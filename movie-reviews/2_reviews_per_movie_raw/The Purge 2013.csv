","DIRECTOR: Good afternoon, sirs! I came in today because I was stoned out of my mind earlier and I thought of the best idea for a movie ever! STUDIO: Alright, we're listening! DIRECTOR: So, like, in the near future, the government will allow 12 hours of crime a year! Like, murder will be legal and stuff! STUDIO: Okay, cool! Why? DIRECTOR:Uh... well... because if people go crazy on one day, then they won't need to do any other crimes the rest of the year! Because all crimes are created by random murderous passions, right? ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: Why don't the rich people just leave the country? That's the worst idea I- STUDIO: That's so original! People will eat that up. And it can double as a shallow social commentary! DIRECTOR: Uh... yeah... social commentary. I know what that is. Anyways, I got Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke to sign on! STUDIO: Fantastic! I bet you have lots of good dialogue to go between them.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: Yeah... good dialogue... I know what that is. Anyways, the dad sells these security systems and the mom is... well... a mom, I guess. She can sulk a lot. And the older female kid can be a ""typical"" sulky teenager who is completely brain dead! She won't see anything suspicious when her much-older boyfriend, who her father disapproves of, sneaks into her house on the night murder is legal and says he's come to see her dad! And the also brain-dead boyfriend can botch his low-awaited parent killing by yelling out the dad's name before shooting! He'll die and then the shocked girlfriend will cry and then wander around the dark house by herself for no reason! ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: Uh, why would the boyfriend think she'd continue to date him after he killed her dad? That's an awful and unnecessary i- STUDIO: Perfect! It'll be tense when she wanders around because we really care about her character! Who else is there?<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: Well, there'll be another son with that awful super-long hair that's popular with horror movie boys nowadays! He'll be reclusive and play with creepy remote control dolls and he'll be the only moral character in the movie while being completely moronic! He will shut down the security system without letting his parents know in order to let a homeless guy in, and then he'll hide him, even though that means his whole family will die. And then, when he sees his sister about to go hide in the same spot, he won't yell out or warn her or anything! And then even later on, he'll hide in the basement and STILL let one of the invaders sneak up behind him, even though he has a gun! STUDIO: He sounds so lovable! What about the other characters? Are they dumb too? DIRECTOR: Oh yeah, super dumb! For example, the dad will have a complete 180 degree moral change halfway through the movie even though he sees the purge first hand, as if he didn't already know about it because he sells security systems for the purge! And then, he won't even untie the guy he's saving so he can help! He's completely retarded. And then there's the wife! Instead of hiding and having the advantage against the invaders, she can get up and wander around so she can be snuck up on! And then she won't shoot the guy who's threatening to kill her daughter because... well... she's stupid! And finally, the lead bad guy will try to kill the main character, but stops and leaves after giving him a flesh wound in the stomach! And then gets snuck up on, too! <br/><br/>STUDIO: That's wonderful! Movie goers are much more likely to cheer for stupid characters than intelligent ones! DIRECTOR: Oh and the invaders will wear masks like ""The Strangers""! STUDIO: Great, that movie was terrifying! ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: No it wasn't, that movie was awf- DIRECTOR: I'll be sure to include the max amounts of clichés, too! Like, a bad guy will be ABOUT to kill a main character, but there'll be a dramatic pause before he does, and seconds before it happens, he'll get killed from behind! STUDIO: Genius! That should happen AT LEAST 4 times.<br/><br/>DIRECTOR: And for the icing on the cake, the invaders will be like cultists and recite prayer-like incantations dedicated to America and the ""new founding fathers"" because that's what would happen in real life, right? STUDIO: Perfect! Let's get this movie made. ONLY SMART GUY IN THE ROOM: **** this, I quit."
"shinwi","1","180","212","23 September 2013"," What went wrong
","I usually don't write reviews but this one was infuriating. I am going to list all of the things that do not make sense in this movie.<br/><br/>1. The kid that lets in the stranger. This kid is unrealistic and does not have his own character. At one point he is so afraid of the purge and shows his knowledge for it so much. It is probably not his first purge either, yet he shows so much ignorance for what is going on, as if he was born yesterday. If I was a kid, and I was afraid of the purge, I would just watch the surveillance camera for 12 hours making sure nobody gets in. Instead, he opens ever door in the house on the most dangerous night of the year to a man who looks like he has nothing else to lose. His decisions were purely moral, but not of a kid in fear. If my father was fighting for my family's lives, the least I can do is sit in the corner and shut up.<br/><br/>2. Now more of the purge itself, it seems unrealistic that so many people would actually participate in this act. OK, lets pretend for a moment here that this purge DOES actually release anger. Do people have so much anger trapped inside that they would risk their own lives just to relieve anger? The only people, I would assume participating in this, would be people who have nothing else to lose and people who have a particular grudge on someone. But lets say you do have a grudge and you happen to kill this one person. You not only risk getting killed yourself, but their family members will come after you on the next purge, putting you and your family members at more risk. This movie pretends that laws and legal regulations are the only things preventing murder on the streets, but people consider reputation and networking as well. <br/><br/>3. The ""bad guys"" in the movie. Particularly the women. This night is the most dangerous night of the year. And you're running around with a knife? I thought you guys were good at this ""purge"" thing. You can afford equipment that can demolish high tech security but you can't afford guns? Why don't you just stay inside? Your chances of living are very slim.<br/><br/>4. So apparently, these bad guys are huge fans of the purge, but they spend most of their night waiting in front of a house just to kill one guy. In that time, they could have killed hundreds. But no. They NEEDED this one guy.<br/><br/>5. Why is murder the only crime being committed? I would assume robbery is the number one crime being committed. I think a huge robbery movie would have been a better theme. Everyone would just steal each others' stuff. It would be like a huge capture the flag game.<br/><br/>If you haven't noticed, this movie made me very angry (especially the kid). Do not watch this movie."
"The_Film_Cricket","Null","158","200","7 June 2013"," Why didn't they just go to Europe for the week? Canada? Australia? Something!
","James DeMonaco's ""The Purge"" operates on a premise that is so stupid that you feel like throwing rotten fruit at the screen, or maybe the director. As you're watching it, you hope that the screenplay will make up for its insipid ideas with a logical explanation, but no, this is one of those movies where all of the players end up running around in the dark shooting and killing one another in the manner of a video game. To our intense surprise, it can't even get that right.<br/><br/>By now, you've heard the premise, which has been spilled out in endless ads running on television. In the year 2022 the United States is now controlled by a series of corporations known as ""The New Founding Fathers of America"", who have devised an annual ritual so idiotic that no one can adequately explain it: Every year, on March 21st all crime is legal between the hours of 7pm and 7am – even murder. No police or medical services will be available. The government's explanation (you'll love this) is that they are trying to keep the population under control. They figure, given one night of violence, the populace will behave themselves for the other 364 days of the year. You could write volumes on the flawed reasoning behind this.<br/><br/>It hardly matters anyway because once that idea is set in place ""The Purge"" turns into an ugly, violent home invasion thriller centered on a nice family, The Sandins, headed by James (Ethan Hawke) and his wife Mary (Lena Headey). They have two kids, teenage daughter Zoe (Adelaide Kane) and young Charlie (Max), who loves surveillance. James has made himself rich by becoming the developer of a home security system that will protect wealthy families from the purge. The Sandins are convinced that they are safe, but having seen the trailer – and countless movies like this – we know this isn't the case.<br/><br/>As the purge begins the family closes themselves inside the house behind thick sheets of metal which cover the windows and doors. A short time later, Charlie sees a homeless man on the surveillance camera wandering the street in front of the house. The man is bleeding and begging for shelter. The kid lets the man in, but soon his pursuers come calling, assuring James that they will get past his security system within the hour. What follows is a plot similar to David Fincher's ""Panic Room."" The difference is that that film used logic and characters to set up a unique cat and mouse game. ""The Purge"" uses creepy-masks, shotguns and bad editing to create phony jack-in-the-box terror. It recycles clichés, like having the family split up into different rooms so one person can emerge later in order to save another person who is about to be killed.<br/><br/>Somewhere in this insufferable mess, a message emerges about social justice and the tyranny of the ""haves"" over the ""have-nots."" It eeks around the edges of the film but conveniently doesn't get in the way of the repeated shots of someone getting blown to bits with a shotgun. This is an ugly, grimy little movie that comes down to a sick scene in which a mother painfully begs for her children's lives while they have guns to their heads.<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is a movie that gives you a lot of time to think. Ask yourself this: Why didn't the Sandin's just leave the country for the week of the purge? These are wealthy people, so why not just lock the house down and take a trip to Europe? Why not Canada? Or Australia, it's supposed to be lovely this time of year.<br/><br/>1/2 (out of four)"
"breckdude","2","305","405","7 June 2013"," Bad From Start to Finish
","I had the unfortunate pleasure of getting to see the movie ""The Purge"" at the 10 O'clock premiere last night. To be honest, going into it, I didn't expect much. I didn't really know a lot about the film aside from seeing a couple trailers here and there and hearing customers blabber on about how excited they were for this movie (I work at a movie theater). I guess the concept sounded kind of interesting, and really, I just felt like seeing a movie I hadn't seen yet. My expectations were blown away; the movie was worse than I had originally assumed. ""The Purge"" pretty much just stinks from beginning to end. However, it does have a few slightly redeeming factors.<br/><br/>Okay, I lied. ""The Purge"" has only one redeeming factor; and it's how hilariously bad the dialog is. As soon as the movie starts and we are introduced to Ethan Hawke driving in his car, talking on the phone. Right off the bat I could tell that the script for this movie was really poorly written. All the lines sound incredibly forced and unrealistic. For example, when Ethan Hawke first arrives home he says something along the lines of ""Hey, hey! what a long day at work!"". All of the characters, especially Ethan Hawke's character, say things one would never say in real life. This is the one good(ish) thing about this movie. How hilariously terrible the dialog is. I was laughing pretty much throughout, at just about every line. Now, to be fair, other things may have influenced my laughter, or intensified it, rather. But overall the dialog is just completely unrealistic. Realism. That is my biggest issue with this movie: it's lack of realism. <br/><br/>Let us begin with perhaps the most painfully unrealistic part of ""The Purge"": the plot. The idea behind this whole futuristic America is that the Economy is down and Crime is up. It is just universally accepted that the cause of all these problems is built up aggression within the human population. In order to correct this, the United States Government decides that it would be a good idea to give the public a day to ""release the aggression"". So, one day of each year, they will have an annual ""Purge"" where all crime is legal (including murder. They put a lot of emphasis on murder being legal). Somehow, magically, this does help the Economy and Crime overall is down for the rest of the year. Because if people get out all that anger in one day, they will not feel the need to commit any more crimes for the rest of the year.. (yeah.. right..) I'm calling bull sh*t on this one. This would never EVER never ever ever work or even be considered in real life. I understand that not all movies need to be realistic to be good, but this movie is kind of trying to go for a realistic feel. It's clearly not supposed to be a Sci Fi film. <br/><br/>Now, not only is the dialog bad in ""The Purge"", but so are the characters. The main characters throughout the movie consistently make stupid decisions and totally change their opinions in the blink of an eye. But the worst characters of them all have got to be ""the bad guys"". I'm gonna call them ""the bad guys"" because there were a lot of them, and I don't remember their names if they were even given. Without spoiling anything (if you still want to see the movie) at one point there is a group of people that approach the house to terrorize Ethan Hawke and his family. This group is heavily armed and set on killing off the filth of society or ""the swine"" as their leader constantly calls them.(He also uses words like ""tootaloo"" and ""folks"") For no particular reason they all wear clown masks, dresses, suits, etc. They jump around, act goofy, scream, laugh and play on swing sets... I think this was all meant to make the movie a bit more creepy and eerie, but it just felt forced and left me cringing throughout. There was nothing to justify why they were acting like circus performers. <br/><br/>The ending was disappointing. There are numerous moral issues brought up throughout the film. None of them are solved. In the end, some people die, some people live, and it's just over. It's almost like James DeMonaco just gave up, and couldn't figure out how to end the movie in a decent way. So he just threw together a little stupid humorous bit at the end. I suppose this is to be expected with James DeMonaco though. Pretty much every project he has ever touched has been bad. <br/><br/>""The Purge"" is not at all worth seeing. It's not scary. It's not suspenseful. It's not realistic. It's not well written. It's not anything. It's just terrible."
"jeffa123","1","52","64","19 March 2014"," premise problems
","my main issue with 'the purge' is the utter unbelievability of the entire premise. all crime is legal for 12 hours? this is supposed to reduce crime the rest of the year by giving people one night per year to vent? if your house were invaded and destroyed by the neighbors; and members of your family were killed in the name of 'the purge' i doubt you would have a very good time at the next culdesac barbecue. you would be enraged. and the next purge, what would you do? go on your own rampage? where does this cycle end? here's what you could do: go rob a bank; or empty the lottery ticket bins at the nearest 7-11. if anyone tries to stop you, shoot 'em. crime is legal after all. go kill all your co-workers. no stupid project to go back to. see where this is going? 12 hours is enough time to devastate society. their only disclaimer in the film is you can't use specific weapons above a certain rating; and you can't go after government officials. it doesn't say anything about your boss. why not wipe out your rival businesses. now you're a monopoly. how about killing off the rival sports team? league champs! there's so many things that would go wrong with 'all crime is legal for 12 hours' that it would NEVER EVER be implemented as an actual law. and this thing was supposed to be in 2022. thats 8 years from now, and that was with it already in place a few times. come on. what you have here is some twisted writers genocide fantasy. how can you reduce poverty and unemployment? kill off the impoverished and unemployed. problem solved. really? this movie sucked in every way. it doesn't make any sense. the boyfriend scene? how does that work? why does the angry mob waste their precious 12 hours trying to go after 1 guy, when they can go wipe out all the 'swine' they want? why not drive up to canada; or Mexico for the night? why even be home that night? NOTHING about this makes any sense."
"dannyobrien247","4","191","260","10 June 2013"," Wasted potential, just a generic home invasion film.
","From the producers of Paranormal Activity (as is all horror films these days) The Purge tells the story of a near future were crime is at an all time low and unemployment stands at under 1% of the US population, to compensate for one night a year all crime (including murder) is legal for 12 hours allowing society some kind of release. <br/><br/>The film revolves around the Sandin family who are confronted by a group of college students hunting a man on the night of the Purge who the family had allowed into their home after lockdown. The Purgers (lead by Rhys Wakefield) drastically try to break into the family's home causing James (Ethan Hawke) and Mary (Lena Headey) to protect their children from the invaders in order to survive the night. <br/><br/>The main problem with the film is the premise itself, whilst interesting is filled with flaws and holes that just make the whole idea ridiculous. Such as what happens to the serial killers and career criminals of this world? Do they just control their urges to kill or steal for the other 364 days until the next Purge, as well what if someone has a heart attack on the night of The Purge? Is it just a case of bad luck you chose the wrong night to need medical care?<br/><br/>Despite the flaws of the premise, the film repeatedly ignores the possibilities of the premise, instead of exploring the ideas behind the Purge or the events that occur on the night of the Purge from different perspectives and situations. Instead the film settles for a typical home invasion story that although done well, is nothing we haven't seen done in many other films. The Purge in the end seems to only be the premise of this film to stop the age old question of ""Why don't they just call the police?"" in home invasion films. <br/><br/>To the films credit it is quite subtle, there's a running theme that the Purge is just an excuse for the upper classes to exterminate the poor, driven by all the attackers wearing prep school blazers and the person they are chasing wearing dog tags around his neck. The film also contains some strong performances, especially from Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Lord of War) and Lena Headey (Dredd, Game of Thrones) who carry the film throughout. The film also has a twist near the end which allows the audience to get inside the heads of the people during this night. <br/><br/>That cant be said for the leader of the Purger's played by Rhys Wakefield (Sanctum, Home and Away)whose performance is slightly cringe worthy, hes trying to be psychotic yet in control of the proceedings but it just comes across as a amateur dramatics' version of The Joker. He just never seems like a really threat and just a creepy next door neighbour. <br/><br/>The film also contains some bizarre and just plain weird set pieces, such as the families' son who builds a spy camera on a chard baby doll on the top of a rhino tank from Warhammer 40,000. The thing looks like a demented contraption from Sid's bedroom in Toy Story. <br/><br/>Overall, The Purge is an OK home invasion film, there are moments of suspense and a couple of jump scares are effective. The wasted potential of the premise is the films main downfall which could have lead to a more effective and possible original film then what we got in the end."
"eonbluedan-1","5","204","281","5 June 2013"," Should have been better
","The idea is intriguing. For twelve hours a year all crime is legal, including murder; do what you want and face no consequence. All emergency services are suspended and with the exception of an unexplained restriction on weaponry, and certain members of the public being out of bounds as targets, there is nothing to stop you doing what you wish. The result is a venting of frustration and anger, a purging of demons, as well as the eradication of the poor and those unable to defend themselves. The end result of this annual purge is extremely low unemployment and crime, and a fantastic economy; ""a nation reborn"", where the weak are prey and the strong survive. One of the strong is James Sandin, who sells security systems to fellow high-flyers; these obviously come in most useful on the night of the purge. Of course on the night in question, things go rather wrong and the Sandin family find their home under siege, following their son Max's generous act of letting a victimised stranger in.<br/><br/>For a second, put aside the rather obvious holes in the idea when considered as a practise encouraged at a national level, even put aside the cynical nature of the movie, and we can see the idea may have started out as a distressing vision of a near future, a terrifying ""other reality"". Indeed, 'The Purge' takes its cue from a lot of previous work that has done similarly; you don't have to look too hard to see various elements of 'A Clockwork Orange', '1984', 'Lord of the Flies' and 'Battle Royale'. The problem is that unlike those works, and unlike 'Straw Dogs', with which it shares more than a little DNA, this story has been watered down to a locked room domestic thriller; a potentially incendiary political fable is devoid of most of that which would have made it so. This is actually typical of writer/director James DeMonaco, who is responsible for the screenplay for the remake of 'Assault on Precinct 13', a film which again extracted a lot of the original's rough edges and tough moments to leave a flat, action driven thriller. Similarly, the scope of the film is rather narrow; with early implication that there will be a study of repressed violence and how the night is used as an excuse, it is then disappointing to see the story steers frustratingly wide of all matters other than murder. The film lacks the gumption to tackle the disturbing elements of our unchecked nature in a way that Cronenberg would have done.<br/><br/>So what we're looking at here is a film which, in different hands may have proved to be a controversial and stirring piece of work, but with DeMonaco scared to grasp the nettle, we end up with a flat, rather tame film, which is given some lift by its better elements, such as the performances and some of the fight sequences. Lacking bite, with a frustrating amount of exposition and not enough dissection of issues, 'The Purge' falls short of what it should have been.<br/><br/>This is not to take away from Ethan Hawke's solid performance, or some of the more effective scenes, but what we would give to have seen this in the hands of Michael Haneke."
"markey28","1","202","289","5 June 2013"," Embarrassingly bad...
","Watched this based on the fact it had an interesting, original idea and good ad campaign...<br/><br/>The reality is that 'The Purge' is one of the worst movies I have ever seen - an original idea is ruined by huge plot holes, annoying, clichéd and unbelievable characters, bad acting and scripting, and an absurdity that goes beyond 'Sci-Fi' or suspending your disbelief...<br/><br/>Rather than being scary, tense or exciting it was just incredibly irritating - watching characters doing the most stupid things throughout that made you repeatedly ask the question ""WTF did they do THAT for?""... The woman sat next to me in the cinema was chuckling to herself throughout and at the end climax everyone in the cinema was laughing at how ridiculous and absurd it had all become - was it actually meant as a thriller or a comedy? It started off promisingly and went downhill very quickly indeed...<br/><br/>As soon as you pick through the plot holes and how dumb the purge killers are for cutting off the power to the Sandin's house when they have just asked them to hand over the homeless guy they are harbouring inside you can no longer take any of it seriously at all... Maybe it's because had they NOT cut the power and the lights in the house there would be no movie left and this ordeal would have ended even more prematurely than the 85 mins I had to suffer... The actions of those involved make no sense and the whole feeling of the movie is that as long as you have money then screw everybody else in society..."
"malaysian1789","6","217","312","1 June 2013"," The Purge, great concept....not so great film
","Humans have a natural instinct as predators to kill, but society forces us to repress these feelings by living in a ''civilized'' way....according to new Ethan Hawke led film The Purge, a very interesting concept of a film, which explores a future society in which all crime is allowed for one night a year...<br/><br/>It's 2022 (not actually that far away), and unemployment in America is 1%, crime is at an all-time low, and generally, everybody seems happy, especially James Sandin (Hawke), a rich citizen who makes his fortune selling security systems for houses to use during the annual Purge. Basically the reason why unemployment and crime is so low is because, for one night a year, a Purge occurs, where all crime (murder, raper robbery, the whole lot) is made legal, and no police or emergency services are allowed to interfere. Mad. But also intriguing. James and his family happily avoid the Purge by using a security system outside their large house while the rest of society kills each other, but all that changes when their youngest son Charlie decides to let a stranger into the house......<br/><br/>This starts off as a really captivating film, the concept of legal crime kept me hooked, but soon enough, it descends into a stereotypical action film where Ethan Hawke fights off gangs from his house with a variety of handguns,and all originality gets lost in a haze of bullets (literally). The short running time (85mins) and variety of twists every 5 minutes makes sure that it doesn't get too boring, so overall a decent watch, but nothing that provokes any thinking afterwards.<br/><br/>6/10- A lesser version of Panic Room"

","Short and Simple Review by WubsTheFadger<br/><br/>First off, this film could have been amazing. The plot and premise are very original and had a lot of potential. But sadly, the story is full of clichés such as stupid teenage kids, bad decisions, and clueless villains. If they had only made the film in a way that we could see multiple Purge stories, it would have been better. The ending is the probably the best part of the story.<br/><br/>The acting is okay at best. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey perform the best. Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane play two of the most annoying, stupid, and idiotic characters I have ever laid eyes on. <br/><br/>The film starts off very slow and continues to have slow pacing until the end.<br/><br/>The blood and gore aspect of the film is very good. This is one of the highest points about the film.<br/><br/>Pros: Very original story, the ending, good acting from Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, and a good use of blood and gore<br/><br/>Cons: Slow pacing, wasted potential with the story, annoying characters, Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane and their terrible performance, and a lot of clichés<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 4.3"
"borengsven","1","137","200","24 July 2013"," Wasted potential
","I saw this movie with basically no expectations, yet I managed to be quite disappointed. With competent actors such as Ethan Hawke and Lena Heady, and a premise that (at least to me) sounded exciting, I don't really know how they managed to ham it up this much.<br/><br/>It's' predictable to the point of being laughable, and the family characters seem cut out of some template on basic movie-making. And the ""villains"" brings little new to the table, copying the home-invasion-psychopaths of Funny Games, The Strangers etc. (2 examples of it being done right, in my opinion).<br/><br/>I think this movie got a free ride on the hype it garnered online, with a sleek campaign and major buzz on Twitter, proving that all a movie really needs to make it is a brief, smart slogan and peoples imagination and anticipation creates the rest.<br/><br/>Too bad for an interesting idea. Can't help to think that maybe another director could've done something memorable with this."

","By the year 2022, America has become so nihilistic that it deems necessary one night of the year where people can commit any crime legally, in order to better benefit the economy.<br/><br/>This provides the framework for ""The Purge"" a horror/thriller/sci- fi/social statement/dystopian movie that is ultimately too unsure of itself. The film tries to juggle themes of unemployment, the 1percenters, out of control youths and the American dream while also juggling the standard conventions of a paint-by-numbers horror in the house movie. All this added baggage turns whatever the film makers were trying to say into incomprehensible background noise, when all they can manage to convey is: ""Boo Jumpscare!"", ""Look at our creepy villains!"" and ""I bet no-one who sees this will be old enough to remember Straw Dogs!"".<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke (who looks really haggard here) plays the father of a family of four, Lena Heady plays the miscast wife and two kids no-one will ever see again after this movie play the kids. I'm not just saying these things to be cruel. I promise you wont ever see Ethan Hawke half-ass it through a movie like you will here, I guess after Training Day he just gave up trying to be good in movies. Lena Heady is a fantastic actress, but she is in totally the wrong role here. Heady dominates the screen playing icy, disdainful strong women roles (Dredd, GoT) but is stuck playing the most bland generic motherly figure possible to write, she takes a mundane role and adds nothing to it. The children were horrible, i don't need to go into them any more. Rhys Wakefield steals the show as the polite leading member of a gang of murderers, a good example of what a creepy face and smile combo can bring.<br/><br/>But what really sinks The Purge is the fact that no character in the movie acts like a real person does, it's all contrived to get the movie going. Characters switch motivations in the blink of an eye, only seeing the danger of the situation when the script suits it. After being told of their impending death unless they surrender a homeless man seeking refuge in their home, the family does almost nothing to keep themselves safe, they obviously don't care enough about their family to save their lives.<br/><br/>The dialogue had me rolling on the floor though, ""surrender the homeless pig"" and ""let us purge their souls for America"" are likely to have audiences howling.<br/><br/>A common scenario in this movie, was to have one of the main characters held at gun point or some other situation of imminent death, only to be saved by some other character off camera. This was fine the first time or second, but after about the eighth it was becoming predictable and laughable.<br/><br/>Plus this movie is short, it barely scrapes 80 minutes. I get the impression they filmed this movie in a week inside some rich white persons home and then slapped the movie together without really having much footage to edit.<br/><br/>The Purge is a bad movie, plain and simple. It's themes aren't though out, the actors aren't trying, the characters behave irrationally, the intense moments are hysterical, the editing is choppy and clumsy, the scenario is unbelievable and poorly staged and its not even long enough to really get mad over because it ends so soon.<br/><br/>It may have had a pretty cool idea for a premise, but the execution sank this sucker. I expected better from Platinum Dunes."

","I was expecting something exciting, given how interesting of a concept this film holds; rather, all I got was an annoying, irritatingly irritating... I'll say it again, irritatingly irritating and unnecessary story that tries to combat morals and fails so dismally you can't even enjoy this infuriating muck.<br/><br/>The Daughter - Zoey (With her persistent schoolgirl outfit): She deserves to be purged. Why? She has this anger towards her father, that we later realize is because her father, James, has forbidden her to be with her boyfriend because he is older. Nowhere in this film are we given the opportunity to care about Zoey or her dumb relationship. Sure, it's not her fault that her boyfriend snuck in, but it is her fault that he (the boyfriend) got introduced into the life of the character we actually cared about, being James.<br/><br/>The Son - Charlie: Oh my goodness! I hated him from the minute he was introduced. Spying on your mother with a creepy doll on a day such as The Purge. That automatically starts him off on a bad footing, then he goes and does what he did. EVERYTHING was his fault, but not once was he even ever blamed. I hate the character so much, I actually don't want to see Max Burkholder in any other movie, otherwise I may just ""release the beast"".<br/><br/>Charlie was NOT a hero in any way, shape or form. He is an idiotic, useless piece of anything coward, that actively endangered the lives of ALL his family members and kept restricting the endangerment of his own... And for what??! This wasn't a moral conundrum. This brainless fool of a kid let his own sister make her way into the very danger he orchestrated. Even turning the homeless man into a hero does not save this half-wit little punk, because ALL that happened, could've been avoided had he just played his part... And if he wanted to be a hero, then, he should've endangered his life, and his life alone.<br/><br/>Then we have the community trying to kill the very family that's providing them with all the security they need to stay alive, because the Sandins made money from it??! What the hell motivation is that??? OK, we kill them, then what happens next year? Will they be exposed, or will somebody else make money off their unprotected behinds???<br/><br/>From there, James Sandin earned the viewers favour, and Mary Sandin did her bit to not be too annoying, and I appreciate that. The cinematography was polished, however, because of how senseless the story is, any attempt at startling and terrifying, fell on its own blade.<br/><br/>2.4/10 for this squandered opportunity and unnecessary mess."

","THE PURGE  I have been waiting to see this movie for quite a while now. I saw the  trailer a while ago and loved the idea. This is a highly anticipated  movie for me.  America is a peaceful country since a new law has been introduced for  one night a year, all crime is legal! The police, ambulance and fire  services are not available for 12 hours. So during that night, as you  can imagine is hell. The whole country has turned into a riot murder,  rape, arson, robbery you name it it is happening and is legal. One  wealthy family lock their house down with really high tech equipment  and everything is fine during the night of purging until the young son  hears someone screaming for help and decides to open the security to  help him now their house is targeted by a large group.  It is a very good thriller and it did not disappoint. There were a few  moments where it was very predictable I saw a few of the moments  coming before they happened but there were also a few surprise  moments. The ending is really good too.  The movie stars Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane  & Edwin Hodge. Everyone did a great job in their roles but the only  problem I have is with Lena. She did a great job in this, but  unfortunately I think she has been typecast as a bad person. I have  seen her in Game of Thrones & Dredd and she plays a mean bitch in both  of them and she plays it well. I just didn't quite believe she was the  housewife victim she was portraying in this movie. But the star of the  movie for me was Rhys Wakefield. He played the leader of the group  outside and he was great. The way he played the character was actually  really polite and nice, but with a very mean streak. I thought it was a  nice touch and he did a brilliant job.  The action is great and there are some nice twists. Seeing as the whole  movie is set in one house, it gives it a sense of entrapment. You don't  get bored either it has a great suspense about it.  Excellently shot and well made. I am so glad that this highly  anticipated movie was not a disappointment for me. I was hoping to see  it in the cinema, but I missed it apparently it was in the cinema for  only a week. It didn't have enough publicity really this film deserved  a lot more publicity as I believe it would have been more popular that  it is.  I will give it 7 out of 10.  ""Incoming reports show this year's Purge has been the most successful  to date, with the most murders committed."""

","I am a movie theatre employee, so I saw this film last night at an employee screening. Going into the movie, I was rather excited. The concept is interesting, and has never been done before. While this movie was not as scary as I had anticipated, I still thoroughly enjoyed it. The antagonists were disturbing, and the movie really shows the struggle between self-preservation and what's right. It is somewhat short, but the makers certainly do get the job done. Plenty of flashlight-and-pistol standoffs and suspenseful scenes make for a movie with an interesting plot, and good acting. The ending was a bit predictable, but did not ruin the movie in my opinion. Not the best that I've seen, but overall a decent flick."
"simsartblog","1","29","42","14 July 2014"," The worst movie ever... EVER... E...V...E...R... !!!
","*Contains Spoilers* but who cares? This was the worst movie ever made and proves how ridiculously moronic Hollywood is these days. The idea is in no way original nor interesting. It has been done several times before, most notably on Star Trek. When I saw the trailer and TV spots for this piece of generic garbage I was sick to my stomach. All I could think about is how some greedy old men in Hollywood thought people would eat up the boring premise of a night of murder. When people I know told me how excited they were to see it and how ""original"" the idea was, I did everything I could to restrain from laughing in their faces. When I make the effort to actually watch a ""hollywood"" movie (i.e. Super hero movies, sequels, franchises, and other unwatchable movies made for simple minded people) I actually go in with an open mind and give it the benefit of the doubt (For instance, I thought The Conjuring looked like crap but it was actually entertaining). Last night I broke down and downloaded a torrent of The Purge (I would never pay for movies like this and if I would have I'd be hunting down the director for a refund). Here's why it's the worst movie ever: 1. The Purge begins with terrible dialogue and is a downward spiral from start to finish. 2. Ethan Hawke is a great actor but lately he's been cast in these same kind of B-movies. 3. The actual idea of the purge is lost somewhere in the continual cliché moments of this amateur film and the explanation of it is terrible. All I had during this movie were questions. Nothing about this movie was even remotely believable. 4. Every character in this movie is a moron and had 0% like-ability. By the end I was cheering for everyone to die. When Ethan Hawke was killed I clapped. 5. The dumb cliché loner son with long ugly hair and a remote control surveillance device (basically Home Alone 3) disarms the security system and lets a homeless guy in because he begs for help. Wouldn't you think a stranger on purge night would say anything to get in? 6. The cliché bratty daughter, who for some reason never changes out of her sexy schoolgirl outfit, wanders around whining while her and her entire family are in serious danger. 7. Even though the family has been through many purges they seem like it's their first time. Quite virginal, isn't it? 8. The cliché ""I'll pause before killing you so someone can sneak up and kill me"" moment happens every 3 minutes. 9. The cliché ""If I kill them I'm no better than the rest of the killers"" moment happens every 2 minutes. 10. The neighbors' motivation for wanting the family dead is: ""They made money by selling us a security system we needed. We are mad they spent that money on a small home addition."" 11. The ""let's all split up but not hide"" cliché is used every 10 seconds. 12. The son hides in the dark while continuing to shine his flashlight to give away his location. 13. WHY DON'T THEY JUST LEAVE THE COUNTRY DURING THE PURGE?? the biggest plot hole ever in the history of movies, television, and radio. 14. This movie is a total 1hr 25min and a lot of that is the opening and ending credits. 15. Seriously, why don't they just leave the country.... ? 16. Security system is mildly defensive and not at all offensive. 17. The masked hipsters split up, skip around, piggy back, and have nothing but knives and axes. 18. Why is this only focused on murder? I would think if the purge was real robbery would be the crime of choice and people would be running to the store to steal electronics, appliances, food, money, cars, etc..... 19. Did no one really ever think of leaving the country....? really? seriously? are you kidding? 20. Just the fact that a sequel is coming... and the plot is: family car breaks down during purge night... let that sink in... yepp... it's an even worse plot than this movie. 21. There is no suspense, no scares, no thrills, very little action, and very little violence. How is this even consider an action/thriller/horror??? 22. The ending is terrible: dad dies from wounds, neighbors want to kill family, homeless man saves family, family spares neighbors' lives, the purge ends, homeless man leaves, credits roll. 23. I just can't any more... this is the worst movie ever. The only good thing that it has done is make me feel superior to the people calling this movie ""art."" bleh.... I'm about to purge my lunch... Go see a real movie: Under The Skin, Beyond The Black Rainbow, Closer, Wait Until Dark, Rope, We Need To Talk About Kevin, The Godfather, Alien, etc..."

","The subject of Man still being just a killer animal deep down is one that has fascinated writers throughout the ages, and increasingly in the modern world, where we in the West have achieved a lifestyle of such mundane safety and freedom from risk that we fall almost into a malaise, a spiritual deadness, requiring a sudden jolt of violence to wake us up.<br/><br/>From ""Dr Moreau"" to ""Lord of the Flies"" to ""Cape Fear"" to ""Straw Dogs"" to ""Death Wish"" to ""Hunger Games"" we've seen this theme fuelling dark and disturbing polemic tales. What better victims of this cruel revelation than the perfect, successful, All-American middle class professional family, their safe little castle prone to sudden violation from the forces of savagery without and within? Add to that then a frightening dystopian future world as a grisly mirror of where we are heading now, in this case why not a law that makes all crime legal in the U.S.A for one night of the year that allows us to purge all the vent up anger and frustration for the rest of the year? OK, that's actually a pretty stupid concept which has a thousand holes in it once you think about, not least of which is that no government and certainly no population would ever consider such a thing, especially in a year or two (this is set in 2023 and ""The Purge"" has been running for years already)<br/><br/>From this clichéd but still quite rich vein you could take the story in a hundred different fascinating directions. You could make a Judge Dredd/Robocop-esque satire on violence in the shiny corporate new world, you could make it the tale of a person who has repressed their anger all their life suddenly bursting it forth and finding they enjoy it, you could show violence and brutality as a social leveller, eliminating all supposed differences of caste, creed and society to show us all as the same animal beneath, you could show someone who refuses to become the monster even when everyone else has, clinging onto that faint wisp of civilization in uncivil times, you could make it a terrifying nihilistic nightmare in which those used to comfortable life find themselves facing uncontrolled brutality within the walls of their safe little home, the layers of their illusory state peeling away before them with more terror than any maniac could bring, you could make unlikable middle class bourgeoisie reveal their true natures over the dinner table in a Bunel- esque carnival of satire, you could comment on the wide-scale acceptance of violence in the media and how saturated we are with almost pornographic brutality while at the same time pretending that it does not really exist.<br/><br/>Or you could make ""The Purge""<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is one of the limpest films ever, which fails miserably as a social satire, a dystopian future nightmare and a blood chilling Horror movie. It is almost like drawing a straight line with a pencil, it starts, it carries on the same, then ends with no fluctuation, variety or development. The characters are literally place-holder cut-outs -the professional family man, his good mother wife, his rebellious teenage daughter and geeky teen younger son, the edgy boyfriend the father doesn't approve of, the noble saintly black man, the evil rich yahoo types, the snobby neighbours – who never evolve outside their 1 dimensional moulds. There are no shocks, no surprises, no twists you think might be coming, no grand lesson, no epiphany. Here everything IS simply black and white with absolutely no troubling shades of grey to worry your little heads about.<br/><br/>The nice middle class professional family (who would already be married and having kids NOW) blindly accept what the Government tells them without a thought (You can murder rape and steal from who you like for a whole day? Hey, I'm fine with that..) and get rich from selling home security, which of course makes them partly evil because making money IS evil (unless of course you work in Hollywood, in which case it is perfectly OK) After a clichéd family dinner rift on Purge night, the geek son decides to take in an escaped slave pursued by lynch happy cackling plantation owners.(COUGH!!) Sorry, I mean a poor helpless black homeless man being pursued by lynch happy masked rich white kids (See, rich = EVIL, unless you work in Hollywood of course in which case rich = GOOD) The family find themselves being menaced by said bunch of Evil Rich White Kids, who wear stupid joker smile masks of themselves and rattle off ""we are the decent people, it is our task to eliminate the poor scum from the face of the Earth and leave it for the good rich white folk"" speeches written by some Liberal Hollywood type who imagines that's how anybody outside his comfy little circle must think. Despite being built up as the ultimate in terror, these ""blood bloods"" are the least menacing or effective opponents since the Demons in ""Ghost Rider"" and the ease with which they are dispatched is almost insulting.<br/><br/>What have we learned as the long dark night is over? That Rich people are evil (especially white ones, unless they work in Hollywood) that all black people are saintly and good, that ""New Founding Fathers"" are also evil and probably Tea Partiers, that gun control is a must even though most of the killing done has been with knives and machetes, and that ambition for a family is itself dangerous.<br/><br/>This film is as likely to insult Liberals as it is anyone else with its brazen stupidity and waste of a potentially interesting subject.<br/><br/>And it's not scary or exciting either, but it could be a good cure for Insomnia if someone wants to patent it!"

","In 2022, the United States of America celebrates once a year ""The Purge"", a 12-hour period when any crime is allowed including murder. The result is a economical growth and society free of homeless, sick and unproductive persons. <br/><br/>James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is a successful salesman that sells security systems for the houses. He lives with his wife Mary (Lena Headey) and his teenage son Charlie (Max Burkholder) and daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) in a fancy house in the suburb. During the purge, James seals his house and plans to watch a movie with his family. However, Charlie sees a stranger (Edwin Hodge) fleeing from a group that is hunting him down and he disarms the security device and lets the man in. But the leader (Rhys Wakefield) of the group gives an ultimatum to James: if he does not deliver the man to the group, they would kill the whole family. Now James has to find where the man is hidden and decide his fate.<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is a stupid movie with an absurd storyline that may be reasonable for American people that lives in a country frequently in war and with a powerful armament industry and armed citizens. But it is hard to swallow the explanation of the purge in most of the countries since the story is totally unbelievable. How could a society live without regret and rage on the day after of such savagery? Jealousy would become grieve, hatred, need of revenge on the next day no matter the laws. In addition, in a society living this way, the moron Charlie could never have the codes of the security system. In the end, this movie is a senseless garbage.

"thewillt08","3","149","277","7 June 2013"," Way to Blow a Great Opportunity
","Once a year laws do not exist. Once a year you can do anything you want for twelve hours and not get in trouble. This is called The Purge and it is designed to let humans let out their frustration on the world. This apparently keeps society healthy, the economy up, and crime down. I'm here to tell you that The Purge is a waste of time. A Waste of money and should not be viewed by anyone with half a mind. <br/><br/>I don't even know where to start with this mess. Let's start with the idea of the purge. In 2022 the idea is that if we let people go crazy for 12 hours they will be calm for 364.5 days. The logic and science behind this is beyond far-fetched and it is really laughable. The fact that anybody believes this works is out of their mind. Think about this. Somebody pitched this idea to a group of people and those people said, ""yeah I believe that, we could make millions."" Well I'm here to say shame on you people and how dare you try and convince audiences across the country of this crazy premise. To make it even worse scientists and other people try to say the purge is an excuse to kill the homeless and people who cannot defend themselves. It is an excuse to get rid of the weak and allow the strong to survive. I don't like the idea that this movie supported the idea of killing weak and poor people is OK. The first half of the movie really focuses on these crazy people trying to find this one particular homeless person. It allows them to cleanse society and themselves. It makes zero sense and this movie had potential and it was wasted on this piece of garbage.<br/><br/>The story is basic. There is a family with a lot of money and they sell security systems for the purge. Their house is huge and I will say I would love to live there. So the purge is going on and their youngest son sees a man in the streets calling for help and of course he lets him in. Shortly after a radical group of lunatics come knocking at the door looking for him and if they don't get him in a certain amount of time then they will come in and get him. While they waste time at the house they could have been running wild and cleansing the world of more poor people. Instead they waste time on this one person.<br/><br/>These people are completely out of their mind and it is impossible to believe they are normal for 99.9% of the year. There is no possible reason why they go nuts for 12 hours and go on a murdering rampage. I'm not sure if they are supposed to be funny or scary either. While they are outside they are dancing and prancing around being stupid with their stupid masks. One is on the others back running around. The masks are on and they pretend to make out with one another and it was really failed comedy or an even bigger failed scare. I just sat in my chair and laughed throughout the entire movie. I don't know if its horror movies or me but I find them really funny. I laughed more during this movie then I did during The Hangover 3.<br/><br/>I will be honest, I did hate this movie but I don't regret seeing it because I did have a good time and enjoy myself. I sat in a full theater and listened to the crowd tear apart the movie. People hated the daughter's boyfriend and the son's stupidity and the craziness that was happening. Every time somebody died the crowd burst into cheers and applause so that was awesome. I liked ripping the movie apart in the theater. There was a scene where there is a giant glass bowl filled with dominos and for some reason I thought it was the funniest thing. <br/><br/>Other than the crowd I was entertained through this disaster of a movie. The action scenes where bodies were flying and people were dying were cool to see and what the movie should have been about. The selling point of the movie was 12 hours of lawless mayhem. I wanted to see chaos and the world go to hell. Instead I got a stupid story about a family I didn't really care about being tormented by people out of their mind. This movie tried to touch on human nature and how they change in the heat of the moment and how they do things they won't normally do. It doesn't work. The movie gives the wrong message and the wrong counter argument to the message. <br/><br/>Overall The Purge is a mess. The lame jump scares I saw coming thirty seconds before they happened were not scary. The lunatics were not scary or believable and reminded me of a silly version of The Strangers. That movie was scary and the stuff they did made me scared. The stuff these guys did made me laugh. I wanted something 100% different from this movie and I got boring characters, a terrible story, and a disappointment. This movie fails at almost everything it attempted. It doesn't get a recommendation, it doesn't even get and A for Effort. I haven't don't this in a while but The Purge gets The WillyT Seal of DISapproval. Don't waste your time. Take my advice, save your money, save your time, save the gas in your car. If you really have to see it, wait a few months and get it off the internet for free. You're welcome."
"lo_ongg","1","119","222","21 June 2013"," Literally, this movie made me purge
","So, from where shall I begin? When I saw, for the first time, the trailer, I had big expectations from this movie. The idea seemed to be original, the trailer looked good, 2 great actors were in there. what more could you ask for? But, apparently, even after I saw its rating on IMDb and most of the critics categorized this movie as one of the worst ones in this year, I still had a little hope that they might be wrong and I'll enjoy this flick Nope, that wasn't true at all. After first 30 minutes, with a slow pacing acting and flawed situations,with unbelievable plot holes, I just gave up. I was convinced that this movie is one of the biggest failures of this year, standing next to After Earth. The acting, which is one of the main things in a movie, was so unconvincing and stupid, with pretty much lame dialogs.. oh god, I can't even talk about it. Plus, the situations the characters were involved into, were so illogically dumb and mediocre, which would make you feel like throwing up. And, of course, the ""purgers"". HAHA. nothing scary, nothing creepy, just some bunch of kids wearing masks, acting like they just got out of circus and making all those goofy jumps. C'mon, let's be serious. Even a 5 y/o kid wouldn't consider this movie, in any way, creepy, whether, scary. To conclude this, The Purge sucks BIG A**"
"ironhorse_iv","5","9","12","22 June 2013"," This movie will make you purge. By purge, I meant more like hurl vomit.
","Don't get me wrong, it's not a boring film or not that bad of a film. It was pretty entertaining, but it's nothing new. It was a disappointment. It had an awesome interesting plot that could have been more awesome if they were to take it to a better story than this dumb 'home invasion' movie. A cool concept was really wasted, and became a typical home invasion flick. I just wish they had a back story to the film. The film did little to no explaining how this world became this way. Honestly how does crime and unemployment rates hit an all-time low when the government instituted an annual 12-hour time period called ""The Purge"", during which people can vent their negative emotions because all crime is legal and emergency services are suspended. How does killing people stop poverty? Cause they kill homeless people. If unemployment is 1%. How can there be homeless people? Why spend hours trying to kill some homeless people, when you can rob a bank? How do people get envy of the other people wealth, if unemployment is 1 %.? The movie would make more sense if they explain it more like saying it was more population controls reasons. The movie doesn't explain how the country went from bankruptcy to prosperity through violence through Social Darwinism. Even if the Purge did exist, are we to believe that nobody would commit a crime after it. Most people that commit crime, does it because it's not legal. If it was legal, than it's not a crime. In no way, is crime going to stop, because one day out of the year, it's legal. There always going to be rule-breakers. It's like saying, people can only smoke marijuana on April 20. Is that really going to stop people from smoking any other day? No. When most people kill another person, most of the time is on it because it's a crime of passion, where the person can't control sudden strong impulse such as rage, and attack people. In no way, can these people just wait and wait for one day just to arrive to get rid of somebody. Society would cave in plus vendettas would carry over, if someone killed someone you loved or tried to kill you of course you would want revenge and might not be willing to wait a year for it. Most people that commit crime, are not thinking of the consequences of it. Anyways, Directed by James DeMoncano, the movie starts in the year 2022, where the Sandlin family held hostage for harboring the target of a murderous group during the Purge. While the acting is alright. I have say Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are great in their parent roles. The children are some of the most annoying, and unbelievable characters ever. The movie is full of stupidity people trying to hide in the dark with a flashlight on. In one scene, the daughter is held at gunpoint, thrown against a wall and knocked out, wakes up and is mad at her dad for tying up the dude that did that to her. Plus, the son is still sticking up for the guy after he does that. While the characters do make pretty stupid decisions, I always make the argument that in a moment of terror anyone is prone to not making the correct decision, but this was just pure stupidity. The people that want to murder them, are not scary, but more comedian type. Let's us purge guy was just hilarious to watch. I think it would have much better ending involving the Sandin boy. Too bad the government is exempt during it. If the left-wing and right-wing extremists all stabbed each other to death with machetes once a year, maybe we'd get less scumbag politicians on both sides. At less, they explain that plothole. In my opinion, the story isn't that original. There was a 1967 episode of Star Trek call 'Return of the Archons' with a similar plot, in which an otherwise placid society is allowed pre-scheduled 12-hour periods of lawlessness and violence. Rather than a normal home invasion, this movie could have been pretty good like 2000's Battle Royale. A ""state of life"" film instead of a thriller. Instead of making it about 1 Purge, it should be like a film that takes place over a long period of time. It starts with the pre-conditions that lead to it, and then the purge comes out and we see how life gradually improves except for that 1 day a year. Instead of treating the purge as something disturbing, treat it as something normal. That way, the viewer is more disturbed by it, just as 1971's A Clockwork Orange shows violence in a very nonchalant light. We see how successful the purges initially are, and then learn the moral of the story by the end when the purge isn't working anymore when society bring down to years of years of violence abuse. That would have work, but this movie didn't. Some critics think the movie plot is, an attack on the Republicans and Tea Party ideas. Leave the poor on their own and eventually enough of them will die off, thus eliminating most of the country's troubles? Republicans tend to be tougher on crime than liberals, so I doubt the majority of Republicans would support purge. After all most Republicans support things like the death penalty and tougher laws on child molesters. So no, I don't think so. I think it's just a dystopia idea. The plot/concept is absolutely brilliant, they should have more with it. This is another movie that did not reach its full potential. It's worth a look, but probably not in the theater. Just rent it on video or something. That being said, overall it is good idea, poor execution"

","It's just beyond ridiculous. I won't mention anything about the horrible dialog och plot holes as others have done that already.

As if thatäs even remotely possible. <br/><br/>SPOILER BELOW (doesn't matter though, you shouldn't watch the movie)<br/><br/>They want us to believe that these well-behaved upper-class neighbours would gang together, enter the house of the heroes for the purpose of KILLING the entire family including their CHILDREN. Why? Hold on to your hats... Because hero dad had made so much money selling security systems to the neighbours! So they're jealous.<br/><br/>That will happen. In nine years.<br/><br/>Also these upper-class neighbours keep saying things like ""Thank you for your sacrifice! Thank you for keeping this country safe!"" (as in, when the family is dead there will be no need for violence on any of the other days).<br/><br/>The logic makes no sense what so ever. Oh god it's so sucky. Why did I watch this????"

","This movie was just plain aggravating. I could have spent my money better elsewhere or another movie. I was extremely excited to see this movie, the beginning was cool but for the son to open the alarm system and let the injured guy inside was a false move there, the son never gets chastised for it either. The person whom they let in should have at least waited there and not just ran off. Knowing that they will most likely take the fall for HIS actions he should have stayed there. The boyfriend came out of nowhere and shouldn't have been in there. For the boyfriend to think solving the relationship problem was to shoot the father was PSYCHO. The mother wouldn't step up to the base to hurt anyone until the end of the movie. The neighbors made no sense and the movie itself was horrible.

","America—the near future: the annual 'Purge'—a 12-hour period where all crime is legalised—turns into a nightmare for a wealthy family who had hoped to spend the time in the safety of their heavily fortified home.<br/><br/>The Purge has been the victim of a lot of negativity, but I found it to be a well-executed thriller with a satirical edge that deliberately adopts a far-fetched premise in order to take a pop at the USA's culture of violence, its undercurrent of racism and a legal system that favours the rich.<br/><br/>I imagine that much of the hate comes from Americans who simply don't like the messages the film so effectively illustrates—an understandable reaction, perhaps, but sometimes its good to take a long hard look in the mirror, and if you don't like what you see, do something to make a change.<br/><br/>On a more shallow note, the action was suitably hard-hitting, with the snooker room fight being particularly bad-ass, and both Lena Headey and Zoey Sandin are total babes."

","Saw 'The Purge' due to being really intrigued by the concept, having seen home invasions being handled well on visual media and finding Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey dependable actors. Saw it without seeing reviews beforehand in order to see it with an open mind, as is always my intention.<br/><br/>Count me in as another person who found 'The Purge' poorly executed in almost every way. Can completely understand the mildly mixed to very negative reception and find the criticisms very similar to mine, just for the record what will be covered in this review is my personal opinion and nobody else's with the flaws being so obvious you don't need someone else's opinion to base yours on. The concept was handled in such a dumb and dull way, to near intelligence-insulting degrees, and 'The Purge' is in no way a good example of how to do a film about a home invasion.<br/><br/>There are a few strengths. 'The Purge' doesn't look too bad, it has a gritty and slick look that doesn't look cheap and there is a little atmosphere.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey and Rhys Wakefield give reasonable performances which is better than what their characters deserved.<br/><br/>However, nothing else worked. The rest of the acting is weak, with the two young actors Adelaide Kane and especially Max Burkholder being terribly irritating as characters that are impossible to get behind in a film full of shallow and unrelatable characters that behave so stupidly and illogically. <br/><br/>No tension or suspense at any point and nothing scary or thought-provoking, got nothing enlightening about the social allegory aspect. The pace dragged badly, which undermined the suspense, likewise with the excessive predictability and clichés that were tired well before the film was made. The scary aspect is cheap and never surprising, creative or scary, the violence being gratuitous, the situations so ridiculously dumb that it insults the audience and the villains are goofy and flat caricatures, nothing menacing about them. The direction is generally indifferent.<br/><br/>In summary, lame and not recommended if not without redeeming merits, namely the leads. 3/10 Bethany Cox"

","Why did people make this a box office hit? To be perfectly honest with you, I wasn't looking forward to this one. It seemed like a variation of The Strangers to me, and I was also reading a lot of poor reviews. I finally gave it a go, and it's what I expected. The potential is certainly there. If done right, home invasion story lines always manage to get to me, simply because your home is where you are supposed to be the most secure. The thought of psychopathic people invading your home is terrifying. I also liked the idea of allowing a purge (including murder) for a 12 hour period. It could have been lethal and memorable, but the execution is extremely flat, and I was bored silly. They did a decent job in The Strangers, but they really missed the boat with this one. I felt it lacked the proper suspense to really be effective, and there is nobody to root for. Ethan Hawke's character is almost as bad as the people invading his home. I understand wanting to save your family, but throwing a homeless man to the wolves? His character improves in the second half, but it was too little too, too late for me. I had trouble connecting to any of the Sandin family members. Ethan Hawke came across as a little too abrasive and blasé for me. It's not that he performed badly, but his character put a bad taste in my mouth. Lena Headey comes across as a bit better as the wife. I felt more sympathy for her. There isn't much gore to speak of, but we do get some nasty moments. We get some harsh gunshot wounds, and a really nasty broken nose, which made me cringe a bit. The ending was also underwhelming. A sequel has apparently been green-lit. Let's just say I don't approve of that, and I really hope they change their mind on it.

","The Purge (2013)<br/><br/>Well, this is either the stupidist movie ever or it's a mishmash of something audacious and creative and a slasher film with campy expectations. It doesn't make the grade as a great movie mostly because of an hour of redundant ax-wielding around a big suburban house. But the first half hour is really great—some potential here that went aground fast.<br/><br/>The premise is clear right away: it's the near future, maybe 2021, in the United States. Once a year for twelve hours everyone is allowed to be an ultra criminal without repercussion. None. Kind of like Devil's Night in Detroit without any cops. You can murder, destroy things, be a general naughty boy or girl, and have no criminal consequences the next day. Hurray!<br/><br/>Everything is just okay! Or not.<br/><br/>Well, the reason this works in the first half hour is the calm, steady, well appointed believablility of the acting and scenario in this fancy (upscale American) house. Ethan Hawke plays a great regular, successful, nice Dad. His wife (Lena Headey) is a sweetheart in the clichéd way (she is sadly the typical Hollywood female, incompetent but nice to have around). They have two children in the standard mode, talented and slightly disaffected.<br/><br/>So 7pm rolls around and the family has a fortress of a house (steel doors drop down in front of the windows and doors). So they watch on their monitors the calm and then the lack of calm on the nice street outside, at night. And things go sour badly.<br/><br/>Okay, so a great set up. Of course, if you think about it, it's about as believable as zombies. And so therefore you can go with it if you decide to. So the public can expunge their violence by killing a few people and the other 364 days are crime free. Great. Except, well, uh, really?? Yeah, it implies that we would kill without compunction, and that the next day you would walk by your neighbor, who just killed a few people during the Purge, and say, ""Good morning Mrs. Johnson,"" as if all was fine. And there is no guilt. Or feeling. Or morality. <br/><br/>But that's if you think about it. A lot of Hollywood's idea of the future is not meant to be parsed out and logical. Look at ""The Giver,"" or even (yes) ""Avatar."" Etc.<br/><br/>So on a simpler level we have the problem of a movie that turns into a slasher film. Because the bad people do, of course, get into the house (you saw that coming) and the family tries to defend itself. This part of the movie is not especially well made, or well acted, or original. It destroys all potential, and makes it a disturbing bore."
"Suicide_Saint","7","21","37","12 June 2013"," Bloodlust in America
","It is no secret that humans are prone to violence. ""The Purge"" takes place in the United States, a country founded upon violence through the Revolution, savage dealings with Native Americans and Africans, and incessant involvement in wars throughout the world. Though the film itself remains relatively simple, it does touch upon not only humankind's thirst for blood, but on additional societal issues such as socioeconomic status, crime, and governmental control.<br/><br/>The film focuses upon the traditional cinematic nuclear family: a father who has just earned the spot as top salesman at his place of employment, a mother home cooking for her family while drinking wine, the teenage daughter messing around with her boyfriend (of whom dad does not approve), and the unusual younger sibling, a son playing with his remote controlled vehicle with a camera hidden inside of a half-melted doll. Okay, so the introduction to the son is a little strange, but the impression of that of a typical family unit.<br/><br/>The new founding fathers of America (in the year 2022) have created an event known as ""The Purge"" which has, according to the film, saved the country. During the purge, all crime is legal for a period of 12 hours. This allows mankind to ""purge"" the hatred, anger, and violence from their souls and contain these natural instincts to this 12 hour period alone. The reports indicate that, thanks to the purge, unemployment and crime now stand at record lows in the United States. However, the film suggests that this is because many Americans ""Purge"" by killing those too poor to afford the security systems sold by the aforementioned father played by Ethan Hawke. As we discover, these security systems, much like those available now, are simply a false sense of security and can be penetrated if the assailants so desire.<br/><br/>Compared to other films currently in theaters, ""The Purge"" presents a fairly original plot. Humans are inherently violent and man killing man happens every day. Therefore, why not attempt to regulate and contain this violence? Ultimately, however, the film falls into predictable patterns of main characters separating and aimlessly wandering in the dark with violent intruders abound. Furthermore, these intruders are reminiscent of those in the film ""The Strangers"" though not nearly as frightening. Also, with all crime legal for 12 hours, the only crime displayed by the film is that of murder, often via the use of firearms. One would think that robbery, rape, drug trafficking, and a myriad of other illegal activities would garner as much interest and attention as violence. Regardless of some predictability, simplicity, and familiarity, The Purge was still more entertaining the majority of the mindless special effects-laden nonsense churned out by Hollywood's backside. Are you ready for The Purge? See the film and enjoy the discussions that ensue."

"ryh-fong","2","8","12","6 October 2013"," Nothing makes sense here
","The Purge could be the worst movie this year -- in short, the director/screenwriter came up with an idiotic premise, dumbed down every single character, gave them bland and uninteresting dialog and explored some half-baked superficial social commentary/issues sporadically. There wasn't enough suspense to be a thriller/action and not enough blood to be horror. And when we sat through the misery to reach the end, it almost felt like the director didn't know how to end the mess he started. But by then, it didn't matter because nothing seemed to have made sense along the way, and when the story's characters don't make sense, I already stopped caring about them. <br/><br/>Even if I don't question the ridiculousness of the basic premise (that if we give everyone 12 hours to ""purge"", the rest of the year will be fantastic with low crimes and people live happily ever after), I couldn't deal with the rest of the plot. First, let's start with the son: he disarms the security and lets a total stranger into the house; gets confused about which side he's on by helping the stranger (and indirectly leading or letting his equally idiotic--we'll get there in a moment--sister be held hostage by that stranger); while hiding in the basement and knowing the bad guys are inside, wave his flashlight to give away his position and doesn't fire his gun at the bad guy when he's spotted. Mom and dad somehow never have had a conversation with their son about not to disarm the house or let strangers in, keep on losing their kids around the house (ironic for a guy who sells security/alarm systems); act indecisively about what to do when the stranger enters their home; have a sudden change of morality half way through the film; when the bad guys entered, instead of using their familiarity with the house as an advantage, they decide to leave the kids alone and split up; and why did the mom let the neighbors leave at the end (so they can try again next year?). The daughter just witnessed her bf shoot his dad and yet all she immediately cares about is that her bf is wounded and dying (again whose side are you on?)-- and when sh!t hits the fan, she runs away alone and ultimately finds the dumbest place to hide (if the bad guys would make sense at all, they would've found her under her bed right away). For the bad guys, why shut off the power if you want the parents to give up the stranger in the first place (it's harder to get him out if we can't even see him in the dark)? Why didn't they destroy the cameras outside first? Why didn't they team up to sweep the house once they made it inside (again, entering into a hostile unfamiliar place by splitting up??)? Why did the main bad guy not actually kill the dad when he had the chance? I guess if the director didn't take it so seriously, this could have been a comedy or spoof."

","The Purge definitely has an interesting, and a very relevant to our times, premise. I would even go so far as to say that this film could have been among the best horror films ever made, that is if it were executed with more believability/creativity. The suspension of disbelief here is just too weak for the film to be anything more than a fairly mediocre horror film, and that's definitely disappointing given the interesting and somewhat unique premise. In my view the first 30 or so minutes of the film are quite good. The suspense builds up decently, the characters seem somewhat interesting, the premise has unique possibilities, but then we just end up getting overwhelmed with too many familiar/lazy plot devices to remain held in the grips of the film. The young son in the film becomes basically the goat of stupidity behind practically all of the problems that the main characters have to deal with, and it ends up feeling like a cheap way out. It ends up mostly being a very standard and overdone Hollywood film, because it lacks enough intelligence to deliver truly engaging turning points and an overall solid story. The film had promise, but definitely lacks the creativity to make it a standout.<br/><br/>In my view the film is no better than a 6 out of 10, at the very most. Perhaps a 5 would even be more fitting. However one aspect of the film makes me give it the extra rating of a 6. This is definitely the most interesting part of the film and something to think about. There is no doubt, a somewhat hidden message does straddle this film...<br/><br/>The film basically tells a story about how America has become a more productive and peaceful country since introducing the purge to society. A period of 12 hours a year in which murder, and basically any other crime(Certain weapons are still forbidden) is entirely legal. The film lightly paints us a portrait of how this time of purge is basically to the main benefit of the wealthy. They are the only people who can really afford to defend themselves or hide very well during the dangerous time of the purge.<br/><br/>The main story of events in the film revolves around some very privileged and snobby college types who are out to kill the worthless 'swine' of the country who are of course the homeless and downtrodden of society, the weak and worthless if you will, who supposedly drag the country down. The main person we see them after is a homeless man who is clearly dressed in an army green jacket and has dog tags around his neck. At the end of the film, there is a news report about how many people have gathered at a candle light vigil to pay tribute to those whose lives were sacrificed during the purge, in order to help make the country a safer place. I think you can do the math yourself. It is quite apparent that the hidden message is that the elite, with their noses firmly stuck in the air are too self absorbed to care about common folk, they feel they are above others and that they have the right to use the commoners and especially the poor. With the homeless war vet, it is very obvious that the film draws a parallel between the films world of the purge, and our real world in which the elite are continuously using the poor people and common folk as their dogs of war so to speak. Make of it what you will, but clearly their is an attempt to draw a parallel between how America's elite think very little of, and have no regard when it comes to using the less fortunate of society.<br/><br/>While this is far from a masterpiece, I do recommend one viewing to those who are interested, reasonably intelligent, and fans of the horror genre. It could have been a lot better, however it also could have been far far worse. It has its moments.<br/><br/>6/10"

During The Purge, you can, literally, get away with murder and, yet, some people still like to wear masks. Oh, and play on tree swings. All for dramatic effect, I suppose.<br/><br/>19. Never thank a family that saved your life. Simply stand, be quiet and at the most opportune time, hide by use of a half-melted, red-eyed devil baby on wheels.<br/><br/>20. The greatest advancement of technology in the next decade isn't cars, tablets, security or weapons. It's glowing sunglasses.<br/><br/>21. Also, speaking of the future, ""equipment"" to break into people's secured houses is so highly developed, they have a name for it that we already use today: a truck.<br/><br/>22. And I don't think Burning Down the House by the Talking Heads is ever played in the future because, well, why not give your victims some of your precious, few hours bypassing the easiest way in and waiting for said truck? <br/><br/>23. When barely anything has happened yet, multiple facial close-ups with people who look like they're sucking on golf balls has to be a universal sign of fright, apparently.<br/><br/>24. Does homeowner's insurance apply to The Purge hours? <br/><br/>25. I'm not sure wasting 12 of the 8,760 yearly hours, doing whatever the hell you want to do, on one house and for one victim, is the best use of your time.<br/><br/>26.

A huge arsenal of weapons should be clearly ignored – for the rest of the movie – when multiples of people are bent on killing your family and it's much easier to carry just a handgun. You know, just as a ""precaution."" <br/><br/>28. While it's grand that Hollywood broke from yet another tired ""Ghost-Story-Paranormal-House-Found-Footage-Supposedly-True-Film"" clichéd movie, I would've been happier if they had actually hired a writer with an original thought.

"zardoz-13","8","21","40","9 June 2013"," A Wicked, High-Concept Satire About A Futuristic America
","Writer & director James DeMonaco's home invasion thriller ""The Purge"" qualifies as both suspenseful and thought-provoking political allegory. The year is 2022, and America revels in a state of idyllic, economic prosperity. Crime rates as well as unemployment have plunged drastically under the inspired political leadership of the New Founding Fathers. Literally, America has been ""reborn."" The reason behind our national recovery is the institution of an event christened 'The Purge.' Citizens may embark on crime sprees during one 12-hour period annually without fear of prosecution. All emergency services, including police, firefighters, and physicians, are suspended. Indeed, anybody can murder with impunity. During the opening credits, we're shown ersatz surveillance system videos of people committing blue-collar crimes during the purge. The hypothetical nature of DeMonaco's narrative comes with some vague rules. We learn from the prologue that no harm must befall high-ranking government officials and citizens cannot wield weapons above a 'Class 4' level. The crazies that lay siege to our hero's house are packing either shotguns, assault weapons, or good, old-fashioned axes. DeMonaco provides scant details behind the ideology of the New Founding Fathers. People like to cleanse themselves on 'Purge' of their negative emotions and they praise their victims for sacrificing their lives for their country. Furthermore, he keeps the scope of his premise confined to one high-income, gated community covered with security systems. Clocking in at a nimble 85-minutes, ""The Purge"" suffers more from its enigmatic origins than from plausibility. DeMonaco references the New Founding Fathers, but we don't learn much about them. You may see some things coming, but this evocative melodrama has enough surprises to keep you guessing. ""The Purge"" carries an R-rating so the squeamish should beware, and adults with impressionable children should shun this violent, bloody thriller.<br/><br/>James Sandin (Ethan Hawke of ""Training Day"") sells security systems, and he has attained the pinnacle of success at his company with his chartbuster sales. Undoubtedly, the annual Purges have contributed in some small measure to his good fortune. He resides in an upscale community with his wife Mary (Lena Headey of ""Game of Thrones"") and their two children, 14-year old Charlie (Max Burkholder of ""Daddy Day Care"") and 16-year old Zoey (Adelaide Kane of ""Donner Pass""), and they live in reasonable harmony. If anybody can shatter the tranquility of the Sandin house, Zoey's 18-year old boyfriend, Henry (Tony Oller of ""Beneath the Darkness""), who doesn't stand a ghost of a chance negotiating with her dad, is the best candidate. As the action unfolds, ubiquitous loudspeakers repeatedly warn citizens that the next 'Purge' is scheduled to commence at 7 PM and then elapse 12 hours later. DeMonaco makes certain that we know what the Purge is, even if we don't know the gritty details behind it. Meanwhile, Henry wants to win James over to his side. Henry plans to let events trap him inside the Sandin household for the next 12 hours. While he is holed up with the Sandins, Henry hopes to convert Zoey's father to his camp. Initially, nobody but Zoey is aware of Henry's presence. During the pre-Purge period, James and Mary deal with some of their neighbors who are preparing for an active evening of bloodletting. DeMonaco does a good job of foreshadowing their part in the action. <br/><br/>Meantime, James isn't too concerned with all the mayhem that will ensue at seven. He locks down his house with his state-of-the-art security system that makes the dwelling well-nigh impregnable. Ordinary burglars wouldn't be able to breach this system. Moreover, the system is equipped with surveillance cameras that enable the Sandins to monitor everything occurring around them. They celebrate the occasion with a dinner, but Zoey isn't acting civil during this preamble. Charlie is a bit of a home security whiz himself; he has built the equivalent of ""Demonic Toys"" doll that cruises around in a small, four-wheeled, remote-control contraption. Not long after lockdown, Charlie spots a homeless African-American (Edwin Hodge of ""Red Dawn"") in fatigues wandering through the neighborhood. We aren't told how he got into the gated community. This stranger pleads desperately for mercy because he is the object of a manhunt. James' considerate son decides to forfeit everybody's safety and disarms the security system so the stranger can enjoy sanctuary. Of course, something has to shatter the calm in the Sandin household or ""The Purge"" wouldn't land the Sandins in the dire straits that follow. Before the night is over, nothing promises to be the same for the Sandins. Not long after they let the African-American into their home, a collection of male and female killers dressed in gaudy costumes with hatchets and high-powered rifles show up on their doorstep. Guess who they want and what they will do to get him?<br/><br/>The performances are strong. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey make a convincing couple, while Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane are just as persuasive as their kids. The assailants who surround the Sandin residence are a creepy-looking bunch with their masks and costumes. ""The Purge"" is cut from the same cloth as movies like ""The Hunger Games,"" ""Panic Room,"" ""Straw Dogs,"" ""A Clockwork Orange,"" ""The Strangers,"" ""Lakeview Terrace,"" and ""Assault on Precinct 13."" Incidentally, not only did Ethan Hawke star in the remake of ""Assault on Precinct 13,"" but also James DeMonaco penned the script. The biggest problem with DeMonaco's script is the reason the villains target the Sandin estate. You'd think that James would keep closer tabs on his son. The real surprises occur late in the third act after the villains have stormed the house. At one point, you may find yourself screaming back at the screen for our heroes to kill, kill, kill! Clearly, what DeMonaco has written is not as cynical as it seems. Although ""The Purge"" looks like something the NRA would endorse, you can bet that DeMonaco has crafted a satire to show how extreme the conditions would get to achieve such fascist prosperity."

","If you are wondering about the film and worried about the low rating, please don't mind the people who seriously underestimate the quality of this film. The reason is that everyone thinks that they can write a better scenario than that and characters are stupid. They expect characters with no emotional dilemmas, they expect people who are doing the most rational thing with no human element, as in every Hollywood film where the cool hero kicks the a** of the bad guys in the brightest way. DO NOT expect that too much in this film. This film is not a typical thriller film that approaches killing very lightly and easily. Every time you feel a character is about to die, it makes you think its moral sides. This film has many very good messages and it delivers them very well. It is trying hard to reflect on the emotional dilemmas and morality of killing rather than keeping it as a satisfaction element for the audience. So If you want to watch a film with a very good story and messages about morals, this is the right film. If you wanna see a blood bath with coolest and brightest characters dealing with a meaningless gore, then find another film.<br/><br/>Briefly, this film is for you, if you are looking for a good story that will make you think. If you are looking for a typical film like ""panic room"" etc. then turn your face to another film. IF you think the characters could behave better and more logically, without any emotions, then you better start writing your own scenario and good luck in finding some readers, you will need it."

"Agent10","6","12","21","8 June 2013"," The idea was bigger than the movie
","Let's face it, when a mainstream Hollywood film is made, closed minded, money grubbing executives are the ones who ultimately ruin the product. They value money and accessibility over making something that is risky and potentially historic. This sort of mentality is really the only thing that holds back ""The Purge,"" and a common echo that will be heard on this film's comment boards is the fact it had so much potential. <br/><br/>But even then that mentality could be reminiscent of the story at hand, where Ethan Hawke's character James Sandin makes boat loads of money (literally) but blinds himself to the actual truth of the annual Purge. Too bad the people making the film didn't have a realization to the truth and release their violent tendencies much like James Sandin. But either way, despite all of the punches that are pulled, the film brings up a lot of speculation that makes it more interesting to a sophisticated film goer even though it is advertised as your typical kill fest of the week. While popcorn movie watchers will watch for the violent implications, pretentious snobs like myself will find something much deeper, much more sinister. While the class warfare angle has been overplayed the last couple years, this film managed to turn the idea into actual violence. And while conservatives might just label this as typical anti-wealth liberal Hollywood trash, it is actually quite an allegory for 2nd Amendment enthusiasts and fiscal conservatism. ""Purging"" the poor has saved America, unburdening the country of ""parasites"" and in turn, has helped create a smaller and more efficient government (presumably) and allowing poor people like James Sandin unprecedented upward mobility through unfettered capitalism. I especially found it interesting when his neighbors turn on Sandin, once again showing classism-based jealousy is not just a poor/wealthy paradigm, but also an affliction that ensnares the upper crust. <br/><br/>While all of these things were there for the taking, the direction was what turned ""The Purge"" into another run of the mill pseudo horror film. I believe this is where too many people put there opinion into the fray. Imagine the response if the film had some of these scenarios: The people in the masks actually were the neighbors or Sandin was less virtuous, taking advantage of The Purge to make money and not giving a damn about the carnage or implied ethos, or maybe the homeless man they let into the house was truly guilty, an escaped murderer or child molester. The social implications could have gone any way, but even though the filmmakers took the easy way out, the ending still had some interesting implications at the end. I won't say The Purge is great, but at least it wasn't an unmitigated train wreck."

"deacon_blues-3","2","10","17","24 March 2014"," This movie is for morons
","Here is why this movie is for morons:<br/><br/>1.) The premise is moronic: OK, OK, I get the ""social commentary"" aspect of the film's premise. But only morons believe that all the people who disagree with them politically are conspiring to exterminate the poor and minorities to the point where this premise makes any sense. Demonizing your adversaries is easy; understanding reality takes mental effort—effort that the makers of the film and those who like it are not equipped to expend even if they wanted to. <br/><br/>2.) The story is moronic: I really don't know where to start on this topic. I suppose the worst is that none of the characters is at all realistic enough to garner the least bit of sympathy. Each one is either too stupid, naïve, or too selfish to live, especially through any situation where murder becomes legal for 12 hours! If you were able to identify with one of these characters—my sympathies to you, for you will live a short, brutal existence. One thing that is glaringly stupid is that, given the scenario of Purge Night, all home security systems would have had to be offensive as well as defensive. Walling yourself in would never be sufficient in a lawless situation. There would have to be exterior gun turrets to protect the home from enterprising intruders like those who show up in this story. And, while were dealing with inconsistencies, why could the son communicate verbally with his mother through his robot at the beginning of the film but suddenly have no such capability later on? Perhaps the most moronic touch of all (and this is when I turned it off!) is when the head villain says, "" I want every barricade torn down! Every door, every window!"" What an idiot! Why would you waste so much time and effort on tearing down every barrier when all you need is one access point? Wouldn't removing all the barriers provide more ways for those inside to escape? If you create one entrance, everyone inside would be trapped and much easier to deal with!<br/><br/>3.) The characters are all morons: OK, lets start with the family. The dad is a deluded materialist who only looks out for his own and thinks that everything that is kept at a distance is not his concern. The wife is basically the same, except she is dumber and understands less of reality, if that's really possible. The teen daughter only understands her own desires and is fixed only sex and music. She has no respect for anyone who is not sexually attractive to her. She blames her father when her boyfriend tries to murder him and he winds up getting killed when her father defends himself, even though her boyfriend blatantly lied to her about his intentions toward her father. After her boyfriend dies, she wanders off into the house in an emotional daze, even though there is a desperate outsider roaming around whom she has every reason to believe might have violent intentions (especially since—let's remember—murder is legal!). The son is an technogeek, but no less a moron when it comes to having any grasp on reality. He disarms the entire security system and opens all the barriers just to let one person in. We must assume that this is not his first Purge, and yet he (and the rest of his family for that matter) does not understand the violence that is going on outside and that any plea could be a ruse to get access to killing him and his affluent family. Then there are the ""bad people"" (sigh!). Why wear masks when everything is legal? Isn't that the point? Then they traipse around outside like they have nothing to fear from an entire world armed to the teeth with murderous intent! Girls in nightgowns, singing and dancing around in the yard when their own leader is capable of offing one of his friends without notice and with minimal provocation! Then there's the homeless man whom they let in; he struggles frantically to survive and then just suddenly resigns and tells the father to do go ahead and put him outside to protect his family! Oh, yeah! That makes sense! <br/><br/>None of these people would have the slightest chance of surviving any real emergency.<br/><br/>And neither would the creators of this film!<br/><br/>But one thing this film taught me that I never realized before; there are people who need to be purged—the makers of this film!"

Anyway, as a European, I see The Purge as a satyr or something like this. Authorizing crime/murder one night a year is here seen as the solution for all the problems ( and it clearly worked ) and it kinda works in a weird sense. After a little slow first half that allows us to ""learn to know the characters and what is their point of view on The Purge"" , the action enters and never stops until the end. We even have a few twists all over the place so it was really enjoyable. Totally recommend it."
"Cristi_Ciopron","10","23","48","18 August 2013"," A Genuinely Insightful, Heart—Wrenching And Effective Drama, Well Crafted
","The cabal against this movie is political. 'The Purge' flopped politically, it flopped for political reasons. A genuinely insightful _dystopian thriller, subtle and bitter, piercing and heart-wrenching, James DeMonaco's movie is clearheaded and sharply thought, convincingly realized, a tale of substitutive atonement, and also of expiation. Much is left unspoken, or suggested. There are hints—about the characters' ways of being. But the undertones—of danger, of eroticism and appeal, etc.—are extremely well managed.<br/><br/>And it is also a story about virtue—the husband's, who is a man of virtue. He speaks about team, about making it as a team. He shows good sense and balance, while the members of his family are unbalanced, either because of age (the kids) or other causes (the wife, 'Mary', is certainly mysterious as a character, intriguing, we see that she drinks, and later she exchanges looks with the hunted person, and the moment when she and their guest part ways has an undeniably erotic undercurrent, she gives in to him). He is betrayed and redeemed. His team fails; the team assembled around him, in his home, will not buy in the virtue he upholds. They betray him. The kids disobey him, his wife flirts with their uninvited guest. He is blamed for everything, for every _disfunction, he always gets the blame—because the security systems aren't unbreakable, because he wants to deliver the fugitive to his hunters, then because he won't, then for giving the boy a gun, etc.. The surrounding soft-heads get all the love. We understand early that most of the characters are humanly undependable, save the husband; the wife is often shown drinking (while preparing the meal, then at dinner), the boy is annoying. In current terms, they are flawed persons. But the husband is flawed also, and here is the twist of the story—because he is cleansed, redeemed, by his virtue. His death is substitutive and expiatory; it is true he kills a youngster, his daughter's lover, he kills in self—defense, and is killed in his turn, cleansed, stabbed, the others kill too, but they get away with it, because they play the game, and so their generosity is a piece of the same puzzle with the murderers and the decent neighbors, they belong to the same world, while the husband, the sales' champion, doesn't, and is killed. And so, the family saves a stranger, tears the ethics, and betrays one of theirs. They make the mistakes, and they are ceaselessly comforted, etc.. The husband, the man who believes in team and in virtue, is betrayed, stabbed, cleansed and redeemed. His team falls apart, they survive, he doesn't, and the meaning of his death isn't that of a failure, but that of redemption—also expiation and substitutive atonement, in a secular understanding.<br/><br/>The actress playing 'Mary', the wife, has a very striking beauty. Her character, 'Mary', is a standout by her drinking and by her beauty.<br/><br/>An aged Hawke does a good role, understated and satisfying, perhaps like a Dillon, or a better Nolte.<br/><br/>Hawke is 42 in this movie, Mrs. Headey is 39.<br/><br/>Perhaps it is not really a dystopia, dystopia as the conventional genre known to us, and perhaps it's not even related to the philosophy of culture; it's not a political conjecture, or a warning, it is a political statement, and indictment, which is why its critics, or many of them, disliked it, and 2022 might be anytime. This is the best of the five movies released this year that I have seen. I have found it mind—blowing. I understand that it annoyed the righteous ilk."

","Where do I begin? This movie was such an absolute waste of my time it is ridiculous. I have never been so frustrated after walking out of a movie. This movie had so much potential with such a solid idea and such a great premises that was all thrown to absolute crap with this story line. There was no character development, no back story, no details about the events of the day, no history, and nothing to build on for the whole movie. The events that occurred were so unlikely yet predictable that the movie was not even enjoyable to any degree. The entire audience was laughing almost the whole time and seemed to be entertained only by their fellow audience members, not the movie. By the end of the film I was in need of medical stress relief and a good purging myself because of how angry and frustrated I was at not only the unlikeliness of every action and emotion in this movie, but at the absolute waste of such a genius idea that the film was based on. I felt no relation to any character and thought the entire movie was just garbage. The best actor in this movie by far was Rhys Wakefield, and what a waste of his talent it was. If there was a way for me to destroy this movie as to stop anyone else from wasting valuable life time on this garbage, it would be my life mission. I cannot describe my hatred towards this ""film"" enough. I put quotes on film because it is almost a joke to call it that. Bottom line, please do not waste your time on this movie."

"inkblot11","7","10","18","19 June 2013"," Dark, compelling, not for under 18 and then only with caution
","First, before I begin, let me state that my favorite types of films are art house beauties, like Pride and Prejudice, A Merry War or Cinderella Man. Yet, when I heard the premise of the Purge, I felt compelled to see it, admiring science fiction and dark subjects like mass propaganda and brainwashing. So, here is my review of The Purge.<br/><br/>In the very near future, the United States government, under its NEW Founding Fathers, has solved, in its mind, problems of unemployment and crime. It has instituted the Purge, a once a year night of ""soul cleansing"", where any crime is allowed. On each March 21, from 7:00 pm to the following morning at 7:00 am, police forces are nowhere to be found and murder, assault, theft, arson, etc. is the norm. No, government officials can not be targeted and weapons above ""level four"" are forbidden. Naturally, the rich can afford elaborate security systems on their mansions and endure the purge in their personal fortresses. Everyone else has to fend for themselves. In this way, the population is reduced, riff raff is eliminated, and pent-up rage is released for humanity's ""good"". Or, that's the government line. Top security systems salesman, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) has become rich from hawking his company's products on members of his elite community. His mansion is the biggest on the block, with a spanking new addition. Wife Mary (Lena Headey) can stay at home and make healthy, scratch meals which are ""carb free"" and take care of their two teenagers. Older teen Zoey is bright and pretty but has a boyfriend, Henry, who is already an adult 18 and who James has forbidden her to see. They meet in secret. Younger teen Charlie is also bright but shy and timid. He spends his free time inventing electronic gadgets, like his remote controlled video camera which uses a battered babydoll as its foundation. Now, this year's Purge is to begin. The Sandins go into lockdown after the evening meal, unaware that Henry has hidden himself in the house after visiting Zoey. As each retires to their chosen rooms, with screens showing what is happening outside their immediate area, Charlie sees a man running down the block, screaming for help. The teen makes the decision to momentarily disable the security sys and let the man in. All too soon, this man disappears into an unknown place in the enormous house. What's worse, some rich college age sons and daughters of the Sandin's neighborhood come knocking on the door, too. It seems they, instead of taking shelter in their own homes, went out looking for a victim for their own personal purge. Their choice was the homeless man now confined in the Sandin's home. As their ""preppy killer"" leader proclaims, the Sandins must return this man or face their own demise, for they have bought equipment to bring down the security of the Sandin's home. Can this really be? Yes, James tells Mary, despite his company's claims, their system is vulnerable to certain breaches. James begins to hunt for the man, knowing they must throw him to the ""wolves"", their killer neighbors. But, before this happens, Henry appears with plans of this own. Also, the perps begin their assault, which they say is their ""right for the night"", as they are in need of soul cleansing. How will it all shake down, with most of the neighbors already in resentment of the rich, rich Sandins? If you have ever pondered Shirley Jackson's story of The Lottery or how Hitler, Tojo, and Mussolini were able to use propaganda to convince folks that their plans were for the best, then you have the idea behind the Purge. Nevermind that the actions seem inhuman, unjust, and more, this is the new norm and folks have taken it to heart. This is dark, compelling stuff. All of the actors here do a fine job, including Hawke and Headey, but most of the praise has to go to the premise and its execution. Some critics have dismissed this film as dumb and/or silly but I found it heady stuff. For those who, like me, find the movie's plot description too tantalizing to ignore, then head out to the nearest theater."

It takes the most simplistic and mean-spirited caricatures of the NRA, the TEA Party, 1%- ers, and the religious right, rolls them into one dehumanized lot, and tries to sell the audience on an ultra-violent dystopian 2022 where twelve hours of state-sanctioned anything-goes mayhem is legal.<br/><br/>One always enters a film with a willing suspension of disbelief, but this film offers up such thin caricatures and obvious moralizing that the spell is almost immediately broken.<br/><br/>The only people who could enjoy this film would be those who believe the caricatures fair.

","The trailer and the general idea of the movie seemed original and quite interesting. After the first 20 minutes I began to question my decision to watch the movie. The characters seemed completely fake and made up. They lacked logic and general realism. For example, when the bad guys wearing stupid masks (supposed to look creepy) made the family start looking for the homeless guy, they shut down the power. WHY? If you want someone to find someone else why would you shut down the power. Another example is when Henry got shot. His girlfriend didn't seem to care about what happened at all. Her boyfriend just tried to kill her dad and ended up getting killed himself. Yes, she did cry but it just didn't seem believable. In general the whole plot of the movie was terrible and the acting made it even worse. I definitely do not recommend this to anyone, and the only reason I didn't give it a 1 is because I've seen movies worse."
"rising-down","2","8","14","30 June 2013"," Beyond stupid
","In the oh so near future there's one day where you can go out and commit whatever crime you want. The idea for the movie might sound somewhat interesting at first. Questions pop up such as: what kind of society agrees to a thing like this? How does this affect daily life, knowing/assuming that your neighbor or employee might be trying to kill you, or tried to last year? Doesn't an annual crime green card for murder and rape for Average Joe even lead to a more doomed, sick society? Nobody knows, because the movie doesn't bother with those boring details. Everybody seems to be cool with this (except for the oddball son) because ever since then all citizens agree to only commit crime during the purge. It's ... magic! <br/><br/>In many movies you have that one annoying character. This movie does different. Everybody is annoying. Only the stranger seems to be the only sane and bearable person (a ""thank you"" might have helped the situation though). Everybody else is nuts. <br/><br/>As soon as the main plot starts everything gets chaotic. All of them are running around and are acting unpredictably. It goes like ""There's a guy in our house and we need to save our daughter? Well, let's check the monitors first to see what is going on *outside*!"". We also learn that the safest way to protect your family apparently is to split up: son, you go there. Woman, you go defend something over there. Daughter, umm - where was she again? Nevermind. Let's not even talk about the girls boyfriend. Go figure yourself what he was thinking, because I don't know. Then we got the spooky masked villains. Apparently some students on their annual purge rite, trying to act like a mixture between the (Dark Knight-) Joker and Alex from Clockwork Orange. Well, ... trying. In the end the other friendly neighborhood villains show up, killing the other villains, only to try to kill the family themselves. Because in the future society it's totally okay and good for society and your soul to kill a family including their children during the purge, just because they have too much money. Of course they fail but their lives are spared leading to the most interesting part of the movie, opening the doors wide open for a sequel. If the movie does well in the box office there will likely be one and it would give the opportunity to show us how the other 364 days until the next purge will be like, now knowing that their neighbors tried to kill them, leaving room for character development. But let's be honest. This is not gonna happen (the insights, not the sequel)."

Check.<br/><br/>Creepy older possessive boyfriend thinking ""if I kill my hot younger girlfriend's dad then I will win her heart or at least her body""? Check. (Bonus points for this being then essentially unimportant for the rest of the movie, once the boyfriend is summarily killed for the crime of attacking a protagonist.) One could go on, but most egregiously, the movie gives us one-percenter protagonists who feel entitled to hold themselves above the violence that engulfs the country, one-percenter antagonists who feel entitled to ""cleanse"" society of ""lesser"" (i.e. less-rich) members, and more one-percenter antagonists who want to take vengeance on our unsympathetic protagonists for being slightly richer than they are (when they should be taking vengeance for being sold crappily unimpressive ""security"" systems).<br/><br/>The best-case scenario would be the tough, apparently innocent black veteran being the only survivor, with all the unsympathetic characters killing each other off.

","On the large scale, allowing anarchy to reign in any country would just encourage revolution and insurgence. Gangs of dissatisfied citizens would plan every year to sow anarchy during the time they know cops aren't going to be around to enforce the laws. If they start eliminating all the cops in large regions, as they do in revolutionary and anarchistic countries, then after the purge is over, who is there to restore order? This is the problem we are seeing in Iraq and Afghanistan, where the new cops are killed off at graduation ceremonies, and police stations are bombed. What results is a perpetual anarchist state, ruled by warlords and gangs.<br/><br/>Well, its against the rules of the purge to use automatic weapons or to go after cops. Again, people who like hunting other people aren't going to just follow the rules because they are docile and easily controlled. They'll probably just do as they wish, eliminate the cops and the authorities while they have a chance, and cause the downfall of the government.<br/><br/>Any society is just a few days away from revolution. Take away basic services over a large enough area, take away emergency and policing, make it hard for people to get food.<br/><br/>Overall, this is just a childishly silly premise for a basic horror movie.

"culmo80","4","7","12","21 August 2013"," Cheap Political Statement rather than a film
","Whenever someone makes a movie that is first and foremost a political statement, it won't be good, unless of course you think the message is right.<br/><br/>The Purge is a left-wing view of they see people who believe in individual liberty and the right to self-defense. Obviously, gun ownership is evil and only leads to more violence... Throw in some jabs at greedy Wall Street and this is essentially what this movie is.<br/><br/>Even without the annoying political statements, the film is a let-down. Spoilers ahead!<br/><br/>First, even common sense will tell you that the entire premise of this movie is deeply flawed. Crime is at an all-time low because people get to kill one day a year? Do the writers even know what the motivators are in crime? Somehow, rape, robbery, murder, and other crimes just decline because people can kill without criminal prosecution? Right! Look, the premise is interesting, but come on, put some more thought into it. People won't stop stealing just because they can murder at will one night...and murder wouldn't cease to exist because most murders are not meticulously planned out...they occur in the heat of the moment, either through rage or surprise (think a spouse murdering his/her spouse during an argument or after finding them cheating; or consider a robbery gone bad). Second, the idea that having one day a year where murder is legal will somehow keep unemployment down makes no sense. Unemployment is not a fixed number, it is related to the size of the population and there will always be unemployment regardless of the population size. When you consider the homicide rate now for a year you'll find it much higher than anything that could occur in a 12-hour span in one night. So if anything, the population would skyrocket and there would be MORE unemployment.<br/><br/>As for the plot itself, it was very basic. A family is besieged in their house after the son lets in a homeless guy running from crazed killers. The crazed killers are of course pros at entering a house and have all the right equipment and know-how...oh, and they are apparently trust-fund babies or something. There's a bunch of killing and at the end the homeless guy saves the day, which was about as predictable as it gets. Oh and throw in a brief subplot where the daughter's boyfriend is hiding in the house and tries to kill the Dad, but he is shot and dies...and that's it for that.<br/><br/>Plenty of plot holes though. So, they have this security system that they only need for one year...yet the entire family (at least the son and dad) know the security code by heart? The son deftly enters the code to let in the homeless guy. Sorry, but in 8 years, we'll have more security codes and passwords than we can remember and there's no way the family will know it by heart when they only use it once a year.<br/><br/>And what is a homeless doing in a neighborhood like that? They make a point several times in the film to say that they live in a very safe area...presumably without any homeless people. Are we to believe that the killers chased the guy miles and miles to a posh neighborhood?<br/><br/>Then there's the trust-fund hit squad. They're all wearing creepy masks (for the cheap effect of creeping out the audience) but for anyone who remembers Halloween masks...they're very difficult to see out of...much less stalk your prey and commit murder in. And they're experts at breaking into fortified houses? Their special equipment consists of some Ford F-150s and chains? Really? Just what did they attach the chains to? The steal plates didn't appear to have any convenient hook points, so...? Plus, how did they rip off ALL the steel plates? There were only two trucks and it would have taken a while for them to get to each window...probably several hours, and you can't tell me that the ENTIRE house was accessible to vehicles that had enough room for the trucks to maneuver in order to pull those plates off. I mean as a home-security expert, the Dad should have known that the best way to prevent someone from entering your home is to limit the number of approaches and entry points. For instance, you don't allow someone from the street easy access to your entire house from the outside. You put up fences, you plant trees, you make it very difficult for someone to get in. I'm sure their house would have been a tougher nut to crack than we saw.<br/><br/>I hear they're going to make a sequel to this movie...great, another series of bad ""horror"" movies that get pawned off to the public. <br/><br/>Don't spend money on this movie...watch it on TV or see it on Netflix or something. There are better films in the genre than this...way better."

"mecheart","1","7","12","25 June 2013"," A needless foray into a future America where the lives of the poor mean even less than in the present
","From reading through many of the reviews of 'The Purge' on this website I have derived that viewers of the film have divided themselves into two categories: those who honestly enjoyed it, and those who simply despised it. I must side with the latter group for reasons that are easily described. <br/><br/>'The Purge' is an exploitation film first and foremost. It is not a horror picture, nor does it load itself up with a high enough caliber message to make a moving statement about American social or political woes that trouble us today or are likely to worsen in the near future. It is a very short film that neither troubles the viewer with even slightly developed characters, nor does it weave into its simple plot the least of twists to make worthwhile a viewing in its entirety. <br/><br/>Essentially, if even slightly developed characters that interact with one another even slightly interestingly or entertainingly are a requirement for your enjoyment of a film, 'The Purge' is something you want to avoid. <br/><br/>The film is about an America of the near future where on one night a year, all emergency medical and law enforcement services are suspended so that you, I or the neighbors can legally commit any crime they like - up to and including mass murder - so that the tension and stress we've all pent up throughout the year can be ""purged"". This annual bloodfest has supposedly reduced crime to an historic low and made everyone happier and more productive in general. While the premise is interesting, its use in the context of the plot and themes evinced is not. <br/><br/>The family of main characters enter the picture as do good dick and jane who while they do not participate in the government encouraged slaughter, fully support it and praise and explain it to no end to their two children who could not come across as more bewildered by the inevitable events of the coming once yearly hell night. <br/><br/>Of the four family members, the son is the only one among them with a trace of a conscience made evident when some time after daddy Ethan locks their home down into fortress mode against the ""purgers"" he opens the ramparts momentarily to allow in a poor, black, homeless veteran begging for his life on their front lawn. You see in addition to the steel window and door plates their property is wired with high resolution security cameras. <br/><br/>Moments later a group of young people, who could only be described as serious fans of the Manson family cult, arrive on their doorstep and demand that the wounded homeless guy be turned over to them before their ""heavy"" steel plate breaching equipment arrives. It is here that the movie suddenly tries to remake itself as some kind of religious cult out to slaughter for kicks type of film. Ridiculously the members of the thrill kill squad wear masks with big frozen smiles and leering empty eyes and the too many scenes of them frolicking in the Sandin's front yard seem intended to be surreal and nightmare like, but end up making the would be thrill killers look and sound like prancing garden gnomes. <br/><br/>The film asks us to believe that these rich young people out to kill the poor on Purge Night are law abiding, wholesome youths 364 days a year, but on that last day suddenly transform into a cult of throat cutting maniacs with quirky on acid like facial expressions and patterns of speech? Loony Tunes I tell you - it's loony!<br/><br/>While the Sandin's brace for the incursion of the new manson gang, mom and dad hunt down the homeless guy their son let into their own private paradise and out of the blue their daughter's boyfriend - who snuck into the house before lockdown - decides to take several shots at her dad. I suppose this subplot was to demonstrate that the misguided lad could not be charged with a crime on Purge Night, but it only served as a comical distraction as moments after daddy blows him away, daughter dearest has forgotten all about her ""growling"" love for her beau. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Sandin boy makes an effort to keep the homeless guy hidden from mommy and daddy as they hunt their unwelcome guest down armed with a ridiculous selection of handguns. I think Ethan was packing a snub nose .44 magnum for goodness sake!<br/><br/>Inevitably the creepy crawly cult of killer teens does break into the house, but not before a horrid scene involving Lena, the bound by duct tape wounded homeless guy and a letter opener. All of this conducted in front of her two children its no wonder they go around the whole film looking so traumatized. <br/><br/>Movies like the 'The Purge' have always been made with the intent to shock us in some way, to make us feel less confident about ourselves, our neighbors, our society - to make us feel less safe in our sea of the mundane. Some similar films have succeeded, 'The Purge' however fails to do any of the aforementioned by a wide margin. <br/><br/>To sum up, 'The Purge' is a forgettable thriller populated by transparent husks of imitations of plausibly real people set in a America where life means even less than in some instances in our reality outside the silver screen. It's plot takes us to no interesting or even startling corners of thought and those targeted by the film for exploitation are the ones we should protect at all costs from sight or sound of this tragicomic mess of a movie."

"joe-collins91","5","28","66","27 May 2013"," Disappointing and Not What You Think
","The Purge tells the story of a dystopian futuristic America, where vigilance is almost non existent and unemployment rates remain at a respectable 1%. The reason for this? Because every year, for a 12 hour period the government permits American citizens to ravage the streets, killing, raping and destroying anything and everything they desire. During this time, external aid is unavailable and all emergency services are suspended. This annual holiday is known as ""the purge"" as it encourages the elitist-sort to ""purge"" all their negative emotions and violent urges.<br/><br/>The Purge is the latest credit from Jason Blum, the man who brought us ""Paranormal Activity"" and last years ""Sinister"", both of which are highly entertaining and genuinely scary films. Therefore ""The Purge"" should be good. Unfortunately shooting a high concept sci-fi thriller on a shoe string budget and spending 90% of your budget on Ethan Hawke's hair ruins what could potentially have been one of the most interesting speculative horror films of the year.<br/><br/>With such a great, albeit it inconceivable and questionable premisis, you'd have thought that director James DeMonaco (probably best known for his writing credits on the awful Assault on Precinct 13 remake) had a little gem on his hands. The setup is fundamentally disturbing and chilling- a world where crime is legal for one night of the year would make for a highly interesting and entertaining narrative if done properly. But the problem with The Purge is it tries too hard to please and is no where near as effective or smart as it likes to think. Add to that a so-so home invasion plot thrown into the mix, which completely sidelines the awesome setup and you have a recipe for disappointment. <br/><br/>The film opens up nicely with an eerie title sequence which showcases how ""the purge"" plays out on the streets. From here though we are shoehorned into the claustrophobic life of James Sardin (Ethan Hawke) and his rich elitist family. Sandin designs and flogs ""purge proof"" home security systems to the neighbors and for this reason lives in an impressive lavish home himself. After a cliché ridden dinner party scene complete with flying insults about overage boyfriends, Sandin, his trophy wife Mary (Lena Heady) and their two rebellious teenagers Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder) prepare to settle down for the night, in order the wait out the annual ""purge"" which is about to commence. As Charlie questions the moral practice of such a disturbing concept (killing the needy to cleanse the streets) a stranger (Edwin Hodge) who is being pursued by a gang of masked vigilantes screams for help. Charlie, being the only compassionate character in the whole film decides to disarm the security system, allowing the bloodied stranger to take refuge in the family home. Meanwhile Zoey's creepy boyfriend sneaks into the house to pursue a conflict with her father. It's not long before the murderous mob, wearing masquerade-style garments traces the stranger to the family household. The charming but sinister leader of the mob (Rhys Wakefield) issues a chilling ultimatum to the family- hand over the stranger or they will break into the house and murder everyone inside. <br/><br/>From here follows a battle of morals, numerous chase sequences in darkened hallways and more jump scares than you can poke a stick at as cliché ridden plot points play out like a rusty video cassette. The final act consists of an action ridden shoot-em-up, and despite a few neat twists rattles along like an old ghost train, complete with fake manufactured scares. The whole idea of the ""purge"" is lost in the muddled home invasion plot and the numerous plot holes are so large that they could swallow up the house where this dull thriller is set. The cast do a reasonable job, but the script never allows for them to be more than two dimensional clichéd cutouts (the loyal husband, the ""perfect"" housewife, the rebellious kids etc) there's even a token black guy and a pantomime villain. Wakefield steals the show as the main antagonist (a performance reminiscent of Heath Ledgers smirking Joker) but it still doesn't distract from the fact that the concept is smothered by typical horror conventions. The ending is pretty shocking and unexpected (I wasn't expecting such a main character to be dispatched in such a cruel fashion) but the last 10 minutes cannot make up for the previous 75 which are mediocre to say the least. <br/><br/>Therefore The Purge is nothing more than a disappointing stretched out Twilight Zone, and even then it would be within the weaker of those episodes. Had the concept been properly explored (showing us the carnage in the streets, tieing up loose ends about the premisis etc) then The Purge may have been a highly entertaining and specualative thriller. As it stands, it is nothing more than your average teen slasher. Best avoided."

","*Director - James DeMonaco <br/><br/>*Actors - Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane, Edwin Hodge and Rhys Wakefield.<br/><br/>*Synopsis - Set in the year 2022, ""The Purge"" is about a family's fight to stay alive during the annual purge - a 12 hour period in which all crime is legal.<br/><br/>*Review - I came into this movie with relatively low expectations. The trailer looked promising, but what can one expect from modern day horror movies but disappointing clichés and poor acting? To my great surprise, ""The Purge"" turned out to be a frightful ride that showcased the immense flaws in a supposed Utopian society.<br/><br/>All of the actors shined in their roles. Ethan Hawke was amazing at portraying a protective matriarch. Lena Headey and Max Burkholder showed an honest portrayal of characters at odds with their morals. Adelaide Kane and Edwin Hodge, while both adequate actors in their roles, didn't really wow me in their performances. Finally, Rhys Wakefield was truly extraordinary in his role of of the polite sociopath.<br/><br/>I enjoyed James DeMonaco's style. In the beginning, he chose camera angles that one would see in any film. However, as the movie progressed, DeMonaco used jerky and fast camera angles and shots that reflected the characters moods at the time: completely disoriented and unprepared. Scary scenes during the purge were sudden and intense, which definitely upped the scare factor for me. The script had smooth dialogue throughout that didn't venture into unrealistic territory. The only thing that really bothered me was that the film seems too short, with the actual action occurring late into the film. And unless the world changes drastically in the next nine years, ""The Purge"" would be more effective if it took place in an unknown time in the future, so that humans could truly question whether this would become reality.<br/><br/>The soundtrack was also good. I particularly enjoyed the beginning credits, which played soft music over horrific crimes. It was such a raw and sharp contrast that it got you thinking of what the purge really does to people. Besides that, everything else seemed to fit the movie pretty well, although no other effects really amazed me.<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is a terrific film if your ever in the mood for thought provoking horror. While the premise may seem faulty, the movie asks you many questions about morality and challenges you to think of what you would do if the purge was actually in existence."

","STAR RATING: ***** Saturday Night **** Friday Night *** Friday Morning ** Sunday Night * Monday Morning<br/><br/>In a futuristic America, unemployment and crime have been virtually eradicated, thanks to 'the purge', an annual night a year where all crime, including murder, is legalized for twelve hours. One family who choose not to participate are the Sandins, headed by father James (Ethan Hawke), who choose the 'lock down' option in their fancy home. However, things get complicated when a homeless man approaches their door, begging to be let in before he is torn to pieces by a blood thirsty mob.<br/><br/>It seems if an idea isn't far fetched and off the wall enough, it can certainly be sick and twisted enough to get your attention. The Purge, the latest offering from the man who was either the director of Insidious and/or the producer of Sinister or something or other, certainly wants to expose the dark heart of humanity at it's centre, but maybe it isn't as far fetched as you might first think. It presents a, somewhat controversial, but certainly thought provoking idea of how to stamp out crime from society that provides real food for thought and forces the viewer to look inside themselves and truly examine their morals and conscience.<br/><br/>It's certainly a challenging spectacle that delivers more of itself and gets more out of you than you might have thought. In a day and age of hackneyed, tired scripts and plot lines, The Purge is genuinely suspenseful and unpredictable through out and the edge of your seat is truly where you'll be. Yes, it may follow suit with all the other modern fright flicks with it's over reliance on jump scenes to get scares, but with an intelligent script and taut direction behind it, they serve a function rather than just being meaningless window dressing.<br/><br/>There may be a lack of political correctness to it that might put off some, but The Purge is so much more complex and surprising than you expect it to be, it stands on it's own as something to be admired. *****"

An annual event in which criminal acts, including murder, are permitted by the government thus allowing all good American citizens to 'cleanse' themselves of their negativity and hatred without fear of consequence. What a great premise for a film!<br/><br/>Sadly, the potentially thrilling idea is poorly executed across the 1 hour and 25 minutes of this first in a series of films. Its main downfall is its predictability. I won't go as far to call them 'twists' because the plot is painfully straightforward but you will certainly see the two big plot points coming before they occur in the later part of the movie. The casting and acting varies from adequate to weak, but then the characters themselves are overly generic and uncomplicated. <br/><br/>I guess the real draw of The Purge was supposed to be its violent scenes, but even then it does nothing new, exciting or shocking. I can't help feel that in the hands of another Director/Writer the concept could have been something very thrilling indeed but since there are a couple of sequels, maybe the next in the series might deliver? Maybe a future instalment will take a deeper look at the moral implications of the annual event? Or, more likely, they will just be repeats of the same idea in varying locations.

"zkonedog","4","3","4","5 March 2017"," Such A Novel Idea Wasted On What Turns Into Stock Horror Fare
","For its first 30 minutes or so, ""The Purge"" is one of the most inventive, fresh movies of the entire year. At about that point, however, it is as if director James DeMonaco thought ""oh wait...this is supposed to be a horror movie"" and thus the creative juices dwindle down into pretty much stock horror fare.<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, ""The Purge"" sets the stage of America circa. 2022, where on one night each year all crime (even homicide) is legal. Supposedly, this ""simple"" government action has led to the lowest levels of unemployment and general violence in history the other 364 days. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), wife Mary (Lena Headey) and their two children (Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane) plan to ride out the night inside their fortified-shelter home, until a homeless man requesting aid gives their night a completely unexpected twist.<br/><br/>The concept behind ""The Purge"" truly is an incredible one, and thus contains the backbone of the entire storyline (or, at least, SHOULD). Enough dialogue (in various formats) is given about the event that the viewer will actually be intrigued instead of instantly dismissing the concept as a ""gimmick"". While watching, you'll actually be thinking through some pretty deep societal messages/themes (gasp...at a horror movie!).<br/><br/>Sadly, once the ""Purge"" event in the film commences, the movie slowly turns into much more traditional ""jump"" and ""blood"" horror movie fare. All those great themes established in the opening sequences are thrown away in favor of chases and contrived scares.<br/><br/>Thus, there are two ways to look at a movie like this. On one hand, it accomplishes a great feat by taking some extraordinary themes of humanity and sticking them in a ""scary movie"". On the other hand, the film still couldn't be genre-diverse enough to resist going back to the ""old standards"" of horror in the end and wasting such great development."

An annual twelve hour period where crime is legal, anything goes, including murder. Everyone makes a plan for Purge Night, lock down, parties an murder. The film focuses on one wealthy family, The Sandin's. James and Mary are hugely wealthy, living in a smart neighbourhood with their two children Zoey and Charlie. James has made his money by selling top notch security systems, even their mild mannered neighbours have all invested. The Purge is seen as a time to cleanse America, the homeless and other drains on society are purged. On that night Charlie let's in a homeless stranger who's pursued by a group who mean to purge him. James is given an ultimatum, release him, or they'll break in and kill everyone.<br/><br/>I think my expectations for this film were really high. It satisfied to some extent, but I had expected so much more. I bought in to the world they had created, somehow the thought of crime only occurring one night a year made sense. The production values were high, the camera work slick, it felt like a very well made film.<br/><br/>My gripe with the film is that it felt small, what could have been big, brutal and gritty turned out to be a home invasion film, which let's face it could have happened at any time, the concept of Purge night seemed a little redundant somehow.<br/><br/>Quite a few clichés surrounding the main characters, the daughter with awesome legs, the creepy boy, the nice but sinister neighbours. I will applaud the performance of Rhys Wakefield though, he managed to create a huge disparity between his appearance and his behaviour, he at least felt original.<br/><br/>I had hoped for more, the basic premise was excellent, it was just sadly underused, I'm sure there will be several follow ups. 5/10"

When the night rolls around again the Sandin family settles in inside their protected house and starts to relax. When the son, trying to do the right thing, protects someone in trouble it puts the entire family in danger and the house doesn't seem so safe. While this is a horror movie I do have to say that it's more along the lines of The Strangers then a typical horror. The plot of the movie isn't really that far fetched which makes it a little more terrifying. While I wouldn't call the movie scary I do have to say that it made me feel tense and edgy for almost the entire time. This is a movie that kept me interested and intrigued the entire time. The movie seems to only be filmed in extreme close-ups which adds to the horror aspect of it. It also makes you think how you would act if this actually was going on. I really enjoyed this much more then I expected to and I recommend this. Overall, much better then I was expecting and very tense the whole time. I like and recommend this. I surprisingly give this an A-."

","The Purge, 12 hours where ALL crime is legal. Despite this movie being labelled as a 'Horror', it is not particularly scary. This movie has plenty of jumpy parts, bits that will surprise you, but I wouldn't class it as a Horror movie. It's more of an Action/Thriller movie. The character development is good, and you can easily form a relationship with them, whether it's love or hate. The movie is full of twists and turns around every corner which keeps everything entertaining and interesting for us. The twists are pretty unexpected and they make you think. The concept of the whole movie is really fresh and is creepy in itself. One of the best Action-Thriller movie's I've ever seen, the concept, the twists, the characters, the entire plot is flawless. The acting, especially from Rhys Wakefield is exceptional. They all deliver believable and amazing performances that enhance the film even more. Overall, I would definitely recommend this movie for any fan of Action or Thriller movies, especially for anybody interested in this kind of concept."

","This takes places in 2022. Unemployment is at 1%, crime is non-existent and everything is fine.

One family is all protected in their house--but their son lets in an unarmed man who is running from a mob that wants to kill him. The mob tells the family give him to us...or they'll all die.<br/><br/>The premise is ridiculous any way you look at it; people do REAL stupid things and the dialogue and situations are laughable...but it still works in parts. The family is likable (if dysfunctional) so you really feel for them when they're attacked; the masks the group wears are REAL creepy; the people playing psychos don't overact and there's bursts of extreme violence and blood (but not much). What I found more disturbing was my audience was cheering on the violence which was NOT the idea. Still I have to admit when two particularly vicious villains got what was coming to them I applauded.

"logan-krum","9","18","41","28 May 2013"," With some suspension of disbelief, The Purge is an excellent thriller.
","Cleansing Hollywood of its sins<br/><br/>The Purge is better than you probably expect, and you're probably already hyped for it. It's rare that a film has writing, directing, and acting work with perfect synchronization to establish a solid image for the film. It would have passed as a stirring horror/thriller based on concept alone, but it refuses to rely only on its marketable premise to attract viewer-ship. Finally, we can enjoy a horror movie without feeling like we're being baby-talked to.<br/><br/>The Purge toys with the concept of an America in which all crime (as long as it is not at the expense of a prominent government figure) is legalized for 12 hours, one night a year. During this time no help is available; police and hospitals are preoccupied hiding in their own homes. Purging night has helped whittle crime rates to a measly 1% of what it used to be, and helps Americans unleash pent-up aggression. It's a foolproof system. <br/><br/>James Sandin (Ethan Hawke, giving horror another go since his role in Sinister) makes a large profit for his family by selling security systems designated especially for the yearly occasion. When purging night arrives once more, he and his wife (Lena Headey) and two kids (Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder) prepare for an uneventful night behind the protective barriers. <br/><br/>But the beautiful thing about America is that everyone is entitled to their opinion. James' son Charlie doesn't see the humanity in purging night. When a homeless man becomes the target of a group of masked hunters who use the night to unleash their heinous (but highly educated) anger, Charlie lets him through the barrier into their home. The group of anonymous private school students targets the family for protecting the swine born to be hunted this night. ""If you had to kill someone tonight, would you?"" Charlie asks his parents. <br/><br/>Unrelentingly gripping the guileful concept, director and screenwriter James DeMonaco slides current political issues into the film. The concept is navigated from the standpoint of a typical small American neighborhood. There's sweet old Mrs. Robinson from across the street, pulling a final batch of chocolate chip cookies out of the oven and sharpening her machete for tonight. Who do you know who would take advantage of purging night, the film asks. Would you?<br/><br/>Our four heroes don't have much time to make up their minds. Morals, instincts, and beliefs clash as the family attempts to survive and retain their humanity. The acting is fantastic across the board, especially Rhys Wakefield as our charming gun happy antagonist. He's very Ledger-esque without coming across as a blatant rip off. <br/><br/>Every scene is fueled with an agenda to entertain and a different means of entertainment. Part churning and suspenseful and part heart-in-your-throat action, the film rewards with every sequence. The action scenes play well and are perhaps the most satisfying of the film, despite being nearly incoherent from frantic camera movement. The audio is recorded with raw scratchiness from the opening scene and teases its way to a climax of rending but pleasant clamor. (Maybe my position a mere five rows away from the screen made it louder than it actually was.) The over-the-top gunfights combat the film's clever subtleties well.<br/><br/>The true greatness of the film is how DeMonaco uses horror as a medium to provide social and political commentary. I don't think most horror movies can add 2 plus 2. This film could ace a calculus exam. <br/><br/>Bonus: producer and CEO of Blumhouse Jason Blum held a Q&A after the film was over. Blum is the mastermind behind horror hits such as Insidious and Paranormal Activity (and, if I was writing this in 2014, I'd most likely include The Purge on that list). Blum is a very down-to- earth and tan guy eager for The Purge to hit theaters. Someone in the crowd asked him how long the Paranormal Activity series will go on. His frank reply: ""I probably shouldn't say this Paranormal Activity will continue as long as people continue to see it."" Interesting.<br/><br/>The Purge comes out June 7. There's no doubt in my mind this quieter film can stand its ground against the extravagant CGI and chivalrous superheroes this summer. <br/><br/>9/10 stars<br/><br/>You can read the full review here: http://logankrum.wordpress.com/2013/04/26/the-purge/"

","The Purge has got to be one of the best low budget horror movie I have seen in a long time. It's an intense film that really gets the audience thinking ""what would I do"" if put in a similar situation. Despite what a lot of critics think, this film really delivers an emotional ride from start to finish. The acting and directing are superb and the storyline is quite believable.Rhys Wakefield as the leader of murdering marauders is wonderfully cast given his boyish charm and good looks combined with a wicked smile. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are great are the all American couple who really just want what everyone wants: a good family, a nice home and money. So suspend your disbelief for a while but remember to check the doors before you go to sleep!"
"lowwe22","9","6","11","16 January 2014"," surprising elements lead me to write this review
","This is my first review on this website and i feel like the purge deserves one because the film truly keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout the full run time. (contains mild spoilers) The first half of the film generally annoyed me because the dad is the only likable character and everyone turns against him.. Considering the concept of the purge is an annual day of survival/crime.. you'd think the family would be used to not letting people in when they say 'please, help me' and that the son would know the high security password the locks down the whole house.. never mind that. At this point i was quite disappointed as i really enjoyed the concept of a 'Purge day' and it felt like the idea wasn't given full justice.<br/><br/>My opinion changed however as the film developed into the second half as it explores morality and whether humans can just change for one night. I don't feel like it needed to have a crazy scene where you see the world falling to pieces.. the idea was gripping enough.. and in terms of suspense and horror- it was actually pretty good. That is why I have rated it a 9/10 because it's not often you find a really good idea paired with genuine suspense and good elements of horror.<br/><br/>Towards the end of the film i found myself shouting at the camera shots because you are dying to know what will happen to this family and all you get is slow close-ups.<br/><br/>I can't truly explain why i enjoyed this film in a written review like this but i think some may feel the same when they watch it and i don't think it's fair to judge by the IMDb rating.. just watch it with an open opinion and judge for yourself"
"Hellmant","8","6","11","10 June 2013"," Turns from horror to society message to full blown action 'home invasion film' starring Ethan Hawke!
","'THE PURGE': Four Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>Low budget horror film that killed at the box office it's opening weekend (making $36 million, for a #1 debut, on a $3 million budget). Horror is always the most profitable genre though. They're immensely popular films because everyone loves to be scared and feel disturbed at times. They also can be made on a shoestring budget, which doesn't mean much to the viewer but as a filmmaker being forced to work on a low budget forces creativity. Horror is the best genre to do this with because it lends itself to that kind of filmmaking. Coming up with cool and unique ways to scare and startle people doesn't cost a lot of money and that's what this genre is all about. 'THE PURGE' is a great example of this; it's horror done right. <br/><br/>The film was written and directed by James DeMonaco and produced by Michael Bay. It stars Ethan Hawke (who has been doing a lot of horror films these days, like last year's 'SINISTER', when he's not doing 'BEFORE SUNRISE' sequels that is). Hawke and Lena Headey play a married couple (named James and Mary Sandin) with two children. They have a son, named Charlie (Max Burkholder), and a teenage daughter, named Zoey (Adelaide Kane). The family is very well off as James sells security systems, in the year 2022. It's a single-party future where crime and poverty in America are almost non existent because the Government allows a 12-hour period, once a year, where all crime (including murder) is legal and emergency aid is suspended. The only laws are that high ranking government officials are not to be harmed and certain weaponry is forbidden (I'm assuming high powered explosives probably). The film all takes place at the home of the Sandins one night during 'the Purge', which is what the 12-hour period of lawlessness is called. When Charlie lets a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) into their secured home to protect him from a viscous gang of rich kids, led by a masked man (Rhys Wakefield, in a very creepy performance), it attracts the gang to their house. The leader threatens to kill everyone inside the house if the Sandins don't hand over the man. James knows that his security system is not without it's flaws, and the gang can break in, so he decides he must find and catch the stranger roaming around their house and hand him over. His morals, as well as his family's, are put to the test. <br/><br/>The story is reminiscent (and perhaps inspired by) an episode of the original 'STAR TREK' TV series 'The Return of the Archons', from 1967. It revolves around a world, that Kirk and crew visit, which allows a similar annual 12-hour period of lawlessness in order to keep the peace the rest of the year. This idea of purging yourself of violence so you can remain peaceful the rest of the time is an interesting psychological concept and a disturbing one to me. This 12-hour period of violence seems like too great a cost, in my opinion, even if it lowers violence overall. The premise of course is a great social allegory and like all great horror the movie is full of good social commentary. It's of course also, mainly, about 'the haves vs. the have-nots' in society; how those with less money always get screwed over. In this way the film is outstanding. Hawke and Headey are great and so is Burkholder and the scene stealing Wakefield. The directing is decent for a movie like this and the writing is probably the film's highlight. It's a great idea for a horror film (despite it's many holes). The film also offers many different genre fans something. It turns from horror to society message (which most great horror does though) to full blown action 'home invasion film', starring Ethan Hawke as it's action hero. I enjoyed it and I think most horror fans will as well. There is a psychological theory that people who watch a lot of violent films 'purge' themselves of violent thoughts as well; that the more violent films one watches the less likely they are to be violent in life. I don't know if I 100% believe that but it's an interesting idea, kind of like the one presented in this film just less much drastic.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fFfGQiMGk-4"

","I watched this movie after hearing how different it was compared to most cinema coming out of Hollywood. I will start with the general concept of the movie, it was phenomenal. A lot of creative thinking went into the one night of lawful murder, theft, and destruction. That was a bit brilliant.<br/><br/>Parts of the plot were predictable, but to those who call it ""laughable"" in that regards aren't thinking about the entire scope of the plot as there are some points that could have gone either way. A certain point does give away a ""predictable"" feel, but that wasn't enough to ruin the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the acting and the constant progressing events throughout the film, it was very well done, there are some changes I would have liked to have seen made. But due to the uniqueness of it and some of the very creepy and intelligent themes, I ranked it highly.<br/><br/>True Score: 7.5"

"asda-man","6","9","19","7 June 2013"," Consider me purged
","I may be a little bit biased in this review, because I am a horror nut who has a passion for the home invasion sub-genre. I find these films very tense, involving and thought-provoking because it could happen to anyone. Yes, it could happen to YOU! So when I saw the trailer for The Purge which seemingly burst out of nowhere I was incredibly excited! Firstly, the concept is highly original and very interesting. It's an idea I've never come across before. People have expressed concern about the annual purge just being a set-up for a home invasion movie, but the idea is extremely relevant throughout and serves to make the film even for thought-provoking. Whilst the idea, if it were really carried out, is totally bonkers and dumb, the film convincingly shows it as a good and helpful tool in helping the country that God really loves!<br/><br/>People have also expressed concern about the film showing no other purge-related events outside the Sandlin family's attack. Well here I'm going to have to disappoint you, because apart from some CCTV footage for the opening credits to play over, you don't get to see very much else at all. However, I am actually very for this decision because it makes the film much more focused and makes the audience involved with the characters, so when the attack finally does arrive, it makes everything that much more intense. It's very hard to balance a film if its concentrated in several areas, and I think it would've been a bit messy. Sorry if you wanted to see more purge action though. Perhaps they will in the sequel.<br/><br/>The lead up to the purge is done brilliantly. There's a great sense of anticipation and fear as we wait for the sirens to commence the purge. I also liked the emergency broadcast, which played out rather realistically. In fact, once the purge begins the film doesn't really stop being a tense and marvellously entertaining thrill ride. Some people say that the film isn't horror because they use guns. I'm sure if they didn't use guns people would be moaning about how it wasn't realistic because they didn't use guns! OK I admit guns were over-used because the horror hound inside me would've preferred some more decapitations with the axe and machete, but do not worry because they are still there! The film first and foremost is horror. You can't deny the creepiness of when the masked folk arrive, along with Rhys Wakefield's 'Polite Stranger'.<br/><br/>Also, the masks themselves are brilliant! They have a creepy Strangers-esque vibe to them, and certainly set the horror tone. I've never seen or heard of Rhys Wakefield in anything else before, but the former Home and Away actor puts on an extraordinarily creepy performance, evoking Michael Pitt from Funny Games US. He has a seriously scary smirk that reminded me of Heath Ledger's legendary Joker. Rhys Wakefield could've made an even more memorable villain if he was in it more. Although, he completely stole all of the scenes he was in, I would've loved to have seen him play a bigger role with more screen time.<br/><br/>The film isn't shy of throwing up moral dilemmas. It had my brain jogging about what I would in the situation, and we see a lot of interestingly dislikeable sides to Ethan Hawke's smug security expert, which isn't even strong enough to protect his own house! The final 30 minutes or so are incredibly entertaining. It's never short of a tense thrill and there is also one stand-out fight sequence that put a sadistic smile on my face (don't worry, I'm quite normal really). A nice surprising twist tops everything off and by the end of it you really do feel like you've been through quite an ordeal.<br/><br/>The Purge offers a creepy, thrilling and innovative slice of home invasion. Whilst obviously not as amazing as Inside, or even Funny Games and the remake of Mother's Day, I think I enjoyed it more than The Strangers and to compare it to a more recent horror film, I liked it about as much (or maybe ever so slightly less) than Evil Dead. The Purge certainly doesn't deserve the knocks it has been getting from a lot of people. I do think it could've been longer as I couldn't get enough of the action-packed finale, which surely isn't a bad thing is it? I enjoyed it a lot and I think a lot of horror fans are going to enjoy it too. It's an under-valued film with a fantastically original concept, which deserves more views!"

","Want to sell your scripts for a fortune? The Purge shows you how it's done. Find an easily marketable premise which grabs people's attention (""Dystopian future: one night a year, murder is legal""), and that's it - you can coast on your high-concept idea without bothering with the rest of the script. <br/><br/>Writing for The Purge could be charitably called a mess: characters are blank slates (""the father"", ""the mother"", ""the son"", ""the daughter""), its garden-variety nihilism laughable; dialogues so absurdly on the nose, they sound like a parody; and if you were surprised by a resolutive intervention near the end, you are the kind of viewer who would run away terrified from a train projected on a big screen, like the first public of brothers Lumière. The final scene, with the most awkward neighbors' reunion ever filmed, gives a new meaning to the word ""anticlimactic"" and almost achieves a kind of unintentional, sublime ridiculousness.<br/><br/>Action consists of people crawling in an inexplicably huge house in the dark - seriously, Headey moves around for like 20 minutes during the climax without stumbling into any of the ten or so intruders, or into her husband wrestling with them. For long stretches it feels like wandering into IKEA at night - dark room, furniture, furniture, new dark room - only punctuated by cheap jump scares. Compare this to Fincher's Panic Room, with its careful sense of movements and spatial relationships within the confined environment<br/><br/>Hawke and Headey are both capable performers, wasted here in roles which require alternatively either wide-eyed panic or squint-eyed determination. Perhaps the worst offender is how the high-concept sci-fi premise turns out to be irrelevant: this is essentially just another ""home invasion"" thriller, like dozens which have preceded it.<br/><br/>Watch Bryan Bertino's The Strangers instead, as it played with a similar scenario with much higher craft (in spite of its wafer-thin plot) and skillful use of pacing, framing and composition.<br/><br/>4/10"

The setup and hook was presented in such a way that you expect some action and a bit of social commentary. Quickly after ""The Purge"" begins, things start to unravel. The characters are weak, the story becomes incoherent, and the twist actually made me laugh out loud with everybody else in the theater. Like a bad ""Rosemary's Baby"". First of all, you have the young sexy daughter who is admittedly HOT. Her boyfriend decides that he'd rather kill her Dad than bang her. I think NOT... I would have banged her first. Next, you have her half-wit brother who decides to let some homeless guy into their house. Really??? I would have put his ass ""outside"" for that genius move.

He has some friends that are just as crazed, flat and ridiculously one dimensional. Together, they are able to defeat an elaborately fortified security system with nothing but a Toyota Pickup and some chain. WTF??? The story goes nowhere and falls apart completely by the end.

It does however, appeal to the mindless violence of today's youth without addressing it or offering any solution.

","The Purge (2013)<br/><br/>* 1/2 (out of 4)<br/><br/>Annoying, dumb and eventually cruel film dealing with the one day of the year when America allows you to kill anyone who want without being punished. This ""purge"" is supported by a security system seller (Ethan Hawke) and his wife (Lena Headey) but during the 12-hour period they find themselves the target of a gang of murderers. THE PURGE pretty much gave away its story during the theatrical trailer and I thought to myself that we were going to get something fresh or something that has a few interesting ideas but just didn't work. Sadly there are some interesting ideas floating around but the screenplay is simply so bad and so clichéd that it pretty much kills anything positive. The biggest problem is that the film is never scary, which is just downright disappointing. Another problem is that the film itself doesn't know what to do with its ""free day to kill"" idea. It takes a while for the viewer to warm up to this futuristic world where we can kill but as soon as you accept this ""law"" the screenplay then pulls a quick one and starts to challenge the morals of such a thing. We then get a bunch of political non-sense thrown in just to make us question the whole thing. Why sell a film on an idea and then not know where to get with it? Even more annoying is that this film contains some of the dumbest and most annoying characters in the history of cinema. Yes, the history of cinema. The couple's young son is someone I wanted to be off the screen ASAP. The daughter isn't much better but just wait until the two twists that happen. Both Hawke and Headey give good performances as does the rest of the cast. If you're expecting a horror film then you're going to be disappointed because even though there's quite a bit of violence, for the most part this is nothing more than a rip-off of STRAW DOGS but set in the future with this one ""change."" Sadly, THE PURGE just never works and in the end you're left with a major disappointment and just a cheap excuse to kill."

","So, i like the concept. +1 for the concept, it drew me to the movie and made me want to watch it.<br/><br/>The script was sheer drivel, with so many plot holes it's difficult to actually call it a script. The acting and/or directing was sub par. I cared nothing for any of the characters. There was a pretense at an internal struggle over the right and wrong of the purge, but it fell absolutely flat. No more stars for you. At least I only lost an hour and a half with this junk.<br/><br/>Seriously, Ethan Hawk's character sells security systems, and apparently does fairly well at it. So just where does he get his ninja powers? How many people does he manage to kill? Same with his wife. Secretly studying karate? What makes it believable?<br/><br/>Worse than that were the kids. Their kids are idiots. And, if your kids are idiots, it just makes sense to give your idiot son the code to unlock your house, right? ""Here son, go hide in the basement, but make sure to wave your flashlight around so you can be easily found by the people that want to kill us, okay?"" The idiot daughter has an idiot boyfriend that thinks he's going to endear himself to his girlfriend by trying to kill her father. Yeah, that works.<br/><br/>And then there's the guy that smiles all the time. Maybe the best character of them all, but come on. He's on a time constraint to get his purge on. Go find the next homeless victim. Oh, I forgot, you're supposed to be crazy.<br/><br/>James DeMonaco lets his characters fall victim to the overdone mode of stupidly and blindly striking out on their own, getting attacked, and calling it suspense. Sometimes that works (like maybe Scream, Blair Witch Project, or Bruce Campbell flicks.) Here the characters just seem stupid.<br/><br/>Doesn't it make sense to have a safe room to fall back to just in case that really expensive and easily defeated whole house system is defeated? Would they really not think to test the defense system against a truck with a chain attached to it? Would they not think to have a 12 hour power backup system, like maybe a battery? If you're rich enough to afford it, wouldn't you have insisted on the optional lethal force external perimeter installation? Movie doesn't work anymore? REWRITE IT GODDAM IT!<br/><br/>Oh yeah, now we better circle back to the crazy neighbor we introduced at the beginning of the movie, can't forget that. What's up with the religious/political chanting? The cult of the purge? Another interesting idea, but the script just couldn't pull it off. It just seemed silly. And poorly written. And poorly directed. And poorly acted.<br/><br/>A sequel? Sure, why not. Written and directed by the same guy? Nope, I don't think so. Call me when you get someone who can write and direct."

And she just lets this boy sneak in her room whenever, so surprise when the purge starts he's in her room. And his purpose? To kill her father...really?<br/><br/>Then there's the whole purge idea, so the idea is there's. 12 hour period where everyone can just go around committing crimes, then magically they'll just stop what they are doing in the midst of killing at 7 am and go back to their regular lives.<br/><br/>When I say this movie is absurd and just bad I'm not exaggerating.

"estebangonzalez10","4","4","7","20 August 2013"," Home-invasion thriller that fails to establish scares
","""Our target for this year's purge is hiding in your home. You have one hour to find him and give him to us or we will kill all of you. We will be coming in.""<br/><br/>In my opinion The Purge failed both as a home invasion thriller and as a social satire towards American society. It didn't work as a thriller because I never felt tension or chills during the invasion. I didn't really care for the characters in this film and it didn't bother me either way if they survived or didn't. The characters were just too dumb and commit too many mistakes, while the villains felt cartoonish at times and the psychological terror never worked like it did in The Strangers for example. The film did manage to make a respectful amount of money at the box-office so unfortunately a sequel is already in the works. The premise of this story was beyond ridiculous and director/screenwriter James DeMonaco (The Negotiator and Assault on Precinct 13) never managed to sell the futuristic story to me. I don't see a future America acting according to this law. Critics might say this wasn't meant to be real, rather more of a social satire. Well in that case it didn't work either because other films like The Hunger Games managed to make a more believable satire on today's society than The Purge did. This film tries to create cheap thrills that never work and is full of cliché moments and one dimensional characters who we really never care for. Whatever moral statement DeMonaco was trying to make I wasn't really feeling it. He kind of made a similar movie to Assault on Precinct 13 although this time he incorporated the home invasion element instead of the prison. He even had Ethan Hawke star in that film as well. The Purge doesn't have to make sense if it really achieves its goal in scaring the audience but it doesn't and therefor one begins over thinking the plot. The Purge is lazy filmmaking and a very forgettable one. <br/><br/>The film takes place in 2020 and in order to combat violence the American government has allowed an annual twelve hour period in which all criminal activity is permitted (including murder). They call this day ""the purge"" because they believe that this way all citizens can release the tension they've kept inside during the year. In reality the people who are more vulnerable are the poor who can't defend themselves or lock themselves in their home. This way America has prospered as a society and the criminal rate is practically non existent. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is one of those citizens who has benefited from the purge because as a security salesman he has made a lot of money selling his product. He and his family are safe thanks to the advanced security system in his home. His wife Mary (Lena Headey) and two children Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane) are locked down in their home as the purge is about to begin. It seems like it is going to be a safe night for them, but when Charlie decides to help out a stranger (Edwin Hodge) and lets him in his home things begin to get complicated for the Sandins. Will they be able to survive the night? Suddenly they don't feel safe after all.<br/><br/>The thrills in this film are extremely cheap and every scene seems perfectly staged. Nothing about the film feels real and the characters are far from being real human beings who we can identify with. Ethan Hawke in the lead role gives one of his worst performances to date and the kids in this film are both terrible (the characters they play, not their performance), they make one stupid decision after another. The dialogue doesn't work either and the villains in this film are a joke. Rhys Wakefield tries to play a villain in a similar way as Heath Ledger played the Joker but it really didn't work at all. Even the continuity in this film is a mess. Everything happens in one night and Ethan Hawke starts off with a clean shave and halfway through the movie he has a goatee. The other problem I had with this film is that these rich people instead of spending so much money on a security system could've simply left the country for one day and returned without having to worry about anything. These sort of things I probably wouldn't have questioned if the thrills would've worked, but since the film begins to drag and feel dull you begin to question things. The Purge doesn't live up to other home invasion thrillers and I'm afraid that as a satire it doesn't say anything new about society's culture and obsession over violence. After this movie is over with you will want to purge yourself of the memory of having spent 85 minutes watching this unimaginative film."

With a great story idea, cast & crew give a valiant effort of trying to elevate this film to a respectable level. That being said I, truly, wish I could complement this film more. But, regrettably, I can't. This was/is a great example of the trailer being better then the final product. The concept was intriguing and made me (and $36million worth of sales thus far) turn out for this one. Sadly, the film doesn't live up to the clever premise. From typical clichés, weak character development and ""writing into a corner"" this viewer was left frustrated and bored. It's movies like this that make me realize the delicate balance it really takes to make any film truly take off. Unfortunately, this one barely gets off the launching pad. Get ready though.

","It's nice to know that in just nine short years - at least according to this film's opening narrative - that unemployment will be just one percent and the crime rate will be practically negligible. That will certainly be good news for our next president during his or her second term.<br/><br/>Of course, the reason for these statistics is that once a year all heck breaks loose and all criminal activity is allowed, including murder, rape, arson and assault. Evidently, top scientists have claimed that such annual mayhem has curbed the natural human instinct for violence the other 364 days of the year.<br/><br/>Directed by James DeMonaco (""Staten Island, Little New York""), ""The Purge,"" sort of a ""Straw Dogs"" meets ""Panic Room"" amalgamation, tells the tale of events in the not too distant future where ""the new Founding Fathers"" (whatever THAT means) have established an almost Utopian society based upon this logic that if ""the Beast"" is released, then the basic good of the individual will shine through (after he has bludgeoned his neighbor's family to a pulp, however).<br/><br/>After the explanation of the 12-hour event, we are introduced to the Sandin family, dad James (Ethan Hawke, who once was nominated for an Academy Award for ""Training Day""), mom Mary (Lena Headey, ""Game of Thrones"" TV series), slutty daughter Zoe (Adelaide Kane, ""Goats"") and dimwitted son Charlie (Max Burkholder, ""Friends With Money"").<br/><br/>A wealthy home security system expert, James is quite busy this time of year and has just been named the top salesman of his company. His daughter could care less, however, as she has secreted her goofy boyfriend, Henry (Tony Oller, ""Beneath The Darkness"") - who seems to have sinister plans of his own - in her bedroom. Once the crime spree begins, James locks down his home and bolts his family in and expects to ride things out as the bloodletting run its course.<br/><br/>However, a movie like this cannot just run its course and soon enough, the dullard Charlie violates every precept of intelligence and credibility by letting a possible victim (Edwin Hodge, the remake of ""Red Dawn"") of the night's carnage into the home. This causes a series of unfortunate events to take place, including the arrival of what looks like cast members from a community theater troupe of ""Rocky Horror Picture Show"" led by the ""Polite Leader"" (Rhys Wakefield, ""Sanctum"") who now demand the escapee be turned over or the family faces certain death.<br/><br/>This is because the group somehow has the means and equipment to break through all of the Sandin's sophisticated and intricate security systems and blockades. This revelation then begs the question, that if the villains can do this to the Sandin home, why not just pull down everyone's walls and barriers and really do some damage in the exclusive neighborhood instead of chasing down a solitary homeless bum.<br/><br/>Film then turns from a quasi-political statement on left wing tolerance of crime and right-wing paranoia into your basic home invasion/slaughter flick with James arming everyone in his clan (with several convenient weapons) and making his stand against a dozen or more crazed psychopaths.<br/><br/>Here, the brutality reaches fever pitch with shotgun blasts, stabbings, beatings with pool cues and other assorted cruelty handed out full measure. Thank goodness many of these scenes were filmed in Ray Charles-Vision, coming out so dark, grainy and obscured by quick-cut and confusing camera action that few viewers could tell just what was going on anyway.<br/><br/>And, despite an interesting concept, the execution falls flat, the direction becomes substandard and the acting approaches ""Paranormal Activity"" level (although Wakefield seems to have a little fun with his too short villain's role). Especially at fault in that last department is Burkholder, who spends most of the picture playing with a remote control tank/video camera contraption and starring expressionless into the camera.<br/><br/>Yet, I suppose if there is one positive thing about ""The Purge,"" it's that the picture runs a mercifully short 85 minutes, allowing the cinema patron to see this mess as quickly as possible before moving on to more important and interesting diversions - such as washing dishes, picking up after your dog had an accident and watching beige paint dry."

","I can't believe people would even say that the premise of the movie is intriguing, plausible, or even remotely realistic. Come on!

"rgkarim","Null","7","15","7 June 2013"," To Purge or Not too Purge...
","Ever been so angry you wanted to murder someone? Apparently director James Demonaco has because today's review is all about the latest horror/thriller to grace the movie theater entitled The Purge. The concept of this is intriguing in which every year for twelve hours the government legalizes all crime, including murder. Such an idea allows for an ultimate game of cat and mouse, which if done right could allow for some scares and spine chills Of course with the countless horror movies that seem to pop up every month, it's hard to find one that is actually worth a trip to the theater. Has this movie scored a place in the hall of horror fame? Read on to find out.<br/><br/>Despite the promises of the trailer, the Purge was not as exciting/interesting as I had hoped it would be. The explanation for the festival of the beast is rather lame as it really involves feeding the psychopath's hunger while also serving as population control. Yet for a horror movie the plot is often not what people go for, it is more so the scare factor. I'll give this movie one thing it has diversity in their attempts to terrorize the audience. For those who like a good jump, this movie has plenty of ear drum shattering sounds to try to make your body jump. The quiet halls of the house with the steady breathing of the characters sets it up perfectly, and if you don't see it coming then the sudden discharge or appearance of a hunter might make you squeal. Those who are immune to this tactic have another challenge to face though in which they are to resist the creepiness of the dark. Early on in the film the power gets cut, casting a veil of shadows in every room that seems to suck the all light and sound out. Seeing as the halls are rather spacious, well the simple suburban setting becomes a hunting ground that has you wondering what is behind every corner, until it gets overdone. Finally the last factor comes in the form of how realistic these killers are, for The Purge has ditched the zombified chainsaw wielders, aliens, and supernatural murderers for average people. While these killers are indeed overacted, more on that later, there is still something that sends chills down your spine when the killing crew arrives, especially those odd masks. <br/><br/>Although I applaud their diversity though, the movie has a lot of downfalls that counter the angle they tried to take. For one thing, they overdo a lot of the scare attempts that it becomes rather boring and predictable. How many times am I supposed to be freaked out by a mask man or woman getting a close up? As for the darkness of the house, well that gets old too, because the size of the house is ridiculous and they tend to revisit the same rooms numerous times to again get things stale. Yet the biggest thing that I got tired of was the fact that the same dilemma happened not once, not twice, but at least three times in the movie. Kids ran off into the dark, the dad and mom got into shouting arguments, and I the constant monitor watching made it feel like I was in Safe house except without as good of acting. <br/><br/>Despite the challenges this movie had though, there were some very symbolic messages in the qualities of movie setting. Perhaps the biggest message was the animalistic and barbaric nature that can overcome any human. The evolution of the characters into releasing their savage side as the situation gets worse brings up the question of how much does it take to give in. A battle of morals and ethics is fought at various points, mainly between the youngest member of the family and the adults who are years older than him. While a bit cheesy, overacted, and sometime pathetic, the points they raise are ones that many of us should continue to examine ourselves. Unfortunately a piece of you might die with this film as well, especially when the torturing and soulless decisions come on screen that, for this reviewer anyway, made me not only uncomfortable but pitying a lot of characters. Pushing past the morals and tests of whether or not you have a conscious the ending revs up the excitement to finish the movie fairly strong. There is some action, a few scenes that make you cheer, and some nice ties to the loose ends that form over the course of the movie, though it is not too hard to guess what is coming. <br/><br/>Finally I'd like to make a few comments on the acting of this movie. In a nutshell most of the characters/ parts are rather shallow and simple involving nothing more than screaming, crying, and occasionally some actual dialog. Ethan Hawke was one of the better roles, had a combination of elegance and ruggedness needed for his transition. Max Burkholder was the moral driver of the story, and played the frightened kid who had a strong moral obligation to do the right thing. Rhys Wakefield had the creepy and psychotic role down pat, and despite how polite his character was, managed to drive some anger towards his character, which was I believe the intended goal. As for the rest of the cast, some aren't bad, and many of the killers/hunters are very disappointing, who at first are creepy but quickly devolve into mentally imbalanced teenagers who get rather annoying. <br/><br/>In a nutshell, The Purge isn't necessarily the scariest thing to grace the screen. Those looking for a more realistic thriller will get their fill, but if you're looking for a quality film, avoid this until it hits Redbox. My scores for the following are: Horror/Thriller/SCi-fi: 5.5 Movie Overall: 4.0"

","Let me start off by saying, I have never seen a good plot develop in a film that's only an hour and 25 minutes long. It's just not possible. This was ultimately The Purge's major downfall.<br/><br/>With such a creative idea came a bit of story development for the beginning of the film, which took a decent chunk of time. By the time that we had a plot going, the movie was nearly over. They got a few jumps and scares in, and before we knew it, the movie had ended.<br/><br/>To put it simply, the writers came up with a brilliant idea for the movie. However, once they introduced the storyline of ""The Purge"", the creativity was thrown out, and we just started watching another typical home invasion movie, similar to ""The Strangers"". After the commencement of The Purge began, all fun ideas were shot out the window, and we were left with a typical scary movie.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it was the film's only fault (although that is a HUGE fault). The acting was decent. The scares and the action were quite enjoyable. There were quite a few moments where the audience screamed and shouted and even cheered for the characters. However, when the credits started rolling, I could tell people felt cheated that the film didn't bring as much originality as expected."

","Who wrote that synopsis, did they even see the film?! Good idea maybe but this film is dire! Crap is too generous! The film appears to set up a number of tensions: adolescent v adult, Jones v Smiths within a middle class neighborhood, rich v poor. Yet all of these dissolve far too quickly with no real exploration of these sources of conflict. The bloody stranger has potential for real development but the opportunity is missed (race, class, back story, human contact....) Some scary moments but most of the cinema audience I was in opted for seeing it as comedy/farce. Not scary, not clever, not even particularly interesting in the end.

I still purchased a ticket to view this film, and my god this movie was perfect in almost every aspect. It has it all, great actors, a great premiss, great storytelling, great drama, some intense moments, suspense and overall a blast to sit through, the whole point behind the film is that allowing people unleash their anger may lower crime rate and unemployment and make America better all around, it makes people more evil and more blood thirsty then ever before. That allowing evil for even just one night, makes us worse people than we were to begin with. Great story. Superb film."

The IMDb rate is 5,5 but i am sure that in a few weeks it will reach something around 2.

"jcaraway3","3","3","5","29 March 2014"," A victim of it's own poor writing
","The story, though extremely far fetched, could have made a very good dystopian sci fi horror flick. Unfortunately, this film takes that idea and goes nowhere with it. We never find out who these mysterious New Founding Fathers are or how such a law could have been passed in such a short time. On the other hand, the film's main villain, the ""Polite Leader"" is laughably one dimensional and shallow. Thanks to this character's ridiculously cheesy opening dialog, we know exactly what he and his friends want within 2 minutes of screen time. Any possible social commentary this film was trying to convey becomes lost in the awful script and wooden performances of most of the cast. Now, let's talk about the climax. My God, what a ""I'm the screenwriter and this is the big twist I pulled out of my you-know-what"" ending. Let me ""spoil"" it for you. The neighbors all gang up on our heroes and attempt to ""purge"" them themselves. Why? Well, because they got rich selling them expensive home security systems, that's why! Sorry, did I miss something? They traded their money for a product they wanted, and they're so mad about it that they would kill because of it? Basically, they're jealous they're not making as much money as our heroes, though they are clearly in the same basic financial situation as them, as they live in the same neighborhood. I'm sorry, but even for a movie like this, that makes no sense! Anyway, the movie kind of fizzles out after that, and the audience is left to ponder just how bad the effects of a ""Purge"" would be, though most people who saw the film would know such a law would be a bad idea in the first place. <br/><br/>While ""The Purge"" features some good action sequences, I found myself too distracted by the incredibly inane characters and ridiculous plot twists to care. Also, that robotic baby thing was clearly lifted from ""Toy Story"". Also, the masks were lame. Seems like if it's legal to kill all these people, you wouldn't need to hide your identity, and might make you really sweaty too."

","I went to the cinema to watch The Purge with my partner, and we both came out disappointed. We both had high expectations for this film, with the original and good sounding concept.<br/><br/>I thought that the beginning of the film, maybe 30 minutes into it, was half decent. Actually it was pretty much as soon as the masked people came into it, that I thought it was decent. But of course that didn't last, as soon as you see them masked you see them unmasked pretty much straight away. I thought the masks was creepy and wonderful and as soon as it comes off, I thought they rushed into the unmasking themselves. <br/><br/>But the creepiness of the girl in the white dress, whistling and humming whilst skipping around swinging around an axe in her hand made the film interesting for me, whenever she was on the screen, (not often enough). <br/><br/>The ending of the film, was very disappointing, I didn't quite understand it. I think James DeMonaco knew that the beginning of his film would grasp the attention from a selection of their viewers, and didn't bother with the rest of the film. <br/><br/>*HUGE SPOILER*<br/><br/>If people just come into your house, tried to kill you and did kill your husband, the father of your children; would you just sit them around a table in silence and wait for the night to be over?

Just about everything about this movie is dumb and lacks common sense in every way possible. To the point, even for a slasher popcorn flick it get annoying. And there is hardly any tension, and things just zoom by way to quickly. Maybe it's because, everyone wields guns for the most part. Even the twist at the end is just kinda random and not believable. Besides the concept and idea, nothing else stands out. Mainly because the premise and idea, is just on the sides and didn't seem very important when it comes to the core of the plot. And thus becomes a narrow, dull and cheap slasher flick. The villains in this seems like something inspired from the Manson family and from the film ""The Strangers"". And the leader of the pack reminded me of a young John Malkovich. But they are just not all that intimidating. Maybe because they just lacked that mystery and because they are all mostly incompetent. I just couldn't buy any of the characters in this movie, they are all mostly over the top and crazy. Overall this is just a dull, dumb and cheap slasher flick.

"davemoore3","8","3","5","26 June 2013"," This is not a ""thriller""...it's a statement
","Much of the criticism I've read about ""The Purge"" is due to viewers taking the film literally as a thriller/Sci-Fi piece. Despite the action being contained within a relatively confined space,this movie is not 'Panic Room'. In the fashion of The Hunger Games, The Purge is an illustration of the subtly horrifying means by which a malevolent government can manipulate the society which is dependent on it. The Hunger Games accomplishes the power of the government by fear, deprivation, and intimidation. The only way to gain more of life's necessities and comforts is by allowing our children to be entered multiple times in the horrific lottery for the equally horrifying ""games"" sanctioned by those in power as punishment for a previous rebellion.. The Purge establishes this same control in a more subtle, but just as repressive fashion by allowing the privileged and most resourceful to prey upon the weaker and poorer members of society in a Darwinian 12 hour stretch when almost all rules are abated. Notice the statement early on where the commentator reminds the citizenry that high-ranking politicians are exempt. The Purge is a small metaphor on where we may be headed without checks and balances in the hands of the populace at large. While the result is universally insidious,some of it is subtle, like the comments by the neighbors and the way in which the coming night of mayhem is accepted as routine, and some is rather 'ham-handed', like the speeches by the ""polite stranger"" in the prep school blazer. The Purge, like '1984' and 'Fahrenheit 451' before it, further shows what can happen when the line between government edicts and religion tenet is blurred to the point where political ideals take on a religious fervor. The sanctioned criminality takes on the cathartic form of a religious cleansing. The viewer is very effectively placed between the murderous zealots at the door and the homeless victim, making the same choices as the family. Do we ultimately choose what the government tells us we should do or what our humanity tells us what we should do. This is quite a cautionary tale, very effectively executed (no pun intended), with props to Ethan Hawke, who basically carried the film, and the viewer, on his back. Recommended."

","Were to start with The Purge..<br/><br/>Firstly, For this film that was said to be from the makers of paranormal activity and sinister, what a disappointment.The purge in my opinion has what you would think a 'good' concept to it, An Just by the thought of there being one day in the whole year were every crime is legal, You would think they would have done something just a bit more with this film.<br/><br/>The beginning was almost as-if the writers just couldn't be bothered to give us any background knowledge of the family. it seemed as though whilst your watching the film that there's a few second of slow moving at the beginning and then BAM, straight into action! Every time there was a slight climax were You thought this film is about to perk up and possibly even start getting half good, the peek would just be a shamble of bad over Exaggerated acting and and no real exciting horror that would force you to look away. The only part that i could even remember making me slightly turn my head was the pressing of the wound on the fugitive that entered their home, and even that slice of action could be found on an episode of Casualty.<br/><br/>For me, i was expecting a bit more for this very short lived film and Would have at least liked to be slightly scared as i was by paranormal activity and sinister! Its defiantly more thriller than horror! The ending was very predictable and lets be fair, We all knew the fugitive would be saved at the end by the family as this film is showing that maybe even high class people have at least some consideration for the poor. Even though maybe just maybe she could have offered him a home at their house at the end, Yunno giving the fact that he did just save their lives, maybe IM asking for a bit much.<br/><br/>But all in all maybe i did have a pessimistic attitude before even going into this film because the plot is so UNREALISTIC that it almost put me off even before hand, This plot is something that would NEVER EVER happen. But others might enjoy this film :)"

This attracts the purgers to there house as they want to kill this man and they are willing to do anything to do so.

In the final scene we see the stranger they saved come back to save them and keep the neighbour hostage until the purge ends.<br/><br/>The film had tones of potential to be a great hit with a unique storyline this defiantly grabbed my attention however fail to deliver for several reasons for me. The lack of purge action we actually got to see made the film lack realism as i believe if this would happen in are country today no matter what community we live in purgers would be out in mass however in this film we see only one gang targeting one family. Another reason is that the film was to predictable with the stalling of killings leading to the main characters to survive once again this was repeated several times in the film which really made me loose the feeling that family won't die which is something the audience need in order for them to enjoy the film.<br/><br/>The acting in film was not the best as the main purger gang member i thought tried to duplicate the joker by doing actions like sniffling his nose, dramatic head turns and slick back hair. This film needed a bigger budget so they could of used a bigger names which could of pulled of the more menacing act out with out making it feel cheesy.<br/><br/>Overall i didn't enjoy this film and wouldn't recommend you to watch this film as the storyline isn't as exciting as the trailer makes out to be lacks the action it claims and is predictable at times."

The acting , especially by Ethan Hawk , Lena Heady , and Rhys Wakefield are strong and you do believe them in their roles. The family decision making is so bad that there were many cringe-worthy moments that were just unbelievable.

I have a friend named Leighton , who got offended watching the movie because it it's a illogical plot which doesn't make any sense and even if it exists as a movie it is still illogical. There are also many plot holes throughout the entire movie: How come we live in a world where it's all legal for 12 hours? , The new Founding Fathers aren't this insane and psychopathic , that they will allow this to happen , it brings more chaos and destruction than happiness and peace which they made it out to be, American people can't live in peace after their loved ones are killed out in the streets like that , and the dad , who is so rich doesn't have back-up generator in his Mansion. The neighbors thing really ruined the movie for me and the idea of the New Founding Fathers really exaggerated it for me . So, I give the Purge 1 star only for Ethan Hawke."

","The basic idea of 'The Purge' is not too bad and, in a better film, would have been entertaining and interesting to watch. Sadly 'The Purge' is not that film. The home invasion thriller genre may have been done to death but it's still a personal favourite of mine. Home invasions always seem scary no matter how many times you've seen it before but the main feeling 'The Purge' leaves you is not terror or tension but a lack of belief and mild boredom.<br/><br/>Although it contains a few good sequences 'The Purge' is generally poorly executed. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey do their best to ham things up but the script itself is poorly written. We are asked to believe in and root for the characters but they make so many stupid decisions each and every scene that it's hard to like them, or even dislike them. Instead I just didn't care. Their emotions too seem almost always out of kilter with the events of the preceding film, a problem that hardly helps to build tension for the situation. <br/><br/>Much of any home invasion film's tension derives from the characters making use of their house and its space but in 'The Purge' the house seems inordinately large, even for a rich family in the suburbs. Throughout the film I felt myself asking the question, how big is this house? I know American houses are large but is it really this big?<br/><br/>'Purge's' other main problem is its message. Instead of subtly posing questions and answers or calling our attention to the real life social implications of the film's basic premise writer-director James DeMonaco decides to hit you over the head repeatedly with a large brick from the very opening of the film."

","First of all, the premise alone is so unbelievable. Suppose it were legal to commit crimes during a 12 hour window once a year. Who'd be dumb enough to risk to go outside, even if you hated someone so bad you wanted to kill them? Basically, it's 12 hours of lawlessness, yet the movie still tries to convey that people will have SOME loyalty. E.g. most will kill poor people but not in their own communities. But would you really trust anyone except your family during these 12 hours?<br/><br/>Second, it assumes that crime will drop from it. That is completely unrealistic and ignores all crimes of passion. But yeah, those people will just think: No wait, there'll be a day where I can do this legally, let's calm down and wait!"". Crime would never go down. Battery, homicide, etc. would still happen.<br/><br/>Third: This premise is not new at all. It's basically how it was in Europe in the middle ages with the feud ""system"". If the ""purge"" was real, it would be the same. Suppose person A kills person B during purge. Family of B would probably seek revenge the same night or next purge. It would escalate between families. Until the government would just say ""F it and let's establish the old system again"". There's a reason that we have the law system we have today and not the one from the middle ages. A purge is utterly nonsense.<br/><br/>That leads to the next point: This purge would be way too inefficient. Imagine the clean up they'd have to do. Police, Hospitvals, Fire Departements etc. would be way busy with the aftermath of it. And what about all the people killed who had jobs? Businesses would probably have to search for new employees after every purge."

","The idea of the movie is that the government decided to give the right to the citizen to do whatever they want for 12 hr every year... why?? well who cares, it's a movie and it is supposed to entertain us. The idea might not entertain a lot of people but you can always do a beautiful job and entertain them with the execution of the idea. Personally I find this idea to be a good material for a movie.<br/><br/>It's 2017 and i watched it 4 years after the release, so during all these years i have been hearing about it from different people and i have been imagining what i will be watching. I expected to see chaos, people killing each other for the fun of it, people trying to rob a bank or a jewelry stores or some crazy idea that i haven't thought of but instead we got a movie of a crazy lunatic drugged (most probably) teenagers who are going to break into the house with a security system (a very bad one btw) to get one man. I mean maybe it would happen, but would the audience want to know about it?? (I wouldn't). And while trying to get their revenge they do it in a funny way, I'm sure it would have taken them a couple of minutes to finish the job and go kill someone else but no! Let's be stupid and get killed stupidly.<br/><br/>I think the idea of the purge night is a good one for a movie. But this movie didn't execute the idea in a good manner and focused on the dumb side of a story that could have been told in a much better way.<br/><br/>I don't know why but i'm going to watch the next one maybe it will be executed better."
"magscadar","5","2","3","14 November 2016"," An exercise in poor taste
","Starting out with a silly basic premise of allowing anarchy to reign unchecked for 12 hours once a year, this film has reasonably decent performances from its cast but is sold out by generally dull writing and consistently mediocre and uninspired direction. The idea that crime can be controlled by allowing a free-for-all one night a year is ridiculous, and it says much about a society which is so incapable of controlling itself that it needs to resort to a purge instead of finding healthy ways to channel aggression.<br/><br/>The writer/director relies far too much on stupid choices made by the characters (I counted four from the son before I just stopped counting) for his plot twists, and also far too much on last second saves of someone's life when all seems to be lost (again, I counted four separate incidents before I stopped counting). The cast works hard, but there's zero chemistry between the parents and nothing but smirking, mincing lunacy from the main antagonist. The fixed, passive-aggressive grins as everyone wishes everyone a safe night became simply annoying.<br/><br/>People who don't mind a bit of barely-motivated gore and violence will likely enjoy this without caring about the poor quality. People who want some intelligence in the films they watch would do better to look elsewhere."

The Purge is a twenty-thirteen horror slash political thriller brought you by the people who gave us great modern horror classics such as Paranormal Activity 4(SUCKS!),Sinister(Best horror film in years).This film will change everything you know about horror movies,one critic called this movie ""The most important horror movie ever"" and I strongly agree with him or her. Oh my goodness I can't take it anymore, I tried, I really, really tried, The Purge is the worst movie ever! This movie should have it's name changed to wasted potential or maybe the purse,since you know the year it came the audience put all there hard-earned money into it which is sad really. When I say this movie made money I mean it made a house load of money. The Premise is that all crime is legal for one night a year which sounds interesting,so naturally just for that concept anyone would see this horror flick,but then we have it turn into a generic slasher where Ethan is playing well hell I don't remember his characters name because characters, what characters? He crated a house defense system for his and other homes during purge night,but when a random homeless man is outside begging for help his son let's him in. Oh boy doesn't win the child of the year award for stupid. Their is a cult waiting for this homeless man to be delivered to them so they can purge. But the problem with the concept is while realistic,stupid realistic cause it's stupid but it could happen, how could they justify such an idea? One night a year anyone can kill anyone for funzies. How did this get started?, in a politically correct world like ours especially in America how would they get away with something like that? and lastly how did the government come up with this idea? The setting isn't even all that cause while it is a realistic house in a somewhat nice neighborhood, it's just lame and boring this movie has no fun it tries to be way too serious and fails miseberly? None of the elements of a good horror film are in this movie,setting lame,concept cool but at the same time tries to be taken way too seriously and is pretty stupid,acting well like I said what characters? I give The Purge a half out of five."

Ethan in particular, was pretty bad in this film. The wife, Headley, ditto bad. Best acting was done by Bloody Stranger - Edwin Hodge.

","I have seen the Purge films the wrong way round having seen The Purge: Anarchy first and rather liked the film although it was not entirely original.<br/><br/>This is the original written and directed by James DeMonaco and stars Ethan Hawke in a future America which has reduced employment and violent crime through the annual purge where almost anything goes between evening and dusk for 12 hours. The sequel and this are unconnected although they seem to share a minor character.<br/><br/>Hawke is a home security sales executive, rather handy to protect oneself from Purge night and has made a lot of money from selling the security system to his neighbours as one of them remarks to him jealously.<br/><br/>Hawke lives in an affluent neighbourhood with his wife, sulky teenage daughter and young son. They expect to be safe from the Purge however Hawke is not happy that his daughter is seeing an older boy who sneaks into her bedroom and decides that tonight is the night to have a serious talk with the overprotective father.<br/><br/>However things get manic when his young son lets in to the house a homeless black stranger who is on the run from a mob of rich kids who are hunting this man as their prey for Purge night. Hawke is given an ultimatum by the rich kids to throw the stranger out or else they will attack the family. Problem is the stranger is hiding in the house and Hawke does not know where he is and the rich kids are ready to attack his fortress.<br/><br/>Hawke starred in the remake of Assault on Precinct 13 which DeMonaco wrote. You know this is really the plot of the original Assault on Precinct 13. It's the fortress under siege plot. There are a few twists here and there and lot of its incredulous. The sulky daughter is a dimwit if she thinks the boyfriend just wants to talk to the dad on Purge night. It's never made clear why the boy was let loose on this night of all nights on his own with the security controls.<br/><br/>The family should also had taken more notice of his neighbours and realised they are not exactly the most popular people in the area. In fact the house did not seem to be very secure at all given how the boyfriend could casually sneak in to the daughter's bedroom.<br/><br/>Still DeMonaco retooled the film for its sequel which made for a better film, it also gave it more social commentary than this one."

","Where can i start... this is a horror movie that came out a few year ago and it star two actors that i very much like, Lena Headey and Ethan Crow. Ethan is from Training Day and classic like Daybreakers. Lena is from Game of Throne and Dredd and umm 300, sadly. But anyway I still like both actor and I would watch a movie for their performance alone because I like them. But this movie I did not really at first know they were in this movie, I look it up and want to see it because the premise seem to be original and scary. <br/><br/>a movie where the story goes like this; one day out of a year is chosen by Obama to have nothing but crime on the streets and the day is called the purge so basically criminals can crime and killers can kill and is for 24 hour I think or may be 12 I am not sure. So I go, okay, so this happen and then main character in their home get attacked by these criminals and killers. But they have nice security system and gates so they keep themself protected but somehow killer still get into house. So I close trailer and go wooow i need to see this. i eventually find movie and i watch it. I hate it. <br/><br/>I hate movie. Is so cynical and immoral. not very scary, cheap scares and super violent and also the killers are played by terrible actor who over act and do not bring in subtleness to it. characters in it are annoying and I do not care for them even though something bad is happen to them. This movie makes you feel very disconnect from emotion and from characters and what is going on. The plot and the premise make human look very evil and is to immoral and cynical. I hate movie because it try to be so edgy and dark but it come off like a college kid who has read an article about violence for first time suddenly go, ""oh no world is so bad humans are so evil they need to be wiped out"" and they have this laughable idea about humanity. its very unmature script. This movie is similar to Eden Lake in one way, because it made me angry after finishing it. Eden Lake was realistic but this movie was very very very silly and stupid so is made me angry and nothing redeeming about it. I hate this movie so much."

They're the target audience...<br/><br/>Nothing to like about this movie (except Adelaide Kane...)"
"SnoopyStyle","6","2","3","3 May 2014"," Interesting horror premise needs to be worked out more
","It's 2022 in America. Unemployment is at 1% and crime is at an all-time low except one night every year. The law allows many forms of crime including even murder in that 12 hour period. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) sells home security and is having his best year. He has gathered his family (Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, Adelaide Kane) to wait out the night. Things don't turn out well starting with the daughter's boyfriend. Then the son allows a vagrant to enter their house who is followed by a mob intend on killing that homeless person.<br/><br/>The premise is interesting and original reminding me of Sparta and the Helots. It's certainly a good way to get into a horror movie. However there are a lot of aspects that went uninvestigated in this movie. Everybody has enemies and it's an obvious avenue to go for. For example, he's the best salesman which seems to me to be an obvious reason for other co-workers to kill him. Writer/director James DeMonaco just didn't think through all the possibilities in this world.<br/><br/>The obvious fix is to make the purge be only against the poor and the helpless. There could be rules about harboring the hunted. The family lets in that homeless guy which could make them fair game. I'm willing to not harp on it but I must deduct a point for the mistake.<br/><br/>When the power goes out, the darkness is not a good way to shoot a film. However when the mob gets vehicles which could light up the house, the lighting looks good. All the light and shadows provide great horror opportunities. I wish more of the movie take place in that lighting scheme.<br/><br/>Another missed opportunity is the ticking clock. It could have been a great vehicle for raising the tension. Instead the movie wastes this away by sitting around to run out the clock. It's not the most compelling climax.<br/><br/>It's a great original premise with loads of opportunities. With a few more tweaks, this could be a great horror franchise. It has a built-in morality play. The premise doesn't even need any one particular character to carry it either. This could run for a long time if they put in a few fixes."

","I remember I first heard about this film in an ad before a YouTube video. It started with a voice-over said ""Don't skip this ad. You are about to see the trailer for the most disturbing movie of the year."" That was a bold statement, considering Evil Dead had already come out and The Conjuring was right around the corner. So naturally, I was curious and didn't skip the ad. One of the first things I noticed was that Ethan Hawke was in the film. I am a fan of Ethan Hawke, and since he was in Sinister a few months prior (one of the scariest films I've ever seen), I was even more curious. Then I noticed the interesting premise about all crime being legal for 24 hours, and as I sat and watched the trailer, I thought ""You know, this movie has a lot of potential if they do it right...""<br/><br/>Finally, June arrived and the release date came along, so I saw the film. I was surprised to see a lot of awful acting, bad directing, and a poorly written story. Any and all potential that this premise had was completely wasted. The filmmakers took the premise and did the laziest thing possible: they made it into a cheap slasher flick. The Purge tries to make you feel isolated/alone in a small area with people hunting you, much like how the first Alien movie did. But The Purge relies too much on jump-scares to scare you, which is not a good tactic for horror movies. Good horror has slow-building tension and a release, two things that The Purge has none of.<br/><br/>The characters and the acting are similar in the sense that they're terrible and make you angry. The kids make HORRIBLE decisions, and even in some instances, endanger their own lives. For example, there is a scene where the daughter is upset with her parents, so she walks off, while the people are still invading their house. She risks her life just to act rebellious. Then the people invading the house aren't great either. They all seem to wear masks and act insane to seem creepy. This could have worked, but the moment someone fires a gun at them, they immediately stop acting this way, and they take cover and act like regular people, which gets rid of any creepiness of them possibly being mentally insane.<br/><br/>My final rating for The Purge is a 3/10. I hoped that this movie would at least be worthy of a Redbox rent, but it isn't even worth that. Part of me feels that I went in expecting too much, and I probably did. However, in a way, with the marketing and the premise, I didn't expect too much out of it. If you say that your movie is the most disturbing movie of the year, then you better give me the most disturbing movie of the year."

Including murder.<br/><br/>Because murder is definitely the worst crime imaginable, right? No, seriously. Worst crime ever. It's even singled out in the movie's Purge warning.<br/><br/>So the movie is about this troubled night, in the year 2022, and is focused on this one family's experience...<br/><br/>... which would have never happened at all in the first place if the family wasn't so frikkin' *moronic*.<br/><br/>*For Instance* If this Purge is a major changing point in the history of your country, why aren't you educating your children on the dangers of not minding your own frikkin' business? For a teenage male with as many smarts as seemed to be portrayed, the 'son' of the family is a gorram nut-case, with absolutely *zero* street smarts.<br/><br/>While the movie never explains how many years this Purge tradition has been going on, I'm sure it can't be too long. No more than eight years or so. This would mean that at least one of the idiotic children in this movie would remember things about the world from before the Purge was initiated... so why not pass this information on to your frikkin' sibling?<br/><br/>And what responsible parent would let their child know/have the lock-down codes for your house, especially on the *deadliest* night of the year?

This strange man, covered in blood, whose presence inside your house has now put your family at risk, and who had, no more than ten (10) minutes prior, thrown *your* daughter into a wall and knocked her out... you don't want to throw him outside, as was asked of you, to end the torment coming down upon you? Your own daughter has *a bleeding head wound* and has been knocked unconscious, and you wish to save her attacker's life?<br/><br/>I don't have kids, and I find this brand of idiocy absolutely appalling.<br/><br/>Then there's the ""If you throw him out there, you'll be no better than them,"" thing that was attempted to be thrown into the movie. Because letting the enemy invade your house to kill you *and* the man your stupid son helped is totally better than just throwing the man out of your house, ending the nightmare for your family, changing your frikkin' lock-down codes, and beating some sense into your moronic kid, right?<br/><br/>Because child abuse is totally allowed during this 12 hours too. But it's obviously not nearly as horrible a crime as murder.<br/><br/>One star, only because I can't rate in halves. I want that hour and a half of my life back, please."

","It's basically 1:20 hour of people getting murdered, not much to it. Only at the end did something bother me, even the psychopath enjoy murder because it's forbidden. Why would anyone start murdering people just because it's allowed ?<br/><br/>This movie is, from my point of view, a satire on religion. Religion teaches you that your natural instinct is to do bad stuff but you have to refrain those instincts in order to go to heaven.<br/><br/>Religion is not explicitly mentioned but it's hard to miss the parallels: - It's about being purified (as a society, but still) - ""blessed be our New Founding Fathers"" Clearly these are some kind of prophets - ""A nation Reborn"" Clear reference to the ""chosen people"".<br/><br/>So when the almighty Godvernment (get it ?) allows it, everyone rushes back to its (would-be natural) bad instincts and starts killing, torturing and raping for one night and then just stops being violent because for the next year it's not allowed anymore.<br/><br/>Of course some people do not understand morale but in real life, it doesn't take a government to tell you it's bad to do harm, just like it doesn't take religion. I have a hard time believing that everyone would start killing each other if murder wasn't something forbidden (either by religion or government).<br/><br/>Smart idea for the scenarist... This is why I gave it five even for such a (seemingly) pointlessly violent movie."

","When we saw the original preview for this movie, both my husband and I were really excited to see it, because the idea was intriguing. Didn't have the funds for the theater so waited for DVD and rented it right away. I made the mistake of checking the rating and a couple non spoiler reviews on here before watching, but now I definitely agree with them. I have never been so incredibly annoyed watching a movie in my entire life. These characters have no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I was hoping they'd all just die in the end due to their extreme stupidity. The son? Ridiculous. The parents? Really? Wimps. There is far too many shots of people staring. All anyone does for 75% of the movie is stare stupidly. The bad guys are semi ridiculous and not in a good way. Would never watch this movie twice. Wish I had never watched it to begin with."

I give this one a high rate of @@@@.5 for the story. Give this movie a go and please look on the story and not the graphics. Movie is supposed to be judge by its content not the cover anyway. Talking about judging, I found myself figuring out the both side of parties of how they feel and why they proceed in the action and this movie is pretty much what our society today is becoming. This movie need more attention to be watched and reminded how our society can be manipulated just because it's a reasonable action to kill / neutralize other people just so they can be better or should kill more people to raise economical benefits.

The script consists of 80% tedium, with the other 20% delivering a bit of tension and some weak action sequences. The look of the film is overly dark, which combined with the slow pace and lack of thrills... makes for a tiresome experience.<br/><br/>I was relieved when the whole thing was over.

One thing I can say it that this horror flick had a very interested plot the bad news is they failed to deliver and fell short of what the film should've been doing focusing more on (The actual Purge) this film had real potential but unfortunately that slowly faded away with a boring story,over unrealistic acting, and bad directing its........in closing I want to say give it a watch its not the worst film but if defiantly not the best it's worth one watch but trust me this film isn't at all memorable I would recommend renting it on (Redbox) or at a local video store but if you've got spare money and want to waste 20 bucks then the Blu-ray will be there waiting for you"

Then uncanny timing of people saving other people at the very last second...unbearable. There were about five or six scenes in the last half hour of one family member/hobo saving the other family member at the last possible second. If you're power to your house it cut, and there is a gang of lunatics in the house...please do not walk aimlessly around the house with a flashlight. That is sure fire way to be noticed and have your life ended. If anything use the flashlight as a decoy on a chair and lie on the ground behind cover so that if someone opens the door they are prompted to fire at the flashlight or something. I'm not a cop or a bad ass...it just seems like common hunt or be hunted knowledge, you don't walk around a dark environment, lit up like a beacon lol There are layers upon layers of common sense lacking to make it a qualified story line. Aside from that, the ""lunatics"" were like limp wristed prep kids...the one thing that this movie taught me is that stabbing someone requires no strength or effort, you can basically dip the knife into someone. The scares were mostly predictable. It is hard to take a murder seriously when they are prancing around in the front yard. I don't know much about murders, i would like to think that they wouldn't hold hands and prance around the front yard. I'm usually not hard on movies about this kind of stuff.<br/><br/>There are movies that are unconventional in every sense, are way over the top too (maybe like a Tarantino movie or something), but they have some sort of style, ""swag"", culture, rhythm, I don't know.

"richardv81","3","2","3","20 August 2013"," Great concept, Poor movie
","Over the weekend I got to see one of the most anticipated movies of the summer for me, The Purge. I had high expectations off the build, the idea and the great marketing through the trailers. So here is what I thought was the Good, the Bad & the Ugly.<br/><br/>The Purge happens once a year; it's a 12-hour time period that crime is legal. As James Sandin and his family settle in for the annual Purge, his son makes a mistake that he would soon regret.<br/><br/>The Good – The Idea – James DeMonaco came up with a brilliant idea here, and boy was I excited.<br/><br/>My favorite part was the scenes leading up to Sandin (Hawke) turning into a kick-ass hero. While I 100% hated Hawke in this role, his becoming a fine hero that was trying to protect his family was pretty good. The fight scenes had a nice touch to them and he really kicked some ass.<br/><br/>The Bad –The Plot holes: Without spoiling the film, there were just some terrible plot holes planted throughout its entirety.<br/><br/>The Acting – Ethan Hawke (who I don't think has made a good movie since Training Day) was just terrible in this film with his lifeless portrayal of the father, James Sandin.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast from Headey, Burkholder (who I wish died), Kane & Hodge was just bland. I don't know what it was but they were awful. They never really got me to buy into their characters to honestly care what happened to them.<br/><br/>The Ugly – The Title of the movie is the Purge: The movie is based on a Purge, which is a 12-hour window where crime is legal. So why did we get stuck in a house for 2 hours and see very minimal purging? Outside a montage at the beginning, more of a build towards the whole ""purge"" situation would've been nice.<br/><br/>The End – So I really think a solid ending to this film could've saved it from being as horrible as the movie was. Well we just couldn't have a good ending could we? It was just as bad as the film was, and a stupid way to end this movie.<br/><br/>The Directing – DeMonaco never really goes to the places he should've with this film. From scene to scene it was just poor. For a ""Horror"" movie, absolutely nothing was remotely scary.<br/><br/>The Verdict - 1 and ½ stars out of 5<br/><br/>The Purge fell short of my expectations big time. What could have been a great concept was turned into a mockery. James DeMonaco should be credited for a great idea and then Purged for his poor execution on the film. Sadly, fans like myself flocked to see it and we will get an unneeded sequel to this movie. I would not recommend seeing this film to anyone in theaters."
"huh_oh_i_c","6","2","3","3 August 2013"," The Purge is already happening! Read here how.
","The point of The Purge is NOT showing us a good or likely way to end the recession. Nor is trying to tell us that this is a way to reduce violence.<br/><br/>No, the POINT of the movie is of course addressing the ridiculous gun laws in the USA and how over-the-top they've become. Sandy Hook has shown us that the subversive NRA-element in our midst doesn't really care how much kids are being killed, they're always gonna pervert any tragedy into a call for more, not less guns. When Tucson happened, they managed to convince the father of the 9 year old girl to cry and to not blame guns.<br/><br/>Of course, if people kill people and guns don't kill people, what the hell do they need guns for?<br/><br/>It's showing one likely consequence of the current gun-culture. It's asking: ""What could be the ultimate consequence of lax gun laws?"" Oops sorry, 'free' gun laws.<br/><br/>Yhe movie is not really trying to be realistic, and that is it's main weakness: The story is so full of holes, that it completely detracts from the message. It allows the gun nuts to say: ""This sort of thing would never have happened to me, because I would have done this and that"", like, bought a generator. Instead of addressing the real issue, namely, what do we do about all these guns in the hands of extreme fear-mongered people?<br/><br/>I think there's also a sizable minority, like 30-35% that truly believes that killing all the poor people will revive the economy and reduce crime. However, the MOST damaging criminals are white collar criminals, like Goldman Sachs, who openly lied to their customers, in order to sell them faulty products and still weren't indicted for fraud.<br/><br/>Imagine that GM sold you a faulty car with an exploding motor, and it DID explode, wouldn't GM be sued?<br/><br/>So, killing all the poor people would NOT reduce crime, would not solve a thing. That aspect DOES highlight an immoral, vicious and un-Christian streak in American society: the conviction that poor people are poor because they're lazy, that the poor have only themselves to blame for their poverty, and, it's CERTAINLY not the fault of the rich paying too little in taxes. That's quite a sick attitude, an extremist right-wing variation on blaming the victim. But it's an attitude that's very popular because it absolves the middle class from doing anything about poverty.<br/><br/>Ain't that mighty Christian of them?<br/><br/>The Melancholic Alcoholic."

And the whole family seemed not to give care about the teenage daughter another thing i really liked in the movie was the violence which is not to everyones taste but watching the father etc take on the masked killers was good also the main guy with a mask was brill he played the character well he was creepy but i was sort of sad he was killed because he was the best bit, the fact the father sold this security and it was basically for show it looked good but was rubbish again surely you'd not be that dumb the only reason the family likes the purge is they can afford not to take part !!!!"

","I thought the idea for this movie was great, seeing that it was pretty much a brand new concept for a horror/suspense film and they could have done so much with it. However, this movie was very disappointing. <br/><br/>First of all, as others have said, the dialog is quite bad and so many things throughout the movie either don't make any sense or just go unexplained. In fact, there's an entire character (the girl's boyfriend) who had no purpose at all in the story. Why was he there?? & why did he do what he did. I don't get it and they really could have left him out of it completely. That's also where things didn't make sense. The characters did things without reason and that made it very unbelievable to me. <br/><br/>Along with being unrealistic, this movie did not live up to its potential at all. When I went to see it, I was expecting it to be interesting to see how people who react to a day with legal crime. I was really surprised to find that it focused the entire movie on this one family. Don't get me wrong, the story line had to come from somewhere, but I think it would have been so much better if at least some of the scenes (other than the beginning credits) showed what else was going on in the town. <br/><br/>Overall, this was a very disappointing, not scary, movie that I wouldn't watch again."
"tomassparups","3","2","3","18 July 2013"," Glorifying stupidity?
","What looked like a somewhat promising thriller turned out to be plain awful, other than the creepy masks the purgers wear, this movie is not even remotely scary. Set in the near future, the United States government legalizes all crimes for a period of twelve hours every year for an event known as ""Purge Night"". Ethan Hawke plays a man named James Sandin, who has gained a substantial amount of wealth selling security systems to wealthy neighborhoods. The purge has reformed the United States. Crime is at an all time low and the economy is flourishing. Even Sandin's wealthy neighbors take part in the purgefor fun. At home, Sandin is awaited by his trophy wife Mary, played by Lena Heady and his two children, who do a great job at making the worst decisions imaginable and acting like total morons. As the purge begins, the Sandin's lock up as per usual. Later on, as the night falls, James' son Charlie sees an injured man walking down the street and begging for help through the house's security camera and gets an oh so sudden moral obligation to help him. He let's the man into the house. For the sake of the plot, purgers arrive at the Sandin's door.<br/><br/>This film is just, for lack of a better word..retarded! The characters make sudden horrible choices and make the story not only feel cheap, but incredibly stupid. The child actors in this film are horrible and the characters they portray are even worse. I mean (and I know i'm ranting) their father does everything to protect them and they basically spit in his face. The initial concept of ""The Purge"" seemed genuinely fascinating, but it is presented so badly and over-exaggerated to such extremes that it becomes laughable! Not to mention the horrible production. The blood/gore effects looked like something out of a student film and the cinematography felt like it was for a cheap, and I mean really cheap TV movie and the sound effects for the guns sound like their taken from ""Garry's Mod"" or some other video game. Ethan Hawke is the only one who delivers a decent performance. Lena Headey is not a bad actress and she could have had an exceptional performance if the plot and her character weren't as dumb. God, I couldn't stand this movie. I know i'm being very critical, but it was just awful! It could only pass as a cheap film that you watch on TV when you have absolutely nothing to do.<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is predictable, dumb and annoying. Ethan Hawke gives the only decent performance, but still fails to save the movie in any way. Topped off by a ludicrous plot and horrible visuals, ""The Purge"" is an example of a interesting idea gone terribly wrong."

","I was excited for this film's release, the concept intrigued me and it did sound promising. Unfortunately a absolutely horrendous script writing ruined this film before it even began!<br/><br/>The Purge, a 12 hour period in which anything is legal and all emergency services are suspended, begins towards the start of the film. Middle class family the Sandins settle down for the night, behind their 'state of the art' security. They're safely wasting the 12 hours away, until son Charlie decides to offer refuge to a homeless victim of the Purge (plot hole number one, why on earth would you entrust the code of your security system to your creepy child?). Soon enough a gang appear politely demanding the Sandins release the homeless man as he is their target for the purge, inexplicably cutting the power to the Sandins home (why cut the power? How on earth are they supposed to find someone in the dark?). Of course you can guess the rest, lots of torches, gun shots and just for the sake of it a pointless plot twist.<br/><br/>Characters are unbelievably one dimensional, we have the stereotypical middle class family. Hardworking dad, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke), his perfect wife, Mary (Lena Headey), rebellious Catholic school girl daughter, Zoe (Adelaide Kane) and some creepy, Blanket Jackson-esque son, Charlie (Max Burkholder). Don't expect to care about any of these characters in anyway shape or form, in fact in the case of Charlie you will probably find yourself actually wanting the antagonists to kill him! There is absolutely NO character development and none of these characters have any redeeming qualities. Hawke isn't usually a bad actor but is terrible in this, he looks bored and fed up throughout. Headey has been given such a flat character I honestly couldn't even rate if she managed a decent job. Rhys Wakefield puts in the best performance as a the creepy leader of the gang though his dialogue is badly written.<br/><br/>Unlikable characters (I mean seriously, I don't think I cared from start to finish who died), bad dialogue, full of MASSIVE plot holes that are impossible to overlook, no suspense, no scares and repeatedly using the same cheap tricks (oh look, yet again another off-screen character is saving the day). I wouldn't recommend this film unless you intend to watch it as a satire because really unless you're going to laugh at how much of a failure the characters and plot are it's probably going to be a waste of your time."

Though unexpected, it left the feel that he was unimportant. And if he's a major character, he's rather important.<br/><br/>The Purge had a lot of potential in terms of plot, the story, and the characters, but being a mere 1.5 hours long, and poor direction, the film leaves a bad taste in the mouth.

"stevenerceg","6","2","3","10 June 2013"," Mediocre
","The film the Purge was an alright film. The idea and gist of the film is not original, taking the idea of one night where all crime is legal from an episode of Star Trek, 'the Red Hour' (ep. 45. Season 1). The very execution of the idea in a more modern setting is exceptionally well. <br/><br/>In this dystopia and modern future, a day known as the 'Purge'. There is one full night of crime as crime is legal to 'cleanse' the evil and stress inside of themselves. After finding a homeless man on the streets and picking him up, the 'Strangers' come to the Sandin house to reclaim the already wounded man that they claim is theirs to kill. The Sandins are then faced with the decision of bringing the man to them or keeping him safe.<br/><br/>There were a few things that I did not like about the film, the way the characters acted. The characters acted like they were in a bad horror film. The choices seemed a bit too...well, stupid. Stupid meaning they were unrealistic and seemed a little forced. I would have also liked it if the film had been more built up to the 'Purge' rather than the whole film being during the 'Purge' itself. That way, we could have liked the characters more and known more about them rather than their small traits. We are introduced to our main characters a bit unexpectedly and were told to react to the happenings and mishaps of the 'Purge' as told by the actors or the music.<br/><br/>The actors give a wonderful and thrilling performance in the film. Max Burkholder as the son, Charlie Sandin is quite good as a child actor, but I feel that Rhys Wakefield, pulls out the starring role as the unnamed villain. All other actors give it there all and were fairly well. Amazingly, I found myself liking some of the characters and wanting them to meet there struggle and make it out.<br/><br/>The action in the film, what little there is, can be quite suspense-filled. As I had already stated, I felt for the characters which was quite rare.<br/><br/>Overall, the Purge is a well-made movie and quite original compared to the other films released before it, (not counting 'Now You See Me' or 'After Earth'). Regardless, of the way the characters acted and the way we were introduced, I couldn't give it a one or a four. Truthfully, I simply give the film a six out of ten for at least trying."
"Erika_IMDb","4","2","3","10 June 2013"," Cool concept, horrible execution
","Well we have a new contender for the #1 spot in my Worst Films of 2013. There is so much wrong with 'The Purge' that I don't know where to begin. <br/><br/>The performances were dismal and most of the casting choices were questionable, at best. The only actors who I think carried their roles well were the two that portrayed Charlie Sandin and the Bloody Stranger. I am sorry to say that I did not like Ethan Hawke's character at all in this movie. <br/><br/>The concept for this film was promising but what I saw on screen was not what I expected. This is nothing but a home invasion movie, think The Strangers, except that here murder is not only legal but government sanctioned once a year. What should have been a film about suppressing one's animalistic urges becomes quite the joke. It attempts to be intelligent but falls extremely short of that. Why in a world where purging is legal and you could potentially become someone's target, would you not learn how to shoot or defend yourself? How can you not learn to not only protect yourself but also teach your loves ones how to defend themselves as well? How do you work as a salesman for a home defense company and don't know that your product is virtually crap? Why would you not have a backup plan in case of emergencies given your field of employment? Why was the daughter more worried about her boyfriend that her father who he tried to kill?<br/><br/>And for those complaining about the ending, I quite liked it myself. I don't think movies, especially those of this genre, have to have a 'happily ever after' and really, by this point of the film I really wanted James Sandin dead. <br/><br/>This film had so much potential but was unfortunately poorly executed!"
"FNDNreview","6","2","3","8 June 2013"," 'The Purge' a theme-driven attack on America?
","Films that make political statements aren't anything new, nor are they a revolutionary means of gaining otherwise unlikely attention. Controversy has always been a means for creating revenue, especially in the United States where people tend to flock to scandalous news stories. But, before you come after me for generalizing, hear me out. The Purge, which is the subject of controversy due to comments made by James DeMonaco in relation to The Tea Party and NRA, appear to have stirred quite the commotion for a film that would typically never register on the average movie-goer's radar. But, when roughly one-third of the United States is clearly conservative, attacking their base with a overbearingly apocalyptic film seems like a great way to aggravate that one-third, while still forcing them to go see the film in order to figure out what all the talk is about. When you take that logic into account, mix it with a liberally-charged subject matter and the unremarkably high interest for blood-spillage from teenagers and young adults, you have quite the cocktail for success.<br/><br/>The Purge, directed by James DeMonaco (Staten Island), stars Ethan Hawke as James Sandin, a home security developer that sells security systems to home owners in anticipation of a yearly 12-hour period, called ""The Purge."" During the 12 hour window, the New Founding Fathers of America (government) allow Americans to ""purge"" themselves of crime, hate, and murder by legalizing these acts (with certain exceptions). James Sandin and his wife, Mary (Lena Headey), along with their two kids, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Henry (Tony Oller), decide to stay in for ""the purge,"" believing in its cause, but not partaking in the events. However, the evening of The Purge takes a turn for the worst when Henry aids a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge) begging for salvation outside the Sandin's residence. The man's assailants, including the cryptic polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield), demand his release before they ""purge"" the entire Sandin family, also. Arija Bareikis and Chris Mulkey also star in supporting roles.<br/><br/>It's difficult to watch this film without focusing on the underlying themes that are completely in your face for its entirety. The idiotic rational featured in this film states that America is better off if its citizens are given a 12 hour window to commit atrocities. On the flip side, the government believes that if Americans are given this 12-hour window of ""freedom,"" it alleviates crime and promotes job growth, along with economic prosperity for the remaining 364 days of the year. Still, it's bothersome to think that people can simply go on a 12-hour crime/killing spree, and just go back to their regular lives the following day without any carry over. They say once you've killed the first time, it's likely you'll do it again. However, with that logic in mind, it's difficult to imagine any of these individuals would be able to wait a full year to kill or commit a crime again. This film obviously gives the mind plenty to contemplate and it certainly creates a different way of thinking about the future direction of civilization. Regardless, the film's premise is a complete and utter rip-off of the classic 1967 Star Trek episode, The Return of the Archons, in which an evil dictator rewards his minions with a similar 12-hour window to pillage and plunder an entire planet's civilians.<br/><br/>Themes aside, there's very little about The Purge that separates itself from the array of unlawful entry films, not to mention the classic slasher films featuring Michael Myers or Jason Voorhees. The abundance of stupid mistakes and clichés (like characters that still hide under the bed) really hurt this film, especially in the later half after the film turns into more a ""so stupid it's funny"" horror flick than a spine-tingling thriller. For instance, if the son hadn't invited the random stranger into his house, the whole situation could have been avoided. Of course, that wouldn't make for a very interesting movie – but it always takes something away from the film when the majority of viewers don't believe the situation is visible, especially in the horror genre. Fror there, there's a series of irritating questions, like why are a large group of blood-thirsty individuals hell bent on ""purging"" spending so much time on won random bum/war veteran. It makes the film feel like a whole lot of wasted time with very little reward.<br/><br/>To be honest, the lack of star-power hasn't been a very big concern for the horror genre. However, The Purge's leading man, Ethan Hawke, is far from an unrecognizable face. Surprisingly, Hawke makes an enjoyable protagonist, but he just lacked the proper antagonist in this film. His nemesis for the film, credited as the ""polite stranger"" is reminiscent of a watered-down version of Heath Ledger's joker persona. If the joker were 15 years younger and starring in a CW version of Batman, he may have resembled the performance of the relatively unknown Rhys Wakefield. And, to be honest, the kid (Henry) is rather creepy in the film, even though he turns out to be utterly harmless. Tony Oller's portrayal is commendable, and even though he had the look of a future Michael Myers follower, (small spoiler) he turns out to be the voice of reason in the family's darkest hour.<br/><br/>Overall, The Purge is a silly movie filled with a ton of potshots at America. The film is chock-full of liberal bias, but is it anti-American? Well, that's a matter of personal opinion, but the fact that a film like this can be made (even if the director is using his own personal criticism) means the First Amendment is alive and well."
"CSHaviland","5","2","3","9 June 2013"," Questionable psychology, contrived plot, repetitive thrills
","I almost never give any movies less than 5 stars unless the filmmakers clearly dismiss the art and science of movie storytelling (such as what you might find from the likes of Charles Band, Ed Wood, or Troma). Movies in which the filmmakers are trying but fail will get something from 4-6 stars from me.<br/><br/>Reviewers who give even movies like this ""1 star"" are abusing the rating system. To think that there could be no movies worse than this is ridiculous. Just watch the SyFy channel's original monster movies, like Mansquito. I dare you. The Purge does not rate at THAT level.<br/><br/>The Purge has a provocative idea: what if one day a year there was almost no law enforcement, so people were allowed to steal, commit violence, murder, rape, etc, without any police or legal interference? The movie takes that a step further and suggests that our culture evolves to promote this behavior as somehow patriotic, as it supposedly helped to rid our nation of violence for the rest of the year.<br/><br/>There are some precedents in history for barbaric annual festivals of this kind, but not to the effect that they created peace for the rest of the year.<br/><br/>The problem with the movie is that it misunderstands human psychology. The idea is that we all have a violent nature, and that violence in any culture can be attributed to our need to vent that nature, as if it were pressure building up in us like a tea kettle. This is not the case.<br/><br/>While every human has the capacity for violence, this is quite different from having a drive to be violent, even if the situation presents itself. There are some interesting studies on mob behavior, which has a bizarre counter-active effect on typical individual personality and behavior. And I think there is a genetic disposition toward competition, which is what drives people to love sports. And there are some who have a desire to hunt, which is mainly an echo from the millions of years of human survival strategy, especially before we learned how to farm. But it is not correct to presuppose that most humans would choose to go out and commit extreme recreational violence and harm against others, even murder, just to support a national holiday or purge themselves of some instinctive pressure to be violent.<br/><br/>Cultures that exhibit wanton violence are the result of being taught that violence is expected or required of them from a very early age. Vikings and Spartans are well known examples of such societies. A misguided and hateful culture can steer collective human behavior for some time before it is ""normalized."" Surely the Nazis have shown how dangerous this can be.<br/><br/>But without cultural pressure, humans have a high capacity for feeling shame. I think more than any other organism, possibly in Earth's history, humans indulge in a sort of psychological self-flagellation, a self-loathing that extends not just to one's self but one's gender, one's country, even one's race. I am hearing people complaining that humans are evil rubbish, comparing us to viruses (which is ironic considering how successful viruses are, and how most viruses are harmless and some have even contributed to the evolutionary advancement of life), and that we deserve to be ""wiped out"" before we ""destroy the planet."" People with these feelings might envision a movie like this as being completely accurate. In fact, they prove the movie is not - because self shame would neutralize self-indulgent violence toward others. Most humans who are not sociopathic also have a tendency toward high empathy, not only to other humans but to other creatures. This also tilts the balance toward non-violence.<br/><br/>The movie, as shown in the trailers, attempted to demonstrate a family that did not choose to participate in this festival. They hunkered down to ride out the storm. But the point of the movie seems to be that a majority of people seem to choose violence because they feel it helps them and helps society for the rest of the year. Not just violence but weird, psychotic behavior.<br/><br/>(If you wait to the credits you'll hear the suggestion that Dallas, Texas has the highest number of participants. A thinly veiled political stab?) I am growing ever-so-tired of Hollywood's cock-eyed perception that the ""upper class"" is made up of unsympathetic, selfish, elitist bigots. It's almost as tiresome as the idea that the military is nothing but a legal mob of evil warmongers, and that our democratic republic is a group of rights-violating conspirators intending to take advantage of the ""underprivileged."" These clichés are overused and their logic is unimpressive. At least The Purge chose main characters who were among that so-called ""upper-class"" who do not behave that way. Had they been some poor family fighting to survive attacks by the rich, I would have dropped the movie to four stars... Maybe three.<br/><br/>Shoving all that aside and looking at it as a popcorn movie, there are other problems. The plot was too contrived, and full of thriller clichés.<br/><br/>Example: do you remember a moment from any movie in which an important character is about to be killed by a bad guy, but suddenly the bad guy is killed in the last second, saving our hero's life? I'll bet you've seen that dozens of times over the last 20 years, right? Well in The Purge you'll see it not once, not twice, but at least three times! Even a new untested screenwriter shouldn't be making mistakes like that.<br/><br/>I could go on. The point is: this movie is made up of gratuitous well-worn thrills based on a spurious psychology.<br/><br/>I would pass on this one."

","This movie stared off good, but halfway through it goes downhill. <br/><br/>It goes from being horror to action/thriller and the ending felt rushed with a few predictable twists.<br/><br/>If I'm feeling generous I'd give it a 7/10. It wasn't horrible, but it certainly didn't live up to the hype. I was a really excited to see it but came out a bit disappointed. Good concept, poor execution. <br/><br/>See now, what they SHOULD have done is make a movie about the Purge itself and the political, moral, and emotional implications it had on society as a whole, with maybe some character being an an-hero and trying to shut down the corrupt government and their ""purge"". but no... they made into some ""been there done that"" home invasion flick. <br/><br/>Remember during the beginning when some guy on the radio was talking about how the purge is really just a way to exterminate poor people? This movie had some much potential, they could have gone 100 different directions with it, but they chose the least interesting route.<br/><br/>I expected more from the makers of ""Insidious"" that's one of my favorite horror movies.<br/><br/>The ONLY horror in this movie was the intensity felt when the purge starts and possibly the creepy guy on the camera (his smile gave me the chills) but it quickly derails into a fast paced shoot 'em up. <br/><br/>Save your money and wait for a DVD release."

When I first saw this film I found I was asking myself ""would I condone one night of any and all crime if it meant the rest of the year my loved ones would be safe?"". Part of me screamed yes then I was horrified with myself for even considering such an idea.

"spookyrat1","6","1","1","27 March 2020"," Original Concept; Execution the Problem!
","The Purge is one of those minority films that has a better ending than beginning. I came to the film enthusiastically, though knowing little about it. However the idea of a family who find themselves endangered by a gang of murderers during the annual Purge, a night during which all crime, including murder, is temporarily legal seemed really intriguing to me; especially considering America's collective love of all things to do with guns, ammunition and the right to bear arms. The Sandin family set-up is good too, with dad James a very successful entrepreneur, whose company specialises in home security systems, specifically designed to offer protection during The Purge.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the main storyline's implementation relies frustratingly again on the eternal trope of the ""naughty children"". So we have son Charlie, who's clearly supposed to be at least 12/13 in the movie and a nerd who likes to play with electronic toys. Now despite needing to have Dad explain to him what The Purge is at the start of the movie (to give us valuable exposition), he unilaterally decides to turn off the security. Yes, somehow he already knows the access codes and decides the family will handle things differently. BTW after this occurs and creates all manner of chaos, Dad never has a critical word to say to the brat.<br/><br/>Speaking of brats, we haven't spoken about daughter Zoey yet, who is also a unique piece of work. Although Dad doesn't approve of her boyfriend, of course she knows better. Then when said boyfriend tries to kill her father during The Purge but is grieviously wounded himself, what does she do? Yes, she runs away into the mansion-sized house, worrying about the murderous boyfriend's health and not her father's. She spends much of the rest of the movie running away from anyone who's actually likely to offer her protection. She's worse than a damsel in distress; more like a moron in distress.<br/><br/>Mom played by Lena Headey, until very late in the third act, plays a stereotypically indecisive, dithering woman, very much the polar opposite of her infamous Game of Thrones persona, Cersei Lannister. She does a lot of nervous creeping around the house with a gun in her hand ... but not much else. Most of the heavy lifting in terms of decisive action is taken by Ethan Hawke's James and let it be said; he does a pretty good job. Also smarmily good is chief villain ""The Polite Stranger"", though it's difficult to see how he inspires much loyalty amongst his gang of thugs, when he's shown to off one for a minor infraction, within the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>What lifts The Purge in overall quality is an excellent third act, where we actually are given several reasonably unexpected plot twists which ramp up the suspense and interest quotient accordingly. The quality of the action improves too. Early in the film there are a couple of really badly-lit, choppily edited sequences, whereas in the back half, we start to actually see who's attacking who and what they are doing about it; always a help. Even the post - credit soundtrack adds to the overall calibre of the tale.<br/><br/>Many will be aware that due to the success of this first film, a franchise was created with the immediate sequel, The Purge:Anarchy supposedly being even better than this one. I just might be tempted after seeing this, given half a chance."

"roelv-41217","2","1","1","5 November 2019"," Good premise, grotesque execution
","Exciting concept, with great potential for a movie. The actors are fine, as well as the cinematography. However, the writing absolutely BUTCHERED this film. The characters engage in a string of ridiculous choices that make no sense.<br/><br/>1) The father sells security systems and is loaded because of it, yet he chooses to re-enforce his home with a few flimsy sheets of metal? 2) He does not decide to build a safe room? 3) The family spreads out as far as possible within the house so they cannot communicate? 4) The parent leave the control room unsupervised??? 5) The children know all the codes to disarm the security system? 6) The father insists on taping the intruder to chair while the intruder is already unconscious and while under extreme time pressure? Throw the dude out asap! 7) The son appears to have brain damage throughout the entire movie since everything he does is so stupid I can't even describe it? 8) Characters that are hiding in the dark attempt to signal their location with flashlights? Turn that off! I could go like this for a while...<br/><br/>It also seems to be a waste that the movie is limited to a home, since it has now become a home invasion movie on steroids. However, I find this only a minor complaint in comparison with the crap writing.<br/><br/>On the concept of a purge itself: I love the premise for a movie and do not expect it to give a realistic representation of what would happen during an actual purge. That is, I want to see a lot of violence, etc. However, I cannot keep myself from hypothesizing whether this would be realistic, so here goes:<br/><br/>What if crime became legal for a night? First, let's determine that: 1) most violent crimes are committed out of passion or due to personal gain (i.e. gang violence, domestic violence, violence during robberies, etc.). These types of violence are mostly circumstantial and cannot be postponed till the purge, since they are committed in response to something. 2) If crime, and murder in particular, is premeditated by someone like in this movie, there is something mentally wrong with this person, and they would not be held back by laws anyways, thus rendering the purge useless even to these individuals. 3) Social standards are still in place during the purge. If your neighbor goes on a killing/raping spree, he/she would still be judged the same as when he/she would do it during a regular day, even though it would be legal. Overall, it seems both unlikely that violent crime would be significantly reduced during the regular year, or that violent crime would occur on a scale as seen in this movie (Unless 10% of the population is secretly a serial killer being held back by the law).<br/><br/>Rather, a HUGE spike in non-violent crime seems probable. Everyone will try to make personal gains through or engage in robberies, cyber crime, stock manipulation, insider trading, forgery theft, etc.<br/><br/>Also, most who would have the financial means would flee the country. Insurance (home, business, and health) rates would go up by huge margin, and additional purge coverage would possibly be required. The U.S. financial market would collapse as all bankers try to steal their clients' assets. The weapon and security industry would increase rapidly in size.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, a purge with a lot of violence is a fun concept for a horror movie, although I would recommend skipping this one."

","Having heard about these Purge films but never been too interested in them, decided to watch the original to see how it was. As was expected but slightly different. This film is more of a thriller than horror and it works in some ways.<br/><br/>The film is quite short so everything happens roughly quickly. Ethan Hawke is a likeable lead character here, and so is Lena Headey but the two kids weren't and made questionable choices from the start. First when the actual Purge begins, the son lets in a stranger he sees out in the street. Had he not done this, perhaps everything that occurred would have been avoided.<br/><br/>As an action thriller there are some decent amounts of thrills and entertainment. It is as to expect as the trailers do show exactly what it is. And as a lower budget film, this was a massive success which is why it produced three more sequels (as of now). The film could have been better and kore explained but given its run time, its clear they wanted something very quick and to the point."

","This could've been a short film or a special addition to the main franchise, which could've been released later, to show a more close up of the unfolding of events from a perspective of specific target individuals. The main concept of purging was never fully explored throughout the movie, which would've done the title justice. It was only talk-talk on media & no walk-walk on screen. To introduce the concept of the brutal & chaotic purging, this was a horrible choice to go with. It kinda toned it down to become as a basic slasher movie & tried to wrongly assure that everything's okay in the end. It didn't feel dystopian at all. Anyway, I somewhat loved the movie as a whole, it was gripping, especially the last 25 minutes, but don't call it ""The Purge"", not this movie at least, & definitely not in this release order.

These periods are The Purge, when pent up anger results in massive loss of life, especially among the poor or the disconnected.<br/><br/>James sells security systems that work 99% of the time. Great. The biggest threats to the family's safety are (1) Charlie, who lets in a wounded victim and (2) Zoey, whose boyfriend stows away in the home/fortress just before the Purge starts. Giving sanctuary to the victim results in the organised attack on the household by well-to-do marauders who want the victim so they can finish killing him.<br/><br/>The film is about the outside attackers assailing the household, and the family's decisions on how to deal with it. Their target is not the family, but the family's stupidity turns the family into an additional target. Will the attackers break in? That's easy to guess. Will they leave anyone alive? Are they the only threat?<br/><br/>There are some interesting ideas here, but the execution just sucked.

"jordanhuntgeneral","Null","1","1","29 August 2016"," A strong concept with weak execution.
","Centred on the concept of an annual twelve-hour window in which all crime, including murder, is legal, The Purge is one of those rare franchise starters, like Saw or Final Destination, that takes a seemingly simple scenario which then captivates the imaginations of the movie-going public. What if our lives and our homes were defenceless for one whole night, and worse, what if it was encouraged by the state? What if you couldn't afford to install a high-tech security system to protect your family? What if you were homeless, or in need of emergency medical care when, by law, there was none available?<br/><br/>The Purge fails to do anything other than briefly consider the implications of these issues, and for that it is a massive waste of an opportunity. Although our main characters are an affluent family who have made a small fortune by selling vital security mechanisms for The Purge, the ethics of such are barely argued. What follows instead is a familiar home invasion narrative that borders on nonsensical, as a family of four manage to lose track of one another within a relatively small suburban household as they come under threat from the 'Purgers' threatening to invade their residence.<br/><br/>The core conflict of how a pacifist chooses to act in the face of a life-threatening situation is certainly gripping, but the film subsequently aims to distract you from thinking about it too much. The Purge is a film that has much to say about the politics, economics and morality of such a situation, but mistakenly assumes that the audience would rather ignore them in favour of watching a cliché game of cat and mouse unfold. A damning consequence of this miscalculation is that the drama is then confined to a limited setting while we are left to picture what horrors are most certainly occurring outside, beyond the walls.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey portray the social ambiguity of their idyllic married couple well, but by the end they are anticipating the end of The Purge just as eagerly as the audience is anticipating the end of the film."

","Let's make the soundtrack to super irritating that we don't notice that the script is moronic, the acting wooden, the characters the kind of people you want to slap (not kill. . .we're not ""purging"" here).

I watched American Psycho the first time and hated it, until I realized it was brilliant social satire and commentary. I watched The Purge and realized that people will make a movie if it makes money, and rejoice that having terrible scripts, terrible acting and terrible moral lessons is perfectly good enough to get a few sequels made and make more money. Moreover, the white privilege notion that other races won't come in and kill the white idiots hanging out on the other white idiots' lawn is really idiotic. Also, why didn't Mr defense system contract guy equip his house with enough explosives and guns, etc. to wipe out his other stupid white neighbors really lends credence to white DE-supremacy. White people really must be the most stupid. And I'm white."

","I am not a big fan if horror films at all but I gave the purge a chance to show me what it had. And this film is just your awful dull cliché horror film. The premise is that once every year murder is made legal for 12 hours so people can use their rage, this is called the purge. After a boy tries to help somebody it brings a group of murderers to there front door. Now I think Ethan hawke is a decent actor and I think he did a decent job in this film with what he was given. His character does have some development and you end up kind of liking him but he is just a pretty boring character. Lena heady is in this film and she does a good job as well with her character being more sympathetic and easier to like but also tough as well. But the kids and the villains in the film are just ridiculous. There characters are hugely unlikeable and have nothing good about them in any way. The premise of this film is really unique but the film absolutely fails to deliver on it. It doesn't matter if murder is legal for this film to work it is just your simple home invasion horror film that you will not care about. The script has nothing to it with no interesting dialogue and really all the characters aren't written very well. The style is poor as well, all the jump scares are predictable and lazy and the action that there is just feels like poor horror action. Overall I was really disappointed with this film and I hope the purge anarchy is allot better."

","The year is 2022 and the Annual Purge is about to commence; The Purge legalises crime for 12 hours and is part of a government initiative which has been put in place to allow individuals to vent out any frustrations that they have been building up over the last 12 months. Ironically one of the main reasons that The Purge has been put in place is to reduce crime as a whole. However, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and his family find themselves on the receiving end of The Purge when a homeless man (Edwin Hodge) takes refuge in their home and they refuse to release him to a gang of murderers who the homeless man had managed to escape from. When the gang gain entry to the Sandin's home, the family find themselves in a life or death battle with the murderous gang.<br/><br/>Writer James DeMonaco has come up with a fantastic concept here and with more thought and care this could have been a truly brilliant film. Sadly it wastes its own potential and for the most part it's down to the moronic screenplay. Here's a few examples; <br/><br/>There's a man running round the streets shouting for help (in the middle of The Purge) claiming that someone is chasing him (even though there's no-one in sight). The Sandin's son decides to let him in on the strength of him needing help. Not only was that stupid, but it's just totally unbelievable - the son didn't know who this guy was - for all he knew he could have had a grudge against someone in his family or may have just wanted to rob them because they're rich. That's just one example of stupidity.<br/><br/>The next example of stupidity belongs to the murderous gang and the homeless man; if we read between the lines we can assume that this gang targeted the homeless guy because they see him as a 'purge' on society (no pun intended), but again the attack on him seems rather random. This then brings me to my next problem, if you're a murderous gang of people who have 12 hours to commit whatever crime you wish to any individual you wish would you waste your precious time standing outside someone's house waiting for a family to release a random 'homeless guy' and go to all the trouble to acquire specialist equipment in order to break into said house and get said homeless guy OR would you go out and just find another homeless guy or commit further heinous crimes. Surely if they've had 12 months to think of what crimes they'd commit during The Purge they wouldn't have just decided that they wanted to kill one homeless guy. It just didn't make any sense. I could perhaps understand the gang wanting to see it through if they were a group of work colleagues and they were targeting a boss or fellow work colleague that they hated - something to make what they're doing seem believable, but all that effort for a random homeless guy? I don't think so. I also didn't understand the point of the gang wearing masks. Was that supposed to be scary? It wouldn't matter if they were identified as the crime was legal when they were committing it.<br/><br/>The most disappointing thing about this film is that it felt like a really big missed opportunity; it would have been nice to have had a bit of commentary on the subject and I think it would have been a better film if the central plot would have focused on someone who had it in for the Sandin family or someone who has a reason to resent someone within the family (having the film focus on Sandin's daughter's boyfriend trying to kill Sandin would have been a more believable plot line). The only other reasonably believable aspect of this film was Sandin's neighbours wanting revenge against the family, but even this aspect isn't given a lot of focus.<br/><br/>Whilst it started strong, it sadly never built upon its excellent premise and pretty much wasted the potential that it had. A very big disappointment."

And of course psychopaths would also enjoy their 12-hour killing spree and not kill anybody the rest of the year !

","Thought to be safely locked away in their homes, a man and his family find themselves under attack by a gang of criminals seeking them during a legally sanctioned night of depravity, murder and mayhem and forces them to fight back.<br/><br/>This was a really lame suspense/thriller since hardly anything actually happens here until the final ten minutes. Most of this is spent with the family trying to prepare for the actual event and actually watching around the other actions of the night. That it then becomes a frustratingly interminable sequence of events about the family searching throughout the house for the wanted individual makes for a long, boring series of scenes that do nothing but showcase how large and dark the house is without any sense of pacing or tension as it just winds through it's paces until the inevitable conclusion with the house attack. This does make for some fun times with the different brawling and gunfights that take place throughout the living room and kitchen where they come under attack by the criminal gang. All of this is rendered moot, though, under two of the most laughably inept motives behind the film which is the sheer stupidity of the central premise that it rests on and the ineptness of it's execution. The fact that society would devolve so greatly as to await a yearly-appointed time of day when criminal activity would be legally rendered and expunged from their conscious makes no sense at all for it wouldn't be needed in the matter it shows off here for citizens would be wary of further repercussions on that night and would eventually render the need for the particular night moot on the second or third year of it's inception. That this features such a group of whacked-out individuals as these guys shown here who are clearly in it for the legalized murder rewards and have very little that shows them to be normal citizens on every other night of the year completely takes away the scare factor of them who just turn into mindless yackos without much thought. Seemingly this is a commentary on the violence in everyday society but whatever the cause it fails mightily under the inept execution because they never are seen to do anything other than chase the one individual. Rather than partaking in this night of glorious excess, they stand around lamely prancing away on the front-yard because of an ultimatum issued that ruins their credibility when they should've just barged in and taken over the way the plot really should've dictated they do. That might've generated a scary tale here but instead it turns into a lame thriller for an hour with about ten minutes of actual horror and that's not a worthwhile balance.<br/><br/>Rated R: Graphic Violence, Graphic Language and children-in-jeopardy."
"Sci-FiHorrorFan","3","1","1","14 January 2015"," What A Lame Film.
","I found this film to be generic and mediocre and I did not like it and I did not like the characters either they were a bunch of upper class selfish rich people. Most of the characters were A**holes and only cared about themselves. Where do I begin with this film well first let's start with the idea,the idea to the film is stupid and implausible and it would never happen in real life. And yes I know this is a futuristic film but even for a futuristic film it's far fetched and ridiculous. The idea to the film is one night a year all crime is legal and the government has allowed this to happen because they think it will reduce crime,there are so many things wrong with this idea I don't know where to start I guess I will start with the psycho bad guys. Now what exactly is stopping these guys from killing again? How would the government know if they killed on a day that was not purge night?. In reality the government would have No way of knowing if these people would not kill on other days that are not purge day and that's the major flaw with the story. The government is just (hopping) they will not kill for a long time until it reaches purge night. That's right they are (hopping) but they have no way of knowing if these people would go around killing on other days.these people are crazy and purge night will not stop them from killing again. Frankly I think the government are Morons. <br/><br/>Now getting on to the next problem the boyfriend character frankly I thought this guy was a total Idiot with a capital I. This guy has had problems with his girlfriend's dad they don't get along and his way of solving this problem is to go into their house on purge night with a gun and try to kill him???. Yeah that's Such a clever idea moron because your girlfriend is really going to want to be with you After you killed her father. The stupidity of that decision is mind boggling to me because all this Moron will end up doing is making his girlfriend scared of him which will then cause her to Not want to be with Him. This film is filed with dumb decision after dumb decision and it killed my brains. I found the film to be a generic home invasion story that I have seen dozens of times before,the only thing this film had going for it was Lena Heady I like her but even her good performance could not save this film from being a mess. <br/><br/>Eathan Hawke plays the father of the family and I have to say I thought his character was a jerk he was unsympathetic and only seemed to care about himself much like his character in (Sinister) what a funny coincidence. This movie seemed to be filled with jerk characters and characters that had no personality like the daughter character,you know nothing about her to even care about her and its the same with the wife character and the husband,the only character in the family I thought was decent was the son and that's only because he tried to help this guy who was in trouble on purge night and that gesture made the kid somewhat likable, it's a shame the rest of his family were not considerate and nice like he was. But whatever that's just a nitpick I know shame on me for wanting likable characters in a home invasion film so I care about what happens to them. The bad guys were laughable and Lame,they were not scary and not interesting they were just a bunch of stupid teenagers with dumb smiley face masks. Yeah because smiley face masks are REALLY going to scare me.I'm being sarcastic. If I want to see a film that's scary and has a creepy mask I will watch Halloween it's also a better movie than this. I know I should not get off topic but when a film is as bad as this film it makes me want to talk about a better movie.<br/><br/>The son helps this guy who's running away from the bad guys and he lets him into their house to hide him and then somehow the Freaks in the smiley clown masks find the guy and know he's in that house,I have no idea how they know but that's just another nitpick. The main bad guy played by (Rhys Wakefield) is so lame he does not even have a name they just call him polite leader and I'm guessing that's because he always smiles. They threaten to kill Ethan Hawkes family unless they give up the boy inside the house,they give him one hour to make a decision and at first the family hide him but then predictably the family cracks under pressure and they turn on the boy, tie him up,and try to force him outside. The family is constantly changing their minds on whether to give the boy to the bad guys and frankly it just got annoying and boring.<br/><br/>I also can not stress how laughably Crazy the bad guys were they were so over the top I found them to be a joke and they started to annoy me after a while, some of them even started dancing around the garden and playing on the swings like idiots. The film also has a really stupid twist at the end that made no sense and the ending felt unsatisfying and Weak. This Film was mediocre at best and Crap at worst not Terrible just Crap I'm sorry this was not a good film I should also mention this film tried to be scary but failed miserably it was not scary at all it was just crazy and weird.To sum things up this was a Lame Film and I would not recommend it."

Sinister and The Purge have the same gloomy look and feel and the same grim music. Both movies are unpleasant to watch. My advice is to skip it.

They were just a jumble of scenes, where members of the family were right at the process of being executed, just to be saved by someone else right out of nowhere.<br/><br/>First, the son is about to get shot in the head, and is saved by the dad, in the last second. OK, a movie gets one of that. Next scene, the mom is about to get executed by a machete, just to be saved by the neighbors in the last second. Next scene, the dad, mom and son are about to get executed, unpredictably, they are saved by the daughter! Next the friendly neighbors are about to execute the entire family, miraculously, they are SAVED! By the gun blazing hobo. M. Night Shyamalan couldn't have written better, which I'm saying sarcastically. <br/><br/>If any movie had some awesome exciting twists and turns, it's definitely not this.<br/><br/>If any movie is extremely predictable and constantly causes you to face-palm just because of sheer stupidity, this is the one."

","Now listen... this review is going to sound a bit preachy, but there's a reason why The Purge made more than 10 TIMES its budget in the opening weekend only last year.<br/><br/>With all of my reviews, I always tie in some sort of reality check as a possible inspiration for the film. The Purge comes a year after Sandy Hook and the Aurora Theater Shooting; this all coupled with a public still reeling from the Virginia Tech Massacre. I remember it like it was yesterday when a dejected Barrack Obama addressed the people on national television on December 14, 2012, when he used the Sandy Hook shooting as a way to infringe on our rights to bear arms.<br/><br/>While many viewed The Purge as a fun movie, there was actually an agenda behind it and it helped feed a movement that ultimately affected your rights as an American.<br/><br/>The advertising, the premise, and the political tension at the time is what ignited it's success and also what added to the chaos amidst a politically engaged America looking to once again rehash the issue of gun control.<br/><br/>For one night all crimes are legal and as a result all crime throughout the year is decreased; the purge. James Sandin, played by Ethan Hawke (Training Day, gun-control advocate), is a businessman that sells security systems based on the purge event. Hawke's performance was very Mark Wahlberg (another gun control advocate); homage to a comrade or past his prime? Anyway...<br/><br/>Of course everything goes awry when the obligatory child actor in a horror movie, in this one his name is Charlie ""can't sit in the corner and shut up"" Sandin (Max Burkholder), jeopardizes his family's sanctity when he disarms the security system and saves a stranger (who literally has no name, but is played by actor Edwin Hodge) from being purged.<br/><br/>The mob chasing him organizes in the front yard, and the leader who calls himself ""Henry"" (Tony Oller) amusingly threatens and demands they release the stranger or they will ""release the beast."" No more threatening words have ever been uttered by any man in history! After the cliché opening credits which is a montage of people causally shooting each other set to uplifting music, the movie quickly decomposes before your very eyes.<br/><br/>What the people remember about this movie is the premise and the shock advertising, which came at a time when America was vulnerable. What The Purge really is, is a forgettable political attack on gun rights and the activists who protect them (the National Rifle Association). If its anything at all, its at the very least terrible. In my opinion it was simply spun together to exasperate a real situation. Could've been so much better, but they just had to be political with a terrible movie..."

"carson860227","4","1","1","19 October 2014"," The Purge: Just Kill Me Now
","Welcome to, The Purge, a dystopian thriller that follows an upper class and extremely white family for an entire night! Every year the annual purge commences for 12 straight hours. All crime is legal, including murder; it's a celebratory time for statewide catharsis. The idea sounds tremendously promising, but in the end, that's all this film amounts to, a good idea.<br/><br/>James DeMonaco is the writer and director of this horrendous horror film. Once again, he as proved himself to be one of the class-c writer/directors that we love to hate. Other films that fill this man's repertory include The Kill Point, Skinwalkers, and Assault on Precinct 13. Have you heard of any of them? I certainly haven't. Its clear that DeMonaco seems to have hit the jackpot on the idea for The Purge and he's cashing in every penny it's worth.<br/><br/>This film has already cultivated an immense amount of popularity all over the country. It's turned into so much more than a movie; it's becoming a franchise. For example, the annual Halloween Horror Nights at Universal Orlando has opened their first exhibit of the year ""The Purge: Will You Survive?"" They're expecting to have tens of thousands of visitors this season. This exhibit is based on The Purge's sequel, now in theaters, Purge: Anarchy. It was released an astounding 13 months after the original. This lack of proper production tells us only one thing; that this is just Hollywood ""cash cow"" film that really doesn't attend to the more artful aspects of film just like its predecessor. <br/><br/>This film follows most of the formula that goes into the creation of a hit studio film: plenty of action, a crude love story, and the always-riveting protagonist versus antagonist relationship. The ""evils"" (the only name fitting for such an antagonist) of this story are quite the mysterious clan. They are bent on eradicating this one human ""swine"" of society. They may even be classified as the 'cleanup crew' of the lower class. When they are eventually posed against the protagonist, the results are awfully plain. <br/><br/>What really kept me watching this film was the comedy behind each character's motives and idiotic arbitrary decisions. Without spoiling too much, people do die in this film. And I'm actually relieved that they do! In fact, they really deserve the death that they had coming. It's almost as if they were shouting, ""Run! Quick! Head for the creepy and deadly graveyard!"" The dialogue doesn't amount to much either; it's unrealistic and terribly plain. The decisions that each character makes often turn on a dime. Supporting the premise that these characters are indeed, painfully stupid. When a man cannot chose, he ceases to be a man. Therefore, death in our situation is absolutely operative. <br/><br/>The film also touches on several elements of social and moral commentary. But the operative word remains ""touches on"". None of these issues are fully explored or solved. We've got the 1% vs. society exemplified in the prep school blazers faced off against the lower echelon of rank. We're also left with the desire for human catharsis. This comment surrounds the plot entirely, yet doesn't reach the audience on any type of deeper level.<br/><br/>Cinematography and plot play a massive role into what genre this movie actually falls. It battles on the brink of a thriller and horror. Certainly the freakish child's toy and the evil's circus-like masks lead us to conclude that this film is clearly classified as horror. However, it's the cinematography and plot that lead us in a different direction. Shadows, handy-cam, and the use of the elemental unknown keep everyone's eyes glued to the screen. Of course, the plot is painfully unrealistic and the action on the screen is idiotic, yet all of that is forgotten when the livelihood of our protagonist is put on the stake.<br/><br/>If you didn't catch the earlier allusion to A Clockwork Orange, I'd now like to comment on the relationship both films have with one another. Given that A Clockwork Orange is a piece of art, and quite frankly I don't believe The Purge will ever come close to what we call a classic film, I still believe certain cinematic elements are shared between the two. The ""evils"" are a clear ode to the droogs gang that pride themselves in a night of ultra-violence. The arc of each protagonists is opposite in both stories. In Clockwork, Alex is reformed to believe that a lawful life is the only way to live. Ethan Hawke's character (James) on the other hand, finds that the only way to survive is to kill the predator. In the end of both films we are left with the premise that the world we live in is kill or be killed. <br/><br/>There is one redeeming quality I find to be the clear essence of this film. That is the thought of the piece, or main idea if you will. It's inventive and riveting. That's what got the original $64.4 million worth of audience through the box office on opening weekend. However, the plot was terribly dull and unimaginative. What really upsets me is the many different (and more entertaining) roads this film could have taken. This points to how DeMonaco sacrificed many of the film's deeper elements for more action driven drama. Hopefully the many sequels this film is surely promised will fill the void. <br/><br/>In the end, I was left unsatisfied with the film. Several modes of moral and social commentary were mentioned, yet never investigated. So much more was capable of this film, and I certainly believe it fell short in its delivery. What else do you expect from a cash cow film? If you're lulled by an intriguing storyline, go ahead; spend your precious time with this poor excuse for cinema. And while you're at it, you might as well watch The Purge 2, 3 and 4."

I don't know what kind of moron made this film Or what kind of moron would like this film. AWFUL"
"MUFCOK","2","1","1","10 September 2014"," Bad.
","The Purge has an original concept & had a good marketing campaign (everywhere you looked you saw posters & advertisements). Horror/Thriller films are one of my preferred movie genres, even when horror films have big plot-holes, stupid characters & sometimes wobbly story lines, I still, more often than not, find something to enjoy and take something away from the movie experience. The Purge however was bad from start to finish; I am genuinely struggling to think of one single positive. <br/><br/>1) I was expecting a horror. A horror is designed to scare you, to give you an anxious/nervous feeling when watching or at the very least, make you jump. Did the Purge do any of those 3? No.<br/><br/>2) The characters. More often than not in horror films, there are shallow, idiotic characters that do silly things and make you wonder why they did things they did. In the Purge is this the case? Absolutely. The most irritating, annoying, dumbest characters, acted horrifically by the actors (bar one or two). The son is one of the dumbest characters I have ever had the displeasure of watching. He shuts down the security system to let a homeless man into his home, without telling or asking his parents and without a respectable motive to do so. I do like Ethan Hawke and I do believe that he is not all that bad an actor, but in the Purge he offers very little.<br/><br/>3) The storyline. Initially it was an interesting concept, original and never been done before, 20 minutes in, plot-holes were humongous. The story was boring, incredibly predictable and overly annoying. The Purge may have an interested concept but they should have at least built a decent story to go with it.<br/><br/>4) The 'Bad Guys'. Scary, mysterious, downright twisted, a psychopath with a motive. Does the purge have any of these as its villains? No. The masks of the villains are removed within 30 seconds of them being introduced which killed all suspense and mystery (see 'The Strangers' for how to do it right). <br/><br/>5) Ending. Many horror flicks have controversial endings, opinions are often divided and I can appreciate the difficulty in choosing a way to end a film of this genre. The ending of the Purge, in my opinion, is abysmal. Some people live, some people die, you don't care at all for the people who live and you certainly don't care for those who die. It feels as if they never had any ending thought out and just gave up. It is different than many other endings, but that is not a good thing. Not in the slightest.<br/><br/>The Purge is not suspenseful, it is not creepy, it is not jumpy and it is certainly not Scary. The characters are awful, acting is suspect, ending is dire & the story line is boring & unrealistic. The only thing stopping me giving this a 1/10 is the 85 minute run time. If that is the only positive you can give a movie then it has serious problems.<br/><br/>Avoid. 2/10"
"poperatzo","5","1","1","31 August 2014"," Without a doubt, the stupidest plot concept of 2014
","This isn't a horrible film. It's competently shot, somewhat competently (if distractedly) acted, and the sound is good, in that the dialog actually syncs most of the time with the actors' lips.<br/><br/>But the problem I had seeing it, which started during the first explanatory minutes and again every seven or eight minutes thereafter, is the nagging voice in my head asking, now WHY did they decide to have this Purge night again? Did responsible political leaders actually decide this was a good idea and did the media and majority of citizens actually go along?<br/><br/>""Hey honey, see this? They're going to make rape and murder legal for one night of the year and on that night the police won't come if you call them"".<br/><br/>""That's nice, dear. Be sure to pick up a gallon of milk and a dozen eggs on the way home tonight"".<br/><br/>Honestly, I'd love to have been a fly on the wall when this was pitched to studio execs. Ethan Hawke tries to enjoy himself a bit, but by the end, you get the overall impression that he's got a similar voice in his head asking what went wrong with his career that he has to do this nonsense. He made a couple of decent movies, right? Usually, you get a halfway decent concept and poor execution. This is the worst plot concept of at least this year (which is only 2/3 done!), but it's not horrible if you're able to sufficiently numb the part of your brain that handles logic and reason you may find yourself suitably stimulated by the movement and color and sound, like a baby with one of those hanging musical mobile toys. I mean, this plot is so bad, they couldn't even convince a rapper to play some small part like in most current movies. You know when 50-Cent thinks the plot is too implausible to make some easy money, you've got a stinker on your hands.<br/><br/>Go see it when it comes for less than $5 at the revival houses or stream it from your favorite service. If you lay out $50 for two full-price tickets and a large soda pop, don't come crying to me. I tried to warn you."
"sergio-arauzo","2","1","1","29 August 2014"," Between awful and horrible
","What can I say? Stupid characters, lots and lots of plot holes, predictable ending. Interesting initial idea (one night, every year, murder is legal) but stupid justification (so, if you allow them to kill one night, every psychopath, every passion crime, every murder motivated by money...just will not happen the other 364 nights....yeah, it is clear that the director and the writers knows a lot about human psychology). And, hey, we the rich ones, instead of leaving the country for vacations that day, we buy absurdly expensive and in fact completely ineffective security systems. In addition, we do not think about hire some mercenaries to protect our residential area, no, it is much better to give a gun to our absolutely idiot ten year old son. Do not lose your time with this piece of crap."
"m-d-nightz","4","1","1","24 August 2014"," Expected complexity, got something else...
","I was curious how this (unoriginal) concept would play out across an entire nation, not just in one family's home. I see that as a filmmaker's missed opportunity. <br/><br/>It's difficult to sympathize with 95% of the characters. Nobody is likable and America is just creepy. The concept itself is still in its infancy. I'm not sure how 12 hours of anything goes mayhem isn't extremely costly in terms of lives, supplies, and property damages etc.. (We're able to check costs on natural disasters and street riots which show massive debts.) So, the provided ""justification"" for the ""purge"" is a bit shallow. <br/><br/>The good: Ethan Hawke and Rhys Wakefield. Yes, yes, yes. Ethan has a great fight scene and Rhys shows us how he treats his close friends. I do appreciate the societal parallels - the wealthy being shielded and protected, while the poor remain vulnerable and disposable. It is an ugly truth and I guess this film shoves it in our faces just a bit more. The bad: Everything else.<br/><br/>Note: A much better, futuristic, population control related film with Ethan Hawke, is Gattaca. That one is terrifying."
"Vartiainen","Null","1","1","10 August 2014"," Needed to be more satirical
","The Purge starts with a concept. What if for one night in a year all crime was legal, including pillaging, vandalism, rape and murder. All of it. It's an interesting idea. Naturally it could never happen in real life, but that's not the point. It's the work of fiction to explore the possibilities, even the impossible ones, because they're all reflections of our society, our psyche as humans.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the execution leaves something to be desired, being really nothing more than an intruder horror drama. A family is locked inside their own house to escape the purging, and when everything doesn't go according to the plan, you can pretty much guess what will happen. I would have liked to see this idea explored on a larger scale, or with more attitude. Now it tries to play it safe, or perhaps too realistically. Like this is supposed to be a warning against this sort of solution.<br/><br/>Then again, all the actors do their jobs very well. Rhys Wakefield is especially amazing as a polite leader of hooligans out to purge for the night. He almost summons back the spirit of Alex DeLarge from A Clockwork Orage to possess him and bring us back that good old ultra-violence.<br/><br/>The Purge is a decent film. It had the potential to be much more, but what we end up getting has some seriously creepy imagery, the action and the horror both work and it's an interesting idea to mull over for an hour or two. Recommended for horror fans."
"jonathondenesi","3","1","1","4 August 2014"," Hit or Miss Flick, but mostly a miss.
","I will start off by stating that I quite like Ethan Hawke, give or take a couple flicks. The only reason for watching this movie was the premise, it seemed like it could go in a few different directions. Not knowing too much about what happens before watching it, I didn't have the chance to avoid it. The premise seemed like it could accommodate a variety of twists and engaging elements. I thought the idea of legalizing fun, while it wasn't the most logical plot, seemed like it could be a really fun movie. Given this wouldn't happen, I wouldn't let this logic get in the way of my judgement. I just wanted to be entertained, not shown a masterpiece by any means. However it fell short, terrible how they could ruin something with potential.<br/><br/>The acting wasn't terrible, but was not great either, I won't delve into that.<br/><br/>However, the thriller aspect of the movie was not enticing. The film featured long periods of 'attempted suspense', but came off quite cheesy at times. The last two thirds of the movie were intentionally, and brazenly dark, in the literal sense. I could understand the opportunity for some thrills in this, but it did not work out. This drew the movie out for a while, and nearly put me to sleep hoping for some a genuine adrenaline rush, but it was too cheap. The movie is highly polished, incredibly long in its feel, and stands out as just another grim Hollywood attempt for a stab at your money.<br/><br/>No substance, I wasn't expecting any regardless, but not entertaining in the slightest. Given the exception at the beginning building the story line. The ending had a twist, but a pretty weak and unimaginative one, so have fun with that thought. <br/><br/>Overall, I really wanted to like this movie, but am sadly let down. It could be a hit or miss, but I would avoid this movie at all costs, don't waste your time around trashy and cheaply written movies."
"dcobbimdb","4","1","1","22 April 2014"," Kind of a sick / demented movie
","Lot of people mention it's an ""original idea"" and such, but I didn't find it very original at all. It's pretty much a spin off of Battle Royale & Hunger games.<br/><br/>I did like the suspense aspect and the flow of the movie was good. action sequences were decent and Ethan Hawk (who I've always liked) did a decent job here, but that's about the end of my likes.<br/><br/>What I didn't like was the very concept of the plot and just thought for a movie that is trying to take itself serious the plot itself just didn't add up or wasn't realistic IMHO. I just couldn't buy the fact that there's now this Utopian America and we owe it all to this ""Purge"" day when people can unleash all that bottled up anger and go all rage crazy. I'm sorry if a day like this existed and people really did go around killing, raping, and committing other various crimes are they really all going to be able to just turn it off the next day and go back to their fairy tail lives? No way in hell. If you kill someone just because you can, it's not like it cleanses you and makes you a better person the other 364 days out of the year. That's utterly ridiculous...<br/><br/>As others have mentioned the other things that bugged me about the movie was how idiotic their kids were. Their son is a hypochondriac freak who builds a spy machine out of a tank and mutilated baby? Sorry but a kid like that needs to be in some serious therapy or a straight jacket. Not to mention a total idiot who endangers his entire family by disarming the alarm letting some stranger in the house, what an unrealistic character... The daughter is also a moron who won't group huddle with her family in a crisis situation, another unrealistic aspect... The masked gang acted like total retards to the point where it was just stupid, as did the neighbors. I don't know if they were just trying to copy A Clockwork Orange or what. It's like they were all on drugs or in some weird robot mode. I don't know if it was meant to be creepy or what but in the end it just came off as weird, unbelievable and stupid. And finally I hate to say it but Ethan Hawks character was right in that they should have just handed over the guy to the masked gang as there really was no other option other than to fight, in which odds were they would have all been killed. And as others have pointed out the dialog throughout was just weird and not natural or realistic.<br/><br/>Overall just too many unrealistic and stupid things for a movie that's trying to come across as a serious movie."

","Purge , lets see the tittle of the movie tells the story that its about releasing hatred, bad intentions on people, by killing people.The story was nice, the idea was also nice.Screenplay wasn't good at all. It could have been really good by far. Some points in the movie were just non- sense. Really i couldn't understand them at all. Like why does the kid lets the man inside. Though, man was calling for help but the by knew he could get his and his family life in danger. The boy at first should have told his dad, but he didn't. Then the group of people after the man, when asking James to return the man or they will kill him, his family with the black guy, he agreed to give him the guy, but his son Charlie still didn't wanted to return the black guy, its just ridiculous considering the situation. On the other hand the boyfriend of James daughter Zoey, sneaked into home just before lock-down when the family was at dinner met Zoey in her bedroom and told her that he was going to talk to his dad about their relationship. Zoey being so foolish not noticing that, why on annual purge did his boyfriend wanting to see her dad? And tried to kill Zoey's father but got himself killed by his father. In the end their neighbor's saved them from the group of young boys and girls and wanted to kill the family themselves. So, that they can purge by killing them. I mean that didn't their neighbor's purge by killing the young boys and girls? According to me it was a waste of time by me watching the movie. Not a good movie."
"sudokode","4","1","1","2 February 2014"," Interesting premise? Definitely poor execution.
","I really thought this might be a good movie. It has an interesting premise, unless you take 30 seconds to think it through. The government gives every citizen nearly full license to do whatever they want for 12 hours every year. I say nearly because there are ""clear"" restrictions set up in the movie by means of an emergency broadcast. They can't use certain weapons (Class 5 and higher, one would assume things like nukes or other similar WMDs) and can't harm ""government officials of ranking 10"", so one would assume the way higher-ups. The broadcast also mentioned all crime, including murder, being legal.<br/><br/>Pondering that can only bring you to one conclusion: how the hell does the entire country not fall apart? What sort of moron would think this is a good idea? Well, the creators of the film clearly thought people were stupid enough to buy into this, perhaps for some morbid curiosity crap... The problem is most people aren't going to go kill someone simply because it's suddenly legal. The film doesn't really err on the side of realistic. Sadly the premise tends to be heard as ""MURDER LEGAL GO!""<br/><br/>Aside from the premise not holding up in reality, the rest of the movie was essentially a pieced-together horror/thriller that was never really horrifying or thrilling. I did not care about the main characters. They were a bunch of rich folks with their own silly problems and absolutely no depth. And of course, lets not forget the daughter who prances around in a catholic school girl outfit for the duration of the film.<br/><br/>This movie really wanted to capitalize on extreme close-ups and the brilliant scare tactic of hiding the villains behind people's enlarged heads. I eventually found myself counting down to the next ""OMG HE'S RIGHT BEHIND YOU"" moment and actually nailed most of them. It just wasn't scary. It is still possible to make someone jump out of their seat, and I don't mind having that happen. But when you can predict those moments, it ruins the experience. As for the psychological part, it didn't really work out, especially when you want the main characters to die anyway.<br/><br/>By the end, I was hoping someone would have just dropped a nuke right on this house, but sadly that would have been against the rules. I'll give them credit though, it's hard to find a film with a $3 million budget that does this well in the box office. But clearly this is only a sign of having a rather captivating premise marketed with a decent trailer.<br/><br/>I really hope Honest Trailers picks this movie up. They'd probably enjoy making another lens flare montage."

","Such a terrific idea gone to waste. It's happened before and it will probably happen again. Sadly, with all its ""Funny Games,"" ""Assault on Precinct 13"" and ""Them"" influences, it manages to be nothing more than a boring, cliché-ridden, confused mess.<br/><br/>The premise is simple; one night a year, for 12 hours, the population of the USA have the legal right to commit any crime they desire, including murder. One man and his family have gotten rich off this programme by selling security systems to his rich neighbourhood. This year he's going to get his comeuppance.<br/><br/>what could follow is a film that explores the money made on fear and the conspicuous consumption ideology of middle class America and Europe. It's also fun to watch the bourgeoisie get what's coming to them. Instead, shortly after the 'Purge' commences, most sense and ideas go out the window: the writers can't even come up with a decent villain. <br/><br/>As soon as the 'Polite Leader' of the freaks arrives, gurning at the Ethan Hawke's terrified James through CCTV, all tension is lost. We know exactly how it will pan out and, unsurprisingly, that's exactly how it pans out. Except, well, the whole Ethan Hawke having awesome combat skills for some lily-livered business man. There's barely a whiff of danger and no game of chess played between hunter and hunted. Unlike other home invasion films (the aforementioned ones as well as ""Panic Room,"" in particular), the main characters here seem to have every idea of what is happening and every idea of how to prevent it. There's also very little to fight for in this film; Jodi Foster and Naomi Watts were both fighting for their families in their films and the poor couple in ""Them"" were fighting just to stay alive. Ethan Hawke, however charismatic, isn't fighting for the justice or injustice of ""The Purge,"" his belief in the system is never clarified and he certainly doesn't seem to be fighting for his family seeing as they all seem too cosy and miserable in their massive home. <br/><br/>Sadly, the writers don't know what to do with their cast and characters disappear and reappear on a whim, doing very little but pushing the film towards an inevitable climax. There's a homeless man who puts the gears in motion and some neighbours who are/aren't the family's saviours but they're all so inconsistent. This could have played like a more violent Hitchcock film or at the very least a smarter version of ""Mother's Day"" but fails in both aspects - too loose and underdeveloped for Hitchcock and too lacking in conviction and horror to be ""Mother's Day."" The fact that the main antagonist is cornier than Blowfeld makes the whole thing even harder to stomach - was he aiming for Michael Pitt in ""Funny Games?"" <br/><br/>All in all, the film ends criticising the violence it is based on making the protagonists nothing more than a bunch of cowards who are too afraid to stand up for their convictions. I sincerely doubt that this is the film they wanted to make."

"zzoaozz","4","1","1","3 December 2013"," Not very interesting
","Having heard many positive reviews of the Purge I watched it expecting it to be a fairly straight forward family in peril fighting for their lives type movie, something along the lines of panic room. What took me aback about half way in as I got up to get a drink without bothering to pause it, was that it was actually rather boring. Let me break it down into the good the bad and the ugly. <br/><br/>On the positive side, the premise is interesting. Once a year the government suspends all law allowing people to murder rape steal and pillage. (makes you wonder if the insurance companies have anti-purge clauses like the current anti-terrorism clauses) A little background exposition via your friendly neighborhood TV set leads us to wonder if the purge really is for the mental health of the people allowing them to release pent up aggression and violence legally or if it is all an economic ploy to get rid of the poor and sell security systems, guns, and weapons to those who can afford it. <br/><br/>Also on a good note, the character of Charlie was interesting. He did seem morally conflicted about their lifestyle and the plight of the less fortunate and his spy camera doll was one creepy little critter, ingenious really. <br/><br/>Sadly we must now go to the bad. Other than the smallest glimmer from Charlie, the characters were totally unlikable. You don't get to know the homeless bloody stranger well enough to know if he is interesting or not. He just doesn't have many lines or many scenes revealing his character's personality or humanity. The father is a jerk who only shows a few redeeming characteristics way too far into the movie to make a difference. The mother is about as deep as a blow up kiddie pool. The daughter is supposed to be a moody angsty teen in lust with an older boy but again they just kind of throw all that out in a few expository lines from mom and dad. The neighbors are almost Stepford Wives creepy from the first time you meet them yet not really as creepy as the central family. There is also not one spark between any two characters in the entire movie. The parents don't even seem to like each other, let alone love each other. There is no feeling of warmth between either of them and the children, or between the siblings. Even when the daughter is fooling around with her boyfriend Henry, she seems about as engaged as someone watching the paint on the ceiling dry. The movie was also boring visually. Most of it takes place in what looks like a enormous rich house on the outside and looks like any boring suburban split level on the inside. Even the art on the wall and the furniture arrangements were so very, very middle class that the very idea of the neighbors feeling that they were uppity, just fell flat. <br/><br/>And now the ugly, and by that I mean the atrocious acting. The characters are flatter than a pancake, played with a sort of listless boredom that infects the viewer as well. The father comes across as plastic, the mother as bored. The daughter is completely unrealistic as a teen as is her boyfriend. The neighbors and the gang of rich thugs were as overblown and cliché as actors in a parody. They had no place in a serious movie at all. The acting was honestly about what you would expect in a high school play. I except the characters of Charlie and the bloody stranger from this criticism. Charlie seemed rather distant, but there seemed to be some potential there and the stranger as stated before wasn't on screen enough to judge. He seemed a fairly competent actor when he was so I suspect he may actually have some talent. <br/><br/>This movie was a complete and total waste of time. Most of the action is just gun shots in a dark room and over acting thugs. The characters are too poorly played to bring any drama into the script. I am not sure who failed this movie, the director, the casting company, the actors themselves.... but this movie as a whole fails completely. It is not entertaining."

","...one of those films that will easily pass an hour and a half if you have got nothing better to do. Do not expect anything great, it is just a fun film that did not annoy me too much. There is two jump scenes, and a few freaky moments, all due to the masks. It looks like the characters were taken straight out of the video game Bioshock put into the costumes of 20 something year old California rich kids, watered down a bit for a bigger audience. <br/><br/>The story is mostly completely predictable, you can get it all from the trailers, a few twists but once the first one comes the rest are obvious. The characters are quite useless, with the exception of Lena Heady and the homeless guy the kid saved (you never find out who he is, which I found quite interesting). Every other character is a cliché, and not too bright either. This is where the spoilers come in (I only give away the middle), so ignore the rest of this paragraph if you do not want to know. After the ""Freaks"" outside cut the power to the house, threatening them to get the homeless guy back so they can kill him, the family go looking for him. When they find him, he is already quite injured from the ""Freaks"" before he was saved. To tie him up Lena Heady had to stab his injury with a letter opener. The Daughter character freaks out about this with all the ""look at us"" stuff that will make you sigh. Ethan Hawke decides to fight instead. He does not want to allow this guy to die, instead he will risk the life of his family and kill half a dozen people instead. It is never explained how they got inside the house, you hear some large pick-ups revving and some chains at the front door, then all the windows are open through the house. This ridiculous plot moment is why I knocked the rating down to 5/10. It would have been 3 or 4 but I liked the twist that comes later. <br/><br/>The acting was not bad, most of them did not have much opportunity for that anyway, it was kept mostly to moody stares and a few scares anyway. Lena Heady is the only one working hard. There is not much in the way of music, sound or special effects. Some of the lighting was a bit weird (the power went off early) there is a few moments in conversation when they just had to shine a torch in each others face, most people would not care for how impractical that would be. It is a fun film in moments, I jumped once (I do not remember the last time that happened) if you are wanting to watch this with some friends that bit will be good fun. Make sure you are good friends anyway, you wont be impressing anyone with this film."

","The premise of the film is cool. One night a year the masses can create whatever mayhem they wish. In better writers and directors hands, this could have been a genre classic like Saw. It had all the potential to be scary and on the edge watching. Instead it has silly canned characters, poorly constructed scares and plot twists you see a mile a way. I especially disliked the 1950s styling of the family unit in a future society. Gimme a beak! Father Knows Best Leave it to Beaver kinda crap with the word penis thrown in for naughtiness. Ethan Hawke was so obviously ""acting"" it was ridiculous. The other actor's were good especially the son. The actor who played the ring leader of the maniacs was also menacing. Throughout the course of the film, characters just disappear for no apparent reason. Half the time, I didn't know where I was in the house where all the story takes place. I didn't jump once.

"LawnBoy-4","4","1","1","15 November 2013"," Right idea - wrong execution
","Oh, what could have been. <br/><br/>Had the powers that be (including the producer of ""Paranormal Activity"") taken what was a very intriguing idea and done something OTHER than apply the tired ""Paranormal Activity"" treatment to it, this film could have be far more satisfying and original. As it stands, ""The Purge"" is a predictable, formulaic and gimmick-riddled mess of a film and a a frustrating waste of a good idea.<br/><br/>You know a film is destined for failure when, barely ten minutes into the film, you find yourself scripting your own version while audibly and repeatedly exclaiming, ""this could have been so much better if they had just..."". This film should have been MUCH darker, MUCH more sinister and MUCH more impactful than it was. <br/><br/>You've read the synopsis, so I won't rehash. Instead, I'll touch on a few points that significantly contributed to the film's lack of success:<br/><br/>1. As soon as the power was cut, it became immediately apparent that the ""Paranormal Activity"" treatment was now in full effect and that the one trick pony film makers were going to attempt to scare me with silhouettes, flashlight-lit closeups of faces and various ""gotchas"" that pop out of the darkness. As such, any hope for original, visually striking impact for the remainder of the film would be fleeting, at best. <br/><br/>2. Watching the first person perspective of the kid's robot rolling down the hallway hearkened (slightly) to the similar effect and perspective of Danny in ""The Shining"" as he rolled down the hallways of The Overlook on his Big Wheel. Why is this significant? Because it made me wonder what this film could have been had it been made 30 years earlier under the tutelage of Stanley Kubrick. Think of the possibilities, then become instantly suicidal upon witnessing what ultimately transpires on screen.<br/><br/>3. The basic idea behind The Purge (as a concept) is that, if the ""undesirables"" are killed off during that one fateful evening each year, the rest of society will continue to live in a world (or, at least, nation) of economic harmony, perpetually upward mobility and supposed bliss without having to traipse amongst the unwashed. Despicable as that notion is, as a premise for a film, it lends itself to cheap, easy emotional attachment to, and sympathy for, the ""have nots"" while instilling resentment of the ""haves"" without having to invest too much time in character development or establishment of motives. <br/><br/>That is, of course, if it's done....right.<br/><br/>In the end, it was extremely difficult to muster any sympathy or contempt for anyone in this film because the supposed and logical object of empathy (the victim who sought refuge) was off screen for so much of the film, that you actually forgot about him until his (in retrospect) highly predictable reappearance wherein he ultimately ""saves the day"" for the family. Huzzah.<br/><br/>4. The perpetrators were led by a reasonably effective sadist (whose character could have been given much more to work with), however, as a unit, they essentially functioned as nondescript, throwaway extras. When evil exists as a group, the inherent evil of members other than the leader needs to be established and believable. I will point you to the original ""Last House on The Left"" and ""The Devil's Rejects"" as the only examples needed for the illustration of this point.<br/><br/>Overall, a mess of a film and a complete waste of a decent premise."
"Bob_the_Hobo","4","1","1","12 November 2013"," Brilliant Concept Bogged Down Under It's Own Weight
","In 2022, the United States has been overtaken by a new legion of Founding Fathers who implement a twelve hour period of near-complete lawlessness aimed at allowing citizens to properly vent frustration built up over the year. The Sandin family, led by patriarch James (Ethan Hawke) has a fancy security system designed to keep the violence out and the family safe inside, but that all changes when son Charlie allows sanctuary to a homeless man fleeing a band of murderous freaks.<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is an absolutely brilliant movie concept that gets so bogged down in the weight of its own message that it reverts to an average-at- best action-horror flick. The script sees fit to introduce a fascinating idea, that of a night of pure terror sanctioned by the government, and the ramifications that bad decisions can bring. It tries to prove violence as an answer to pent up emotion, but gives little payoff for the few humane enough to say 'no' to the destruction. <br/><br/>The biggest problem here is simple explanation. Just throw in a sentence here and there to explain the following; Is it really beneficial to the economy to allow people to use extreme measures to do whatever they want? If buildings collapse or manual workers are killed, what happens to profits? Are taxes at sky-high rates to pay for all the wounded receiving treatment afterwards? Little things so unexplained. Why is the rebellious boyfriend even in the script, what did he do to advance the plot? He is forgotten by the end. <br/><br/>Acting wise, Ethan Hawke does a good job as the father trying to protect his wife and family. Yet you'd think, for a security salesman, he would implement a fail safe or two preventing young kids from opening intricate home defense systems with the touch of a button. Lena Headey is breathtaking and makes a great heroine, but she seems to have the bare minimum interest in her children's well being, not even knowing where either of them are for most of the film. Rhys Wakefield makes for a creepy but unmemorable villain. <br/><br/>This is a decent movie and worth a rental. It will make you think, but not of the morality or immorality behind the Purge. Instead you'll be scratching your head as to the incompetency of the Sandins. Perhaps diverting your attention from the inhumanity of the Purge is the point."

","Seeing the THE PURGE's rating here and on Amazon, I didn't get my hopes too high. I found it compelling and watchable enough, decently acted, and professionally filmed. Otherwise, it was something of a let-down.<br/><br/>As many others have noted, THE PURGE has a very original premise, and there's a lot more that the makers of this film could have done with it. Some of the various themes regarding contemporary America--classism, nationalism, gun-obsession, neighborhood relations and competition, etc--also begged for a little more development. But in the end, THE PURGE just becomes another run-of-the-mill shoot-'em-up fest.<br/><br/>It would have done miracles for this film if it had begun a few days BEFORE ""Purge Night,"" giving a little more background on the Sandin family's relationship with their neighbors, dad's business relationship with the community, and daughter Zoey's forbidden relationship with boyfriend Henry. That way, what happens during ""Purge Night,"" especially at the very end, would be better-earned and make a lot more sense."

","I marked this at 7 before reading other reviews but feel that it does have it's positives.<br/><br/>I do agree that the execution was frustrating and there were many plot holes. In addition most of the characters are quite shallow and do stupid things.<br/><br/>However the actual idea is original and does allow the viewer time, as some of the action is signposted miles ahead, to think about the social implications of a twelve hour period where you can do anything without reproach. Would it cut crime and lets face it the film looks at the violent side of the purge idea. But imagine if you had a window to sort out differences - hopefully in a no-violent way. It may lead to revenge attacks and two wrongs never make a right but think of the flip side. Traffic wardens/car salesmen and the tax officials would have a very uncomfortable night once a year.<br/><br/>Where the film falls down in my mind is not the stupid actions of the children and parents, as there would be a substantial amount of panic in the house which may lead to the group breaking away from each other and/or doing irrational things, is that it had the opportunity to explore the premise more but copped out of it. On hindsight I think my rating of 7 is too high so will reduce to 5."
"TheSeaLion","3","1","1","20 October 2013"," This had so much potential
","When I first heard about this movie, I thought it was going to be great. The premise was one I had never heard before; all crime is legal for twelve hours including murder and we get to witness it happen. While simple it is a premise that we have never seen before and had a lot of potential to be good. What did they do? They turned it into another home invasion movie. That's right, they take a new premise and turn it into something we have seen a thousand times. Who knew you could make a new idea feel old on the first try?<br/><br/>From the previews, it looks like a good movie, but when you actually watch it, the film does a terrible job in covering up the plot holes and nonsensical motivations of the characters. Throughout the whole movie, I was questioning how the Purge actually benefited the economy and people. Guess what, it is never explained. They just expect us not to ask these questions that would help us understand motivation in the movie and then it goes unexplained.<br/><br/>The characters in the film are horrible. The only characters I was routing for in any way was the man the man the son lets in because he did not deserve what was happening, and the father because he was the only character with an actual personality. The film kept pretending that its characters were deep when they really weren't. They were blank slates to fit in an opposing view on everything, but it was not done in a good way. All they do is question the other people and not put out any good arguments for their point.<br/><br/>If I were to make a suggestion of how to make the movie better, I would say do not follow the people in the house who are fighting off the invaders. Follow the person being hunted or the people participating in the Purge to see what is motivating them to take part in it. The motivations are unexplained or nonsensical, there are numerous plot holes that are impossible to look past, and the characters are uninteresting.<br/><br/>I would say only see this movie if you are looking for a bad film to watch at a Halloween party that everyone can laugh at because this is all this film is good for."

","The premise is pretty simple but very effective. It's supposed to say something about society overall, but is still a fun movie to watch. Well let's say entertaining, because fun might be stretching it for some. I'm surprised about the current 5.5 this movie has here though, especially because this was a big success in America. So big in fact, it will spawn a sequel in (probably) 2014.<br/><br/>The movie treats the idea as if you might not have read the reviews, so you won't get thrown into the mix right away (maybe the sequel will do that). It will tell you what you are about to watch. The really amazing thing, which might have elevated the movie a lot more, is Ethan Hawkes character. The way he portrays him and he is written, with an arc and a clear structure is not something you get to see often in movies like this one. It's refreshing and a nice touch to the whole thing. Having said that, the movie is not entirely without surprises. Good Night and Good Luck indeed!"

Second of all, this was supposed to be a horror movie, the only cringe moment was when the mother used the letter opener in the man's wound. This whole thing was disturbing. That's it. This whole scenario is disturbing. To just kill people for no reason and call it a ""sacrifice"" for the country, they left bodies everywhere for no reason and when the neighbors came to kill off the family, they were getting ready to stab them to death.

"paulandthea","4","1","1","20 June 2013"," The Purge (2013) Review
","The film is set in March of 2022. The basic premise of this movie is that on one night a year for 12 hours (7pm- 7am) all emergency services are suspended and all crime, including murder, is legal, a law introduced by the new president (name undisclosed) within his first month in office. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is the top salesman for a company that produces high end home security systems which are specifically used for the night of The Purge. Him and wife Mary Sandin (Lena Headey) are full supporters of The Purge because of the low crime rate and unemployment that the it has created, however they are not participants of it. They have two children Charlie (Max Burkholder) and Zoey (Adelaide Kane). James and his family are so exaggerated in their behaviours that I almost felt compelled to like them; it's as if the directors had stuck a massive label over the top of the family saying ""People We Like."" Each character also did not feel cohesive as a family; each child had different mannerisms and traits which were not portrayed in either parent. As well as the parents having a sickly sweet and unbelievably perfect marriage.<br/><br/>Unfortunately for this film, the viewer is left dissatisfied within mere minutes of the film starting due to the very poor and unconvincing acting styles of Mr Hawke. His enthusiasm and friendly persona are overwhelming for the introduction of the character. Although being enthusiastic works to his advantage during some surprisingly brutal action scenes, one of the only places where DeMonaco's directing came to any good; the action scenes seemed to be the only part of the film that was believable. I will maintain that the acting from the fairly unknown cast was not all that bad, Lena Headey delivered a somewhat average performance, although this is more due to bad writing more than her particular style; a very dull and very typical mother character. Rhys Wakefield, who plays the ""Polite Stranger"", delivers the best performance of the film. His creepy and annoyingly cheerful personality is about the only thing which creates terror throughout the film. <br/><br/>The film is set in a wealthy suburban area with little knowledge as to whether this in a town, village or city, however, I think the important part of the setting lies within us knowing it is a wealthy area. It is also set at night, a concept also not easy to grasp, because if all crime is legal there is no need to sneak around at night, so why not the day? I do accept that this is done for the purpose of it being a horror, although I do find it unnecessary in terms of supporting the film's basic premise. I find that the setting does not add anything to the fear aspect of the film; in fact I think a rural setting would quite possibly be more beneficial for this element and would create a lot less plot holes.<br/><br/>One major problem I had with this film is the amount of horror styled elements the movie tries to incorporate. It's creepy, it's supernatural, it's sci fi, it's gory, it's terror, etc. This makes the film very confusing in terms of what you should actually be afraid of. It also creates complicated and unnecessary questioning as to what genre the film actually falls into; the possibilities being horror, thriller or action. This ""too much going on"" theme runs throughout the films plot too; so I guess we can slightly applaud the film for having a sense of cohesion. Another problem I found myself is that the film runs on ""no bad guy"" system; how can we be angry at characters that are just doing what they are legally allowed to do? It is their right to purge just as much as the Sandin family have the right not to purge. For me personally, it does not make me feel empathy towards any ""good guys"".<br/><br/>The films initial premise excites me to an extent as many of us, myself included, sit there and wonder whether such a concept could work in society. However, throughout the film, many decisions made by the neighbours in the suburb do make me question the premise. For example, there are no safe zones, only citizens of class 10 or higher are exempt, this includes the government. So even those who do not wish to take part, still have to pay the high cost to install security systems. Although this concept is addressed within the film where they state that a minority of people think the Purge is a way for the government to eradicate the poor. <br/><br/>I was highly disappointed with this film as I thought we may have finally had a horror movie with a decent writing crew to deliver a cohesive movie with little plot holes, but we have been given the opposite. Overall acting: poor, directing: poor, writing: poor, all of these elements deliver an unsatisfying cinema experience. I hope that no sequel is attempted with the left over rubble of this car crash."
"zdh952","4","1","1","19 June 2013"," Tolerable, Absolutely Tolerable.
","""Tolerable"" is the best compliment i can give this movie. It did a good job of showing a ""Lord of the Flies"" style breakdown of morals of a nice and smiley suburban white family. But every move this movie wanted to make was so forshadowed so heavily that nothing was a surprise. Which could be useful in a movie where the entire cast is bland as toast.<br/><br/>The ""villains"" are about as intimidating as a troupe of toddlers with squirt guns and even the parts that were meant to convey menace or unease (the masks the villains wore, for instance) honestly came across as funny and not scary. There were one or 2 points where the tension was right, but this was few and far between.<br/><br/>My main complaint is that this movie goes NO WHERE. From the time The Purge starts, 30 minutes in, until the closing credits, the stakes are not raised at all. Nothing happens to increase tension or make you wonder ""how will they make it"". Again this is as much a fault of the heavy handed forshadowing as anything, but I still feel a movie needs to increase the stakes in the last 20 minutes or so to keep it interesting and this movies remains lifeless for the last hour.<br/><br/>As I saw before, this movie was funny, very funny at some points. But this is not a comedy and I laughed at it as much as I did with it. 4/10 because while it had problems, these problems weren't terrible, just gave the movie an over all uniteresting quality."
"BharatSamra","6","1","1","18 June 2013"," A Unique Premise, Spoiled By Descent Into Idiocy
","Even with an extremely strong and enticing premise at the forefront to paint over the array of farcical stupidity and predictability, The Purge's core foundation that caused audiences to stop and stare is unable to completely gloss over the film's plethora of flaws as they seep through the cracks. The finishing coat that is the idea behind the film does just about enough to prevail and not fade away to the questionable layers beneath it. The Purge follows a family's struggle on one very 'special' night of the year; a night in the near future, where all crime is legal (including murder) and emergency services are disbanded for a period of twelve hours, which has radically reduced crime and allows for economic prosperity throughout the rest of the year. That premise alone intrigues via only a simple synopsis, and in the film, this fascinating night just about maintains what could have been a disastrous and laughable trip to the cinema, as a moderately enjoyable one.<br/><br/>The Purge successfully creates its world in the opening title sequence. You instantly believe and accept the film's set-up and despite some annoying characters, the film undeniably has your attention, if only for a little while longer. The greatest feature of The Purge is its ability to remain relevant, before, during and after seeing it. While many may remember it for the wrong reasons, it can certainly impress by encouraging the audience to consider during to themselves, and ask aloud to those around them after, ""What would you do in that situation?"" The trailer reveals the family's son as a young and somewhat idealistic figure whom opens the family's security system to allow an unknown victim of the purge to find solace in their home. Would you risk your own safety for the potential rescue of a wounded stranger? These are the kinds of questions that The Purge elicits very triumphantly, and it is nothing but a shame that these social, moral issues were not delved into more critically. The Purge is a film that should be remade into a drama/thriller piece, taken more seriously and produced more coherently to restore its purpose that got lost along the way of this 2013 supposedly 'horror' effort. It doesn't really warrant the categorisation of horror, due its lack of fear inducing power other than a couple of jump scares.<br/><br/>The Purge manages to defy logic and reason on multiple levels, and not the levels that one would expect it to. The film in fact has a very convincing, albeit radical, premise that you adopt as reality, and with its rising action to maintain a sense of intensity rather than fear, The Purge disappoints by behaving foolishly elsewhere. First and foremost, the decisions of certain characters make little to no sense, leaving the audience to ponder over their judgement, rather than remain engaged with the film itself. Additionally, The Purge treats, or more so mistreats its audience very condescendingly, to the extent that you actually question whether the filmmakers just gave up trying to convince anyone of anything half way through production. There are countless instances of characters being save 'just in the nick of time', and it becomes frustratingly disappointing as after the first successful try, they just continue to demean all viewers by creating a idiotically predictable plot that a toddler could decipher in seconds.<br/><br/>On the arrival of that moment in The Purge when you come to the realisation that it failed to live up to expectation and is disregarding so much logic and reason that you think at any time gravity might be dismissed, then you can finally just have fun with the film. Despite its refreshing premise, The Purge breaks its promise of being an inviting social commentary and becomes a simply disappointing yet watchable slasher-like flick.<br/><br/>Oddly, I would have to concede that in spite of all of my hate for The Purge's silliness, woeful acting by some, and the frustrating delusional mentality of many of its characters, the film is overall still reasonably enjoyable and not completely worthless. In fact, it is certainly worthwhile, which is exclusively attributable to the conception of the foundational idea that is required to juggle the remaining frightful (not in the intended manner) features of the film, whilst balancing itself. Unfortunately, many of these features are such abysmal that The Purge's premise can only handle so much responsibility, and many of these disastrous elements of the film fall to the ground, in the mud, where they belong. Nonetheless, The Purge is memorable for its highly unique criminological approach that maintains intrigue throughout most of the film, and shall perhaps linger importantly for its impressive aptitude for giving the audience something to debate amongst themselves after walking out of the 85 minute feature."

However, I find it difficult to be entertained when my intelligence is being insulted at every turn. How difficult could it be to write in some plausible explanations for the obvious problems this film rubs in our faces? Consider the absurdity of the home security system which is supposedly designed to keep the wealthy safe from the mayhem outside. One clipped wire from an easily accessed box outside and the home owner is left with no power. These families go through the purge every year and nobody considered a safeguard to the main power or a backup generator? How about the steel reinforcements for the doors and windows? The only tools necessary to breach this state- of-the-art technology, is a 20 year old dodge truck and a chain? Who is this security system designed to keep out? The family has no contingency plans for a break-in? No safe room? The father who is an expert on home security, haphazardly leaves the pass code for entry unguarded so that his 12 year old can open it on the most dangerous night of the year? This family must endure this madness year after year, but as they are eating dinner, they active the security as an afterthought within two minutes of the start of the purge? The kids pick some great hiding places don't they? The closet and under the bed...yea, the bad guy would never check there."

","As a premise The Purge threatens to be something special - in the near future there is a 12 hour window once a year when all crime is legal, i.e. anything goes. With that set up there are any number of tantalising stories that could've been pursued so it's disappointing to report that we are treated to little more than a bog standard 'family protecting their home' plot that has been explored so often in film. <br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays James Sandlin, a home security salesman and therefore held in high regard, particularly around the time when the next 'Purge' is to occur. With a stereotypical movie family at home he locks the place down for the annual 12 hour crime fest that will take place far away from their gated community haven. Except someone else is in the house and their quiet neighbourhood isn't quite as tranquil as they would hope. <br/><br/>It is sadly all rather mundane with perfunctory performances from all involved, including Hawke whose eclectic career is littered with occasional forgettable roles such as this. Things do get slightly more interesting as the tension is cranked up towards the finale but to its detriment it insists on hammering home the moralistic conundrum that is the purge itself rather than just accepting the premise for what it is. <br/><br/>The ending is telegraphed right from the opening scenes and you are simply left with a feeling of nice idea but where's the rest of it?"
"MissMuppet1995","6","1","1","9 June 2013"," Too Predictable
","I loved the idea of the film, there has never been another film with this idea before. So the idea of 'The Purge' was brilliant. The film started off good, and I know quite a few people will agree. But as the film progressed it got more and more predictable.<br/><br/>*I wouldn't read this unless you have seen it or don't mind a spoiler* When the son, Charlie, is hiding in the basement and keeping a flashlight and his eyes on the door, well you can guess what is going to happen. Even though me and my friends were expecting some kind of jump scare it still made us jump when this face popped in front of the screen. Towards the end, Mary, Grace and 3 others are sat round a table with Mary guarding a gun, waiting for the end of The Purge. Grace goes to grab the gun while Mary isn't looking and Mary just hits her with it, in the face. I mean we were all expecting Mary to put a bullet through Grace's head, but she didn't, which was a little disappointing. Some of the moments in the film for very predictable and you could easily guess what was going to happen, including the jump scare in the basement, Zoey's boyfriend attempting to shoot her dad and when they didn't throw the guy out of there house and they started to fight.<br/><br/>There were also a few silly and stupid moments in the film which make you go, ""Why the hell did they do that?"" and ""Why didn't they do ... instead?"" One of these moments was when James Sandin (Hawke) didn't give the stranger (Hodge) out to the group that were after him. His family's safety should have been more important that someone he doesn't know and he put all their lives at risk to save the stranger. The dialogue was not fantastically written. There are a few other things wrong about this film, but you probably have to watch it to understand.<br/><br/>So overall the film was OK, I guess. It could of been a lot better though and I probably would watch it again, but it isn't one of those films that I would pay to go and see in the cinema more than once."

Sadly, this movie didn't do too well in that aspect.<br/><br/>I expected some rich family locking the house for 'the purge' and the door getting forcefully kicked in by a giant mob of people, hoping to loot the house, or perhaps just seeing an overview of the 'purge'. However, it's yet another generic hide and seek type of horror film, consistently shoving overused horror clichés in your face.<br/><br/>I can see how people would enjoy it, it's decently made and can defiantly be called a horror film.

"Woodyanders","8","4","9","29 November 2013"," A taut and gripping thriller
","In the near future, all crime is perfectly legal for twelve hours on a single day of the year. The affluent Sandin family find themselves in great danger on purge night when they allow a bloodied stranger (well played by Edwin Hodge) who's the target of a murderous mob to seek shelter in their home. Writer/director James DeMonaco relates the fresh and compelling premise at a brisk pace, builds a tremendous amount of claustrophobic tension, ably crafts a dark grim tone which becomes more increasingly bleak and upsetting as the harsh story unfolds towards a shattering conclusion, and pulls out all the pulse-pounding stops for the harrowing last third. Moreover, this picture gains additional potency from its sharp and confrontational exploration of how American society favors the rich and thus puts the poor at a cruel disadvantage to be easily victimized by the upper class (in an especially bold and inspired touch, the stranger is ultimately revealed as a homeless war veteran), how pent-up rage and aggression gives people a frightening capacity for extreme violence and brutality, the alarming lengths a person is willing to go to save one's own life and protect your loved ones, and how ""cathartic"" violence causes more problems than it solves. The excellent acting by the tip-top cast keeps the movie humming: Ethan Hawke as straight-arrow nice guy patriarch James Sandin, Lena Headey as James' concerned wife Mary, Max Burkholder as naive son Charlie, Adelaide Kane as sulky and rebellious teenage daughter Zoey, Arija Bareikis as sweet neighbor Mrs. Grace Ferrin, and Chris Mulkey as the jolly Mr. Halverson. Rhys Wakefield contributes a splendidly creepy and smarmy turn as a calm smooth-talking psycho preppie gang leader. Jacques Jouffret's slick widescreen cinematography makes expert use of shadowy lighting. Nathan Whitehead's spare shivery score does the nerve-rattling trick. A real tense and startling nail-biter."
"hampus_granberg","10","4","9","26 October 2013"," The most provocative yet deep and question movie in this modern age
","I was surprised by how deep this concept really struck me, from the simple yet totally bizarre idea that once a year, America, will have one single night of total criminal legalization to outweight the violence and murder that used to be a common fact before the idea was put to action. As it so happens, the statistics has changed over the years, and shows that all kinds of criminal activity has decreased rapidly due to the very fact that people are allowed the pleasure to purge themselves from impulsive and aggressive behavior on this very special night.<br/><br/>But, that is not the only thing that seem to change with this anual festivity. According to other sources, viewed upon as a ""everyone has their own opinions"" thing, the purge does not only work itself through anger management, but simultaneously erradicating any kind of humanity as poverty decreases due to the lack of affordance to the same kind of barricades the upper class has the means to procure.<br/><br/>What it all boils down to is formed perfectly throughout the movie saying that the purge does not rid the world of aggression, but actually supports evil to manifest itself in the psyche of every single individual participating in this vile and abhorrent ritual.<br/><br/>The ones that partake show no remorse of killing, and rather, religiously, delve in the very thankful gift of the founding fathers that came up with this barbaric idea, giving them the strength to go on, and support an ideal society. It shows that homicidal psychopathy is not a trend, but rather a natural behavior sinking discreetly into every human being, infectious and ruthless, til the point when none can tell the difference, ultimately resulting in a world were caring and understanding does not exist.<br/><br/>The purge (in the movie) has gotten responses from a fraction of mankind, people that still carry a conscience, saying that it is wrong, and has only supported a callous and harsch future, not dissimilar from how the real world looks today. It is a great metaphor for cruelty and egoism that revolves around the supposedly none existing upper class in todays society, saying that equality is a fact of our times, yet in real life unknowingly supports total materialism over the well-being of humanity as a whole.<br/><br/>The Purge takes the face of ""the American dream"" and rips it open turning the under-belly inside out showing the true face of greed and primal instinct.<br/><br/>This is not a review as much as it is an analysis of a subtle, yet extraordinary message, imagined as a cruel and distorted jest of real life, very parodic, yet with a perfect serious tone that really grips your sences.<br/><br/>As for the rest, I can only say, it was a good movie, no matter the acting or the scripture, but still, I guess it flowed so naturally that there's nothing to analyze from an objective stand-point, but rather a moral one. I think it is important that these kind of movies exist, not to scare us or makes us feel satisfied afterwards, but to stop us, make us sit down, and think about what it really means to be human.<br/><br/>Feel free to have another read after you've seen it. As I've said, it is an experience, more than just a flick, so, prepare I guess, or don't, just indulge in it, and hopefully learn something useful from it.<br/><br/>Have a good one!"

","I don't know why the low marks and crappy reviews on here, I admit I'm not a big fan of paranormal atrocities (activities), but I really enjoyed this movie, people on here complaining it could've been so much better, then why don't they re-make it? I thought it was well executed, and a bit scary, the characters were a bit dull, but hey it's a horror movie, not classical Shakespeare for god's sake! There are a few nice twists and unexpected moments and it kept me glued to the screen, which is no mean feat, as I get older a lot of movies have the 'seen it before' syndrome! This was a refreshingly creepy movie with a unique story line, so don't be put off by the mostly awful reviews on here, I recommend it and hope you enjoy it as much as I did!"
"Hey_Sweden","6","3","6","19 January 2014"," Entertaining, but nothing special.
","The filmmakers here, led by writer / director James DeMonaco, get your attention with an effective ""hook"" but then don't develop things as interestingly as one might hope. It's too bad, because as others have said, the material *did* have potential, but ultimately this is a Hollywood product where nuance is shoved aside in favour of a familiar siege / home invasion type scenario. That's not to say that the film is incompetently made - it's slick and watchable, with some decent suspense and jump moments, as well as a bit of gore - but the viewer will likely end up thinking that they've seen all this before.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke, who'd starred in the ""Assault on Precinct 13"" remake that DeMonaco had written, is front and centre here as James Sandin, a salesman for a security system company. He and his family live in a future year (2022, to be exact) where the government thinks it's figured out how to channel the aggressive instincts of its citizens - allow them a 12 hour period once every year, dubbed a ""purge"", where all crime is permitted and people can release all of their pent up hostility. Sandin and his loved ones get caught up in an untenable situation when his son Charlie (Max Burkholder) gives sanctuary to a wounded stranger (Edwin Hodge), whose tormentors, led by a well spoken young man (Rhys Wakefield) soon come calling.<br/><br/>What's going to lose some members of the audience is the fact that, as in so many films of this kind, the characters act in order to serve the purpose of the story rather than act sensibly. Still, it does get ones' bloodlust boiling; people may end up wishing that this dumb family bites it as violently as their enemies do. By the end, it's hard not to be yelling at the screen.<br/><br/>The actors do what they can with the script and dialogue. Co-starring are the always watchable Lena Headey as the wife / mother, Adelaide Kane as the bratty, sullen daughter, Arija Bareikis as annoying neighbour Grace, and veteran Chris Mulkey as area local Mr. Halverson. The standout is clearly Australian actor Wakefield, who's chillingly civil as the leader of the gang.<br/><br/>This film does kill time fairly well but it's inevitably going to let some viewers down. Maybe things will get a little more intriguing in the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>Six out of 10."

I personally would get upset as a character, especially if I was one of those dumb characters. I never bothered to write a review for movies before until I saw this movie -- that says a lot.

"pjr235","1","3","6","28 July 2013"," Success? Really?
","What movie/box-office-success!? I'm gonna say right now that I'm a movie watcher and a bit of a winter. I may not be Steven King but I have at least an above average understanding on what it takes to make a story work and I think some may understand when I say that I stopped watching at about 55mins in and simply walked away.<br/><br/>Everything is completely unbelievable. I don't wanna write 2 pages on why I think that is - but damn! From the moment that the black guy - no from before the moment that the bum was even on-screen, and that stupid little over-privileged boy decided to give up the safety of his entire family. 5 for 1 is not a good trade in anyway you look at it.<br/><br/>And the stuck-up brat of a daughter who's too hot in her pants to even see straight, doing everything she can to get captured and raped by this 'intruder.'<br/><br/>I don't even like this movie but lets entertain the idea of it. Do they not understand what kind of animals and freaks come out on that night? Do the kill cams not make it clear enough for them every single year? Does the prissy education they receive not teach them why it is important to simply lock the fkn doors and wait out 12 hours in an entire year? heck, they can sleep most of that time off! Was the daughter so insanely hot for Dick that she was willing to get raped? Could they actually be so stupid? <br/><br/>This movie would have made sense telling a story of survivors that are outside the comforts of such a privileged life and security. But for some reason, every person turns on the father who has given them safety and security in more than one way. Every single one of the characters wanted a piece of the Purge action, else they wouldn't have been so stupid as to do everything they did.<br/><br/>After the 'boyfriend' of the daughter was shot and the girl went missing with the intruder in the house, how is it that they spent time looking at the cams, talking and acting like its okay that shes alone in the house with an unknown man on the night of the purge. Why where they not all tearing at the doorknobs to go find her. Instead they sat and had to tell the audience the game plan - show through action Mr. Director, everyone knows a fathers instinct is to go out search and kill to get his daughter back.<br/><br/>I could rage on and on about the stupidity of this movie. The boy betrays his father and families security twice by helping the bad man to get in and then help him hide. Why?<br/><br/>This movie twists too many stupid angles and is only possible if every single character becomes completely stupid and looses all sense of self preservation for no real good reason. I'm not an a-hole and I can't imagine living in a world like that - but I sure understand the darkness of humanity that can be released on a night like that (the cam snippets at the opening credits as some PG examples to how bad it could actually get) horrors so unspeakable it could only be mentioned or hinted at to keep people from puking their guts out at the beast that is humanity without law, order and civility.<br/><br/>Please if you are reading this, skip this over-rated trash. If it even made sense and had some kind of intelligence to it, I'd say give it a go because everyone has their own cup of tea. But this thing (not a movie) is so loosely put together and had to take away so much to make itself work that it's beyond an atrocity that it was able to be called a movie. Its like a couple of High School kids wrote the script. Interesting idea - yeah maybe - stupid characters and an even dumber execution.<br/><br/>I would instead point your attention to an 'ol movie called Panic Room with Jodie Foster and Kristen Stewart (2002) at least this movie made sense and it was about them outsmarting the bad guys, not about being as stupid as they can to get themselves killed like in this movie. Kristen IDR what her characters name was, she understood fear and survival and the situation was somewhat less hostile than an entire country during a purge. See that and then look at Purge, You'll know why I'm raging about stupid money milking movies like the Purge. And you'll know why I cry tears of blood when I hear that this movie is somehow popular and desirable to today's audience. They want more mindless action and less innovative and thought provoking media.<br/><br/>When did we stop standing up for ourselves? When did we stop standing up and actually saying 'Booo' and leave the theater. Stand! Demand your money back and go find another movie or something else to do. Don't let the economy or the movie industry or the damned government bully you out of your money. Demand better entertainment! Demand better rights! Demand higher standards!<br/><br/>Please rate this movie 1 star, if you agree. I would greatly appreciate it. And like this so that it gets bumped up and helps other people."
"wiserender","8","3","6","15 July 2013"," strong concept that delivers thrills.
","The Purge is one of those rare movies that did not resemble a big budget studio film in any way, yet it received a wide release in theaters. This movie shows what you can do with an original high concept and a modest budget. It helped that it stars Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. The Purge is about a family of four who are living in the near future during one day. This just happens to be the one day of the year when any form of crime is made legal and no police or emergency response is available. There are some rules; certain weapons are not allowed and of course government personnel of a high rank cannot be killed or attacked without consequence.<br/><br/>The reason for this annual day of carnage is for the best interest of the nation because it has brought unemployment down to one percent and crime on any other day of the year to record setting lows. This is all a type of therapy, an outlet to vent deep seeded primal urges for those who choose to participate.<br/><br/>So the family shelters themselves in their house with the help of an armored security system that covers all of the doors and windows. Around 20 minutes into the film a B-story kicks in then all hell breaks loose. A clan of young private school students have reason to break into the house. The leader of this group played by Rhys Wakefield is exceptional and is such a believable sociopath you cannot help but be entertained while he was on screen. Everything in this movie is made to feel hyper realistic which makes the situation even more terrifying.<br/><br/>The Purge holds up against any other movie playing in the theaters and was produced for 3 Million and it grossed 76 Million to date. I hope the studios take note of this. It should come as no surprise that The Purge 2 is in development. There is countless places you can go with a strong premise like this. For example, what does the white house do during this day of anarchy? It would be interesting to see The Purge from the point of view from someone who hunts. Maybe they have a valid reason for choosing their prey and the audience could be routing for the hunters. This movie causes us to ask tough questions of ourselves and that is why it is so great in my opinion.<br/><br/>I have to say that in the theater seated one row behind me were two fat women who talked throughout the whole movie. I wanted to stand up and yell at these self centered ignorant people to vent my anger. Instead I moved away from them. But as I did that I thought if the purge existed I might have followed those two out to their car, to find out where they live."

Let me tell you this, this movie sucked. Why didn't i just stop watching it? because i paid $22 dollars in movie tickets for myself and my girlfriend and i hate to intentionally throw away money.<br/><br/>The realism of this movie comes into serious question when the characters do the dumbest things. I get it, its a movie but c'mon, you don't have to be in certain situations to know ""holy F i don't just confront several armed people or it will just get me killed!"", Jesus!<br/><br/>The ending is just the F'ing worst.

","Sometimes you hear the description of a movie before you see it and wonder how such a dumb concept could actually be made into a real movie. The Purge is one of those kinds of movies.<br/><br/>Sometimes you give a movie a chance and watch it even though it looks and sounds like it's going to be a real stinker. Every now and then a movie will surprise you and find a way to get past its ridiculous concept and deliver a great-underrated movie. The Purge is NOT one of those movies.<br/><br/>This movie is dumb. Really dumb. In a future world where everything is wonderful unemployment and crime are at an all-time low, and it's all credited to the Purgea once a year holiday when all crime is legal. Dumb!<br/><br/>Somehow the audience is supposed to buy into the rational that the government will allow you to go out and kill anyone you want once a year, and that this will give everyone a release from their built up stress and allow them to be on their best behavior the other 364 days. Dumb!<br/><br/>Even if the audience were to somehow go along with the idiotic premise and forget that most murders are committed in the heat of passion and not from careful premeditated planning, they still have to get past the scriptwhich is heavily flawed with convenient plot points at every turn, filled with gaping holes and overall weak. Writer/Director James DeMonaco forces the audience to be as dumb as his movieat least those who want to try and enjoy it.<br/><br/>It's also sad to see Ethan Hawke (Training Day, Sinister) in his douchiest role to date. It's hard to watch Hawke go from a brilliant performance in this summer's Before Midnight, to pathetic swill in this one. He obviously thought there was something profound in the turd of a screenplayand nobody else can be blamed for his choice.<br/><br/>The Purge is a dumb concept with a flawed script and plays as a really weak movie trying to disguise itself as something deep. The Purge is a waste of time, money and brain cells. <br/><br/>For more quick spoiler free reviews check out www.FilmStallion.com"

I was dead wrong. <br/><br/>As an avid movie watcher the one thing I hate the most is predictabilty, and that's all this movie is. <br/><br/>The dad, is a top salesman, conning others into buying security for the Purge, while having doubts on his own product. He has a spoiled, whiney daughter who he has recently ""restricted"" from seeing her 18 year old BF, an oddball for a son, and a good wife. <br/><br/>I won't give too much away, but the kid lets in the homeless guy like an idiot, and the girl's bf (who snuck in before lockdown) has to ""talk to her father and is walking down the stairs as the homeless man is let in and he attempts to shoot the father and is shot.. and the cluster bomb begins. the parent's are given the choice to force the ""swine"" out or they die too. After a lot of wishy-washy opinions from the characters, ""Oh lets wheel him out to save the kids"" and it changes to ""Oh Dad, you're a monster for trying to save us!""<br/><br/>Horribly predictable scares, every corner you turn there's somebody there, every time someone is facing 3+ armed men they are magically saved at the last minute, and after shooting like 4 people in a room the dad thinks oh, none of the evil murderers heard me, I'm just gunna wander out without looking and is stabbed.. He dies and it's all the kid's fault because he saved a homeless man. <br/><br/>The ""bad guys"" are barely even played up at all once they get in the house, and end up playing second-tier to the neighbors (who randomly decide they must save and then kill the family (makes sense right, kill all the bad guys only to ""cleanse your soul"" killing the family, what 20 people isn't enough?)<br/><br/>Best part is when the creepy neighbor gets her nose broken on a table, it had people laughing loud. <br/><br/>All in all, more laughs came from this than scares, as everyone was tearing it to shreds in the theater.

What sounds like an excuse to avoid that ""Why don't they just call the police"" moment in a horror movie, kind off is. Although the idea starts of with some promise, and I was loving the fact the film seemed unpredictable at first, and could of gotten better, with a family stuck in their house trying to fight of their violent intruders.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though, ""The Purge"" doesn't build to much. Its beginnings give the feeling that they're setting up something great. Only when the good stuff comes, its disappointingly cut short, and what could have been an action packed finale, is replaced with one that tries way to hard to be clever, with its obvious twists.<br/><br/>There are a couple of genuinely edge of your seat moments in this thriller, but its short running time, and creepy mask wearing bad-guys (Hasn't that creepy mask thing been done to death already?) don't do it any favours."

The clichés alone will make you roll your eyes to the point of nausea. It's predictable. So predictable that I felt I was watching a Friday the 13th movie.

I understand your trying to raise some moral questions in me, but you need to let me figure out for myself what i would do, instead of forcing morals down my throat. If the goal of the purge is to rid the streets of the poor, why not just gather them all up and let people kill them off once a week? The ""prayor"" they said every time they were about to make a kill was annoying, it served really no purpose. Like I said, this movie annoyed more than it intrigued.

Sadly this movie falls short on just about every level. There's a really bland undertone of social commentary regarding the wealthy and homeless, have's and have nots etc. That really just doesn't go anywhere, it felt like the writers slipped a little bit in so people wouldn't bitch about the concept. The main villain reminds me of an intellectual, rich kid version of Jason Mewes, which isn't terrifying on any level. Finally (just like Hollywood does) they try to throw in a twist followed by another shittier twist that doesn't do anything for this film. It had a couple brief moments where it began to pick up but just as soon as you get excited for some crazy thrill kills, they just phoned 'em in."

The fact that it was made by a bunch of elite, white, rich people from Hollywood is just a nuance they don't want you to notice.<br/><br/>The movie is so far fetched that Direct James Mather sets the scene in 2022. We are expected to believe that the U.S. Government has then been taken over by super smart folks who think they know better than anyone else. They allow killing without recourse for 12 hours once a year. This new U.S. Government thinks it can purge the country of those that don't believe the way it does, and that the way to peace and a civil society is to let thugs vent once a year by killing their neighbors. So far-fetched because you quickly realize with the NSA and the IRS and radical Muslims allowed to kill with no recourse, this isn't 2022, this is the Obama Administration! (Small matter I suppose that such a low budget film could not even afford cars that looked like 2022 models to even try to fool you.)<br/><br/>The after movie conversation turned quickly from what was the message in the film, to who did the writers want you to hate the most. For me that was easy—the film distributor of course! Film school 101 is you must have at least one likable character in a movie. Ethan Hawke plays the Dad, James Sandin as a detestable security exec who cares more about his sales bonus than raising his kids. Wife Mary simply looks like she is preoccupied by a bad case of hemorrhoids. Daughter Zoey is a clueless, oversexed teen and son Charlie plays the role of a unisex moron who occasionally could be mistaken for an ill-trained Pomeranian. Who wants to save this family or care if they all die? In this film, you are simply hoping they all get killed off quickly so you can get home and lock your own door and be safe. Unfortunately, you realize your phone is tapped, the IRS is out to get you, and the President has buddies in the Muslim brotherhood who patrol streets looking for white people to kill. The only real solace you can find is in the nightly news when the U.S top National Security adviser assures you not to worry ""it is just a film."" Yes indeed, perhaps it is time to purge?"
"StevePulaski","4","3","7","7 June 2013"," All the tension and thought-provoking discussion pieces are encapsulated in a film that can't support them
","The Purge exploits its home-invasion, pot-boiler suspense fully but leaves opportunities for exploration of political allegory — as hinted in the trailer — conveniently untouched. When you have a premise as good as this one, make it appear to house commentary about the political and social spectrum that is America today, and you opt for a carbon-copy thriller, that is something of a cinematic sin.<br/><br/>The film sets up 2022 America, ""a nation reborn,"" so they say, thanks to a social policy called ""The Purge."" ""The Purge"" is a twelve hour event, one night a year, where all crime is legal and all emergency services are suspended. This gives people an outlet for all the violence, anger, and rage they keep up inside them and apparently brings crime to an all time low and contributes to a flourishing economy. We focus on a wealthy home security developed named James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and his wife and two children as they prep for the annual Purge in their luxurious mansion, equipped with Sandin's fine security system. Shortly after the alert is given, James' son Charlie notices an injured man, appearing homeless, is running out on the streets screaming for help and assistance. Charlie disarms the system, allowing the man to come in, before James safely arms the system again.<br/><br/>It isn't long before a group of Purge-preppers, lead by actor Rhys Wakefield, who is tremendous here, show up, demanding they let the ""homeless swine"" out of the house so the gang can kill them and rid the streets of their kind. Failure to comply on the Sandins' part will result in their security system being dismantled and their lives taken from them through blunt-force. The masked-preppers cut the power and patiently wait while the Sandins' decide what to do.<br/><br/>A slew of the film's details go unexplained. Why do the criminals need masks when it doesn't make a difference if they're discovered or not since the crime goes unpunished anyway? Also, how does the national crime rate go down to untold lows just because one night a year for twelve hours the population is granted total impunity? Does gang violence, drug warfare, and robberies cease to exist just because of this? If James' security system is so damn fool-proof why doesn't it have a child safety lock so little impulsive children don't put their entire family at risk by setting off the alarm? Why do the preppers themselves camp outside and wait for one homeless man to come out of the house when they're wasting precious hours ridding the streets of more invaluable swine? And what brain-dead congressman/government official decided the brilliant way to cut down on national crime would be to implement something as unlawful, dangerous, and as stupefyingly hazardous to the peace as ""The Purge"" anyway? It's frustrating to see such a potential-ridden opportunity stoop down to nothing but an outlet, or a fix, for dime-store entertainment. It takes about thirty or forty minutes to realize that ""The Purge"" doesn't care about establishing conversation or invoking originality through its clever premise; all it wants is to have its audience members watch a dreary home-invasion, survivalist thriller that squanders potential faster than you can enable James' security system.<br/><br/>The ending all comes down to a relentless brawl between good, moral souls vs. bad, amoral souls in which the sequences of brutality are almost entirely incomprehensible thanks to poor lighting and choppy editing. The film becomes utterly relentless, not in terms of violence, but in terms of style, which is to obscure everyone and everything so much that the only thing audible enough to be distinguished is a shotgun blast. I would've rather been able to read ""The Purge"" as a political statement on the violence of humanity and mankind, or even a social critique about our ""inherently violent"" nature and further justification on why ""The Purge"" is a good idea after all. I expected too much from a mainstream film by the notorious company Platinum Dunes.<br/><br/>Everyone who acts here is adequate, with the exception of Rhys Wakefield who is simply brilliant, and the tension at the beginning of the film is some of the best of this year. But all of it is encapsulated in a film that simply doesn't have the depth or element of surprise to contain it all efficiently. One of my jobs as a film critic is to give audiences other films to seek out if the film in question isn't too great and my substitute recommendation is ""The Trigger Effect."" Like ""The Purge,"" it's a film that questions your ethics and your behavior in times of sheer camaraderie and blunt uncertainty, but it also delivers more on the levels of character and tension, along with becoming more than a home-invasion thriller as ""The Purge"" falls prey to. It's your choice on how you want to spend your evening. If you're looking for a topical discussion on the idea of allowing citizens to run lawless in the streets for twelve-hours a year, than you have all your talking points by watching the two and a half minute trailer."

"ingramlucas","3","2","4","25 February 2019"," Incredibly Disappointing
","I went into this film, knowing the amazing and original concept, expecting to see a creative action packed thriller which I would enjoy very much. Instead I got a boring story line, and a film that I just couldn't wait to end. With a concept like The Purge, they could have done so much but instead they just created a terrible story line with dumb and irrelevant moments. The actor who played the son also really frustrated me as the main plot which put the family in danger was all his fault, which he seemed completely unaware of, and yet when the family tried escaping the danger all he did was shout and complain to them to stop. Also, kind of off topic, but it took me a while to even realise he was a boy. I legitimately thought he was a girl for like the first 10 minutes or so of him being on screen lol. But seriously, considering he wasn't meant to be a dislikable character, or at least that's what it seemed, they did a terrible job casting him as all he did was annoy me (obviously this is just my opinion, but I wouldn't be surprised if I wasn't the only viewer he pissed off). As well, there are multiple scenes where one of the villains are supposedly going to kill one of the family members but then 'surprisingly' another family member attacks them before they can shoot. This would be ok if it only happened once or twice but it literally happened like four or 5 times, completely ruining the surprise and relief it was intended to give the viewer. Overall, I don't recommend you watch this film, unless you want to see a boring and meaningless story line, and an incredibly annoying boy with long hair pissing you off the whole time. Although the concept is cool, the movie is most definitely not. I am aware that there are other Purge movies, which I haven't seen and could possibly be much better than this, but from what I've heard this is the best movie in the series and trust me, that says alot! I'm genuinely being nice by giving it a 3/10. The only reason it isn't a 1 or 2 is because of the concept and the ending, which admittedly I thought was ok, but still not great."

I mean cmon they gave Gravity a freaking Oscar and that was slow throughout. And all she did was talk to herself. The idea was disturbing but more close to reality than the Dark Knight, which is consider one of the best movies, why don't ask me. Reasons I liked it unique idea, action, character development, hard questions like walking dead type questions. Yes character development happened with the husband and wife. They had a mindset like the purge is a good thing and they developed to a point no matter what the law says murder will always be wrong. The law of the country doesn't make things right or wrong. I like the mask thing they did showing how people always smiling at you even though they really hate you on the inside. Could it have been better in some instances, yes like they shouldn't have it about a single family more about the country. Maybe that is why there is talk about a Purge 2."

","Wow, just wow. I ""wow"" at how such a premise can be wasted on such a lame cliché ridden so called ""horror"" film. The Purge lit the internet and box office a storm upon initial release thanks the clever and original marketing campaign for a very interesting concept. What would happen if crime were legal once a year for a few hours? It's a grand idea for a movie one ripe for ideas, so sad then that the filmmakers settled for such a bad one and for such a generic production.<br/><br/>The story centring almost entirely inside the house of the Sandin family begs the question of why the purge even is a part of the film? The movie in the end could just be any standard home invasion thriller/horror, just utterly wasting the whole idea of what a night in The Purge would be like. It's made all the worse by small ideas and scenes offer up an insight into the possibilities of a well done Purge movie. The friendly neighbours turning, the angry boyfriend taking matters into his own hands there are countless opportunities here that play second fiddle to a lame and frankly unbelievable story.<br/><br/>Another major problem with The Purge is the horrible main set of characters, Hawke tries his best but it must be said doesn't do much while the other bunch of headliners in Heady who is wasted and Wakefield who thinks smiling every 3 seconds is creepy (by the way it's not) barely makes a dint in the film where he should own it with his menacing evil doer. In regards to the child actors Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane the less said the better.<br/><br/>The Purge is simply a bad, seen a million times before home invasion movie. What makes it particularly annoying and also like a slap in the face is how it squanders its idea. On the success financially of the movie a sequel has been green lit; can someone please do something with the idea? One can only hope because it wouldn't take much to make this a truly scary and believable horror.<br/><br/>Half a remote control car out of 5 For more movie reviews and opinions check out - www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

The movie itself ends by telling viewers that most of the purge and killings took place in Dallas. <br/><br/>The movie: Ethan Hawke plays the. Main character James Sandin who sells home security systems and his work and life is all about home securities it seems. Though at the same time, their system was easily disarmed by the intruders and they never thought to have a panic room or any other safety protocols in place. Stranger shows up and is let in the house. Weirdos come looking for him. Intruders invade and guns are fired. Crazy neighbors show up from nowhere to help out only to turn on the family. Stranger in the house helps family. The end.<br/><br/>No reason or explanations: - the daughter boyfriend (who can't even muster to say I love you back to her) tries to kill or purge on Sandin on only the fact that he disapproves of the relationship. Guess somehow killing her father would make things OK - the stranger shows up apparently from nowhere with no reason on why people were chasing him or how he ended up in a secluded gated community and his name or storyline was never explained. The bloody stranger is a black man. - the invaders also have no reason for them being there in this gated community, in the suburbs and never explain why they were chasing the stranger. Never explained what is supposedly driving the whole movie. The invaders or predators are all white and preppy, most with blonde hair <br/><br/><ul><li>dialogue is unnatural and sounds scripted. Neighbors address it other by surnames like Mr. Cali (because they live in Cali get it) and not by their first names. </li></ul><br/><br/>Nothing about this movies makes any sense.

The idea of a Purge (12 hours of lawlessness) is great and I was willing to look past the reality flaws of having such a thing. I pictured nationwide mayhem and the potential for some great scenes. But instead they bunkered down in a house. I got a bit frustrated but thought ""Maybe it will be exciting anyway, or they might hit the road"" But no the whole movie in the house!! This is where it began to go south. Shortly after the purge began the son let a homeless stranger in by disarming the security. I thought OK well a bit of compassion is OK even if its dumb. But the thing that broke the camels back and sent me into a fit of rage was next. A group of ""purgers"" were hunting this man and came to the front of the house and told the family they want there target back or they will break into the house. LOGICLLY you would think that the whole family would of worked together to get the man back outside to avoid this situation, also considering how blasé the adults were about the purge they wouldn't care and just send him out. BUT the teenage kid decides to let the guy hide and shows him a secret hiding spot. This was where I lost it with this movie. So a kid decides he is going to hide a stranger and have his whole family murdered for that stranger???? What nonsense. After this I knew this movie was just illogical and painfully written. I turned it off 10 minutes after when the purgers outside turned the power off. BUT WAIT??? Didn't they want the guy out? but they make it more difficult for the family to find him by cutting the power off? Don't WATCH THIS TRUST ME!!!! This movie has put me in a awful mood all day. Never has a movie ticked me off so much. I had such high promise for this movie. And the producer has gone and mad a new concept in a movie into a disaster. There is nothing to be gained in this movie it is an absolute bust. The budget was $3,000,000. Which is a tiny budget for a movie. To be honest I think this movie was made to make money it just doesn't make sense any other way. Goodbye I am going to go and destroy all the walls in my house to release this rage."

","After the success of Sinister with Ethan Hawke and the major success of Games Of Thrones with Lena Headey Hollywood had to find a way to make money out of both. Well here's the result, the weak The Purge.<br/><br/>The story is very weak and even Ethan or Lena could convince me. In fact, the only one who convinced me was Rhys Wakefield as the polite leader. The story itself takes place in the future even as none of the future is shown. So that was already a big disappointment. Not only that, the story itself was rather weak and some things were so predictable that you can see clearly that this was made on the success of both leading thespians. <br/><br/>I must say that there are some brutal moments but if you would like to see some creepy home invading flicks go watch The Strangers (2008), remember the masks. Or go see the classic A Clockwork Orange (1971) for the home invasion or if you want it brute see, A L'intérieur (2007). <br/><br/>It do has a few good moments but Hollywood had to purge themselves before cashing in on weak projects, be ashamed producers!<br/><br/>Gore 0/5 Nudity 0/5 Effects 2/5 Story 2/5 Comedy 0/5"

"saruman_el_blanco","4","2","4","7 August 2013"," The trailer was good, at least
","'The Purge' is the kind of film that makes one think: 'Damn, the plot, the idea of the film is good with potential to be a GREAT movie, but somehow it went FUBAR because it was directed by the wrong guy'. That's exactly how I felt as soon as the end credits surfaced on screen.<br/><br/>The dialog is beyond atrocious. The depiction of most characters wasn't bad, it was God-awful. The timing of the events was screwed up for whatever reason, and you kind of get the impression that the crew who made this film did it in a hurry cause they all had to go and throw up quickly because they knew that this was going from bad to worse.<br/><br/>Incredibly enough, I think that this film is just borderline watchable - just once!-. But I hope that someone, say...Sir Ribley Scott for example, will one day remake this abomination into a very good movie because the plot, I insist, is the only good thing about this...whatever it is, and deserves a decent shot by a decent director."

","""The Purge"" (15) Director: James DeMonaco. Starring: Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Edwin Hodge. Rated: 15, for containing strong language and bloody violence. Out now in UK cinemas.<br/><br/>Set in the (not so distant) future, once a year and for twelve hours, all crime is legalised. For people who do not want to be a part of the destruction, they sit inside their homes (complete with security systems) and wait for the night to end. However, on this one night, when a man breaks into their house, a family must decide to take part in the purge; or to fight through the night.<br/><br/>What started as an interesting concept became an awful film in which there are movie clichés galore. The idea that crime is legalised once a year, was highly intriguing and would possibly be transferred into a decent film. I thought wrong.<br/><br/>It was Friday the thirty-first, of May and it was time for my weekly cinema trip with some friends. Adverts for ""The Purge"" had been placed everywhere and there were some positive reviews that persuaded me to watch it. As I made my way into the cinema screen, I looked around to see a fairly packed out screening. I was quite positive and ready for what seemed would be a fairly enjoyable film.<br/><br/>As the opening credits rolled, there were scenes of extreme violence played to some nice classical music. How lovely. The first half an hour was interesting and spent most of its time setting up the film's plot line. Then, the film dips.<br/><br/>The acting becomes boring as the film progresses, but the presence of Ethan Hawke (""Daybreakers"" and ""Before Midnight"") and Lena Headey (""Game Of Thrones"") saves the film from failing completely.<br/><br/>An interesting concept, which never leaves the ground.

"3xHCCH","5","2","4","26 July 2013"," A Very Unlikely Law, I Hope
","In the year 2022, the US government under its ""New Founding Fathers"" enact a law enabling an annual event called ""The Purge"". On that specific 12-hour period in the month of March, from 7 pm to 7 am the following day, vigilantes can legally go around town killing ""undesirables"" of society.<br/><br/>This film follows the Sandin family, an affluent family living in a huge mansion, on one particular Purge Night. <br/><br/>Father James (Ethan Hawke) has a successful security systems company, while Mother Mary (Lena Headey) lives the life of a typical rich suburban housewife. Their teenage kids Zoey and Charlie are typically detached from their parents. <br/><br/>The problem starts when young Charlie lets a Bloody Stranger (Edwin Hodge) asking for help into their house. A group of masked college-age vigilantes led by their Polite Leader (Rhys Wakefield) goes up to the Sandin house and demands them to hand over Bloody Stranger or else hell will break loose. It does.<br/><br/>The unusual premise of the film will grip you with its seeming inhumanity. Set in the near future, you will get to thinking why a law like this would ever be enacted. Is this a wise law that will actually benefit society? Will the crime rate really decrease with this grisly yearly ritual? <br/><br/>Those moments when you see the Bloody Stranger on the Sandin CCTV monitor, your pulse rate will begin to race. The build up of suspense was excellent right up to the moment when Polite Leader and his group show up at the doorstep. After that, the movie just devolves into another typical film depicting the violent violation of a private home.<br/><br/>Characters will be doing what we will think are the most stupid possible option given those situations. Such is the norm in most horror films, isn't it? This film is not immune to those clichés. <br/><br/>Since murder is legal in that world, murders will happen. This film will not shirk from violence, probably to send a message how senseless violence can be. That is it the educated set that seems to promote this culture of violence on Purge Day is an eye-opener in this age where the power of access to social media is already dictating societal norms presently.<br/><br/>I had hoped that there would have been a more detailed depiction of the aftermath of that Purge Day. Those faceless voices, snippets from radio broadcasts, we hear over the closing credits, were haunting and disturbing. But that will be all we get. We want to know more about this new world order. Unfortunately the film makers do not give us more insight to the wider implications of their original idea. 5/10."
"twilliams76","4","2","4","4 July 2013"," Great idea ... not so great execution.
","Although The Purge has one of the more interesting plots/concepts for a movie that I have come across lately, the film never fully delivers on its promises of originality or (high) suspense and the movie left me feeling more disappointed and let-down than anything else.<br/><br/>Disappointment is never a good feeling to have upon exiting a theater because it means the recently watched film has failed (somewhere, somehow). This is not saying The Purge does not have some good ideas because it does ... the film just does not live up to its adrenaline-pumping expectations following that creepy-spooky trailer that had people (like myself) muttering the three letters W, T and F with some stress on the F.<br/><br/>The premise is actually a good one as it ""echoes"" the (year) 2000 Japanese import, Battle Royale, and also the young-adult/box office sensation -- and best-selling book -- The Hunger Games by Suzanne Collins. Although the films (and their stories) are nothing alike, they share a central concept with one another: a future dystopian society subjugates and controls their populations by offering-up a (voluntary in some cases) means of violent, no-holds-barred, winner-takes-all crowd-control as a way of keeping order.<br/><br/>In The Purge, Americans are graciously given 12 hours to kill, steal, abuse, pillage, maim or commit any number of carnal base sins he/she deems desirable with no questions asked (afterwards). This one night exists as a way of hopefully getting animalistic urges out of a person's system. It is because of the Purge that ALL other hours of the year are peacefully controlled and organized in order to maintain a high level of security and safety (there are no cops or other safety personnel on call during the 12-hour window). Just as there are ""no questions asked"" in the movie, the audience isn't supposed to ask a whole lot either.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke (Before Sunrise, Gattaca) and Lena Headey (""Game of Thrones"", 300) play a married couple with two teenage children who are facing the Purge head-on by locking down their house (he has made a fortune in the home $ecuritie$ industry) and settling in for a long evening hoping they live to see the sun rise on the other side of night ... only it is The Purge and people oftentimes will make plans for something he/she is unable to complete. When a helpless stranger is heard calling for help (after the clock has already begun), nobody knows who can be trusted.<br/><br/>The Purge has a very smart and intriguing idea at its core (the writer-director deserves much credit for this), but the inexperienced direction by DeMonaco makes The Purge almost as messy and chaotic as an actual Purge would be. It is too bad because there is a lot of potential here. Perhaps don't expect as much as I did ... and there won't be as much disappointment (as I believe the film does not deserve to be disliked)."
"blondish_doll23","2","2","4","1 July 2013"," Worst movie ever
","The Purge was the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. The script is way too SF, even if the idea seemed attractive at first sight. The whole movie has a huge lack of consistency and the actions occur too fast, you have no time to be scared. Except the idea of the ""american purge day"", all the other actions were quite stupid, it wasn't even funny. The children's and parents' actions had no logic (the boy knew the security code and he disabled it in 2 seconds, with one click and then he hid from the bad guys, but he was using a flashlight this whole time), the safest and best selling security house structure could be destroyed only by some chains pulled by a car etc. I don't want to spoil everything, but my sincerely advice would be not watching this movie. It's a waste of time. I had better expectations..."
"bradleyrowe","6","2","4","29 June 2013"," Good concept however lacked delivery
","A day in which crimes are all forgiven, for America has found new refuge under the tradition of the annual purge, a concept which toys with our inner primate selves. The Purge begins very slowly setting the scene in an eerily fashion, viewers are introduced to the normality of the purge quite quickly and it is this normality which then makes the later developments in the plot so shocking to an unsuspecting viewer.<br/><br/>The concept is one which could of probably been delivered to a higher standard however the movie to an extent does give it some justice, with it only being 85 minutes in total leaving you hungry for more it immediately becomes apparent that ""The Purge"" is a short taster to a number of following prequels,it provides an insight into ""home invasion"" one aspect of many which could be exploited in the concept of ""The Purge""<br/><br/>With the whole movie being set in the house like movies similar such as ""panic room"" the director has chosen to diversify the film by using a number of different rooms on screen within the family house however due to it being set in the early hours of the morning and later developments leading to low level lighting it means that most of the movie is quite dark.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke plays the patriotic father of the family, an upper class family which strongly supports the annual purge however when they become involved stumble upon choices they must have to make in order to protect there family from the threat outside. The family and neighbours were poorly portrayed by their actor counterparts, it really took value away from the movie and made you want to question were they acting with the boy child being emotionless throughout the film and the neighbours being gormless in some scenes.<br/><br/>Despite this I was glued to my chair throughout, the movie started slow however became quite fast moving. With me not seeing the trailer beforehand the movies events were more of a shock as they came to play and allowed for me to be more gripped. Following the credits the general consensus was positive for being such a low budget film."
"musics_my_life","6","2","4","26 June 2013"," Pretty good movie... Wait for DVD release
","I watched this movie the opening night. The previews looked really interesting and they grabbed my attention. The concept is very creative and disturbing at the same time. One of the things that I liked about the movie is how everything builds up. Everyone in the family was so caught up in themselves and their own drama. Throughout, the family kept separating. It added to the suspense. I didn't like that the movie was quite predictable. If you pay attention, from the start, you can figure out how the movie will end. Also, nothing happened until that last 15 minutes of the movie. Though the movie had an original idea, I couldn't help but compare the movie to The Strangers. The only difference is that in this movie, murdering was legal on this specific day. Overall, I would recommend this movie for those people who don't like scary movies, but have friends who love scary movies. It has a little bit of suspense, but it isn't very scary."

I was looking forward to some bank heists, or perfect crime sort of plot where they went all Oceans 11 or the Italian Job, all I got was the story line from Panic Line and every other house invasion movie. Not to mention the weird kid with long hair, whats his deal? Could we not come up with a more epic plot to go with the story idea? Maybe in 10 years we can have a remake with a better plot.

There must be some really STRONG thing to happen for this law to exist, in this movie, it looks like a really bad joke. 2.

Don't Armour your huge house, as it is just impossible to do it safe enough. Make a section of your basement a solid steel box, and sit there for those 12 hours. Don't make your security controls on a touch pad screen... 3. There WILL be someone asking for help, isolate your garage room, and make it a sanctuary for those occasions. 4.

"pikapikaaa","2","2","4","22 June 2013"," It was.. An interesting experience..
","This movie made me want to write a review. Not in a good way really. Basically this movie is about a dystopian future where one day a year for twelve hours, all crime is legal. Such as murder. They emphasise a lot on the murder part. Anyway the main character James or something, sells home alarm protection systems. And basically they are rich.He has wife and two children.. Anyway. On the evening of the purge, they lock down (turn on the system) and watch the news and do normal stuff. Some black guy outside starts screaming for help, and the son lets him in. Oh, there is also this whole thing with their daughters boyfriend, but I don't really get it, so I won't spoil it.. Anyway, some white rich kids with these really hilarious masks, for some reason they reminded me of Joan Rivers.. Anyway! They appear at their doorstep and ask for the black guy, because.. Well, they basically want to kill him, and probably eat him afterward. And then say that they can get into the house and will kill all of them if they don't deliver him.. They also cut the power for no apparent reason. Meanwhile inside the house, they all start freaking out, probably because it's dark and boyfriend gets shot, and the black guy gets away. The parents start searching for him and the son kid uses his extremely disturbing robot baby-born to guide him to his ""secret hiding place"". He gets there and everyone's happy! Expect his parents and the River people. But then his sister, who is probably the most annoying person ever, is going around crying about her boyfriend and decides to hide in her brothers secret place, which is apparently not so secret anymore. Dad appears black dude threatens to kill annoying daughter (I was rooting for her to die). Then mum appears from behind and dad says ""SHOOT HIM"", which of course alerts Mr. Black man, but he still gets shot. Annoying girl hits her head or something and is unconscious. They tie him up, he struggles of course, mum hurts him with a letter knife, and son just stands there with a flash light. Suddenly their morals change and they decide to fight! Meanwhile outside the ""equipment has arrived, okay, I wasn't paying attention to this part, but it looked like to me they attached some chains to the doors and windows and then to a car and drove ripping the things off them.. But I'm not entirely sure. So, they get in, weird fighting.. Dad just stabbed in the end, mum gets tickled and nearly murdered but is saved by their creepy neighbours.. Then it turns out creepy neighbours want to kill them and they start talking about America and the fathers or something.. Then black dude comes and saves them.. That's basically it.. <br/><br/>My opinion is that it was too long before they got in, and when did.. I mean.. They really sucked. No of them seemed to be capable of doing anything right. I think black dude could have killed them all.. Things I didn't like.. Annoying daughter.. I actually didn't like any of them, except black dude. He was awesome. The reason I'm calling him that is that he didn't have a name.. He was called bloody stranger, but I think black dude sounds cooler. I didn't like the fact that their security system sucked. I didn't get why they were wearing masks.. I mean, that one guy just took it off.. I didn't like how unimportant Henry was. And I didn't get why Henry called out James's name before trying to shoot him. I don't get why the robot was some creepy baby-born. It was funny that the blonde dude kept on calling awesome black guy swine or pig.. The whole dialog in this movie felt very forced. Overall.. This movie sucked.. It was just so.. Boring.. But, it did make me laugh. So, if you are bored you could watch this. It was really bad, but if you need to kill time, why not watch this! But, you could of course do something much more entertaining such as watch a different movie, read a book or watch grass grow!"

","When I first saw this film advertised I thought now there's a concept! Think a world where for one night only you could, mind the phrase, get away with murder. The notion behind it is very intriguing and makes you think what would you do? Could you murder someone if it were legal and you got away with it. I thought this film was going to show what exactly happens to the world when idea like this is in place.<br/><br/>HOWEVER! This film did not fulfil my expectations. One house for a whole movie for a start is so not cool in my books. Especially with such an violent idea behind it. The acting from the family, especially the dad, Ethan Hawke, was TERRIBLE! The ending was so predictable that I knew what was going to happen with ten minutes of its starting.<br/><br/>I wont spoil anything for anybody who thinks they may want to see it but all I can say is I am very disappointed in this film and thank goodness it was orange Wednesday when I wen to see if. If I had paid full price for it I would of been pretty annoyed right now. Peace Out!"

","The Purge is interesting, but not in a bad way! The Purge is an interesting movie with many themes. The storyline is about a family who lives in America and every once a year everything is legal for a 12 hour period. There viewer experiences many themes from the story. 1)Are humans nothing more than animals when all restraints are lifted? 2) People consist of the strong picking on the weak. Rich vs the poor. Neighbors pick on other neighbors when the opportunity arises.3)The idea that the purge cleans society of the unwanted. 4) Violence gets rid of vendettas. 5) The threat of violence keeps people in line because no bad boss or neighbor would live. The theme driven movie is enhanced by great acting, directing and a few interesting plot twists. Personally, I do not believe a lawless day could be viable. The whole city would burn down. I have to watch The Purge a second time to have an opinion. Seven out of ten."

","The actors & actresses did a fantastic job with their roles, especially Rhys Wakefield, he did give an incredibly creep-tastic performance, down to his vocabulary and etiquette. Despite the acting, the predictability of this film was just unbelievable. I called every outcome of the characters the moment they were introduced.. this alone makes for a disappointment. I anticipated this film wildly for the past few months, ranting and raving, counting down, my level of anticipation for a movie that I expected to be so incredibly morbid is likely highly unhealthy. Rest assured though, the most morbid part of this film is WHO is being ""purged"" to boost the economy, it's morally inapt..

","The concept is a good one; crime is legal for 12 hours, once a year. The storyline though, terrible. It gives us no/very little information on who the main characters are. For me, I need to know more about them before I can feel more emotion for them in a film. If I don't know much about said person, if something happens to them, they're ""just another person"". All we get told is that the dad sells home protection, and that the daughter has a boyfriend. We know very little about the mother or son. What I think is even worse is that we know next to nothing about the ""Bloody Stranger"" (played by Edwin Hodge). We know he is homeless, and if you look closely when he is tied up, he is wearing dog tags, so probably has experience in the forces. The film was based around him. If the family gave him up, they would be left alone. It amazes me that somebody so important to the story is kept so secretive. Talking about the story, not much happens! Looking back, I could summaries the full film in about 20 seconds. I'm not going in to great detail, as I don't want to give away any spoilers, but the film, for me, was a big disappointment."
"haydenluz","3","0","0","7 July 2020"," The Purge
","The Purge had James DeMonaco's hand all over it. He originated the story, wrote the film, and directed it, with some help from Michael Bay, Jason Blum, Bradley Fuller, Andrew Form & Sebastian Lemercier. With Michael Bay's name being behind this film, I was expecting big action, and it was just mediocre at best. DeMonaco had some gory kills, with some poor jump scares, but it all seemed very clichÃ© as a whole.<br/><br/>The story was a simple thriller/horror, that wasn't the most original, while being pretty fast paced, and lazily structured. I do appreciate the twist DeMonaco put on it, but it didn't really help the film at all.<br/><br/>The screenplay by James DeMonaco was pretty boring, and cringey, although the two leads in Ethan Hawke & Lena Headey weren't too bad; their kids on the other hand, were so disposable and strictly used for plot content, that is 100% avoidable, and predictable. As for the purgers, they came off super creepy, with those macabre masks, but when it came down to business, they were truly nothing special.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of those flicks that get worse and worse every time you see it. It's just okay the first time around, but any time after that, it starts to become more and more redundant. If you enjoy cheesy horror/thrillers, you'll probably enjoy this movie more than me. If you're like me, and know they're hit or miss for the most part, it's probably going to be hard to look past."

","Watching this movie for the second time after having watched the other movies and the TV series based on same. I enjoy movies that provoke a response be it anger or sadness. As I write this we are under a country wide lock down because of Covid-19. So I can't help but think what could happen if things get to the point that people actually do purge. I really hate pointless and pathetic whiny reviews by people who you'd swear were forced at gunpoint to watch a movie. If you don't like it SWITCH IT OFF!! The purge presents a fascinating premise and is an excellent first instalment in what has become a really fascinating series of movies and TV series. The world is in a really bad place at the moment because we chose politicians instead of leaders. Think about that before you vote.<br/><br/>Ignore the hate and bile contained in other reviews and make up your own mind.

","7/10 up front.
Thrillers aren't really my thing, but that's not what was alluring to me about ""The Purge."" It was the concept. Just because most of America participates in some annual mass psychosis, does that make it right? The central characters of this film, a suburban family of four, are thrust into this moral dilemma against their will when a hunted man takes refuge in their home. ""Purge"" was a commercial success with a 30-to-1 ROI, something rarely seen in Hollywood. Perhaps that weighs on critics... ""Purge"" gently mocks the $300 million flagship pieces released each summer. Those expensive productions generally contain much less to think about than ""Purge."" It's not for everyone, but it still has me thinking after the on-screen thrills have faded."

","Warning: SpoilersA film that brings to realization that a government can get together and allow a 12-hour period for people in the United States to murder, rape, vandalize etc. without consequences. James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and his wife Mary Sandin (Lena Headey) and their family try to stop their community as well as outsiders who try to take a man Bloody Stranger (Edwin Hodge) for the purge that they are housing. Polite Stranger (Rhys Wakefield) and his team of purgers comes to their bloody stranger back as he had escaped them.<br/><br/>James is a security salesman who owns a multi-million-dollar company selling house security systems to stop purgers from entering their homes. He has become rich over this and to he and Mary's surprise as the film moves on their neighbors are upset by their success. The neighbors plot is to take the lives of the Sandin's without them having a clue of what is going on. The Purge Anarchy is a sequel to this film and the theme is the same and the story line has changed just a little bit.<br/><br/>This film does a great job with using lighting and angle to show and set the mood in this film. When Polite stranger arrives at the Sandin residence he has his head down with a mask on and the light and shadows make him look like a total creep from the get go. They also show the volks with him in the shadows lurking and waiting for their prey. The angles make him look like he has a big face and is a tiny man based on the high angle. Other situations with angle are when Mrs. Sandin is sitting at the table towards the end of the movie and you can see Mrs. Grace Ferrin (Arija Bareikis) in the background try to take Mary's shotgun. This adds to the drama and comedy side to things and it shows you how they really can't trust anyone during this purge that is going on.<br/><br/>This movie could have been maybe more complicated but they tried to make it basic and so people could understand what was going on. In Anarchy, you understand the theme better so they can get more complicated and get you on your feet more. This film brought a lot of sound with all of the guns and weapons being used in order to make it look and feel like 12 hours of complete chaos. It makes you believe that it could happen maybe somewhere in this world someday."

As there governs a dictatorial government though elected by democratic means : The New Founding Fathers of America that imposes a revolutionary rules of citizen conduct . The known premise is the following one : The idea behind this whole peculiar America is that crime is up and economy is down, as government put a lot of emphasis on killing being legal, that's why they think of murders would get better common problems. It is just universally accepted that the cause of all these problems results to be built up agression within population. In order to correct this, the rulers decides that it would be a good idea to give the people a day to release the agresssion. Because if people get out all that anger in one day, they will not feel the need to commit any more crimes for the rest of the year.There a wealthy family formed by father James Sandrin : Ethan Hawke, mummy named Mary Sandrin : Lena Headey, and children Zoey and Charlie live at a luxurious mansion when The Purge Day takes place.

This first picture of the big boxoffice franchise contains thriller, extreme violence, crossfire, fighting , surprise-filled entertainment and high body-count. Being a strange mix of dystopian Sci-fi, thriller, drama and Invasion Home. As it is nicely set in a pseudo-apocalyptic future in which a family attempting to survive on a night where it is all-out war on the streets and in home . The nail-biting action scenes, mostly shot at home, are uniformly well made, and suspense, tension and intrigue are enough to keep interested throughout the movie runtime, even in the low parts of the picture.<br/><br/>This The Purge 2013 turns out to be the first installment, being followed by various sequels : The Purge Anarchy 2014, The Purge Election year 2016, The First Purge 2018 and a TV series The Purge 2018.

","I love the Purge Franchise & my favourite is ""The First Purge 2018"" the Blaxploitation prequel but each entry is very good in their own way.<br/><br/>This one is the film that started it all, we have a great scary & exciting concept with a solid cast, here we get the always good & intense Ethan Hawke as the main lead as he stars as an ordinary family man getting ready to lock up for the scary night ahead.<br/><br/>This is an intense home invasion style Thriller with an old school siege feel, it feels low-budget & very B-movie but in a great way, like the type of indie type that John Carpenter may have made in the 70's abit ""Assault on precinct 13"" in it's low-key & cheap approach with it being set in one location & a it's small cast.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is excellent & intense as James Sandin the dad of the house they are holed up in, we also have the excellent Lena Heady as his wife Mary & the two teens Charlie & Zoey, all well cast.
A cool standout character is the homeless bloody stranger who ends up at the Sandin's house wanting help, he's played by the good Edwin Hodge & becomes a good unlikely hero of the film.
The purge night starts & the atmosphere of dread is present & everything goes wrong when ""The Stranger"" is let in to the family home, a deadly siege is commenced on the house it becomes a fight to survive the night!!!
The Purge is a very good intense survival Thriller & the excellent franchise only gets better from this fantastic first film.
Check out ""The First Purge"" from 2018 for the best of the franchise in my opinion but it's a great Franchise."
"aawesome-63803","4","0","0","25 October 2019"," The Purge Review.
","I watched this movie today (October 25th 2019) after recording it to my DVR and forgetting about it for about 10 days. I decided to watch it while waiting for the installer to come over and install a new cable box. I watched this, not planning to review it for IMDB or my YouTube channel. I am a big horror fan, and this movie, while it is a good home invasion movie, feels like it wasted big potential. For example, the premise of the movie is that in this alternate America, there is one night a year where all crime is legal. But they don't explore that idea whatsoever. The most exploration we get is a documentary or something on a TV where someone says that The Purge is for getting out anger and frustration, but that itself makes no sense, if The Purge is for getting anger and frustration out, then why not just make murder legal for one night? Taking a ton of money from a store isn't getting anger and frustration out. Neither is stealing a flatscreen TV. Or jaywalking. So right away the plot makes no sense. And that's just the first 5 minutes. I'm not going to get into specifics but the entire movie just feels pointless. One example: the entire movie a group of masked men try to break into this family's house to kill a man they are sheltering. Why? Surely there are more people to go after. Then the neighbors. Why at the end did the neighbors decide to try and kill everybody? And why when the mother said that they aren't gonna kill each other and makes dinner, why didn't they just KILL HER AND THE KIDS?! You know what? I've just convinced myself to lower the rating from thinking about that."

","Imagine an alternative future, a rather near future, in which the US federal government has created a new ""holiday', during which all crimes (including and particularly murder) are decriminalized for a full 12 hours, starting 7:00 PM. In this future, the sad fact is that accurate data proves that unemployment, poverty and all manners of crime have decreased to the lowest levels in human history, all because citizens are able to ""purge"" themselves of all violent and anti-social behaviors, thoughts, emotions and tendencies once a year. How would people react to such freedom? Who would indulge in their darker sides, and who would see it as an affront to society, and indeed their very humanity? And what of those who can't afford weapons, fortifications and security measures? This is the general concept and notion of The Purge.<br/><br/>There's a story, which is rather nice; there are characters, which are rather likeable and relatable (or despised, according to their role); there's a cast of actors, out of which some perform adequately and others impressively; but the main feature of The Purge is the moral dilemma, the philosophical, moral and societal debate of the few vs the many, the collective vs the individual, complete natural freedom vs human boundaries. None of the other features are remotely impressive enough to revert the spotlight away from this feature, and I believe this feature is the one thing that remains with the audience after watching the film.<br/><br/>So, if you wish to be intrigues and compelled by such a conflict of moralities - I can't recommend The Purge enough, as it's one of the most original and innovative works of this field in cinema to date. It's even suspenseful enough for those who care less about such debates while watching, and have lowered expectations. However, if you're looking for top notch suspense with plot twist and clever screenwriting - The Purge would hardly serve."

Don't want to join in on the fun? Stay inside, and hope nobody breaks in. And whatever you do, do not, under any circumstances, let anyone in your home! This is the reckoning day for many. The Purge had potential, but the direction they decided to go with the plot...I don't know. I was let down. Basically, not to spoil anything, instead of focusing in on various areas, various people, various crimes, were stuck with one setting , and it just grows old real quick. Violent? Barely. The Purge captures a sense of fear, it captures the feel of danger, and that intense atmosphere. The acting is not bad. But if the plot is lacking, so is the story. If the story is lacking, your imdb stars are lacking. 5 out of 10 from me. PS: Many people say that The Purge Anarchy is a much better movie, so I just take their word for it.

"drqshadow-reviews","4","0","0","10 March 2018"," A Thrilling Concept, Betrayed by a Generic Plot
","In an idealized future version of America, we vent our national frustration on one golden night, in which all crime up to and including murder is legal and the results are somehow televised. Apparently it works, because violence is supposedly down and employment is way up, but there is the tricky issue of surviving that single naughty holiday without passing through the crosshairs of an enemy. As a concept, The Purge is ripe. Especially so today, four years after its release, when the nation seems as politically and culturally divided as ever and violent undercurrents are simmering. There's so much opportunity to toy with the metaphorical overtone (including one or two extra-interesting caveats about the event itself which are left unexplored) that it's amazing they're merely used to prop up a rather generic horror/suspense combo. Family makes a series of poor choices. Bad guys show up on their doorstep to make threats and embrace modern horror stereotypes. Big showdown with a few telegraphed twists. That's the jist. The allure of the Purge, and the nationwide embrace of what it means, is right there, just begging to be further mined, but instead it's relegated to mere background color. An excuse not to call the police, really, and nothing more. Despite an inspired (and, go figure, largely unexplored) take by Rhys Wakefield as the charismatic gang leader, this is some bland, uniform stuff."

","Justin here. When the first Purge came out in 2013, it really piqued my interest. I loved the concept of the government allowing only once a year for crime to be legal and it's in a futuristic setting. I'll be honest, I did not really like the first movie. It felt really wasted with its potential because it didn't seem like it had executed with the idea very well because 98% of it took place in a house and it became just a home invasion film. It had some creepy parts here and there like with the little remote control doll, the masks look creepy, and I liked the main leader of the group who was over the top. Needless to say, the characters including the son and daughter made some really stupid choices and the kills weren't really that creative. They just felt standard. It had a lot of padding issues and didn't really pick up until close to the last half. Ethan Hawke was okay, but his character was kind of incompetent. Lena Headey was good though. Overall, I wasn't too big of a fan. 5/10."
"Screen_Blitz","6","0","0","9 June 2016"," Amazing dystopian idea doesn't quite live up to its fullest
","It is common for filmmakers to conceive such fascinating ideas and watch as they're ideas translate poorly on-screen. On the bright side, some of these instances have to be proved to be surprisingly successful, most particularly films dealing with a dystopian society. This film directed and written by James DeMonoco establishes a profoundly interesting concept that raises questions about our society today, including ""Could this possibly happen in the future?"" and ""Would this be beneficial, damaging to our society, or both?"". This film is set in the near future in which the government has enacted a legislation known as The Purge, an annual night of the year when crime in America including murder, rape, and robbery is legal for twelve hours without any interference or disciplinary response by the law enforcement. The purpose of this act is reduce our country's crime rate and unemployment which reaches an all-time low thanks to this act. The plot centers on the Sandin family including James (played by Ethan Hawke), Mary (played by Lena Headey), and their two teenage children Charlie (played by Max Burkholder) and Zoey (played by Adelaide Kane); a family who lives in a beautiful home set with a high-tech security system which they use to protect themselves on the night of the Purge. When a lonely man batter in blood wanders the streets yelling for help from a gang of masked criminals lead by the sadistic leader (played by Rhys Wakefield) out to kill him, Charlie unlocks the security system letting the poor man. With the gang breaking into their house demanding for the man they are targeting. The family must stand together to survive the violent while struggling to turn into the killers that are after them.<br/><br/>With such as thought-provoking idea like this brought together on-screen, it's difficult not to think of the possibilities like ""What would you do during the Purge?"" while watching this. The film succeeds on some levels such as formulating stark, thought-provoking themes and generating some well drawn characters, particularly the main characters James and Mary who are awarded with fine performances by Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey. The script on the other hand, lies the film's biggest falter. The plot is not bad and does enough to keep at least some glued to their seats, it never quite reaches its full potential. There are so many grounds the plot leaves unexplored and because of this, results in an brilliant film concept that feels somewhat unfinished. Instead of venturing through various concepts, the plot focuses primarily on the family's fight for survival and the grim atmosphere that drives the plot. The suspense works at times, but at other times feels dull. The main conflict here is not the family confrontation against the sadistic criminals that threaten to kill them but also the inner conflict within the characters, the testing of their moral compass when they stuck with decision to either throw the poor man the son let in out to die, or pick up their weapons to fight to protect him and themselves. In the end, viewers eventually come to care for the characters and hope of their survival, even the film fails to be scary or inventive as it outta be. <br/><br/>Overall, The Purge is an okay film that expresses some intriguing concepts and thrills, although some viewers will left yearning for more. The film may suffer some flaws in terms of writing and direction but there is still some good to be handed here. Those looking for a straight-out scare fest are likely to be displeased, others may find some satisfaction here."

","The Purge certainly takes place in an interesting future. The premise was really interesting and during the first half hour I was confused why this movie had such a low rating. After the half hour mark I began to understand the low ratings. The movie turned into a mediocre horror thriller, and the backstory was more or less forgotten.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke was great from the start. So was Lena Headey. They had great chemistry as a husband and a wife and they shared some good moments, in my opinion. But they couldn't save the movie.<br/><br/>The kids however were completely opposite to their parents. The son was perhaps the most annoying character in a horror movie ever. And how he got away with everything he did was just irritating. His character was there basically just to move the plot forward and have some kind of conflict and danger befall on the movie's family.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't all that well made either. The jump scares were painfully obvious and were more of an annoyance than actual scare. The movie did feature one brutal fight scene, which was well executed and shot and Ethan Hawke really shined in it. It's a shame that the rest of the second half was so bad."

","This film takes a decent and interesting premise and reduces it to absurdity through poor writing and direction. At a time in the future, the government sanctions one night a year where all crimes are legal, including murder. This releases gangs of ruthless offenders on to the streets to do nasty deeds; it also feeds some kind of left wing dream as represented in this movie. The premise is ruined when the plot depends entirely on the players doing illogical things to keep it moving. The film is further destroyed when the writers turn it into a long ad for their political agenda. It is not worth the time it takes to watch."

Before HUNGER GAMES, there was BATTLE ROYALE (the movie HUNGER GAMES ripped off). Before BATTLE ROYALE, there was THE RUNNING MAN. And on, and on, and on the list goes. While there's probably some unhappy corner of the globe, where such events are possible, it gets old after awhile. Enter THE PURGE. In the US of the near future, crime is now non-existent and there's very little in the terms of rage and violence. What's the solution? One night a year, for 12 hours, the nation holds The Purge. In that period of time, all law enforcement, firefighting services, and medical assistance is suspended. People are allowed to commit atrocities with impunity. Anyone who doesn't want to participate simply has to close the shutters and wait it out in the ""safety"" of their own homes. YEAH RIGHT! In THE PURGE, we're introduced to a bland upper-middle class family who want nothing to do with the annual cleansing process. But wouldn't ya know? The baddies come a-callin' and won't take ""no"" for an answer. So now, this mild-mannered family must find it in themselves to fight against the various murder-hungry punks. Overall, it's exciting.

","The Purge has a great premise: One night a year all crime is legal and a family try to survive the night. There's plenty of opportunity for scary thrills and social commentary. This movie offers neither, since it's a total chicken and chickens out of actually doing anything interesting. This is a movie which devolves as it goes along, like Benjamin Button. It starts out well. Good premise, thought provoking set up, some tension and when a group of creepy villains show up at the house, you think you're in for some scary action. You're not. This is not a totally intolerable film and remains watchable throughout. It's such a great premise that it's difficult not to take some sort of interest in the movie. It's also too short and underdeveloped to do too much harm to anyone who sees it. It's not scary, but there's some very mild tension. The Purge just needed to be handled by a better writer and director. A higher budget than just $3 million dollars might not have hurt either.<br/><br/>The main problem with TP is its lack of actual fear. The lighting's too dark to actually see anything properly and the direction is very flat. It often feels like hider in the house, and there's no real suspense. The moral dilemmas presented throughout the film aren't given enough attention and are solved with stupid writing. The script is another thing which lets it down. The characters are stupid, don't feel real and just aren't interesting. They also change their minds in very silly ways. The film is at first mildly suspenseful horror but towards the end degenerates into clichéd and numbing violence, which is the final proof that TP is in reality nothing special at all and something we've seen 50+ times before. A sequel was released this year mysteriously although apparently it was a bit better. A prequel is planned for next year. It looks like we're going to get a purge every year.

It's simply referred to as the Purge. In the real world, something like this would get shot down quickly but we are going to have to accept this for the sake of the movie.<br/><br/>The social commentary behind it after all is quite interesting. The main character played by Ethan Hawke is a wealthy man living in a wealthy neighborhood. He supports the Purge and not only that, but makes a profit off the event by selling people home defense systems. Therefore, the rich are more likely to survive the Purge than the middle or lower class. <br/><br/>The plot of this movie is simple. The main character's son allows a stranded homeless man in after a group of masked, college educated killers that have a hatred for the impoverished want to kill him. The killers want the homeless man and give the main character a chance to live by giving him over. There is also a minor subplot of another person that infiltrated the house before lockdown but I don't go into details to avoid spoiling the entire plot.<br/><br/>With only a 3-4 million dollar budget, the movie does so little around this interesting but implausible premise.

","Average home invasion thriller featuring probably the weakest villains I've seen in years. You have a guy like Anthony Bravo giving a great performance as a serial killer in a weak film like 'Shock Value,' yet you have a guy like Rhys Wakefield landing big roles in a genre he has no place in. The 'Polite Leader' character is beyond awful and when his crew isn't too busy skipping like 12 year old school girls, they're trying their best to be intimidating - and it simply doesn't work. The rest of the cast manages to hold their own, especially Edwin Hodge, who somehow steals the show as the 'Bloody Stranger.' <br/><br/>'Purge' pretty much follows every cliché in the book, and even though I don't consider that a bad thing, if you're going to be cliché, you're going to need strong characters. 'the Purge' only has one.<br/><br/>Random Ramblings of a Madman: You're not going to find a single likable character in this film, nor will you find anything that resembles evil incarnate. What you will find is Ethan Hawke battling the kid from 'Black Balloon,' and, well, that's not exactly a frightening scenario... at least not in the way they were hoping for it to be.

","In the future (the year 2022), crime is essentially nonexistent and the unemployment rate is 1%. But one night a year, the country's fine citizens are permitted to commit any crime they wish, without penalty, including murder. It's the ultimate way to blow off steam. Twelve hours of mayhem, and then the population surplus is reduced. That's life with The Purge.<br/><br/>The Purge - the event, not the movie - is sold as a good thing, something that keeps everyone in harmony for the other 364 days in the year. No crime? Almost everyone's employed? All due to The Purge, apparently. Some see it with a more cynical eye, though; those who can afford to defend themselves, their family, and their property against the onslaught of violence will probably be just fine. But those who live in the poorer sections of their city...well, they're there to be Purged.<br/><br/>James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) lives with his family in a gated community. James sells security systems, which as you might guess becomes a lucrative business around the time of The Purge each year, on March 21. The Sandin family has a very nice, expansive house, nestled among a plethora of other ""haves."" Thus James, wife Mary (Lena Headey), son Charlie (Max Burkholder), and daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) feel safe, removed from the anarchy of the annual ritual.<br/><br/>Until, of course, a still-unsure-if-he-supports-The-Purge Charlie decides, after the sirens have signaled the beginning of the madness, to let a bloody homeless man (Edwin Hodge of As Above, So Below) into their home. Ooh, bad call. See, some devout, well-armed Purgers are looking for the guy, and sure enough the Sandins' neighbors have ratted them out as harboring the guy. Does James hand over the man, or do the mercenaries take the house by force? Like You're Next, The Purge centers on a group of people being attacked unexpectedly. James does have weapons, but it's quickly apparent that his security system is more of a nominal deterrent than anything. The villains find it surprisingly easy to get inside. And with the lights out - yep, no power except for the generator that's somehow powering only the multiple cameras - and the family separated from each other, it's utter chaos at Chez Sandin.<br/><br/>Also like You're Next, there's a nifty twist at the end. Sort of makes up for plot holes or just missing information. Here's a question: Since all weapons at Level 4 and below are legal during The Purge (and presumably illegal the rest of the year), how do law-enforcement officials discern whether a higher-grade weapon has been used outside of the annual Purge? It's not explicit in the movie, but I guess crimefighting is just that good in the future. But then I was thinking, what if it's good by virtue of instilling fear in the populace? That might control everyone for much of a year, but when it came time for The Purge, wouldn't cops be the first ones on the firing line? (Note: in a prologue voice-over, we're informed that elected officials have immunity.) The Purge offers some interesting food for thought. Would you be willing to live in a complete police state in order to have a crime-free society with jobs for everyone? On the plus side, you get to steal/vandalize/rape/pillage/murder to your heart's content. On the negative side, you could be the victim of all of that and not live to see another Purge. Kind of a dilemma, eh? But make no mistake, this isn't a movie that dwells on heavy issues. It's a thriller designed to shock and entertain, and to that end The Purge does a bloody good job."

","In the not to distant future of 2022, the United States Government has selected a twelve hour time period once a year where any crime is permitted as the new America gets to 'Cleanse and Purge' itself of the violence it holds in all year long. This sets up a class-struggle between the rich and the poor. The rich can afford security and the poor are open to the murder. Enter James Sandin (Hawke) who has sold a purge proof security system to all his rich neighbors. Being told 'this is what is best for America' and believing it, the family sits down to dinner as the 12 hour purge begins. Only Charlie (Burkholder) seems distraught over the event. Through his sympathy, he un-arms the house security system and lets in a man (Edwin Hodge) being pursued by some crazies wearing masks. The family is told if they don't deliver the man to them for death, they will break in and take everyone. Writer/Director James DeMonaco writes a story that sounds far-fetched but in today's political world it just might ring of truth. All humanity and decency is tossed aside in favor of feeling safe. Of course there is the class struggle as well and all of this is something the family must face in these 90 minutes of film. Surely there are some absurd plot twists that must be overlooked to get to that moment when the invaders are in the home, in the dark and it's either kill or be killed. DeMonaco builds decent suspense and there are some chilling scenes as well, as the movie becomes a guilty pleasure. The performances are good and the group of crazies outside is truly scary. Whether you believe in DeMonaco's political stance or not doesn't really matter. The fact he has something built into the storyline that makes you question and think is a good thing and quite rare. The actual execution is decent but the scariest thing about this movie is the idea that it could come true."

Problem is at times I found myself thinking about the idea of the purge rather than concentrating on the story. <br/><br/>The set for the film was limited as it was mainly focused on the house of the family involved.

One thing I found with this movie is that the ending was a sequence of plot twists, I was half expecting the homeless guy to turn around and say, 'no in fact you're mine!'. Either way I think its safe to say, Anarchy won't be the last we see of these films, and hopefully the following films will tell the story to its potential which is something this movie failed to do.

","This is one of those movies that squanders the potential of its premise.

Of course, this is all due to The Purge, and annual event where people can commit any sort of crime they want and get away with it. It's interesting, but instead of taking advantage of this, it decides to be your standard home-invasion movie, which is very disappointing.<br/><br/>The other problem is with the cast. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are good actors, and Headey in particular does gives a good performance, but almost everyone else here is extremely annoying. The daughter's boyfriend tries to kill her father because he won't let them be together, as if killing him would solve everything. And the daughter is saddened by this, because her daddy killed her boyfriend. The son is pretty much the cause of everything, because he let someone into their home. And the main villains pretty much do nothing, with their leader again being extremely obnoxious. It's hard to care for anyone when people are this annoying.<br/><br/>There is some good. Despite being a generic home-invasion thriller, there's some nice horror scenes, some decent fights, and it's pretty violent. It's also short, so there's no real filler.

"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","5","0","0","18 July 2014"," A thriller that almost had deeper meaning
","Nothing has really changed since cops and modern day law was introduced into society. There's the lower, upper and middle class that strive to make it big in the world and hope to all be successful. Obviously, not everyone does make it and unfortunately with this inequality comes various side effects. Much of these problems include that of a drop in productivity of the economy and increased crime rates. But what if all of that was eliminated with just one half day where all law enforcement stopped and all crime was permitted for a full 12 hours? Welcome to the year 2022, and not a far one at that. Where crime is at an all time low, the economy is booming and the unemployment rate is at 1%. That's astounding. But so is ""The Annual Purge"" that was put into place as well.<br/><br/>For one thing, this particular premise is so deviant that it's difficult not to think of what one could do on such a holiday (I guess one would consider it). But this also brings up the question, what would be the point of this violent 12-hour explosion if everything were great? Turns out there are still homeless people, but apparently the purge is what is supposed to take care of this issue. With this in mind, the writing by (as director too) James DeMonaco has socio-political subtext in the story that debates on whether the purge truly is a benefit to society, to release built up anger or if its an excuse just to have unmonitored violence. The writing also brings up the idea of morals; whether one should participate or not. All very good, but with this comes lack of depth to the characters at hand.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey play a set of parents with two children that end up being caught in a dangerous situation. When a stranger from the outside asks for shelter from an eminent group purge threat, the group in search of the stranger begins making threats to break into the family's home. As a cast, the actors perform to their best, but the development of their specific roles are either too thin or too cliché. Seriously, some of these characters that take part in the purge are just grudge holders. If you look at them carefully, you could see that they had opportunities to possibly reconcile with their grudgemaker, but no. Instead they wait for the purge, why wait that long? What if they later on were to become something more and made your life better than ever? These are just flimsy motivations to what seems like taking part in a compulsory addiction that eats away at the conscience of the individual if left unchecked. What's wrong with these people?<br/><br/>The only characters that truly stood out was Charlie (Max Burkholder) and the Polite Leader (Rhys Wakefield). Burkholder's role brought up several times the issue of morals because oddly everyone around him has no conscience, not even his family. Wakefield on the other hand brings on the insane by giving a performance that was not only creepy but downright disturbing because of how polite yet unfeeling he is. His best scene is when it comes to him meeting Ethan Hawke at the front door. Sadly even Wakefield is underutilized.<br/><br/>With also the shorthand of unique characters comes a few other issues. For one, the pacing felt slow. It's understood that giving the family time to settle the issue creates suspense but with slow pacing, the tension is lost. Then when things get under way, the third act feels like your regular horror film - cheap jump scares and violence that is at best average. Fire axes, knives and guns aren't all that special. Using household appliances would've been more interesting. Cinematography wasn't anything special either. Score wise, Nathan Whitehead's music was alright. What'll really hook people is his light and fluffy intro credit song. Very bizarre because of how it contrasts what is being presented. There were a few other moments of different tunes, but at times he would also create tunes that sounded a bare as Joseph Bishara's score to that of The Conjuring (2013). Starting out isn't always the easiest so we'll see if he grows as a composer.<br/><br/>Its premise, layered writing and only a couple characters are what make it interesting to see. Sadly, the pacing is slow, the violence is generic and the rest of the cast is flat out boring with clichéd development."

I expected so much out of this movie due to James DeMonaco incredible ideas of the story line with a abnormal day called the 'purge' where all crime is legal despite the fact that people still stay indoors and not causing trouble.<br/><br/>but...<br/><br/>To be honest, the reason the movie was badly rated my me was that the entire movie is focused in one location and 1 family which surely made the the purge less interesting. Also the acting done by Ethan Hawke sadly brought my hopes down as he did not sound 'fluent/clear'. <br/><br/>The plot of the movie was incredible. No, amazing. But how the story played throughout the movie was worse than i expected. I was able to predict every scene of the movie due to obvious movements and acting by the crew.<br/><br/>I think the 'purge' should really focus more on wider settings and loosen unexpected/plot twisting scenes as people like us lose interest in a second. <br/><br/>Movie was great, interesting. Yet unexpected and depressing. Thumbs up for the great plot!"

","The highlight of this flick has got to be how retarded these kids really are. I mean seriously, it pisses me off how stupid the decisions these kids were making. I think I can even say those decisions basically ruined the direction of this film. I will say that the idea of the movie was very interesting. Though the film does have its pretty cool action scenes and its minor twist, but it still really doesn't help itself spark a comeback to climb out the dark pit its contained in. This in one of the few acceptions I will consider if they add this movie to a list of possible remakes for the future, because I do believe the idea has potential. Action 7.5/10 Acting 6.5/10 Story 3/10 Intelligence........... Though, I will give The Purge Anarchy a chance and see if its intense trailer is honest."

","I watched this the other night, DVR'd it and now see myself watching it again. I am not sure where the bad reviews are coming from. I thoroughly enjoyed this flick and found the plot unusual and interesting. It is 2022 and crime is almost non existent except for a 12 hour annual event sponsored by the Government in which all crime, including murder, is legal.<br/><br/>A family thinks they are safe in their tightly secured home until a group of thugs shows up at their door looking for a man their son has allowed in to save him from being killed during The Purge.<br/><br/>The leader is grimacing, creepy and reminds me of the movie ""A Clockwork Orange"".<br/><br/>Trying to figure out how this movie scores a paltry 5.5.

","This is one of those movies that you don't hear too many good things about, but the concept makes you want to see it for yourself. The Purge is a very insular movie that falls apart when you question just how it could work. Honestly, it could never work, but the idea was interesting enough for me look passed the plot holes. I was more worried about watching an entertaining movie with an interesting concept. Sadly though, the movie itself was sub par at best. From the very beginning, the movie never really tried to be more than a concept. From the obvious plot set-ups, plot holes, cliché scenes and over all stupidity completely destroyed what could have been a good concept film. This movie truly is as bad as everyone says it is."

","I knew the concept of the Purge and it sounded quite interesting so my boyfriend and I decided to watch it. It started quite bleak and, unfortunately, the feeling stayed throughout. How did a boy who designed a camera robot be ignorant enough to allow a complete stranger into their home? You would think that by now the parents educated him of the dangers since the expensive security system isn't enough of a hint. The character ""Henry"" (Zoe's shady boyfriend) was utterly pointless. My bf didn't like it and felt that they could have done so much with the idea i.e. show what happens outside, actually participate, explain why they do it. Its pretty much like the Hunger Games but at least the HG justifies itself. Honestly I've written hw with better plot than that and Im a lazy teen. Overall, I gave it 5 stars because it gave me and my bf something to laugh at and make satirical comments about. I didn't finish watching it and kinda want to know what happens to them although I can already predict what."
"KingAtor42","4","0","0","29 June 2014"," Potential Largely Wasted
","On the surface, this concept has some very good potential. As noted by another review I read, this film has a lot of connections with other successful 'sanctioned violence to cleanse society' types of films like Battle Royale, The Hunger Games, or even Death Race 2000 for example. But you can easily see where there film cuts itself short and limits itself from the beginning.<br/><br/>First is that it horribly downplays real societal and national views, including the psyche of many of the key characters regarding the event. Second, it uses too many vacuous characters. Several are clearly nothing but obvious plot devices with no meaning. Third is sadly, I think budget ruined this film. One could have added a ton of depth to the family (and some of the villains for that matter) with another half hour of development. But that requires skilled talent and not mostly unknown character actors and actresses. It also amazes me how the 'best home security system' is little more than metal panels that can be ripped away with some horsepower and lots of video cameras. In reality, the ideal and actual solution would be more like Panic Room or to some degree, a house built like one big panic room.<br/><br/>This film in some ways reminds me of (although much better) the film In Time, which had its own great societal view and sort of twist on that factor. But while In Time as least did do some light investigation into the themes and morals of the real issues in the film (it could have done so....much....more), this film pales in comparison.<br/><br/>Since it loses any effort at going into real issues, it has turned what could be a great concept into just another attempt at a home- invasion/eventful night film. In that aspect, it does not stand up. ONe can only hope that at some point a visionary writer and director can see the potential and turn one of the later sequels into a real film."

","Spoiler Alert!!!<br/><br/>The Purge <br/><br/>The Purge, it's 2022 and crime and violence barely exist thanks to the new founding fathers whom blessed a new nation reborn by allowing violence to take place in America streets for an annual night where crime is legal for twelve hours. During this event that toke place on March 21, 2022, the Sandins must protect themselves from participants of the purge as they bunker themselves up in their home in this gated community. <br/><br/>Ethen Hawke, whose role was James Sandin father to Charlie Sadin (Max Burkholder), Zoey Sadin (Adelaide Kane) and husband to Marry Sadin (Lena Heady), was a successful home security salesman who has just broke records in sales for the year and he just gotten a huge bonus, for the sale of security systems on the night of the purge. His neighbors, who have contributed in his successful endeavors, buy becoming customers to his security business seemed to think that the Sandins were showing off their new fortune because they added an addition to their home, believing that they practically paid for the upgrade.<br/><br/>Thinking that they were safe in this sanctuary, after the broadcast by the U, S, Government to begin the purge, the Sandins find themselves having to kill someone who they didn't expect to be in their home. This was an early indication that this secure system may not be what it was cracked out to be. <br/><br/>After a few hours into the purge Charlie, who's character reminded me of the creepy girl from The Ring, playing with his remote control tank see a man running and hiding for his life, begging for someone to help him, throw the monitors that was broadcasting the events that was outside their house. Letting this stranger into the house caused not only for the family to panic but invited the people who were trying to kill the outsider to their home. <br/><br/>Not being as secured as James made his family believe, the outsiders where able to shut off the electricity, which gave the movie an eerie feeling that is meant to keep you is suspense and on the edge of your seat.<br/><br/>After having a choice of handing the bloody stranger over to the killers or having the entire family in jeopardy, they begin a hunt throughout the house to find the bloody stranger so that they could throw him the wolves. After capturing the bloody stranger they tied him up, ready to hand him over to the killers outside. After realizing what they were about to do, James and Mary decide that the moral thing to do was to fight back. After their time was up, the outsiders called the beast to pull the steel door off of the hedges of the house. And the Sandins had to fend for themselves at the end, after the chaos that exploded in their once secured home; they finally were rescued by their neighbors who had other intentions in mind. <br/><br/>I liked when the lights got cute off because it prepared you for best part of the movie. I bet in the near future something like may come to the table since we have all this talk of a New World Order, and new founding fathers changing the Constitution."

","2013:<br/><br/>After having done some shopping,I decided to take a look and see what was playing at a near by cinema.With my attention having been caught in the past few days by the very unsettling poster,I was pleased to see that a screening of the Purge was about to take place.Despite having always turned off my phone in the past,I soon found out that my mistake was a well timed one,when I got a phone call about a relative (who is now thankfully OK) fainting from a sun stroke.<br/><br/>2014:<br/><br/>With having just started to watch the HBO TV series Game of Thrones,and also having seen trailers for the upcoming second movie in the series,I felt that it was about time that I finally went on my first ever purge.<br/><br/>The plot:<br/><br/>The future-<br/><br/>With crime reaching an epidemic level and the country being in nothing but an endless recession,the 'New Founding Fathers' of the US decide to deal with the matter by creating a Purge day,which for a 12 hour period (one day a year) allows everyone to 'unleash the beast' by legally being allowed to commit murder.<br/><br/>2022:<br/><br/>Delighted with the fact that he has sold the most security systems for his company,James Sandin returns home and gets set to use his security system,in order to keep his family safe from 'The Purge' about to take place.Talking to his son Charlie about the event,James is sadden to see that Charlie is unable to see the economic benefit's which The Purge has brought them.<br/><br/>Setting up the system,James starts to relax,whilst his daughter Zoey discovers that her boyfriend Henry has crept in,so that he can talk to her dad about their relationship.Looking at the monitors,Charlie notices a man attempting to get away from a gang on 'the purge.'With their being no where for the man to turn,Charlie decides to open the door,which will soon lead to his family finding out what happens when you purge ' em all.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Placing almost the whole movie inside the Sandin's home,writer/director James DeMonaco and cinematographer Jacques Jouffret give the title a chilling stainless steel appearance,with the metallic look of the Sandin's home revealing how little the family care about the killings taking place outside their safe zone.Along with the stainless steel appearance,the movie also features a number of well-handled,swift tracking shots,which brilliantly display the hidden corners of the home which can be used during the Purge.<br/><br/>Putting a Star Trek episode titled The Return of the Archons down to earth,writer James DeMonaco uses a vague political commentary to build a world completely in chaos,with DeMonaco going from the sly, (James security code is 10/13/1982,the day that Ronald Regan addressed the Nation on the economy)to the more overt (the only people who can protect themselves from the Purge are the rich.)Along with the political angel, DeMonaco also takes a sharp home invasion strike,which despite having an easy to guess final 'twist',does very well in building in intensity,as the Sandin's discover that their walls are unable to keep them separated from the nightmare taking place around them.<br/><br/>Entering the movie with a vicious smirk,Rhys Wakefield gives a brilliant performance as the leader of the Purge,with Wakefield's calm manner being broken by his increasingly wide smirk,which reveals 'the beast' that is hidden within.Attempting to survive Wakefield's onslaught, Lena Headey gives a very good performance as Mary,with Headey showing Mary to slowly gain a fight for survival mentality,whilst Ethan Hawke shows a real terror in his eyes,as James is forced out of his comfort zone,and takes part in his first ever Purge."

It didn't explain the circumstances that led to the purge and the historical background? Who cares. It's not a documentary. I think it's on a couple of levels. A straight out thriller and an allegory. Do you protect some guy who has no connection with you if society says he should die? You have a comfortable life. Why should his problem be your problem?

There is no help available as they plainly point out "" all emergency services will be shut"".<br/><br/>Now, i read over 100 reviews made by other people and i have to say I'm disappointed in the way people reacted.

I'll end here but there are a lot of other stuff i really hated in this movie.I gave it a 2 because acting was OK,but unfortunately wasted.Don't waste your time on this one."
"CMTiago","8","0","0","8 June 2014"," Suspenseful and genuinely scary
","When I heard that the concept of The Purge was basically 12 hours of legality for all the horrible crimes that plague society I was immediately intrigued by the movie and with leads such as Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey, I was sure the movie would be well acted and entertaining. I have to say I was not disappointed and while I would have also liked to see a movie about the questions this theory raises, I didn't mind the path the movie chose as it played out well as a horror movie.<br/><br/>So the story focuses on one particular family during The Purge. A family that, due to their economic status, can afford to protect themselves from the dangers of the night. But after the young son lets a wounded victim inside their house, chaos will ensure, as blood will be shared and the family's believe in the cleansing that is the Purge will be tested. Having also made Before Midnight last year, it was hard for Hawke to top his performance there, but he pulls off a great turn as the leader of the Sandin family and with a strong performance by Lena Headey and decent secondary performances, the acting is generally acceptable. While the rest of the movie is okay in terms of the crew's functions, it's the whole mood of the film that makes it feel very eerie and darkly mysterious.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, The Purge is a suspenseful and entertaining way to spend 85 minutes. As far as the ethics of it all goes, I guess we'll just have to wait until a more serious filmmaker takes this story into account and makes a thoughtful and engaging movie about it.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","A very mediocre movie all around. It has a mediocre plot, mediocre characters, mediocre creepiness, and mediocre acting. It's just all around very, very bland.

They decided that a hide-and-seek movie was more preferable, one that turns into nothing but a mindless bloodbath. There was such hype over this movie, and there was a lot of real excitement surrounding it, thinking that it would be a great premise for a lot of really cool scenes, but they decided to stick with Hollywood crap. <br/><br/>That's not to say that it was totally awful. There were parts that were enjoyable. The guy who kept talking at the door to the family was pretty creepy, and he didn't over-do it. Even without the mask on, he was quite convincing as a psychopath. There were a few tiny gems like that in this movie, but none of them came close to saving this movie.

","The concept is brilliant, the effect totally failed. I expected much more from this film, but against all odds, it was just a flabby fuss about nothing.You can hardly call it a thriller as I wasn't biting my nails because of any tense moments. It wasn't horror either, not even by a long shot. Someone putting on a clown mask doesn't make it necessarily a horror film. And beats me where the SF part is.<br/><br/>I can only agree that it's totally predictable . The moment the neighbours came over to bring the cookies and you saw the jealousy dripping from them, I knew enough.<br/><br/>I also don't think the idea of ""The Purge"" is really feasible. Any decent citizen would take the opportunity with both hands to deal with his annoying neighbor, boss or annoying cackling wife. I would try it anyway. A concept like in ""Escape from New York"" would work better. All criminals isolated on an island.<br/><br/>Eventually there wouldn't be much left of the complete world population if everybody would use that highly sophisticated security system. What kind of system was it anyway ? It only consisted of a few outdoor cameras and some steel plates ! Not so sophisticated to me ...<br/><br/>The overall story is completely incoherent and some facts bothered me immensely.<br/><br/>1. I suppose a sophisticated security system like this could identify any intruder when activated. In that way the boyfriend would be discovered easily. 2. I would definitely keep the deactivation code for myself and an option to set a timer so it will automatically be deactivated after 12 hours. 3. Big annoyance about the performances of the unworldly young son and teenage daughter who suddenly disappears halfway the movie. 4. The nerd of a father who emerges as a murderous guy.<br/><br/>The only positive thing here was the appearance of Wakefield.

","The purge was a film that I thought at first would be long and scary. I was wrong. What was advertised to be a scary violent horror film turned out to be only a typical home invasion film with not enough scares to go around. The movie started out quite good, with us getting to know the family and a bit of suspense as the purge begun. But once the masked murderers came into the house it all went downhill from there. Basically it just ended up being typical and short, with crappy jump scenes and no gore deaths. And then there is that thing were a character is about to kill someone and he just stands there for like 4 seconds before getting shot from behind. The movie didn't meet my expectations at all. and the characters are all clueless. The mother wanders around the hall like she is inviting someone to sneak up behind her. The father kills everyone which makes it more boring. The daughter just hides and then doesn't suspect anything when her much older boyfriend sneaks into her house before the purge. The only intelligent and likable character is the boy. And lets not forget the bloody stranger who is actually pretty likable himself. At the end of the movie he comes to the family's rescue and then leaves in the morning. Its too bad, he is like the only cool character in the movie. Okay back to the point. If your expecting a suspense building film like the strangers or the shining or something, this is not the movie you want. I break it down for you. This is a movie with a creative futuristic plot much like the hunger games and divergent that just fails to become a good movie. It has some scary jump scenes but no suspense. It has clueless good guys and strange gay bad guys with some creepy masks. It has a weird ending and some fights. That is pretty much it."

It's an extremely tense film where the main excitement comes from, you could actually see the Americans passing this law. It has enough suspense and twists to keep you guessing.

","It's been a while since I've seen a movie so implausible that I've immediately felt compelled to write a review about it. Such is the case with THE PURGE, a futuristic suspense/horror/thriller by director James DeMonaco. A few years from now, America's economy is on the rise, unemployment is at 1% (an all time low) and crime rate is virtually non existent, except for 12hrs once every year. These 12 hrs (from 7pm until 7 in the morning) are called ""the purge"", the only time frame when all crime, violence and murder is legal without prosecution from the law. The new laws in America believe that, by giving people this time frame to release their pent up anger it will ""purge"" them and help them become better citizens by ""behaving"" the rest of the year accordingly to law. The premise is interesting and even some ""fascist"" undertones are sprayed throughout the whole movie via TV news snippets. We hear reporters and newscasters debating that it is during ""the purge"" that people can rid themselves of society's less unfortunate population: the homeless, the poor, the crippled, the terminally ill, etc, but as the movie shows, people can ALSO get rid off their yuppie neighbors and virtually anybody they hold up a grudge against. <br/><br/>The movie deals with the tragedy the befell the Sandins, a well off family living in the rich suburbs of an undisclosed city. They live happily in a secluded area surrounded by security fences and wealthy neighbors. We know that James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is a salesman for a home security company and that he has sold his security systems to virtually all of his neighbors, making his family among the wealthiest in the neighborhood. Everything seems rosy for the Sandins as they prepare to endure another ""purge"" by barricading themselves from the rest of the world for 12 hrs while all hell breaks loose outside their house. At 7pm, the Sandins security system goes on, shutting all entrances and windows to the house with heavy steel plates. The family then plans to carry on as usual, even planning to watch a movie later on, but Charlie Sandin, the youngest of the Sandins siblings, sees something odd on one of the security screens and find out it's a black man running away from someone, begging for help and for his life. Feeling compelled to help the runaway, Charlie disarms the security system and lets the man take shelter in the Sandin's residence. As soon as the black man gets in the house, he hides away. It is here that the movie starts imploding with unreasonable acting. Instead of being ""mad"" at his son, James Sanding treats him very, very calmly. Now, I didn't expect a father to hit his son but at least a good scolding. After all, little Charlie may have put the entire family at a life threatening risk. This night is, after all, THE purge, the night ANYONE can kill anyone. Anyway, we soon find out who the black man was running away from; a young group of wealthy twenty-somethings covered in scary Halloween masks (apparently from the same rich neighborhood as the Sandins). This group find out the black man is hiding at the Sandin's residence and demand he be turned in, or the group of ""purgers"" will take him AND the Sandins by force and kill them. The action, gory violence and suspense pick up considerably after this but it's during this part when I began to ask myself hundreds of questions. Mary Sandin (Lena Headey), James' yuppie wife, can't believe the violence that has been unleashed in her house and questions his husband's suggested violent methods to save the family. Saving one's family should be a TOP of the TOPS priority is an extreme scenario like this so WHY is Mary so squeamish about the violence? I mean, as we know throughout the movie, this ""purge"" thing has been going on for many years, it's not a new thing. Yet, Mary thinks it will never get to them or that the ""purge"" only applies to a certain strata of society. <br/><br/>Later in the movie we find out that the Sandins' neighbors are ALSO after them. Their reasons to kill off the Sandins are so ridiculous I almost turned my bluray player off. We're talking wealthy, educated neighbors being ""jealous"" of the Sandins just because they have a ""prettier"" house, built from all the sales of James Sandin's security systems. I mean, is that reason enough to kill a neighbor?!?! You have a newer car than me, so I'm gonna kill you?!?!? Now think of the ""purge"" itself: if I had a family member killed by an acquaintance during the purge, I would certainly NOT wait a year to get my rocks off. By saying this I'm implying that the ""purge"" only perpetuates the hate endlessly and one day it could certainly snap. The thinly disguised moral is that hate is a bad thing, as much as the casting of this film. We have a mother and father, all nice looking and blue eyed, and one of their kids cast as if he were adopted, because he certainly DOESN'T look ONE BIT like EITHER of the parents. He looks like some Mexican kid or something. There's a daughter in there too, but at least she looks cute.<br/><br/>All in all, THE PURGE is mildly nice entertainment. Is not an ""edge of your seat thriller"" and it's not as violent as some reviewers might want you to think it is. The implausibility of some of the situations is what REALLY put me off. Watch it and then go kill your neighbors!"

I am not sure why this lists as horror - it is much more of a Larry Niven sci-fi based on a premise that this is allowed under the American Constitution.<br/><br/>The acting was very good including Rhys Wakefield as the chilling American student with ""rights"". This reminds me of all the KKK and other people who have rights based on the colour of their skin.<br/><br/>I really liked and I am not much of a horror fan.

"coastin_on_a_dream","2","0","0","22 January 2014"," Interesting idea, awful execution
","Oh man. This was a really bad movie. Where do I even begin? On paper, this seemed like a really interesting and unique idea. The concept is unlike anything I've seen. Potentially, there could be a lot of loopholes. I mean, supposedly because of this thing known as the annual purge, where people can commit any crime they want to during one evening, crime is supposedly down to 1% or some other ridiculous number? Kind of an eyebrow-raising premise, which would pose a million ""what if"" questions. The damage done on this evening would be enough to destroy the entire country. The death toll would be high in the millions. Billions of dollars in damage. I don't see how this would be a good idea.<br/><br/>But I was curious to see what they would do with this idea, nonetheless.<br/><br/>The result? An extremely below average, horribly acted, predictable, not scary home invasion movie.<br/><br/>This stupid family has an excellent security system and they literally barricade themselves inside of their fancy suburban home during this year's purge. Fair enough. It wouldn't exactly keep someone from drenching your property in gasoline outside and setting things ablaze, but whatever makes you feel safe, right? So the stupid kid in the family looks on the security cameras and some homeless man is running through the neighborhoods begging to be let in. The kid, of course, opens the gates, and let's the man in. Turns out the man isn't much of a nice guy. Runs around the house and hides. And he attracts a huge pack of people wearing masks, trying to get inside the house.<br/><br/>So what starts with an interesting concept just turns into a boring home invasion movie. We've seen this all before.<br/><br/>The characters in this movie are extremely stupid. They are just so unlikable, not relatable, and extremely annoying that you're secretly hoping the bad guys will just get in there and kill them off so the movie can be over already.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is extremely bad, as well. No much more is needed to be said about that.<br/><br/>The script was obviously awful. It seems as if it were written overnight, in a single draft. The character development is poor, and many characters in this movie are just filler characters, and no explanation for their existence is given. They are just simply ""there"".<br/><br/>Also, this movie is very predictable. There are a few so-called ""plot twists"" thrown in this movie, but they were predictable. I totally saw them coming. In fact, I knew where this movie was going and who the culprits would end up being pretty quickly, shortly after it started.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was just awful. Sounded like an interesting premise when I first heard about it, but don't let that fool you. This movie is very bad and if you do happen to see it, you'll question why you decided to and plead temporary insanity. I literally felt like my IQ was dropping every second I was watching this movie. It really is an insult to your intelligence.<br/><br/>My score: I give it a mere 2/10. A 2 because as the premise may suggest, during production this film may have started out as a film of substance, but it was terribly executed. I can't believe I got through the entire thing.<br/><br/>The horror genre deserves better than this."

","It's a couple of hours before the yearly Purge and a 1%er finds out he's salesman of the year at the home security business. The yearly Purge has been setup by the new founding fathers in the future so there will be no violence during the rest of the year. All crime is allowed. Some families just stay at home and worry, others party, and some people go ""hunting."" While the guy talks about preparing, the family just sits and dines and then 3 minutes before the purge, they go to a room with cameras and lock down their mansion with protective barriers. The kid, the daughter, the mom they all go do their own thing. The kid watches the screens and sees a man screaming for help so of course he's going to open the gates and let a complete stranger in who clearly doesn't look like he belongs in a millionaires' neighborhood.<br/><br/>Also in the house is the girl's boyfriend who is older than she is and he wants to talk to the dad. Except that he actually wants to kill him. As a result dad ends up killing him and the stranger vanishes in the house. Suddenly a weird gang of rich kids- male and female with masks show up at the door demanding they release the stranger to them so they can purge. Dad is all for it, mom and the kid aren't, but they still don't know where he is. The party outside is getting antsy and give a deadline. When the deadline passes, they break in the house. By then the dad has changed his mind and won't give them the stranger. Now violence ensues, some neighbors also show up, and the family will try and survive the night.<br/><br/>The Purge has a fantastic and original premise. But as many point out, the execution is a letdown. The first 20 minutes are pretty good, then things go downhill until the violence starts. It is of course annoying when movie characters act in completely nonsensical ways, and there's plenty of that in this movie. The second problem is that it focuses on this single family that isn't very rational or likable. It doesn't take long before the lights go out and people use small flashlights. You know, it is entirely possible to make a horror movie during the day or with lights on. Hollywood should try it out occasionally. We even get some dark POV perspective because the annoying kid has build some creepy RC doll-on-a-tank with a camera. There are some surprises and twists later on but the weaknesses are too obvious to overlook. The idea is very very provocative no doubt and it confront America with its penchant for violence. This movie should be exciting, tense, edge-of-your-seat stuff--but it just isn't. Hopefully in The Purge 2 the writer/director will address these shortcomings."

","The best and most inspired part of this movie was the 2-minute ""purge feed"" that it began with -- after that it was all downhill. This would have been a great concept for a 28 Days Later style of movie, but instead we got a low-budget one-house film with a nonsense plot and constant silly contrivances, turned farcical with some of the hammiest acting in a mainstream movie that doesn't star Shia LeBouf. It's only remotely compelling to anyone willing to overlook gaping holes to focus on its ""message,"" the one it's endlessly bashing you over the head with. Subtlety is not DeMonaco's thing.<br/><br/>The big names just phoned it in. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey practically sleepwalked through everything, resigned to making this turd, and they somehow managed to make the gorgeous Headey frumpy and useless. The kids do a fairly good job and might do well in the future, although the daughter is left to appear and disappear randomly. The band of prep kids all seem to be channeling the cast of House of 1000 Corpses with cues from The Strangers, more comic relief than fearsome. The neighbors and boyfriend have all the personality of a wet paper bag.<br/><br/>There's a lot of violence to add some blood and body count, instead of actually making any sense. In fact, nothing makes sense. It's just an unconnected series of sometimes ludicrously bloody vignettes connected by a frame story. Every event is telegraphed long beforehand, everyone gets saved by some deus ex machina, scenes are repeated to ratchet the tension but only end up padding the time, and it's all just taken so seriously that I couldn't stop laughing at each hilariously stupid ""twist"".<br/><br/>The only reason it got two stars was because at least it generally kept moving and was only 80 minutes.

Anyways, not to worry, that will not be the premise of my following review of the horror flick ""The Purge"". But I had to open my review that way because that is the premise of the movie, but not with puns but with crime. The movie is set in the not-so- distance future where the US government has made it legal to commit criminal activity once a year in a 12 hour period; this way people could release their urges to be naughty; it's called the Purge. Ethan Hawke stars as James Sandin, a security surveillance sales representative who splurges the opportunity to sell equipment to neighbors and others for Purge protection. When things go array during the year's Purge period, Sandin is in a desperate situation to save his family from a group of ruthless youth who want to kill a homeless man who made his way in the Sandin residence. Writer-Director James DeMonaco did not exactly receive filmmaker monarchy status with his orchestration of ""The Purge"", but he does an admirable job in keeping us guiltily entertained. The movie is no Shining, and does have an extremely short punning I mean running time. However, if you want to splurge on horror, ""The Purge"" should be activated. **** Good"

It could be said that this was shown in the Sandin house, but I was expecting more of a citywide, even nationwide look at the effects of The Purge. <br/><br/>There are some redeeming qualities to this film, however, that make it worth seeing. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are great in their portrayals of James and Mary.

","Heading into The Purge, I had heard that it was a great premise, but fell into the boring already done horror house movie. I wasn't very surprised then, because that's what I got. To be honest, I could have just listened to what was said, and not watched the film. However, they are some redeeming aspects to The Purge.<br/><br/>The film has many flaws, but I will start with the positives. The idea is a very good idea, and I know some have argued that the base of the film isn't even as good as many say, but I disagree. All laws gone for a day (OK 12 hours) is a great premise for a film. The chance to question the society and laws of the great country of the United States is brilliant. They are some themes in there about race, wealth, death and politics, that gave the film some originality. The film succeeds in these aspects, but they don't give the underlining narrative any substance or time.<br/><br/>That's where the films flaws start to emerge. The acting is OK, but at times is questionable. The stereotyped family is here again, with the brutish father, the caring mother, hateful daughter and the weird little brother. The main villain of the piece seems to be a combination of A Clockwork Orange like Joker, and it seems a little too forced. Halfway through the movie it seems we are endlessly following people in the dark, with nothing much happening, and even with the short viewing time made me check my watch. <br/><br/>As a summary it has some great ideas and themes that could have been explored so much more then they were. In the end it becomes another alright horror house movie, but the idea behind it makes it worth a watch if you can't find a copy of A Clockwork Orange or The Strangers."

","In all seriousness, I love this concept. I mean, I, myself was conflicted about the Purge thing. Because in the movie they say it's effective. Crime goes down, as does poverty. But then again, that's probably because the poor and criminals get killed first. But it is true that we are spiteful vengeful violent beings by nature. <br/><br/>That being said, the movie is pretty much rubbish. It starts out okay, but as soon as the stranger is in their house, it gets boring. Tension is forced by music and lighting while it's not that scary or tense. Once the family catches the stranger, the hardest part for them should be over. Yet that's the moment they start bickering over ""what they're doing is wrong"". I'm pretty sure that anyone realistic would just turn him in.

","The Purge is an interesting movie concept with poor direction. It was not a bad movie. It just was not very good. The idea of this American government implementing a system to let it's citizens purge themselves by dropping all laws for 12 hours once a year... is interesting. But then the movie gets started.<br/><br/>The concept had my attention through the whole movie. It started off pretty well and it makes one think during the whole film that everything they are doing they entire time is legal. Intriguing. Then it just kinda went South about 30 or 40 minutes into it. There were so many times I said to myself, ""That would just never happen,"" or ""Why didn't they just..."" It was so often that it took the fun out of the movie.<br/><br/>For example: The concept. The news flashes across the TV that this purge helps people to release their inner desire to break the law, so they don't do it any more for the rest of the year and crime is down drastically. Really? Criminals are still criminals. They have criminal minds and don't live outside the concept of not committing crimes. They would not 'be good' because they are allowed to be bad once a year.<br/><br/>Saving the homeless man: If the dad was indeed afraid of their family's lives, he would not change his mind and start fighting and risk their lives. He would have thrown that guy out much earlier<br/><br/>The neighbors all turning bad: People don't just start killing because the opportunity arises. Lots of people are good people even if they are allowed to be bad. They neighbors storm the house in what looks like a rescue, but then are actually there to kill the family themselves just because their front door and security system were torn down. Right.<br/><br/>Why wouldn't a rich man fly his family out of the country for a few days? It would be much safer and cheaper than staying.<br/><br/>Why didn't the movie show you what was going on at all anywhere else? The whole country is purging and the whole movie takes place in one house. Lots of missed opportunities there.<br/><br/>The other problem is the movie lacks reason. There is too much you have to 'just go with.' There was no real reason for anybody to do anything in the movie. There was no reason for the boyfriend to shoot the dad, no reason the gang could not find a different person to kill, no reason the dad should not have given the homeless guy back, no reason the teenage daughter stayed in a sexy Catholic school girl costume the whole movie, no reason the neighbors should hate this family and started killing, no reason for the creepy masks, etc, etc.<br/><br/>What started out as a decent idea turned out to be a basic home invasion thriller. It just didn't have decent writing. The story set up was bad; half the dialog was cheesy or forced; the home-invasion part was something we had seen before. If you want to see good home invasion movies, try Straw Dogs, Your Next, The Strangers or Funny Games. The Purge was not as good as any of those.<br/><br/>Bottom line: What could have been great was not executed well at all. There were far too many missed opportunities this idea could have gone with. It's adequate if you have time to kill but not great if you are looking for quality."

","First of all, this movie is literally what happened to Anne Frank and her family. What we call a scary movie, is what German people actually did to other people. Of course, what British colonizers did to Native Americans was just as awful (and actually far more murders happened to them).<br/><br/>So before I give you my thoughts, I definitely think you should know that real people have had this experience. So learn from what the suffering people had to go through. Good must prevail, and we must stand up to evil doers. All the people who stormed Normandy Beach made sure we could have this world.<br/><br/>This movie was good, and I am baffled that some viewers gave it a low rating. It is exactly as advertised. The exact story is just what was advertised, and the plot really is what you would want. I would love to hear any disappointed viewer actually form a complete sentence about why this movie wasn't up to par.<br/><br/>I can't give this a 9 or a 10, because there was a few plot holes in the story. In the purge era, people have intense security systems that bring up steel walls over the doors (and windows?). But any real person who knew about what the night was, would also probably have built shooting points in their home... like bunkers in war. Like how the Nazis in WW2 had the bunkers on Normandy Beach, where only mega automatic rifles poked through, with a small area for sight; I can shoot you, you can't shoot me... rather than what this movie did; I can't shoot you, you can't shoot me.<br/><br/>Any real person would at least have some sort of plan for the scenario of a Purge. so that if people surround your house, you could post up on a roof top sniper spot and kill em or at least deter em. Or maybe death traps, near the entrances. Also, there was no Panic Room, in the home.

And I'm pleased to say that it didn't disappoint. <br/><br/>Now the very best thing about it, is its originality! No concept like legal anarchy for one night of the year has ever been done before. Not like a lot of modern-day movies who are guilty of stealing ideas from older ones. It's completely original and I love that! <br/><br/>The movie takes you in from the beginning. Scenes of previous ""purges"" grabbing your attention. Makes you wonder if that footage was taken from real-life events. If they were made for the movie, they did a pretty good job at making them look real. So then you put yourself in Ethan Hawke's position. Asking yourself questions like ""how would I protect my house if there was a purge in real life?"", ""How would I protect my family?"" and ""How long could we hold on for?"". Now the positives of Ethan Hawke's (and his family's) situation, is that he's got a pretty decent sized house with lots of rooms and potential hiding spaces. Of course this is good because it makes it more interesting for the movie. Had he lived in an apartment, the movie wouldn't have lasted very long. So then the chaos unfolds. The intensity constantly rising, keeping me hooked. I'm not wanting to give away too much now because I don't want to spoil it for those who haven't seen it yet. <br/><br/>Could they have made this movie better? Of course they could! The whole movie was basically centered around one main family, one house and their neighbors. The concept is an excellent one for a thriller, and I do think they missed an opportunity by just spending the entire movie about how it affected just one family, and not lots of other ones. But nevertheless, it is a good, solid original movie. The acting was brilliant. Especially the acting of the younger actors. <br/><br/>Six out of ten."

","the idea of this movie is just brilliant, it takes the theory of "" Risk Reduction "", which is the method used in legalizing things like for example Cannabis or those pushing to legalize prostitution to reduce harm associated with not legalizing them. <br/><br/>here the writers take Criminal acts in general and legalize them once a year for 12 hours, where all criminal acts are legalized, in the aim to reduce criminal behavior in general in society. a very interesting concept and one that could allow for several plot lines and several films could be made out of it, no wonder there is a sequel in the works "" according to IMDb "".<br/><br/>Viewers seem to be split in terms of the idea and some think it is ridiculous, i do not see it that way, you never know with how policies are moving, something like this might happen. my only take, is that people tend to be impulsive, and waiting several months to a year to take things into their own hands is a long time, people cannot wait, i would say it would be more logical if they made the purge once every two months or even less.<br/><br/>what ever you think of it, the idea is just brilliant and very interesting.<br/><br/>now the script and characters seemed a bit extreme, and some characters seem to make very silly decisions, but nothing that would make this movie as awful as some on here are saying.<br/><br/>Minor spoilers<br/><br/>the boyfriend of the daughter wants to take advantage of the Purge to kill her father just because he does not want them to be together was a bit too extreme, and why would that be a solution ? would the daughter approve of that or even want to be with him after killing her father ?<br/><br/>a silly part for sure.<br/><br/>END Spoiler<br/><br/>i continued watching because the idea was so intriguing and the director managed to create the right atmosphere to keep viewers interested despite the lack in certain areas in characters. and the movie did not let me down, was pretty good and kept getting more interesting as the plot moved forward and the family gets targeted by a group of Psychopaths.<br/><br/>there were of course several plot holes, for example, allowing for a purge, criminals might use that to take down a whole city down and so after the purge, chaos would persist. for example : destroying police property or cutting down communications. <br/><br/>another is people might kill outside the Purge hours and could still get away with it by lying about it that it was done during.<br/><br/>the movie also concentrated on the social aspects and took away all psychological aspects of human behavior, people are aggressive generally and tend to turn into animals in the absence of civilization, but not all people are that way. certain individuals just cannot kill because it is not part of their genes to do so. the film pictures all people as killers, i thought it was a bit of an over generalization.<br/><br/>Spoiler ahead <br/><br/>for example, the neighbors are feeling envy and jealous of the family because they are making profit and showing it off, but is that enough to justify killing them ? maybe robbing their house, destroying their property, stealing, but Killing ? that was another example of extreme.<br/><br/>END Spoiler<br/><br/>the movie does have many arguing points for discussion and you cannot find two people agreeing on it, but that is what is so good about it, it makes good for discussion and is interesting in many ways. the thrills, intrigue, and even some action and drama are all found here and gives and enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>do not listen to the negative reviews here, watch this original film and judge yourself. i certainly enjoyed it with its weaknesses. recommended and i rate it 8 out of 10"

","I mean, yeah, the idea is a freaking gold-mine. The writer should be shot in the head for ruining such a great idea for a film. I was really excited about this, and I frankly believed it could've been much more. The society could've been shown a lot more, and that would've been interesting. Also, they pick too much on the concept of ""The Purge is necessary"" blah blah. The reasons the characters had to do many of the things they did were plainly stupid. It was really not well thought through. There were parts were after the characters killed a villain and saved themselves they just dropped the guns as if; ""Oh well, there is NO apparent reason I'm using this again tonight"". Also, there were way too many last minute kills. Like the villain was JUST ABOUT to kill someone and suddenly, out of nowhere the character gets saved. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, you will certainly not get bored in this movie, but the person who wrote it could've made a freaking cult and he completely miss-used it.

","Top 10 scary movie potential with mid/bottom delivery. This movie struggled. I watched it last night with a group of friends and nearly every moment someone in the group had their hands up gesturing ""WHAAAAAAaaaat!????"" Simply put, take the movie premise and run with it in your mind; because this movie comes no where close to your expectations.<br/><br/>The idea is fairly unique and intriguing. The actors leave you constantly perplexed and confused with their poor acting, dialogue and decision making. I was waiting for a scene where one of the kids didn't run away, but much like my opinion of the movie, I was left wanting. Typical thriller/horror where you can call what comes around every corner. <br/><br/>The boy actor was awful; showing little to no emotion or expression and inexplicably always seeking to torpedo his family's chance at survival. The girl was as cliché as possible and as with her brother, struggles to grasp the gravity and seriousness of the situation. No one in the family felt the need to survive or help one another but rather to make choices that NO ONE would make.<br/><br/>The goofy dancing and actions of the ""bad guys"" is similarly baffling as they have a purpose not a psycho-circus/haunted house feel. I was left comparing it to Panic Room and wishing David Fincher had adopted this project.<br/><br/>But the biggest kicker of all was how the movie failed to explore the vast avenues this plot provided. I was waiting for the ending to identify the aftermath and ""morning after"" each yearly Purge. How do they interact with their city-mates and acquaintances following a night of self-indulgence? Does everyone simply return to life-as-normal? How do the emergency personnel clean up the mess left over? I eagerly awaited the conversation between the dad and son (at supper) that was alluded to in the previews; but it should have tipped me off that I would leave the movie feeling unfulfilled and disappointed in a wasted terrific opportunity."

","I would hate to change the habit of a life time and actually start agreeing with the masses but i'm afraid The Purge appealed to me in a basic way and i loved it!<br/><br/>As usually i checked out a few reviews before watching the movie and funny enough, despite 99% of the time having the opposite opinion of the majority of the reviews on IMDb, i still found my expectations of this movie lowered by what i was reading. The first review giving it only 1 star, very unfair.<br/><br/>The basic premise of the movie is that that once a year, for 12 hours, there is no such thing as crime. There are rules to The Purge such as you are only allowed to use up to class 4 weapons and government officials of ""ranking 10 or higher"" must remain unharmed.The idea behind this is so that people get all there urges out of their systems during the 12 hours and crime rate is lower for the rest of the year. There is however the idea thrown in there that this whole concept is just the governments way of reducing poverty, as the movie shows the rich have the money to protect themselves and the poor tend to be the ones who are being hunted by the rich. I would have like for this to be played on a little more as i thought it was a great idea to play on, the government want to decrease poverty so once a year they let people kill the poor.<br/><br/>On a whole the acting in the movie was of average standard, Ethan Hawke acting a very similar way in which he did in Sinister and Daybreakers and Lena Headey for me will never cap her role in Game Of Thrones. But great acting is not what this movie is meant to be about. <br/><br/>I personally thought two performances in this movie stood out. The first being Rhys Wakefield who plays the ""polite Leader"", the performance to me was a la Christian Bale in American Psycho. the second was Arija Bareikis who plays Mrs Grace Ferrin. At the beginning of the movie she is completely forgettable but as the movie comes to a climax i found her psychosis intoxicating, reminding me much of Karen Black in House of 1000 Corpses.<br/><br/>To conclude i found The Purge a refreshing change from the run of the mile production line box office horror that seems to have infected our multiplexes. The ideas were not 100% developed or flawless by any means but it was a a very good attempt in my opinion. <br/><br/>Don't Believe All You Read! Give it a try and we will hopefully be seeing more next Purge!"

","I have to say, that I didn't have the highest expectations when going into The Purge, mostly due to the fact that it reminded me so much of The Strangers. However, I hoped for the same feeling of unease, that had made The Strangers so great.<br/><br/>I don't want to say, that I was disappointed. That'd be too harsh. But there were so many scenes which made me shake my head and ask myself, why would you do it this way. No spoilers here, everyone will find these scenes just because some were so incredibly cliché it was hard not to sigh.<br/><br/>But, not all was bad. Since the trailer had mentioned something about Sinister (producers were the same), I paid additional attention to the gritty feeling that movie had evoked in me. And some scenes were just as unsettling as they had been in Sinister. Though the director is a different one, there were parts, which made it hard to watch, just because anything could've happened. Unfortunately, most of the times these scenes either ended with a bad scare or were placed so meaningless, that seeing them didn't leave the effect I had hoped for.<br/><br/>All in all, the idea behind the movie left me a bit shocked. The gruesome violence, which feels to be constantly present, does leave some scars, however, nothing else really made me think afterwards."

","Review: This movie takes a long time to get going, and when it eventually does, I found it a bit sketchy and unbelievable. The whole cult bases was bloody weird and it amazed me how a normal suburban man turned into Johhny Rambo with ease. The storyline then goes from one extreme to another and then reason behind the whole change seemed a bit ridiculous. For entertainment, it is ""On The Edge Of Your Sear"" stuff, but the ending could have done with a bit of work because your just left with a news documentary to tell you exactly what happened. You can't fault the storyline for originality and intense drama, but the movie could have been much better if the director got on Keith it from the beginning. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Ethan Hawke has had quite a strange career because he hasn't done anything that rememberable. The actress that plays his wife, Lena Headey, who is most famous for her roles in the Game Of Thrones and 300, is a bit useless throughout the movie, but she gets some balls near the end, when she is pushed to the limit. The kids were rude and annoying, and the boy has a strange look from the beginning to the end of the film, but I'm sure that he will play a big part of the sequel which is planned for next year. <br/><br/>Budget: $3million Worldwide Gross: $87million (WOW!)<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there thriller/action movies based around a family have to protect themselves from criminals in there home. 4/10"

The security system in which the father actually sells for a living to other rich folks. Things go wrong and the entire family is left under attack. The ending is pretty predictable, and leaves much to be desired. There was so much more that could have been done with the movie. The ending ""message"" if you will is nothing new and can be seen coming a mile away. There is a whole world that could have been shown and explored but left out.

"jonny_keogh","5","0","0","16 October 2013"," Waste of a great plot
","The premise and idea of this story is excellent if not flawed, but a very interesting idea none the less. It starts with a family who seemingly support the idea of an annual 'purge' where people can cleanse their inner demons and take part in any act of violence, including murder, and not get punished. The idea is terrifying, because it does raise the question 'would this work in our society?'. The answer of course is no, because of the financial implications and morality, but still raises that question.<br/><br/>The family in question are wealthy, and not particularly likable so the audience don't really have a chance to sympathise with them when things go wrong. Once the barriers are up, that's where the tension is supposed to start. It doesn't really get off the ground. The kid lets a stranger in to try saving him, and suddenly the family are under attack from some bloke who wouldn't look out of place in a boyband. Yes the masks are a bit freaky, and the actions of those around the villain are a bit creepy, but in all honesty, this is not a scary or tense film. It ends up being a home invasion film, and completely forgets its own plot, (a fairly original and interesting plot) and then wastes its potential.<br/><br/>There are twists, about 20 minutes in, then again at the end of the film, and both of which are easy to figure out.<br/><br/>The villain is cheesy, clichéd and in no way menacing. The end of the film is rushed, and so much more could have been made of this.<br/><br/>Glad i didn't go to the cinema to watch this, because I would have been disappointed, but it gets a 5 for the idea, the masks and the fact that it does beg the question 'would an annual purge, reduce the crime rate for the rest of the year?'. My opinion is no, but I'm sure some may disagree."

","While we've seen the generalities of the plot before, this one has some sharp twists and enough psychodrama to keep you watching. Ethan Hawke is a home security salesman with the typical family--wife, teenage son and daughter. Again we see more clichéd characters, in that the daughter is a rebellious, burgeoning slut and the son a disassociated genius. One night during ""The Purge""--a 12-hour period when all crime is legal (the details aren't important)--the family settles in for what they assume will be a quiet night of impenetrable protection. Things change when the son makes a big-time mistake--and I won't bore you with additional plot points--and the family's fight for survival is on. <br/><br/>What this film lacks is that we don't see the mayhem that occurs elsewhere and the way the family battles their attackers, makes the escapes in Clive Cussler's Dirk Pitt novels seem plausible. The villains are a clichéd cross between those in clockwork orange and Precinct 13. I do however, commend the director for what is something of a double anti- hero point of view. The ending is far from a cookie cutter pattern and gets things wrapped up neatly without being forced. A good date movie as far as thrillers go, not a lot of gore and a couple of intense scenes that might leave the ladies shaking their heads."

","Okay, so I went in with high expectations, and ended feeling less than underwhelmed. The premise of the movie was original. One night a year, all crime is legal, even murder. I guess I should say ESPECIALLY murder. The movie didn't seem to flow well. It begins with a half a** attempt to explain what ""the purge"" is, but never elaborates on how it came to be, or why perfectly nice/normal people seem to think its a wonderful idea. Some even sit around the TV as a family & watch all the murder that's going on. A young boy sees an injured man outside, pleading for help & then lets him in. Meanwhile, a pointless side plot occurs. The daughters boyfriend comes to kill the father because he doesn't approve of him. Its like 5 minutes long & is just there to kill time. The ""main plot"" is that the group of ""hunters who were after the injured man, breaks in & attempts to kill them all. It seems like 10 minutes goes by before that is over...but wait, no, its REALLY the neighbors who want to ""purge"" them. For a movie premise with such potential, they really did a poor job. I kept waiting for ""the good part"". Finally, it happened. The end credits."

","When I first saw this movie's preview on TV, I was very eager and interested in it. I mean, what would I do if anything was legal for twelve hours. I was hoping this would be a movie that made people question human nature and government structure all together. I was hoping it would be a film that I would walk away with i still on my mind for days. Unfortunately, this is not what i received. With a paper thin plot, two dimensional characters and unchoreographed scenes made this movie a pain to watch. The main characters made decisions unnaturally stupid to make screen spectacles. Like when Lena Heady got knocked down, but was saved at the last moment (preditctably), she dropped her fully loaded pistols, but didn't pick them up to continue her travels through her murderer infested house. Why, you might ask, would someone make such an unacceptable, irrational decision like that? So that when there pinned by the Joker wanna be near the end she can't shoot him and get out. They set up that scene so their scanky daughter has to hop in and save the day. The movie constantly set themselves up for scenes like that and it was painfully obvious. While we're on the subject, let's talk about the bad guy. The only guy who was remotely interesting got about three minutes of screen time. They set him up to be this inescapable obstacle, the bane of this families existence. But he turned out to be nothing more than filler. In this version of America, they have a low crime rate, great economy and the Purge. But what they didn't tell you is the fact that in that world, people can be shot in the stomach with powerful revolvers at point-blank range and function properly without any troubles. I don't know if maybe when they had that homeless guy tied up during the entire movie and left him alone for no reason even though they wanted to save him he escaped and got magic medical attention or something, but when he jumped in to save everyone (minus the dad), I literally laughed out loud. The one scene that I didn't mind was the part where Ethen Hawke beats the crap out of four goons and kills them right before his predictable demise. Compared to other scenes in this snore- fest, this one seemed Oscar worthy. Also, just remember that this was a horror movie. Yep, believe me, I had to look on the back of the case just to make sure. Horror movies don't scare me. A shadowy figure peeking around a corner, bed sheets moving by the selves and low-quality footage of dark hallways aren't frightening to me. But what i do expect to make me jump are the cheap jump scares. You know, like when that stupid cat kept hopping out out nooks in Aleins. Jump scares usually make me jump, but this movie completely ruined those by literally zooming into the spot where the ""scary"" girl in the white dress was going to hop out of. The only thing I was afraid of was the possibility of ""The Purge 2"". And after reading IMDb's trivia section for this movie, it appears my nightmare has become a reality. In closing, the Purge proves that a good idea does not do the work for you and can't carry the dead weight of the rest of the movie along this 80 minute waste of effort."

I will admit that the movie is flawed - it has a great premise, but in the end the movie becomes a tale of kill or be killed, with quite a bit of violence that comes across as absolutely gratuitous. Some of the characters act quite stupidly and/or unbelievably, such as the action the boyfriend of the teenage girl character does to try and resolve the conflict he has with his girlfriend's father. On the other hand, the production values are solid - it's hard to believe the movie only cost $3 million dollars. And I can't say that I was *bored* at any time while watching the movie - it moves at a pretty brisk clip and does not outstay its welcome. I would suggest you wait for a time you are not in a particularly demanding mood before sitting down to watch it.

","The new founding fathers of a dystopian Unites States of America have reconstructed the country into a controlled society, which lets out all its rage, frustration and mischief on one deadly night. For 12 hours each year the Purge takes place: a free-for-all no-rules-apply vent for the angry masses, where they can rape, pillage and even murder with no remorse, while the police, firemen and emergency rescue facilities are closed. This is supposed to cleanse the society and thus guarantee a harmonious continuity of the system.<br/><br/>James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) reaps the profit from the Purge installing security systems for the rich and well-off, while the poor, helpless and homeless bear the full wrath of societal scorn, letting their blood to fertilise this renewed America. Together with his wife Mary (Lena Headey), son Charlie (Max Burkholder) and daughter Zooey (Adelaide Kane) they prepare for the Purge readying for house lock-down. However inadvertently the compassionate young Charlie decides to save a homeless stranger (Edwin Hodge) from being bloodied out by murderous mobs. This in turn brings the whole family at risk as a gang of youthful snobs led by Polite Leader (Rhys Wakefield) intend to discard of the waste by any means necessary.<br/><br/>""The Purge"" is ruled by the gimmick, and much like with movies such as the cult ""Battle Royale"" the rationality of the whole concept is glossed over. Once the stage is set you shouldn't really enquire into the likelihood of the whole premise, accept it and try to venture into the places it takes. Nonetheless James DeManaco's surprise hit stumbles into the story with such a heavy-handed low-brow approach to social commentary, that you find yourself observing the punctured holes leaking drudge onto the story.<br/><br/>For one thing as much as humans are prone to vent up frustration, but the concept that once every year people would en masse turn into mindless psychopaths is a bit far-fetched (although feasible given the state condones this as a necessity). Nonetheless above all humans are motivated by greed, not spite and pointless violence, so truth to the matter would be that mobs first and foremost would utilise the Purge not to cover the streets with blood, but to advance their monetary standing - hence robberies, arson and various other crimes would dominate above all. Glaringly contradictory to human nature it comes somewhat of a laugh, when the motivation behind the introduction of the Purge is the supposed unstoppable rampant crime on American streets, which - lets face facts - isn't anywhere near the boiling point of the 1970s. But enough premise bashing...<br/><br/>And enter plot-hole bickering. The hugest issue with story lays in the irregularities to logic that litter the script, the main issue lying with the forms of protection utilised by the fabulously wealthy residing in Sandin's cut-off community. When the houses enter into lock-down the immediate question hits with glaring obviousness: I understand that turning your house into a impenetrable steel-enforced fortress may be a decent first line of defence, but honestly - whatever happened to the age-old panic room? Other faults are less striking, mostly minuscule issues, but this one just immediately throws you out a viewer of the presented reality into the guise of the cynic critic.<br/><br/>Overly meticulous? Should just let it go? Possibly, but still the ultimate tension and narrative fail to entice, as what starts of as an intriguing concept quickly steers away from an attempt to present and evaluate the dichotomous society and flings us straight into another generic home invasion movie with some laboriously attached social critique taped on. When the story fails to evolve away from the baseline obvious and the tension never builds up to anything worth anything other than a snore, a few twists are introduced to liven up proceedings with the subtlety of an ox (with some atrocious acting to self-destruct the pay-off all the more successfully). Surprisingly, despite the family being locked up in the house for most of the runtime of the movie we fail even to get a feel of the Sandins, almost faceless protagonists despite the presence of Ethan Hawke (who unfortunately delivers a plastic performance).<br/><br/>Not recommended. But still a workable premise to work off of could garner a much better sequel."

More than once I had the urge to look away and cringe my toes.<br/><br/>But even if it seems like their combined number of active braincells are less than five, it's still an enjoyable movie. The concept is great, and the scares will keep you on your feet. <br/><br/>TL:DR If you're the kinda gal which gets the urge to break stuff when you encounter lack of common sense, than stay at least a mile away from this."

","Well, the premise was extremely interesting. ""For one night, murder is decriminalized."" The only thing worse about this movie is that if another director (you know, a good one) wanted to take a shot at this original idea, he would be the copycat to this garbage of a film. Even before I saw it I knew it would be crap when you can clearly see in the trailer that the entire movie takes its turn when the boy lets the stranger in his home. If the movie were, lets say, about the actual purge, and the government conspiracy to eradicate the poor population( which was mentioned in the film) then you could consider this a pretty good movie. But when you introduce a great plot and end up copying the Panic Room, don't be surprised when the general population of movie- goers hate your film. The purgers enter the home with guns then all of a sudden their guns disappear and you have guys tackling Ethan Hawke, then shooting after a tackle attempt. Who tackles and shoots later. That's like a cop shooting mace into the eyes of a gun wielding suspect. Man, I could go on forever."
"RevRonster","6","0","0","7 October 2013"," The concept is great...but the execution...
","I'll be honest, I like the concept of this film more than the final product. I'm not saying I didn't like the movie--I did--it's just that with the story, it had the potential to be something amazing. It just didn't live up to what it had going for it.<br/><br/>The one thing that hurts this movie is the fact the story is a little sloppy. The movie offers up a twist ending (and it's even perfectly foreshadowed at the beginning) but the problem comes because the plot doesn't feel feathered out well enough and many of the characters aren't developed as well as they should be. This ends up making most of the story and the ending feel either quickly or haphazardly put together. Even with a twist ending that makes perfect sense feels like it was tacked on.<br/><br/>Many of the characters felt like they should have a richer background and this could have made some of these characters more interesting or more sympathetic but all development was focused on the tormented family. While having a mystery figure play the antagonist (and Rhys Wakefield played it awesomely), it would have been nice to see the character have a little more depth to it.<br/><br/>But not all is bad in this movie. While it has its shortcomings, most of the cast (especially Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey) are great in their roles and director James DeMonaco did a great job at crafting tension and a feeling of claustrophobia for the family trapped in their house...and we can't forget just how awesome the concept of living in a world where crime is legal once a year for 12-hours and how it is just instant thriller material! ""The Purge"" had a lot of potential going into it as it called back to those great sci-fi tales about Utopian societies that carry the dark secret of how they got to be so great but, due to a little messiness, the film ends up wasting its potential and just ends up an average (but decent) movie.<br/><br/>You can read a more in-depth review of this (and other) movies at my blog at revronmovies.blogspot.com"
"emuraws","5","0","0","4 October 2013"," The Purge doesn't live up to expectations.
","The first half hour of The Purge sets the movie up to be much better than it is. It is an original idea that takes place less than 10 years in the future, so the audience is immediately captured by the shock that this lawless night could happen in a time so close to our own. The beginning of the movie also presents a conflict in the future society; the question of the true intent of the Purge. Is it really an attempt to defuse the natural human tendency towards violence? Or is it the government's way to get rid of those who cannot afford to protect themselves in order to keep down the unemployment rate? It is clear that the wealthy have an obvious advantage in the night, whether or not they choose to participate. Those who want to partake in the violence can afford deadly weapons, and those who do not can afford elaborate methods of protection. However, the poor can neither purchase weapons nor defense mechanisms. This issue in the class system becomes even more apparent when the Purgers arrive at the Sandin house. Their leader seems quite sincere in his attempts to reason with James, speaking for his group by saying ""We don't want to kill our own."" The Purgers consider the Sandin family to be of equal socioeconomic standing, and they are only targeting what they consider to be ""filth"" that ruins their otherwise perfect country. After the first 30 minutes, it seems as though The Purge is not only going to fill its horror/thriller genre, but also going to leave the audience with some grand message about where our society is headed if we don't check ourselves, right? Wrong.<br/><br/>My main qualm with The Purge is that it appears that writer/director James DeMonaco has bitten off more than he can chew. There's a great concept to the movie, but it's never developed, so the movie never reaches its true potential. Right after all these great background conflicts are established, the movie turns back into a stereotypical ""family protects their home against invasion"" thriller. There is never any resolution to any of the conflicts, so what was the point of setting them up in the first place? The movie ends right where it started. The Sandins are still part of the rich minority who don't participate in the Purge, and they are still living in the same corrupt society created by the New Founding Fathers. I'm not asking for a Hunger Games ""one person starts a rebellion against the entire government"" scenario, but some small lesson learned might have been nice. And what did the Sandins learn? Charlie learns not to be compassionate, because his kindness towards the stranger ended up killing his father. Mary learns that her neighbors want to kill her. And James doesn't learn much of anything, because he doesn't make it to the end of the movie.<br/><br/>In her review of The Purge, MaryAnn Johanson, founder of Flickfilosopher.com, claims that ""Demonaco has found a prism through which to do something extraordinary with the genreinstead of reveling in blood and gore, The Purge forces us to explore our relationship with violence."" While I agree that DeMonaco has found a way to do something new through the novelty of the idea, he neither utilizes this ""prism"" nor executes the movie in a way that constitutes anything extraordinary. If Johanson is correct in saying that the point of The Purge is to get the audience to consider their own stance, then they might as well just skip the movie. Or better yet, my recommendation is to leave the theatre halfway through. You'll probably think of a better conclusion than the sad excuse for an ending that was given to The Purge."

"tetraslash","6","0","0","1 October 2013"," Initial idea of the movie was great, but was barely used
","To begin, I am giving this movie a really nice 6.5 out of 10 just because the actors did a reasonably good job.<br/><br/>I think other reviewers are being too critical on the movie. A lot of the reviews weighed the entire movie on the fact that the original premise was essentially neglected, but didn't realize and/or recognize that the acting itself wasn't bad at all and was quite average to say the least.<br/><br/>The movie, in all honesty, was a solid movie. However, the media and ads shouldn't have heavily publicized the premise of the movie as being the one-day legalized purge system. This misled viewers and built up too much anticipation for an enticing premise that (although was used) was not to the viewer's expectations.<br/><br/>The movie should've just showed more than just the family being hunted down. Too much emphasis was placed on the family trying to survive as opposed to trying to actively promote or go against the idea of purging.<br/><br/>Neutrality was probably the main issue with the movie, since viewers would expect to see the premise being thoroughly portrayed by the protagonists, or the protagonists trying hard to combat that very evil.<br/><br/>All in all, I don't think I wasted my time watching the movie. I'm quite open, and understand when some movies don't quite hit the mark. I don't think I would recommend this movie since it's hard to introduce it, but if somebody asked me what it was about, I would tell them about it."
"alucardvenom","5","0","0","30 September 2013"," good direction, mediocre screenplay.
","I wasn't looking to check out ""The Purge"" in hurry, but it naturally came out to my list. <br/><br/>It's not bad as I thought it would be, but it still wasn't that good. It's well directed, had some rather descent moments with some fine angles, but screenplay was mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Right from the start I had a trouble with basic idea of the movie: once per year, for 12 hours all crime in America is legal. Sounds good? Well, not that much. Right from the minute one, if you just think little about it, it doesn't make much sense. Just ask yourself a question? What all those neighbors do for the rest of the year, and how will one family act to another knowing that their neighbors just killed someone last night?<br/><br/>In the hour before the Purge (around first 20 minutes), characters seem very relaxed. It doesn't make much sense, even if we are to believe they are used to ""happening"" of the Purge event. They walk around their house, fix flowers, greet each other with cookies!? Shouldn't they be scared and locked down at least few hours before the Purge start? The whole concept is hilarious. Minute before and after the ""Purge time"" crime is illegal, yet minuter after that, crime is legal? I must ask, what would happen if one person tried to murder his neighbor at 6:59am, yet the actual death happen at 7:01am. Would that be counted as crime? It's nitpicking, I know, but I couldn't resist. It's like a philosophical arrow.<br/><br/>Another hilariously bad thought in the screenplay was ""weapon class"". It's mentioned in just one scene, then completely forgotten. Basically, all weapons up to class 4 are allowed during the Purge (they are legal), but all weapon class above are illegal? What exactly does fit into does classes? So, killing your neighbor with shotgun during the Purge is legal, with it's not with, dunno, flamethrower? There's a hilarious line that say if class above level 4 is used during the Purge, state will react. How? They will send police? What the hell?<br/><br/>Kids are obviously allowed to watch TV news with footage of violence, murder, rapes and massacre. That's OK I guess in this movie's universe. At least, MPAA doesn't exist anymore and kids are allowed to watch rated R movies. <br/><br/>The scene with the boyfriend was predictable (or I was just lucky in predicting it) and ending is not well thought and becomes ridiculous. <br/><br/>Story gets going once the kid of the Ethan Hawke's family lets the stranger running from the Purge gang in their home. I didn't have that much problem with that scene, because it was a simple plot device and gives explanation why the villains want to target EH's house instead of dozen others.<br/><br/>Movie has some positive sides to it: It's well directed, had some moments of suspense and some directional moments are well thought. Director knows how to set camera properly for this kind of a movie and knows when and how to use the music (soundtrack itself was not memorable). Some scenes reminded me of ""Assault on Precinct 13"" (or Night of the Living Dead) with nameless villains trying to get into fortified building (here, home) while leads try to fend them off. Acton scenes are also well directed, they were tightly edited but you could see what's going on. Well paced.<br/><br/>Villains don't have much of a personality except the Leader, who is OK for the most part. He's bit creepy at first (I really liked the actor who played him and didn't mind his hilarious haircut) but there are few moments where he becomes cartoon character, mostly because of some silly lines he had to deliver. (tip: using Thee never makes your character sound creepy, just silly).<br/><br/>Rest of the actors were fine. Kid was bit off, but I am not sure if he was suppose to be that stiff as a character or actor is just horrible, because I don't remember seeing that kid (actor) in any other movie. Ethan Hawke is little unbelievable in scene where he has to give some exposition about the Purge and you can almost sense he is trying hard not to laugh (it was a very silly line). Daughter was OK and the actress is pretty. Lena Headey was her usual self (also, hot as usual).<br/><br/>Overall, like I said, mediocre screenplay that wasted director's solid skills. It's well paced, so if you can close your eyes on some of the stupid moments in the movie, you won't have a problem with this movie. You should just rent it when it comes on DVD, don' waste money on buying it, because you'll probably want to watch this one just once."
"sirchristo-447-951030","5","0","0","29 September 2013"," Not well thought out!!!!
","I was excited about this film for it's originality, something truly lacking in Hollywood right now. Yet the film left me with mix feelings. The premises is that you have one night a year to give into your primal instincts and commit any crime without any persecution of any kind. Yet this film makes the ruling out as if everyone just wants to kill someone. Now maybe I missed something but I don't feel murder would be the leading crime if such an idea was ever brought to reality. Truth is thievery and rape would be the leading committed crime. And what about pedophiles, they just get one night to do what they wish without any repercussions. I guess with this concept it was easier to focuses on murder and not the more troubling crimes. Truth is murder is more common during an act of passion or for some other stupid reason. Holding out to one day a year to commit such an act is in no way feasible. The story it self is okay, not real scary and filled with moderately likable lead characters. The girl who played Zoe kept making me think of a younger Eliza Dushku. Truth is this story has so many holes it puts it in high competition for Looper for the poorest thought out script. Truth is it's just another way to make ethnic cleansing, on the poor and feeble. Yet the poor and feeble would be higher up the food chain for the crimes seeing how they would go to greater lengths from desperation to get what the wealthy and beautiful people have. hence why rape and thievery would be the top committed crimes. So a sequel is in the work and my hopes is that you have an avenging angel who kills those who try and harm the less fortunate. Yet I doubt it."

","...but then again a dancing pig telling jokes would be an interesting idea. This movie isn't THAT interesting. <br/><br/>It is a very USA-specific movie which draws heavily on that country's fascination with guns, crime & their constant fears of a decaying society. It was intended to explore the idea of what would happen if we could all do exactly as we like to anyone else without later sanction. Unfortunately there is little depth to any of the characters.<br/><br/>Counter-intuitively, a period of 12 hours occurs once a year when there are very few laws against violent crime. This is supposed to almost extinguish crime somehow. Weapons up to ""Class 4"" are permitted, whatever that means.<br/><br/>This movie is not very good, it has too many ""Why don't they just...."" moments where the characters act in an illogical, or even suicidal, way. <br/><br/>We have a version of the 'noble savage' in the form of a homeless black guy to kick the story off. We don't see much of him 'til the end where he acts predictably and is supposed to represent all that is good in people. We don't even learn his name. It just doesn't work. This guy is homeless yet in return for his acts of bravery he doesn't even ask for hospital treatment for his wounds? Maybe that's because his serious injuries were pretty much healed by the time he wanders off.<br/><br/>In fact, why stop with just him? Most of the characters do stupid things & some details are annoying. For example, with a super-HiTech home defence system there is a slot to open in the door for a chat? Wouldn't there be a video intercom for goodness sake? I wanted to scream on a few occasions ""The gun, the gun!! Take the gun!!!"" And it starts & stops exactly on time? Why? How the hell could the time limits be so strictly enforced?<br/><br/>It's an OK 80 mins. 5/10"

","After watching the trailer, I was really excited to watch this. I tend to gravitate towards these kinds of sadistic, slasher-type plots where the protagonist(s) are made to feel somewhat trapped in a corner (sometimes literally) and forced to fight to survive. However, unfortunately as is the case, high expectations leaves one vulnerable to be easily dissatisfied. <br/><br/>The premise was extremely unique, and had the potential to be quite memorable. During the entire film, I was constantly required to think, asking myself 'what would I do in this situation?' and 'what would I do if it happened right now?', etc...and for that, I think the film was successful. The premise was also not too far-fetched either - an annual loophole/cleanse that exempted all US Americans from legal sanctions for 12 hours. Although unlikely to occur in a predominantly democratic society, the premise definitely could reflect (in an extremist manner!) the subconscious paranoid inclinations of some members of the community. <br/><br/>The film also successfully made me feel a sense of defeat for some of the characters. The vulnerability of people invading one's space and liberties with intentions to kill reminded me of similar intrusions as in The Strangers and Vacancy. <br/><br/>However, where The Purge was lacking was in its character development. Each character did exude some depth, but as a whole I felt disconnected to most of them. During some of the more 'climactic' points of the film, I actually didn't feel too concerned for the safety of some of them - except for the main protagonist played by Ethan Hawke. In fact, there were a couple of characters that I secretly hoped would be captured because they just absolutely irked me (...perhaps representative of my own subconscious feelings to purge).<br/><br/>Overall, the film was satisfying - but I wouldn't watch it again (except to show future generations of what not to do if a purge were to ever become reality)."

","Some time in the future, America is in a similar state to the Japan of Battle Royale and the Powers That Be decide something must be done to restore law and order. That 'something' is The Purge, an annual event lasting twelve hours where all criminal activity (within certain boundaries regarding weaponry used) is legal and without risk of punishment.<br/><br/>On this particular night wealthy security alarm salesman, James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) locks himself and his family behind the shutters to enjoy a peaceful night within their home and view the events via their security cameras. Then a bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge, imaginatively credited as Bloody Stranger) hammers on the house and pleads for help. Unfortunately, the faction of middle class college kids with murderous intentions, led by a polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield, credited as, um, Polite Stranger) doesn't take too kindly to being denied their prey when Sandin's son, Charlie (Max Burkholder) opens the shutters for him.<br/><br/>The trailer for The Purge intrigued and marked it out as a must-see film for me. It's a fine idea, though not entirely original, but the execution falls short of the potential. The principal issue is that everything is established so obviously that anyone who has watched even a handful of violently dramatic films will know exactly where we'll end up. The boyfriend's comment, the neighbour's bitchy quip, the deliberate lack of focus on one particular character in the final act: they all serve as blindingly obvious signposts to what follows. Many of the events are so predictable one could almost write a checklist in the first act and then tick them off in the dim glow of the big screen.<br/><br/>Whereas Battle Royale threw a solution at the public and didn't pretend it would resolve the breakdown of their society, The Purge seems to conveniently overlook the inevitable bitterness that would follow when neighbours kill each other. The Purge might allow them to release their pressure for twelve hours but it sure as hell isn't going to end the resulting tension the follows during the next 364 and a half days.<br/><br/>Beyond the 'deeper' considerations, this falls apart as we watch a peaceful couple that opposes The Purge suddenly acquire the skills to convincingly fight a group of sociopaths who have been purging themselves for years. In Battle Royale, inept, innocent schoolgirls armed only with terror and a saucepan lid died pretty damn quickly! And the film was far more entertaining and shocking for it.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke holds the film together adequately as the husband and father fighting for the lives of his family, though how he prevents himself from screaming even once at his children ""What the hell were you thinking?"" is beyond me. His wife, Mary (Lena Heady) is a victim waiting to happen (no, I'm not going to tell you if it works out for her), and if one of the family is going to cop it, she would absolutely get my vote.<br/><br/>With Bloody Stranger being such an integral part of the plot, why does writer/director James DeMonaco not make more of him? Perhaps if the action wasn't restricted entirely to one house we might have seen more character interaction and development. Heck, we might have been better entertained. But I suppose there must be room to expand the inevitable sequel.<br/><br/>With the arrival of Polite Stranger and the manner in which he deals with one of his own friends, expectation increases for an exciting villain and a game of chess where humans are the playing pieces and checkmate is terminal. Alas, Wakefield merely gives us a nut job with one emotional setting. And so it goes.<br/><br/>The Purge is moderately violent, occasionally shocking (though never surprising) and a reasonably enjoyable nine-star idea that is diluted into a five-star film because it's so damn obvious.<br/><br/>Save your cash and watch Battle Royale again instead.<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."
"virek213","7","0","0","10 June 2013"," THE PURGE: We Have Met The Enemy...And It Is Us
","The premise behind writer/director James DeMonaco's film THE PURGE is indeed a fantastic and, perhaps at first, unlikely one: set in the year 2022, when unemployment nationwide is down to just one percent, and crimes across the board are at an all-time low. But what if the manner of getting it that was to allow a one-night ""purge"", in which violent behavior was actually sanctioned by the United States government, and largely to rid America of the poor and the indigent? It is a premise that may seem outrageous; but so too was the idea of a surveillance state as depicted in George Orwell's classic 1948 novel ""1984""; and what has America become since 9/11 but a surveillance state in real life? Under the right circumstances, it isn't totally out of the realm of possibility that something like THE PURGE might come to pass.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke portrays a security systems designer whose entire neighborhood, located in the hills above West Los Angeles, owes its very security and safety to his security designs. It becomes especially important during a twelve-hour time frame from 7 PM to 7 AM on March 21st and 22nd, 2022 known as ""The Purge"", in which violent behavior, including murder, theft, and even rape, will be allowed—and no police or emergency first responders will be on duty. It is a thing that Hawke and his family, and their neighbors, have gotten used to; and they have also become largely callous when it comes to the potential victims of the Purge, namely the poor who don't have the ability to support themselves with any job or pay approaching anywhere close to what Hawke makes. But on this particular Purge Night, one of Hawke's children (Max Burkholder), out of the goodness of his heart and a conscience that the father has apparently lost, lets a wounded black man (Edwin Hodge) enter the premises, which upsets Hawke tremendously. To Hawke, Hodge is exactly the kind of target the Purge people want to kill; and when the leader (Rhys Wakefield) of one such Purge group comes to get Hodge, Hawke, his family, and their home come under siege from that group. Hawke at first advocates handing over Hodge to them (given that the Purge group has already totally crippled what Hawke had once proclaimed a foolproof security system), but his wife (Lena Headey), daughter (Adelaide Kane) and Burkholder, appalled at his descent into cold-blooded survivalist mode, force the issue. In the end, they are forced to endure much physical horror and psychological terror until the morning comesand does it really end there? DeMonaco wrote and directed THE PURGE on a budget of just slightly more than $3 million; and apart from the sometimes shaky and unsteady camera work (a trait that came from the quasi-documentary style of films like THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT and PARANORMAL ACTIVITY), every penny of that $3 million budget shows up here. There are a number of things that don't quite work the way they should; and some of the acting, especially by Wakefield as the chief Purge instigator, is overly hammy. In terms of what DeMonaco is basically trying to do with what is certainly a fantastic and crazy premise, however, THE PURGE is effective enough. Some would claim, in a rather ham fisted fashion, that DeMonaco is attacking the behavior of the Far Right in America and its attitudes towards those who have less than they do. But I have to wonder if any of the reviewers making those claims noticed that the upscale rich people in THE PURGE turn against their own in the end. This kind of has a Rod Serling-like twist to it if you really think about it hard enough--""The Monsters Are On Maple Street"", anyone?. We have met the enemy, and it's really us.<br/><br/>Besides that aforementioned ""Twilight Zone"" reference, THE PURGE seems to derive its power and plot from many films: the original ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13; A CLOCKWORK ORANGE (the masks worn by Wakefield and his posse); THE BIRDS; NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD; STRAW DOGS (the original 1971 Sam Peckinpah classic); and even THE OSTERMAN WEEKEND (Peckinpah's last, released in 1983). But these are films that have a kinetic and psychological power that very few other ""horror"" or ""thriller"" films of this kind can have without spiraling into hyper-violent absurdity, and they are films that DeMonaco clearly has learned a lot from.<br/><br/>Hawke does a fairly good job of being a somewhat callous capitalist who grossly underrates the impact that the violent behavior of the night of the Purge will have on his family. Headey also does a credible job as his wife, who questions his motivations and his morality when, at first, he decides to hand Hodge over to Wakefield, instead of doing the right thing and fighting for his humanity. In the final analysis, and in terms of its credibility and plausibility, THE PURGE isn't necessarily the best psychological ""horror"" or ""thriller"" film that has ever been. But it is effective enough to deliver what it promises for its eighty-five minute running time."
"HorrorOverEverything","7","0","0","10 June 2013"," Assault On Precinct Purge
","First off I want to say I was not as easily sold on the trailer as much as everyone else. Sure I thought the story was a great idea but I also realized that most likely this would just be another home invasion movie. But really at its core this wasn't just another home invasion movie, it was more like ""Strangers"" meets ""Assault On Precinct 13"", and surprisingly that combo worked pretty well.<br/><br/>This movie's strength is obviously its story, it is a very clever idea but it also has its flaws. There were a good amount of holes throughout the plot, won't post any spoilers but most of them are pretty obvious. But the movie still works, its fun, suspenseful, and interesting.<br/><br/>The acting was solid all around. Ethan Hawke does a solid job and all the family was very convincing, especially the son.<br/><br/>This movie is developing a pretty bad rep, but it really doesn't deserve that. Too many people got hyped up thinking this would be the next great horror film of our time, but really it was hardly even a horror film, more of a suspense thriller.<br/><br/>Its not excellent, it has its flaws, and it didn't live up to its hype. But it is still very fun, entertaining, and cool. Worth seeing if you are just looking for a good time. 7/10"
"brookem880","5","0","0","5 June 2013"," Social Commentary & Suspense - could have been, but fell short
","I loved the premise and the movie quickly sets up the idea that the ""haves"" can ride out The Purge in safety while the ""have nots"" become victims. This raises the obvious point that if you eliminate all of the poor, sick, mentally ill, etc. who can't afford protection, it probably stands to reason that a great deal of crime and unemployment would be eliminated leading to this society with 1% unemployment and low crime. The Purge (killing of the have nots) is just the price society pays in order to enjoy living in relative comfort the rest of the time.<br/><br/>I was expecting the movie to take this idea and do something interesting with it, but it really never does. It set up this interesting premise and then promptly went to suspense movie. The parts where people displayed social conscience were brief and the reasons never really explored - just ""these people are monsters, do we want to be monsters too?"" But no real examination of the larger social issues that would lead to a sanctioned mass killing of the poor and defenseless. ""In Time"" and ""Repo Men"" both did a better job of looking at the bigger picture issues with the system.<br/><br/>OK, fine so we're going to blow by the social commentary. Give me a great suspense then! The movie failed to do that too. Instead they give a very predictable plot line with bad guys who are more pathetic and disturbing than scary. It would have been a much more interesting movie if the sneaky kid with the robot had turned out to harbor homicidal tendencies and tried to take out his parents.<br/><br/>Maybe worth renting on video, but I wouldn't pay theater prices to see it."

"ersinkdotcom","8","2","6","6 June 2013"," ""The Purge"" is a well-paced and violently disturbing film that will viewers with something to think about
","From the moment I saw the first trailer for ""The Purge"" and read its synopsis, I knew I had to see it. The concept was so frightening yet intriguing. One thing's for sure. No one will leave the theater and immediately forget the film. I'm willing to bet many audience members will reflect on it for the next couple of days.<br/><br/>In the year 2022, crime and unemployment are at an all-time low in the United States. It's a wonderful time in the history of our great country. However, freedom and prosperity don't come without a price. To keep order, the government has sanctioned one night a year for citizens to ""purge"" themselves. During this twelve hour period, all crime is allowed and the emergency services and police are off-duty. This is an opportunity for people to get their aggressions out any way they need to, whether it be looting, murdering, or some other means.<br/><br/>The Sandin family (Ethan Hawke, Lena Headey, Max Burkholder, and Adelaide Kane) is spending the night of the Purge barricaded inside their high-class mansion. The home's intricate security system is nearly full proof. When the Sandin's son (Burkholder) sees a man (Edwin Hodge) begging for his life in front of their house, he opens the door and lets him in. Unfortunately, the group seeking their would-be victim want to ""purge"" and will stop at nothing to get the man back from the Sandins and punish the rest of the family for helping him.<br/><br/>Writer / Director James DeMonaco does a great job leaving you stunned, disturbed, and frightened all through ""The Purge."" The very idea that the U.S. could sanction such an event is terrifying. What's even scarier is how the people in the movie just accept this yearly activity as the norm. They believe it's for the greater good of mankind and the country.<br/><br/>The scenes of violence range from gang wars to office killings and, of course, home invasions. The group that attack the Sandlins can't be more than eighteen years old. To see these kids commit random acts of violence to relieve their stress is unsettling. Some die very horrible deaths themselves because of their gruesome deeds. At times, I didn't know whether to cheer or feel sorry for them as they met their ends.<br/><br/>Many people see a movie's running time and judge it by that. If it's less than ninety minutes long, it's under suspicion and usually labeled a dud. ""The Purge"" is the perfect example of a film that's just as long as it needs to be at eighty-five minutes. For the most part, it has good pacing. There's a spot in the middle of the movie that felt dragged out a little. However, once the action and terror kick into gear it's a non- stop roller-coaster of a ride.<br/><br/>It's evident what drew Producer Jason Blum to ""The Purge."" He's one of the guys responsible for the ""Paranormal Activity"" movies. Most movies he's involved with feature some sort of surveillance or found footage and this is no different. ""Dark Skies"" had security cameras in all the rooms. ""The Bay"" was filmed with everything from news cameras to iPhones and home video cameras. ""Sinister"" featured 8mm home videos.<br/><br/>Blum hit the jackpot with ""The Purge."" Not only does it have surveillance and security cameras, there's a remote control car whose passenger is a doll with a spy camera lodged in his eye. This little contraption rolls back and forth throughout the house looking for the bad guys and lost family members. I have to admit, it's a pretty ingenious way of fitting some type of ""found footage"" into the movie. It's getting to the point where every time I see the Blumhouse Productions logo, I spend the entire movie waiting for surveillance and security camera footage to pop up. It's like anticipating Stan Lee's cameo in whatever the latest Marvel movie is.<br/><br/>There's a little something for everyone in ""The Purge"" if you enjoy a good action or horror flick. We get some great fight scenes, quite a bit of tension and suspense, and some effective jump scares that will leave you breathless. Though it has its flaws, the movie works as a combination of entertainment and social commentary in the end."

Though you'd have to be a really disciplined one to hold the act for 364 days... And also petty.<br/><br/>But after less than an hour of watching, the movie got predictable.

"amkendall-42128","6","1","2","12 February 2016"," Not Quite Original and Makes for a Very Weak Argument
","When I watched this movie, it is obvious that most of the technical aspects and the performances by the actors were more than competent. However, I realized that I had actually seen a story similar to this. The episode ""Return of the Archons"" from the original Star Trek series. A whole planet's community is controlled by a computerized personality called Landru, kept in a state of blank tranquility. Once annually, the community participates in what is called ""the Festival"" that begins during the Red Hour at which point, Landru will turn off and the people will be free. During the Festival, all of the people engage in sexual aggression, violence, and destruction, but they go back to being tranquil after twelve hours when the Festival ends. Indeed, the story is almost the same. The main difference is that The Purge is set on Earth and pushes much harder to evoke commentary on the human condition and society. Unfortunately, the argument it makes falls apart all too quickly and is self-defeating. For example, the Sandins warn their children that the Purge is a helpful catharsis to cleanse people of their inner rage. Even scientists on the TV make the same argument. The son asks why his parents do not participate. The parents simply say they do not feel a need to. This alone states that the Purge does not serve everyone, but a select group of people, mainly those who were never good people to begin with. The movie argues that crime is down because of the Purge and catharsis is the key. In the real world, there are people out there whom the Purge would not affect - organized crime/career criminals, terrorists, and most serial killers for starters. These people commit crimes not out of sealed up rage but out of profit, political reasons, and to fulfill desires that are irrepressible. Because of this, they would continue their activities outside of the Annual Purge. The movie does not go into enough detail as to how the New Founding Fathers seized power, solved these particular problems, and made the Purge the primary cause for America's new golden age. It becomes too obvious that the Purge's true purpose is to eliminate the impoverished in order to unburden the economy. On the other hand, it is an interesting twist on the totalitarian story. The Purge is shown to have an additional motive. If this is indeed a totalitarian society, it uses the opposite strategy. Unlike most dystopia portrayals, where fear is instilled through oppression of freedom, it is instilled here via the grant of total freedom. In other words, it ensures that organized insurrection is difficult since the Purge makes people not fear the government, but fear their very own friends, families, and neighbors. In the end though, the movie makes it sound as though once the Purge ends, everything goes back to normal which is impossible. For example, if I saw my next door neighbor - whom I am friends with - rape, torture, and murder a complete stranger outside my window, during the annual Purge, I cannot simply write that off as a catharsis. You cannot expect me to go back and treat that neighbor like my friend the next day. One cannot shut down civilization and then expect it to come back within twelve hours. Aside from its weak argument, there are a number of moments in the movie that come off as cheap plot twists that were simply meant to keep tensions high, plus the movie descends into a simple survival tale instead of a smart commentary on humanity. In conclusion, you will get a good thrill out of it, but do not expect it to terrify you as it does not make its arguments very strong. In fact, the Star Trek episode came off as more believable, since those people's humanity was suppressed completely by Landru, and brought back to tranquility through mind control."

It begins nicely and the scenes were set up perfectly - nice upper class neighborhood and neighbors who seem to like each other. Then it falls to movie of the week mediocrity. I rather list the series of faux paux to give you an idea. *Spoilers*<br/><br/>* The Sandins were securely locked in, but the goofy-looking young son has the codes to open the gate ? LOL<br/><br/>* The teenage daughter's boyfriend whose main complaint was the father doesn't like him because he was too old for his daughter, looks to be same age as the the adolescent girl. LOL<br/><br/>* While being invaded, instead of grouping for strength, the young son was given a gun and told to hide in the basement while each of the parents, singularly strike out on their own. LOL<br/><br/>* The adolescent daughter chose to go to her room during The Purge. LOL<br/><br/>* The iron gate the keeps the bad guys out conveniently has handles to let the baddies pull off with a chain and a truck. LOL<br/><br/>* The high tech security system does not include a secure panic room, just an iron gate (with a handle) LOL<br/><br/>* The goofy,pedantic son with his robot toy looks absorbing, and possesses the intelligence to make a great father and son team, but wasted the opportunity. LOL<br/><br/>* The mom looks hysterical the moment the Purge begins. Got sick of her. LOL.<br/><br/>* The bad guys upon entry to the home, chose to make one-on-one confrontation with the defenders with one exception. LOL.<br/><br/>Thankfully the movie was a short one, and I hope the sequel is better."
"tlooknbill","10","1","2","6 September 2015"," It pays to wait 2 years to see a movie hobbled by public expectations..
","I passed on the Purge back when it was first released just from the bad reviews here. Mass public opinion and expectations can do so some weird psychological mind games on decision making. I'm not even sure I can trust online reviews anymore. Over 500 of them and most see this movie as garbage. Do these people have a central nervous system? I just saw it on FX TV channel tonight and I was thoroughly entertained and jumping out of my seat yelling instructions to the characters on how to get away from the bad guys. It was like watching a boxing match. I couldn't sit still.<br/><br/>The whole premise and concept was as intriguing and compelling as the Twilight Zone's ""Monsters Are Due On Maple Street"" and that episode got a 9 out of 10 IMDb rating. But the Purge was just more socially jarring and violent similar to Kubrick's ""Clockwork Orange"", but played out in an overly bucolic, laid back American suburb. There's an air of tense foreboding calm that made me nervous.<br/><br/>This movie is tightly paced and moves along quickly with no long drawn out explanations for the reasons for the Purge. They go right into it and make it pretty simple. Humans by nature are violent (more than animals) so give them an outlet. Saves on future war and crime but then who survives and who dies gets into some sticky social class deterministic vs moralistic concepts I personally had never considered until I saw this movie. It's quite disturbing in an unforgiving way with uncomfortable implications for the cause of the recent shootings in the news lately.<br/><br/>Boy I'm glad I waited to see this movie on TV. I really enjoyed it on a whole different level than I expected."
"Leofwine_draca","5","1","2","26 February 2015"," Great concept, indifferent execution
","As some other reviewers have mentioned, the concept behind THE PURGE is great: a futuristic America, where society is peaceful except for one night a year where all crime is made legal. Sadly, instead of exploring the moral concept behind that premise, THE PURGE turns out to be nothing more than a middle-of-the-road home invasion flick.<br/><br/>Now, I like home invasion flicks, and director James DeMonaco is obviously a fan of siege-based movies having previously helmed the ASSAULT ON PRECINCT 13 remake (also with Ethan Hawke). Sadly, this one misses the mark by quite a wide berth, despite obvious nods to the likes of STRAW DOGS. The first hour is particularly dull, consisting of characters wandering about with torches and not doing much. I also chuckled at the way it takes the characters a full hour to come to their moral senses.<br/><br/>Hawke and Lena Headey aren't bad actors but they play a pair of very unlikeable characters here, so the viewer can never empathise with their plight. The villains are more effective, but under-utilised, and other than some well-handled action and violence in the last half hour this really isn't much to write home about. The weak writing kills it unfortunately, which is a pity because this could have been so much better in so many respects."

","When I first herd of the movie the purge, A twelve hour period here all crime is legal, I already though how awesome this movie was so I wanted to go see it. The movie it self would be 2 stars.

First I can say there are Many things wrong with the movie. The jump scares are completely predictable. As I said wen I herd of this movie I wanted to see it. It was not what I expected There were only 2 action scenes the rest was just the family having dinner and hiding in the house. Now last. The acting.

"robertjohnmas","3","1","2","9 July 2014"," Typical White Guilt Film
","I had high hopes for this film. Lots of potential to go in all types of psychological directions. Instead it took a turn for White Guilt, as almost all of Hollywood is promoting.<br/><br/>-WARNING, SPOILERS-<br/><br/>The son definitely deserved at least a smack for knowingly endangering the lives of the family. But here is what it comes down too, upbringing. The children can't be expected to make the hard choices if their parents are too weak as well. So in reality, the Father is a victim of his own teachings.<br/><br/>It was only by necessity that he rose to the occasion. But in the end, failed to follow through. I see this in America. In reality, the Mother and Daughter would have been raped, before the whole family was executed. The 'strong male' character visibly didn't have the will power to take on all those other characters. <br/><br/>Now lets take this on a symbolic level that Hollywood is trying to convey: Rich white people cause genocide and turn a blind eye to poverty and the murder of the poor. Rich people are so ruthless that they can't stand to see one do better than the other. Rich people are totally f'ed in the head.especially the ones with blond hair and blue eyes. The black man is poor and totally innocent, as Blond Haired and Blue eyed Rich white people are trying to kill them. The liberal white child (frail as he is, with his black hair and black eyes) is the liberator of the social injustice of rich white people.<br/><br/>Do I sense a whole movie portraying White Guilt? Did you notice that almost all the women in the movie had blond hair and Blue eyes? –At least all the bad women. The one good woman had Black Hair and Black Eyes. The one that got her husband killed and equally endangered her family. In fact, she showed more concern for the poor guy than she did her dead husband.<br/><br/>There was only one line in the movie I liked. It's where the Father is looking at boats and talks about how at one point, they could barely afford rent, and now are looking at boats. It's the only line in the movie that acknowledges that you have no station in life, that America isn't a Monarchy. You can start poor and become rich....Anyway, apparently that isn't a good quality because the 1 guy in the movie that did transition from poor to rich on his wits, died. Meanwhile the family that leeches off his efforts live, and is the direct cause of his death.<br/><br/>oh, and by far my favorite tactic. Hollywood gave the poor guy dog tags in hopes to make the audience more sympathetic to him. I'm a Marine and that's insulting. There are plenty of us that make a lot of money in the civilian world, because we have a stronger work ethic, higher morals, and the will to do what is necessary.<br/><br/>American civilians are becoming weaker and lazier, so it's getting easier to lap them in the game of life."
"tohu777","3","1","2","23 June 2014"," Derivative trash
","This is one of those movies that forms a catalog out of the movies (and TV shows) that it's patched together from. First of all, Rod Serling wrote this premise out several times for The Twilight Zone, especially in the ""Monsters Are Due On Main Street"" episode of 1960. Peckinpah made Straw Dogs more than 40 years ago (!) *and* it was just remade in 2011. Haneke made Funny Games in '97 and then again in 2007 (not to mention his Time of the Wolf, released in-between). The Strangers in 2008 was *much* better than this film. And I guess a retreat to a panic room would've been too obvious a steal from Fincher's film...<br/><br/>Why does a hollow, worthless, by-the-book film like this exist, anyway? Because an ""artist"" has a burning need to shoot something, but no idea that isn't pre-digested and encased in his DVD collection? Don't bother with this junk--chances are you've seen it before."

","In 2022, just 8 years from now, the U.S. government has instituted a new holiday. One that has led to peace and prosperity, but at an extreme cost to the less fortunate. For 12 hours, once a year, all crime is legal and people are given the opportunity to release their hatred and rage on anyone they can find. The cast isn't important to a film like this, it's all about the writers cynical message, that behind every smile is jealousy, behind every hand shake is anger, and trust has become a luxury that no one can afford. This Purge is all about the message that is being portrayed, but it has some major holes in the story. If all crime is legal for 12 hours, how come the only thing on peoples mind is murder? There weren't any rapes or bank robberies, nor where there any acts of terrorism or lashing out at authority. It was all about the killing. Most of the Purge is fairly predictable and it is what you would expect it to be. The big surprise comes at the end, which was extremely powerful, and really gives people the opportunity to question the message the writers have portrayed throughout the film. The only notable performance is that of the stars, Ethan Hawke, who was terrific, in a role I really didn't see him fitting into. The Purge is definitely all about the authors agenda and it is somewhat predictable, but what made the film for me, was the terrific ending, which really does give the audience the chance to challenge the cynical nature of the film."

It makes us think what people would do in this scenario, although the film can be a bit bloody ,it's not too disgusting parts that will make you feel sick. This film is defiantly worth more than some other reviews. Even though it's not the best ever , it's worth way more than 2/3. Overall, I enjoyed this, if you're in to original ideas and twisters then you'll defiantly like this film. I am also looking forward to the new one, it makes you question whether you'd seek revenge and murder or break the law or just go under lock down."

Two minutes before it starts, they lock up the house. Wouldn't you be all prepared and ready well before the purge starts?. Then the son disarms the alarm and lets in the first bloody screaming stranger he sees...what? then the stranger runs and hides in the house. But does the family stay together and bunker down? Nope. They leave their daughter all alone in her room. and this is all in the first 30 minutes of the movie. When the ""bad guys"" make entry in the home, does the family stay together a nd bunker down then? Nope. They all separate and walk around the dark house alone. Way too many ""why would they do that"" moments in the movie. And lets not forget at the end their neighbors/friends going insane either.

"jmillerdp","8","1","2","4 April 2014"," Visceral, Intense Film!
","I think ""The Purge"" is great! It's amazingly, incredibly dark. And, you have to be okay with that. So, it's a polarizing film. But, if you are on board, you can really get into it and find it visceral and intense. I did.<br/><br/>This film is a button pusher, and it's intended to be. It wants to challenge you with the possibility of what would happen if humanity went to its darkest place. And, with the premise of ""The Annual Purge,"" it does that. What fascinated me is that the film took that premise even further that I thought it would. When seeing it, I thought it was basically going to be a relatively standard home invasion movie.<br/><br/>But, it's really about challenging both the characters and the audience with the notion of what would you do in the situations presented? And, the answers become increasingly more fascinating, at least to me. And, that is what made the movie for me, a writer/director who was highly skilled and could make you really feel what it was like in that house. I completely believed what was going on, and that is absolutely key to the film's success.<br/><br/>And, it isn't easy to do that. Especially in film, where too much can be spelled out for you, creating a sense of terror and dread is highly difficult. But, it happens here, and it works! Hats off to that filmmaker, James DeMonaco for creating the world this film inhabits.<br/><br/>This isn't for everyone, obviously, but if you are ready for a film that is thrilling, but challenging, you could like it as much as I did!<br/><br/>******** (8 Out of 10 Stars)"

"sean73267326","4","1","2","3 February 2014"," Interesting concept, but very dull.
","The Purge is probably one of the most average films I've seen in my life in just about every facet. It's a hard film to down, because it does what it does fairly well, but it's even harder to find something good to say about it. It's the cinematic equivalent of McDonalds. It'll fill you up and it tastes pretty okay, but it's still just a little unsatisfying.<br/><br/>I will start on a good note, though: the concept is, admittedly, extremely interesting. All crime legal for 12 hours gives rise to pretty much anything happening in the film, not to mention it's pretty fascinating to explore the moral and emotional implications of committing a crime under such circumstances. Does it suddenly become right because it's legal? Are we free of our guilty conscience under these circumstances? Is our conscience determined by law in the first place?<br/><br/>All the concept in the world means nothing though if it's not used properly, and that's The Purge's biggest disappointment. The film does nothing to explore the concept, and instead settles on being a fairly mediocre home invasion thriller. That would be tolerable if it were a good home invasion film, but really it isn't, and in fact it's very run of the mill. The main villain is so over the top in his mannerisms and apparent nastiness that he's rendered totally unbelievable, and ends up being more like a caricature than a character. Every other ""bad guy"" is masked, which is pretty much Lazy Scriptwriting 101.<br/><br/>So, we fall back on the action, which is admittedly pretty okay. Again nothing spectacular, and certainly not as frightening as the trailers may make you think, but pretty solid. Somehow you feel the film is going to be nastier than it is, but it never really kicks off the way it should. There's not enough gore to make it at least a somewhat entertaining splatter-fest, and not enough tension to make it truly exciting. Again, average. Matters aren't helped by the acting, with Ethan Hawk's performance being the only one that feels particularly good. The ending especially is a massive anticlimax; I'm not really sure what the screenplay is going for with it, but it's not exciting, or memorable in any way, shape, or form.<br/><br/>We're left with a pretty average film all round, and one that's aggressively average. That's usually an alright thing; average doesn't mean bad, and usually, I would award an average film a 5 or 6 out of 10. It gets a 4, though, because it's such a missed opportunity. The excellent concept of the story belongs to a better, braver screenplay. Maybe next time."
"JoeB131","5","1","2","27 December 2013"," A mixed bag....
","Rating this at 5 right in the middle.<br/><br/>The Good parts- the atmospherics are genuinely creepy. The use of the monitors to track the killers outside and create a sense of menace are well shot and the pacing is pretty good.<br/><br/>The Bad Part - the premise is completely illogical. Letting the whole country tear itself apart for one night is supposed to bring economic prosperity? Really? The Homeless guy- Portrayed as a Christ-like character. They make sure we know he's a veteran by giving him dog tags, and he even offers to give himself up to the mob to save the family. I guess to avoid being too heavy-handed on the racial angle, they made some of the second group of angry neighbors ethnic as well.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the next point. (SPOILER) The whole ""twist"" at the end was that the neighbors who had all bought security systems from this family were now seeking revenge because they didn't like that he got rich selling them security systems. That was telegraphed at the beginning and didn't come as a surprise at all.<br/><br/>Oh, the boyfriend subplot. So he's going to resolve the father's objections to him by killing the father? Did he really think this through? Again- mixed bag. If they made the premise a little more logical, it would have been thoroughly enjoyable."

"thomas-watts","7","1","2","3 December 2013"," Fear your neighbor
","The film tackles the interesting idea of ritualistic violence as a mean for social catharsis, retrieving the ancient notion of the world being like a theater (""Theatrum mundi"") with an obvious actualization of the Elizabethan taste for blood and gore in picturing man's innate impulses. The necessary evil of authorizing a certain fringe of mankind to lash out on their kind during one night in the year is backed up by a tacit social consensus in the film, providing that it allows people to drain their natural aggression and keeps unemployment in check amongst other issues. But as it turns out, this ""purge"" aiming at social equanimity is only a revised, with politically correct and bourgeois façade, of social Darwinism, where the whole deck seems stacked as the access to means of defense and survival is unfair,sorely depend on a discrepancy of socio-economic factors and background. <br/><br/>The film is based on demonstrating the perverse effects of the system: the most privileged, the family whose welfare, wellbeing and safety has been wagered on the business of selling security systems to its gated community (the ""objective"" violence (see Slavoj ZIZEK) in the idea of cashing in on the survival necessity begotten by the system), is taken aback by the intrusion and unwitting sheltering of the most downgraded ""specimen"" of society (that is more or less the subhuman status (""pig"", ""parasite"") to which the homeless black man is being verbally reduced) and attacked by the product of the highest form of arriviste self-promoting system (the implicit premise here being that we are in a society pervaded by the oligarchic/plutocratic structure, sustaining itself on nepotism and cronyism), an idle youth who has turned psychopath and cruel. The latter are dressed up as convenient people on a regular mundane outing (smoking, long white dresses), but exhibit the moral ambiguity of this anticipatory society through mocking mimicry of persona extroversion: their rictus-masks are sacrificial masks, inverting the hiding function of the social mask (see Gustav JUNG) by enacting the second face in its traditional and ritualistic function, that is a vector of transformation into the inhuman (see DELEUZE, GUATTARI: A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia - in particular, ""Becoming-Animal""). By posturing anthropomorphic likeness (or, in a more restrictive sense, bourgeois likeness) as an alienation, this ""sarcastically"" empty youth is shape-shifting itself, through pantomime, into the subconscious and auto reflexive monster of the present state of mankind. <br/><br/>The hell-bent bunch which besieges the villa - a house of almost Roman ostentation and opulence, an image of decadence rooted in material abundance - plays out as some sort of updated Manson Family; remember the use of the word ""pig"" by their polite leader. The latter is a blond, blued-eyed loony who condenses several archetypes of evil within modern symbolism and imagination: the golden boy in a suit, the shark businessman who's job tends to foster a frame of mind in which humans are reduced to numbers (data of an equation calculating social profit: how many deaths to hold back unemployment, to purge the id so to go on living in the ""dream"" liberal and egalitarian - empty words - society ?), holding in that sense a critical mirror to the family father's face himself; the Aryan stereotype favored in action movies (or, that used to be) working as an auto reflexive motif in the broader context of the entertainment industry (""Die Hard"", etc. ; allusion to these kind of movies is brought up by the use of heavy duty material to rip the gate of the house open) but younger and endowed with a brain which reveals itself equipped with a deviant sense of craftiness, the ""creature"" having in some sense turned against its creators; etc. <br/><br/>The besiegement is temporarily resolved by an unlikely savior, the reassuring presence of the benevolent neighbors if not slightly hypocritical. It turns out the helping hand was only a way of taking matters of revenge into their own hands: the blond woman - the slightly maniac-depressive ""desperate housewife"" type character - wants the mother to embrace the purging of her children as means for the rest of the neighborhood to relieve themselves from negative feelings of anger, bearing one central and unique motive: prejudice of misuse of their savings, of their capital, by the Sandin family*. The demonstration here goes full (vicious) circle in the idea that private property, in the words of Marx, ""is the final and most complete expression of the system of producing and appropriating products that is based on class antagonisms, on the exploitation of the many by the few.""<br/><br/>If not particularly genius because slightly one-sided, caricatured and predictable (and maybe fairly tame in its mise-en-scène and cinematographic endeavors in general), the film nonetheless demonstrates a good degree of coherence in the development of its central thesis, delivering in that sense a decent balance between entertainment and reflection. The way in which this cruel state of affairs in society is treated, like a normal thing with a kind of moral accommodation, is quite effective and gives us matter to ponder on the potential frame or societal configuration which could lead - through forces of inertia (overcrowding of prisons plays out as one of the triggering factors in the film) - to some sort of compelling to legalize ""controlled"" violence, either backed up or answered by moral relativism, or ambiguity, diverting the ""cathartic"" logic which is originally (see Aristotle) based on the feeling and identification of sentiments of pity and anger.<br/><br/>* Through phrasal logic, father, mother and children become an homogeneous entity of shared responsibility, an implacable reasoning analogue to another period of History exhibiting social revolution, the famous tacit saying of the French Revolution's ""Terreur"" (see, for example, in the novel Quatrevingt-treize by Victor HUGO, the character, Cimourdain) which considered that not even children were to be given an exception status of ""innocence"", as they were guilty by nature and birth, bearing the mark of infamy of their cast."

","As soon as I was done with this movie, the first thing I wanted to do was ""purge"" myself by writing a review. This movie is HORRIBLE to say the least. The idea was unique and interesting in a way but couldn't have been executed more poorly than this. As every minute of the movie passed by I grew angrier, annoyed and frustrated with myself for wanting to watch this movie with a lot of expectations, could I be let down in a worse way. Who in the world decides to put their family in danger just for saving a stranger? No matter how kind and humane one would be. Who, among common people, in their right mind choose to take on a bunch of maniac killers just to satisfy their conscience? I wish I could give this zero or negative points if I could. Almost everything about this movie is pointless and lame. If you take my advice, DO NOT WATCH THIS MOVIE. It's not worth your time and money. Total wastage. You might end up feeling the way I am now."

","This movie reached a rare level by me as it proved unwatchable - the entire concept couldn't even get off the ground after 38 minutes, by which time I shut it down. It was ultimately a 'who cares?' that envelopes, then smothers this dog of a flick. Everything wound up being telegraphed and the concept, under cover of the founders of the New United States merely stokes fires of hatred, pain, revenge, misogyny, sadism and probably a lot of other under-superlatives to describe the worst kind of drek on screen and within the human heart. The concept itself sounds good on paper - one day a year to unleash the beast, keeping it bottled up in the meantime for the sake of societal peace and security. This movie ain't sci-fi, it ain't psy-thriller - it is merely psychotic, wrong-headed and a true waste on so many levels. Just look at the take for this flick - over half its money on the opening weekend and then - freefall. Read into it what one will, but I say folks wised up to the fact that this wasn't entertaining, it wasn't cathartic and, if anyone else's reaction was like mine, one just felt slimed and manipulated. There is surely a place in movies for manipulation and slime (Aliens anyone?) but I still struggle to get the grime off - after only 38 wasted minutes."

","If you're looking for a bloody gore-fest like Saw or Hostel, then maybe this isn't the right movie; but The Purge is definitely worth watching.<br/><br/>Although it's not the most unpredictable movie I've ever seen, it did surprise me once or twice. Mostly, though, The Purge was less terrifying and more unsettling - scary because I didn't find any of it far fetched. It shows the sadistic nature that we all fear the people around us have inside. Other than being set a short bit in the future, I had no problem imagining myself and my family in the situations presented in the plot. I also enjoyed Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke, both of whom did a fine job of portraying parents who are thinking only of their family's safety.<br/><br/>Moreover, at certain points The Purge genuinely left me unsure what the moral course of action would be. How far would I go to protect my family? It may not be a political documentary, but this movie definitely made me think. There are a few moments if you listen, where the economic climate of the time plays a part.<br/><br/>As an aside, I don't recommend taking your dog for a late night walk after watching The Purge.

"xuelingyunguaiguai","3","1","2","17 November 2013"," Disappionting, drowsy, ridiculous movie, kind of waste of my time
","When I saw the trailer I'd rather expected a horror and scary production, with the weird masks on DVD cover. However, it turns out to be a pretty disappointment and just wasted approximately two hours of my weekend night. First of all, I have to say the concept of this film is fairly good, it sets the background to release the devils inside everybody. When killing, murdering, torturing become legal and you can revenge just as you wish, the situation could be a really really disaster and even massacre occurs. And audience can see from the setting background, a lot of stories can happen on that particular 12 hours.<br/><br/>Despite the intrigue idea of the script, the director obviously ignore that the audience has logical sense! Here are the groofs in this movie: James Sandins (starring Ethan Hawke) is a huge character hole. How could anyone buy a security system from a guy that his own security system could be opened with a single password? How could a ""professional"" guy give the password of his house's security system to his stupid naive silly son? How could a security system that simply covers the doors/windows with steel be sold nationwide? How could any family that has any sense will leave the monitoring room unwatched during a purge night and finally let the sheer idiot son Charles make his own decision to take in a bloody strange man who was apparently under hunted? What kind of so-called security system has no defense procedures at all? In an ""American"" like this, where annual cleanse of the poor and lower level is supported, what sort of house will have no basement or escape tunnel or plan B at all, and worst of all, this one of the ""haves"" family raised a foolish son who lacks of all common senses as well as a delicate daughter who loves a guy wants to talk to her father in a gun?<br/><br/>The daughter triggers every disaster in her house, and she just disappeared immediately after the mess occurred, then jumped out mysteriously, out of nowhere to go back to her mom or dadoh, when I saw this ridiculous lovely daughter, I just want to slash in her face. Then the son Charles' turn: this even more ridiculous boy has the guts to let a complete stranger in his house without talking to his parents and after everything happened, he never apologized or regret what he has brought to his family, he has this creepy toy rolls around his house and that's it oh my god, I just cannot believe how I expected this little scary toy to carry out a certain mission when I first saw its appearance. The third comes to the mom, Lena Headey is beautiful but useless in any single plot. She creams and run out of the monitor room to look for her stupid daughter or son many times and even when she held her husband's body, she calls out her children who might probably hide well to let them circle around her dead husband and let another bunch of people to kill them all. When I watched to this length, I just wondering did the director ever thought that we audience have a brain that can think logically and emotionally? <br/><br/>Last comes to the also useless husband, though Ethan Hawke has some fight scenes against the hunting young crewed, but that's not scary or horrifying at all, they are just silly childish actions, has no atmosphere which it supposed to embrace. Then there comes the other group of people, actually their neighborhoods, who is envy of the husband's making money for selling security system to them and come with barely unarmed except some knifes. When they tried to kill the family members, the most ridiculous scene happened, Lena screams while her neighbors tied them up, she kept shouting and shouting and shouting, thus these supposed-to-seriously-hated-them neighbors just let the time slip away and eventually killed or stopped by the poor black man they tried to take-in this could be one of the most terrible plots I've seen this year.<br/><br/>All characters and plots are easily destroyable, just the same as their so-called security system. My husband watched it with me and he questioned like ""if we're permitted in a country or society like this, how would you react in a purge night?"" I answered ""I will find someplace hide and would not step out during the 12 hours"". ""That's it! What kind of people would simply stay at their cozy home and close the doors shutdown their windows or activate a stupid security system to let other know: hey, here's a wealthy family waiting for you to unleash your rages!"" he added afterwards, ""if I have the chance to design a security system to be used in a world like this, I would definitely allow no one to shut an activated system within the next 12 hours, even with password or fingerprints or whatever else"". <br/><br/>I just felt that my IQ is badly hurt by the director or whoever writes the script. It's an unsuccessful movie with plots loopholes spreading from beginning to end."

","The Purge was a very good film IMO. Not exactly what you'd expect but engrossing to say the least. One thing about the whole idea of letting society at large have one night to just ""do what thou wilt"" that bugs me is this : Do you think you can just shut it off after that? Human nature IMO does not operate that way. A ""Purge Night"" would be somewhat like Pandora's Box and we would never be able to shut the lid again. Ethan Hawke has grown so much since he was that shy boy in ""Dead Poet's Society"" (remember that?). Lena Headey manages to make you forget her role in ""Game Of Thrones"" as well. Talented cast. Great story idea. Very scary. Very creepy feeling during the whole thing ( this feeling that someone you know might want to kill you and has one night to do it with impunity). I would recommend this!"

Who ALLOWED this level of poorly thought out idea to be on the screen, and who was on casting to allow the people to play the kids. <br/><br/>Why is the daughter off and on screen at ""just the opportune"" moments? Why was Henry's gun completely off, no bullets on walls/door or on Ethan Hawke, but when the daughter picks up the gun there's suddenly bullets?<br/><br/>If this is how society is, why are these hipster college kids taking the night the way they are, poorly calculated, nonchalant? <br/><br/>And if this is how society is, why are children's behavior so alienated from what society has already become. <br/><br/>Too many scenes where characters just ""pop up"" whenever they want, just at the most opportune moments. <br/><br/>I have NEVER written a movie review, but this was just so... annoying.

For example, I loved Pain and Gain (2013) and it really is funny but I talked about it so much at work that my friend didn't enjoy it as much.<br/><br/>So I'll try to be concise about why this film is good without going overboard with my review:<br/><br/><ul><li>It's a home invasion film. Nothing more, nothing less</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>As with all heavily 'genre-d' films such as rom-coms, there has to be a unique premise for the film and with home invasions, the reason the home is being invaded is the unique factor</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There is genuine tension in the film</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>I liked the family but there could have been more character development in the beginning... but do we really care?

Ethan Hawke is an unlikable home security salesmen, James Sandin, and it is he and his family that we spend the annual purge with.<br/><br/>This is an excellent premise gone to complete waste.

"Jerghal","7","1","2","8 October 2013"," Social Consequences
","The social consequences of permitting murder and unrestrained violence one night a year would be very far reaching. Although we get some info on that via background newscasts, the film focuses on what this very night brings for a certain family. Produced by Jason Blum, who very successfully launched a series of scary movies (Indisious, Sinister, Paranormal Activity,...) who all made a ton of money, but were made for a budget no higher than 5 m$. I liked the movie, it was well made, but it could have explored other interesting aspects of this premise. The Purge 2 is already announced, but they will probably make a similar movie with other characters instead of trying to expand this interesting fictional world."
"HanPolo","4","1","2","7 October 2013"," A Preachy ""Panic Room""
","I came into this movie knowing two things: the plot was original/intriguing and Ethan Hawke did a good job with Gattaca (another low budget sci-fi) in 1997. Unfortunately, James DeMonaco is no Andrew Niccol, and The Purge was a tremendous waste of potential.<br/><br/>The setting is the not-too-distant future, in an affluent, Stepford- style neighborhood. Following what we assume to be a second American revolution, there is an annual ""Purge"" that allows people to commit all manner of crimes as long as it is not against the highest ranking government officials and as long as it is using weapons below a certain grade (i.e. you can't nuke the White House and get away with it). The effects have been dramatically lower crime and unemployment rates since the dredges of society are being removed from an increasingly efficient system. <br/><br/>From the beginning, it is the character development that limited this movie's delivery. The protagonist, Ethan Hawke's character, sells security systems for a living, has a quiet wife, a loner son, and a hormonal teenage daughter. These pieces scream typecasting, so you can't really blame the formulaic acting since the actors did exactly what the script told them to do. From the beginning, you know that the wife will have to challenge her husband on a moral issue (in order to exert her female independence), the son will have some profound affect on everyone (because all sociopaths are secretly geniuses), and the girl will be responsible for something going wrong (because she's an irresponsible teenager).<br/><br/>Besides the predictable character development, we're also stuck hearing all these mannequins preach to us about social equality as if we, the viewers, really believed genocide was a good idea. The second you see an African-American male appear you suspect immediately he'll end up saving the world, because.. well, you know.. he's supposed to do that in this kind of movie. Even so, you can't be sure because there are a couple of plot twists that keep you wondering more than just how long the movie is.<br/><br/>The movie isn't only frustrating because of its failed potential, but also because the plot development relies on the stupidity of its characters. The father is pretty careless about his security system on the only night of the year when murder is legal, the son makes several dumb mistakes that make you want to climb into the screen and hit him, and the daughter, of course, lives up to her potential as a trouble- making teenage trollop. All in all, it's a worst case series of events that occur on the most dangerous night of the year in a part of town that is never subjected to Purge-related activity.<br/><br/>It gets 4 stars for the originality of the plot, the use of a moderately talented and relative unknown actor for the lead bad guy, and killing off a main character."
"Robert_duder","7","1","2","6 October 2013"," Disturbing and best of all unique, The Purge was worth the wait
","From the moment I saw the trailer for this I was riveting and intrigued. For one reason or another I wasn't able to see it in theatres so I was stoked to finally get to watch it on DVD. You could say my expectations were reasonably high and I had heard mostly good things. A lot of IMDb reviewers were really harping on the film and I do understand where some of there concerns come from but ultimately this film delivers exactly what you would expect from it so I'm not sure how anyone could dislike it so much. You absolutely have to let go of some semblance of reality and accept a few (mostly minor) plot holes but I was willing to do that for a number of reasons. First of all this was one of the first unique horror films I have seen in years. It is disturbing, twisted and has a sincere undertone of a bizarre moral message in there somewhere. The frantic, gritty and dark style the film is shot in works quite well and sets a tone that really gets under your skin and is genuinely creepy. It borders almost like a found footage style of movie in some ways but without using that completely tired way of shooting horror films. The acting isn't perfect, in fact in some ways I was wondering if star Ethan Hawke was purposely being campy but then I wonder if perhaps the way he acts is part of his character.<br/><br/>Let me explain that statement. Hawke plays a devoted father who sells security systems to guard homes against the annual purge. He has made a fortune at doing it. He seems cocky and very very wooden throughout the film. I thought he almost came across as sociopathic in the way that his emotions felt fake. But I think maybe that was sort of the point to the character. He is someone who has chosen to continue to quell his emotions and not take part in the purge. He is ruthless in some aspects and yet seems to want nothing more than to protect his family. Maybe I'm over-analyzing his character but he was unlikeable in some aspects but I have to wonder if that was the point. It wasn't his best performance but it worked for the film. Lena Headey is his wife. I came to know Headey best as Sarah Connor in the Terminator TV Series and it was different seeing her in a very vulnerable role. She spends an awful lot of time crying and screaming and never really gets a lot of depth to her character. She does alright in the role but the chemistry is lacking slightly between her and Hawke and the rest of the family. Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder are their two children. They also do okay without being particularly outstanding. Both of them have their moments and unfortunately for Burkholder, his character makes such an enormously stupid movie in the first part of the film (which basically drives the entire movie) that you can't help but hate him for it. Edwin Hodge is the homeless man they find themselves inadvertently protecting. He does a good job and shows a lot of emotion but doesn't get a lot of character development for sure. Rhys Wakefield might be the juiciest role in the whole movie as the twisted and demented leader of the group outside their home. He is cold blooded, maniacal and insane and it works. He borders being a little bit campy but he is scary enough that it works.<br/><br/>So the biggest problem that The Purge has is a sub-standard cast or at the very least, poorly developed characters. I can vouch that Hawke, Headey and Burkholder can act so it has to be their characters. The family dynamic is lacking and it should be such an important aspect of this film. Nonetheless the disturbing nature of the film is enough to truly get under your skin and freak you out. Part thriller and part horror it is certain to at least make you jump once and give you chills when you're watching a particularly disturbing scene and there are a few of those. It is brutally violent without being gory in the lease which is bizarre but also clever on their part. Director and writer James DeMonaco breaks my cardinal rule of directing his own writing work. While he did a decent job at this, I think a director with more experience could have crafted this into something spectacular. Don't get me wrong DeMonaco has created something significant here but it could have been perfected. There is a lot of story left untapped, who are the new founding fathers, how did the purge come about and why are people so completely accepting of it? No matter what you think of the film as a whole and there are some issues with it as I've laid out but you can't deny the creep factor and the unique idea behind this. Its simply unfortunate that it was polished and perfected. Mr. DeMonaco needs to find a new director to helm the sequel and we can get this train onto the right track!! 7/10"

","If there's one thing I've learned about American reviews of movies, books, and plays it's this: you can't trust any commentary about anything that in any way addresses the issue of social class. It's no coincidence that a society as brainwashed as ours produces and watches so many zombie movies. We can identify with the metaphor in these films and, at least on a subconscious level, understand that what has happened in them is what has already happened to us. Nevertheless, like zombies, we cannot help what we do; most of our brains have been eaten by what we've been indoctrinated to believe and we must eat the brains of others in return, especially if they are still filled with any questions or critical views concerning social class and poverty. In the case of movie reviews, the vast majority of Americans will not simply bash a film for making a statement about social class, but be so conniving and ignorant of their own mindlessness as to suggest that this statement was the film's only admirable quality. Many reviews of the ""The Purge"" serve as perfect examples of such connivance and ignorance. While perhaps no masterpiece, the film is easily far better than most American horror movies, including many which have been given rave reviews. The narrative, for example, is both focused and meaningful. The film examines a family, the father of which has become wealthy and provided abundantly for his wife and children, i.e., has achieved the American dream, by the exploiting the fears of Americans during a time when all crime is permitted for one night each year. But this dream turns into a nightmare during a particular purge in which the son allows a homeless man to take shelter in their home, which is excessively guarded by the same type of security system that the father has profited from. This act of morality incurs the wrath of the family's upper class neighbors, who not only hunt down those who cannot afford to protect themselves, i.e., the poor, but have grown jealous of the father's financial success. That which the father created for prosperity and protection suddenly becomes an entrapment and the greatest threat to their well being. These events and characters are not only meaningfully tied together but present a metaphor of society that is just as familiar to Americans as the zombie genre. Unfortunately, however, the familiarity with the society presented in ""The Purge"" is of a kind that severely aggravates those who both choose and try to convince others to choose to ignore anything that might help to explain why it is that they have turned into zombies."

","Basically, you'll find yourself interested in the first part of the film, its a good idea!<br/><br/>Issue is, for the film to be all dramatic it falls into a heavily clichéd story with characters making completely stupid and unrealistic decisions. As someone who feels I am quite good with situational (especially survival) logic and decisions I feel even someone with the slightest clue wouldn't make such dumb decisions.<br/><br/>E.g. The girl runs away from her family when the obvious option would be to stay as they are able to protect her more than if she was to hide under her bed *sigh*<br/><br/>TLDR: Good idea but stupid and enraging unrealism ruins it..."

","When I first saw this trailer, I was intrigued about this idea. However, after seeing how they executed it, it leaves a lot to be desired. The main issue with this movie was how both children were so poorly developed. The fact that the son just randomly let in a stranger without any plan afterward made no sense. Plus the kids would randomly just storm off after giving their father a hard time regarding what he was planning to do. This is definitely one of those movies where you scream at the screen. They could have developed the motives for the children's strong opinions, rather than them just staring at their father in disgust."
"GTeixeira","3","1","2","27 September 2013"," Originality is nice, but it doesn't always mean quality
","In the future, the USA has become almost utopia-like: crime and violence are almost nonexistent, unemployment is at 1%, economy is blooming... The motive? The purge, a 12-hour period once per year where every crime is legalized and people are allowed to (and supposed to) release their pent-up frustrations and anger by killing ('purging').<br/><br/>Now, as original a concept as that is, there was one thing that crossed my mind as soon as it was explained: WTF IS THE SENSE IN THAT?!<br/><br/>To let a 'law' like that pass means to throw away every ethic and moral society has ever upheld. Moreover, the results make no sense: how do you get people to follow the 12-hour rule? Why would criminals wait for AN ENTIRE YEAR for a measly 12-hour legality (ie.: what difference is there from what they always did anyway)? How is making people kill each other supposed to make the economy bloom (besides gun and security industries, of course), unemployment decrease or anything else? Society's values have downgraded enough that they willingly commit monstrosities during the Purge, but are apparently perfect for AN ENTIRE YEAR in-between?<br/><br/>There is no way this can be viewed as a 'possible reality', or even realistic at all. As anything other than a fantasy this fails, but even as a fantasy it still has many problems.<br/><br/>The film focuses on a security system salesman (Ethan Hawke) and his family during the night. His (stupid) son lets an injured man inside their fortified house, making them the target of a murderous cult.<br/><br/>Right away we are introduced more idiocy. <br/><br/>-A very idiotic, short-lived and pretty much useless subplot about the daughter's boyfriend; it has no other reason than to have a few 'teen- love' scenes. <br/><br/>-The cultists are just your stereotypical movie psychopaths, like the ones from 'The Strangers'. The leader is an always smiling, smooth talking proper boy; combined with the almost religious tone of the group, he ends up as nothing but a typical religious fanatic leader.<br/><br/>-The son (Max Burkholder). My God, how frustrating it was to see him. He is shown as highly intelligent, but he is responsible for everything wrong happening to the family. Why did he let the man inside and, knowing their lives (not just his, but his parent's and his sister's) depended on finding him, why did he hide him away?! Is he a savant, or did he have amnesia and not remember every other year's Purge?<br/><br/>-Seeing as how willing the people are to accept the Purge (and, as such, throwing their moral values away), the characters actions are often contradictorily moralistic. If Hawke was so in-favor of Purge law before, why was he so unwilling to Purge himself? At best he is a hypocrite, which does not help making him likable.<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey are well cast, as far as looks goes (they play everyday normal people, and look like so); acting wise, Headey does a good job (being the closest to evoking real emotion) whereas Hawke ends up becoming just your usual action hero. Rhys Wakefield (the cultist leader) is clichè but unnerving, Edwin Hodger (the injured guy) is okay, and the children (Adelaine Kane and Max Burkholder) are far too annoying (though the fault goes more to their characters than their weak acting).<br/><br/>The entire social commentary the movie seems to aim towards is absurd, the entire concept is original but ludicrous and illogical, the execution is weak and the final 'plot twist' is predictable (though not unbelievable). Whoever came up with that idea, or whoever sees this as anything other than fantasy, is seriously reality-challenged. Either that, or secretly a sociopath; after all, for such an idea to work it would require the entire society to be composed of sociopaths."

I wanted to know who was the new founding fathers, that was always on my mind since they kept bringing it up, was there a conspiracy?, who was in charge?, what is the world like outside of that neighbourhood?, so many unanswered questions just made it frustrating towards the end and it didn't help that the ending wasn't exactly satisfying in my eyes. I wanted to see some kind of justice or more aftermath but it just leaves so much open and your left with what seems like a half finished plot that ended on a low note. <br/><br/>After watching it all though sometimes you wonder will the world ever become that stupid like The Running Man (1987)"

"MuntherHamdon","4","1","2","25 July 2013"," Good idea for a movie, but bad execution
","The concept of the movie was very interesting and the possibilities and story lines that could have been developed were infinite. Unfortunately, the movie introduced and defined characters within a family neighborhood, and never ventured outside of a single house with 2 parents, a child son and a teenage daughter. <br/><br/>After the emergency broadcast system alarm is triggered on TV, the daughters boyfriend reveals he snuck into the home just prior, and tries to murder the father because of his disapproval of the relationship. We also see the young son disarm the home to let a homeless man in after feeling sorry for him crying and pleading. <br/><br/>The plot thickens and everything seems to be taking off, when the disastrous part of the film takes center stage. The real ""villians,"" a group of rich young people show up at the doorstep demanding the release of the homeless man, because they feel it is their duty and right as Americans to kill this homeless man and rid themselves of their carnal killing desires for the year. <br/><br/>The villain is played by Rhys Wakefield, and his acting destroys any good the movie had built up to this point. The story completely drags itself over the next hour through a very boring story of threats to kill the family if the homeless man is not turned over. After enough time has passed, a truck tears down doors, and some killing takes place. <br/><br/>The end is only slightly better with the neighbors deciding to save the day...but only to then confess their desire to kill the family over flaunting a newly built section of their home...ironically paid for by neighbors who WILLINGLY bought a security system from the husband and who have never expressed complaints with its functionality. The new section of the home does not stand out or cause any trouble. In essence, they want to kill their neighbors because they are jealous of their wealth?<br/><br/>The homeless man rescues the day, and the movie ends. These alternate reality Americans are a cold people, with vaguely a hint of soul lurking in their bodies. It is a poor movie on a seemingly low budget, taking advantage of a very interesting idea. <br/><br/>This version of the Purge should itself be Purged."
"yukichigai","6","1","2","6 July 2013"," A ""concept"" film that doesn't bother to explore the concept
","When the trailers for this film came out I was somewhat intrigued. A New American Revolution, you say? One night a year where all crime is legal, you say? Well that sounds fascinating. Tell me more.<br/><br/>The setup, if you aren't aware of it somehow, is that it is America in the year 2022. Sometime in the film's past (it's not specific) the country went through a ""quadruple-dip"" recession along with a stock market crash that led to huge national debt and a highly devalued dollar. That in turn led some newly elected officials - the New Founding Fathers, as the film calls them - to institute The Purge: a single night where all crime is legal except use of ""above Class 4 weapons"" and crimes against ""Level 10 government employees"". The plan immediately turned things around, lowering unemployment to 1%, reducing the crime rate to non-existent levels, and ""saved the country"" as so many people in the film put it.<br/><br/>Again I thought to myself, ""I'm intrigued. What caused that recession? What's a Class 4 weapon or a Level 10 official? Who are these New Founding Fathers, and what position do they hold? Is the country still even a Republic or America now under some other form of government?"" The premise is good at provoking thoughtful questions. Does the film bother answering any of them? No. As a matter of fact, that three-sentence summary above is just as much background as the film gives you on The Purge. You're just supposed to fill in the blanks yourself, probably by assuming that the New Founding Fathers are members of that underhanded political party you really hate. You know the one.<br/><br/>Protip: the movie is way better if you imagine that David Icke was right and the New Founding Fathers are actually reptiliod shapeshifters who have decided to turn America into their own barbaric version of the Roman Coliseum.<br/><br/>So with that huge potential goldmine of social commentary dangled out there appetizingly and promptly ignored, the film moves straight into giving us a decent setup for actioney whatnot. You've got your standard upper-middle-class family in their upper-middle-class home, white picket fence, 2.6 kids, etc. etc. The father is imperfect but cares about his family, the mother is generic and unremarkable (a waste of Lena Headey's talent), the younger son is borderline hypochondriac (another element left unexplored) and the older daughter is like every movie teenage daughter: more concerned with her boyfriend than anything else. The yearly Purge is a tense time for this tightly knit family, safe in their well-armored home but of varying opinions on the merits of The Purge. Do they sit down and have a frank discussion of their opinions on this literally revolutionary event? F%$# no! Film's only 85 minutes long, people! Can't have all this talking, we need to make time for gunfire, knives, and fake blood all over the place.<br/><br/>So with the issues of family relationships also dangled and ignored, the film finally gets to the shooty heart-poundey omgitsrightbehindyou stuff. The family's uneventful locked-in Purge night is, of course, not meant to be any of those things, and in a sequence of events - one expected, one really not - things start getting out of hand. Before you know it there's a polite but clearly unhinged gentleman and his pack of murderous friends trying to break in. Things get VERY claustrophobic at this point, and it's here that the film excels. The big, big McMansion the film is set in suddenly seems very cramped indeed.<br/><br/>The problem is, that's really the peak of the movie. From that point on it just turns into a long string of ""well that was OKAY, I guess"". There's some resolution, but not a lot. There's retribution, but not a lot. A fair amount of hope and heroism and redemption, but, again, not a lot. The film sets the stage for some very visceral moments, but more often than not doesn't give you the satisfaction you crave. Not that it's without satisfaction at all, but what you get is not what the movie leads you to believe you will be getting.<br/><br/>With all that said, I still enjoyed the film. For a film that had the potential for such heavy-handed social commentary it was in fact quite the opposite... perhaps too much. Regardless, it still had a fair amount of action and thrills, and even a few surprises. I did not regret spending my time watching it, and came out generally pleased.<br/><br/>In doing some research on the film I've learned that a sequel is in the works. I'm actually quite pleased to hear that, and will definitely be watching it when it finally comes out. Let's just hope the second spends a little more time exploring the concept than the first did. Like, at all."
"Matt_Layden","5","1","2","6 July 2013"," The Purge should have and could have been so much better.
","The year is 2022, crime is at an all-time low of 1%. This is due to an act known as The Purge. For a 12 hour period, all crime including murder is legal. The Sanders family is about it feel the ramifications of this act.<br/><br/>This concept, although absurd, is something that could have been an intense thrilling horror show. The concept is a great one for entertainment. Yet The Purge fails to capitalize on this concept and instead it confines itself to a one location low budget thrill show in the style of 2008's The Strangers. There are many areas this film could have excelled at, but unfortunately misses the mark on most of them.<br/><br/>I imagine if James DeMonaco, the writer and director, who has worked with Hawke multiple times before, had expanded his story to take place outside one house, the results might have been much better. Think of the creativity of the kills, the thrills of the chase, the dangers of not knowing who else is out there. Instead we are stuck inside a house with some stupid characters who do stupid things only to advance the plot. you'll find yourself yelling at some of the characters, specifically the son, who is responsible for this whole mess the family find themselves in. The young lad lets in a wounded man who is being hunted by a group of teens of are taking part in the Purge. They know the guy is in the house, so they will do anything to get in. <br/><br/>Of course to make the film more entertaining, they eventually do. Then it becomes a cat and mouse game between the family stuck inside and the would be killers with masks. The leader of this gang is a rich kid who is mild mannered and is willing to kill his best friend if he becomes annoying. While the character is somewhat interesting, this film desperately needed a more prominent villain. Key elements like this could only make the film better. I feel like there was a good film in here somewhere but certain choices hinder it from becoming something that people will talk about years from now. One decision I think it failed at was the ending. <br/><br/>The Purge had the chance to end on a real downer, something depressing and shocking that will get people talking. Instead it ends on a predictable note, which leaves you completely dissatisfied. The Purge should have ended with a bang, not a whimper."

Rich people however are able to lock themselves up in their high security mansions and wait for the killing raping sprees to end. The main characters The Sandins are one of the least believable families you'll ever see. Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey did a great job with what they have, but the daughter and son are just painfully bad to watch. It really shows how weak the writer and director are in the movie when characters need to purposely leave the group and wonder off just so they can reappear later in the movie, it's just like ""i don't know what to do with this character so i might as well not include him/her in the scene."" Not to mention how ridiculous the movie started, It is already established that The Purge happens every year, and this kid (the most annoying character you'll ever see) disables the family's security to let a complete bloody stranger (which was being hunted by a gang of psychopaths) in their house, and the reason is ""why does he deserve it?"" I just rolled my eyes when i heard that. I know there won't be a movie if he didn't do that, but there could always be another reason for this to happen. Crazy killers could just randomly pick your house to attack, or even more logical, the Father could have made enemies in his company since he was performing so good at work, that would totally make sense. To further insult the audience, the kid aids the stranger in hiding from his family, and eventually puts his sister in danger. when asked to hide in the basement, he turns on his flash light in the dark constantly moves around, when he is found(thanks, big surprised) i was hoping he gets killed right there. The villains were under developed, i felt they were going for a Manson family type of feeling, but it just falls flat, you didn't give a sht who these guys, when Evan Hawk finally kills a couple of them and reveals to be just some teen aged, yeah big surprise again, these guys try to kill my family, so what if their teenagers. The ending was ridiculous to say the least, and was incredibly awkward. what happen was it turns out the neighbors show up and killed all the teen killers, and the reason being is they wanted to kill the Sandins themselves. OK..i like this twist but what was embarrassingly bad was when 6 adults were being overpowered by one hobo guy with a gun, WTF The movie ending with all of them sitting at the table waiting for the purge to end. god what a piece of sht this movie was."

","In 2022, the United States is a nation ruled by the New Founding Fathers of America. To maintain low crime and unemployment rates throughout the year, the government has instituted an annual 12-hour period called ""The Purge"" during which all crimes, including murder, become legal. Movie gives a look at one of those horrific nights exposing the whole brutality of negative freedom, when one can do anything they want and they want really really bad things.<br/><br/>James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) is a security company salesman, who turned into wealthy man by selling security system - designed specially for The Purge nights. He got a wife Mary (Lena Headey), a daughter and a son. During early hours of purge a black man chased by number of outlaws, penetrates their house asking for help. Sandins decide to protect him despite the threats by chasers. And they start to hunt for the family.<br/><br/>As a horror The Purge does not give much to scary. You can easily watch it with your lights off. Sometimes creepy sounds was making me jump a little. However, the story itself is a bit thrilling and it got lots of things it actually made me think about. Movie clearly delivers total cruelty of human actions, what each of us is capable of without some control. People who are neighbors, friends, companions during 364 days a year, become enemies for 1 day and they are ready to kill anyone to let their negative emotions go. But it's not how one or two people behave, most of them do the same things - they kill, rob, rape others. I do think that there are some people around us, who are capable of doing same things if it was permitted. But I don't think that it's gonna be that massive, that people will just come out and start attacking others for no reason.<br/><br/>Besides the story, that really shocked me, I loved Lena Headey - who'll always be a brilliant Cersei. She brings a touching act that totally delivers the tragedy of that particular mother trying to protect her children. Mary's emotions are real, so natural and thrilling that it made experience whole psychological terror on me. Hawke does a great job as a father who has to either protect it's family or save a persons life. His character challenges moral dilemma - whether one persons life is worth for threatening your own family safety?!<br/><br/>The Purge also has some let downs, for instance totally illogical death of Zoey's (James's daughter) boyfriend, who's accidentally killed by Mr. Sandin. Soundtracks, which mostly is a bingo thing for this genre movies, is very poor and does not make film any better. And last one, everything in there escalates very quickly and this weakens emotional impact on viewers. James DeMonaco as a director could make a little more engaging and tragic plot to make this sick story even more sicker.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie is good to watch once and you won't waste time. It's definitely above average."

I think most people expected a slaughter fest and one shock scene after another, and the trailer might have actually given that impression, however, it was more of a psychological thriller, which I didn't mind at all. And how exactly was it racists? Because a black man was being hunted by a bunch of white folks? <br/><br/>DON'T READ THE NEXT SENTENCE IF YOU HAVEN'T SEEN THE MOVIE YET: If you haven't noticed, the black man was actually the hero at the end. YOU MAY NOW CONTINUE!<br/><br/>I think what the writers tried to show is that (sadly) a lot of anger and hatred goes towards other races, so it is what it is. But who knows, writers have a purge every day, because they could actually let their frustrations out by creating characters they don't like and kill them off or otherwise. Nobody really knows why they have the focus on a black victim in this movie. Any thoughts on that?<br/><br/>The idea of the movie was new and interesting. I think the 86 minutes went by very fast and I enjoyed the movie. I was definitely hoping for more background information about who created the purge and how other countries feel about it. Furthermore there haven't been any character developments or even an introduction, and I therefore didn't connect with the protagonists. The ending wasn't bad, but came very abrupt and I hope they will come out with a second part that hopefully has a bigger budget, so they can deliver a better story with more twists. The Purge was a huge commercial success and is definitely worth a one- time watch if you liked Panic Room (2002) or The Strangers (2008). But I don't think it is necessary to see it in the movie theater, better rent or buy it.<br/><br/>Rating: 6.5/10"
"Shahrukh17","7","1","2","24 June 2013"," 2022 not so far but people struggling right now!!!
","The year 2022 is shown in this movie where people are allowed to purge at an event that is organized annually by the US. The purge leads to no medical or other services for 12 hours. The cast was good specially Ethan Hawke. I know we live in sorrows but purge is not a good way to release the pressure. So, the movie as an imagination is acceptable but not in any other manner. Few action scenes were nice. The movie just revolved around a single house thats a bit disappointing otherwise it was very watchable. Moreover a bunch of stupid kids wearing weird marks also annoyed me a bit. I am expecting a sequel to this where they could involve the armed forces or even ZOMBIES. Recommended - Ratings 3/5"
"jdlick44","4","1","2","24 June 2013"," A huge missed opportunity here
","Set in the near future, The New Founding Fathers have change America. The time is 2022 and unemployment is at 1% (wouldn't that be nice) and crime is at an all time low, the country is happy....or at least that's what they want you to think. Enter The Purge, one night (12 hours to be exact) to commit any and or all crimes to cleanse your soul, even murder is legal. No cops, no government (again, Nice) no one to come to your rescue. Great concept for a movie and had the potential to take over the reigns as the new face of terror, unfortunately Germy's and Jewette's this one fell flat on its face as Hollywood beat another dead horse! Starting with the script and the dialogue being worse than the Holocaust, there was no suspense and was very predictable, hell even Ethan Hawke looked weird without his goatee! The movie is centered around his well to do family, he's a home security salesman and apparently Lena Headey aka Cersei Lannister is a stay at home mother to their two children. They snuggle in their very barricaded home to watch purge videos only to be set off by the son having a moment of despair and letting a homeless man being chased by ""classy"" purgers. The fun starts from there as they play cat and mouse through the house and one thing leads to another, just like any other home invasion movie ala Panic Room. The only thing saving this one was a frightening performance from Rhys Wakefield whom put the F in fear for us. But the question remains, friends, what would you do with one night of freedom? Would you hide or would you purge? We can think of a few 4 letter words but then again that's why they call us purgeverts! The Germ and the Jew give this one a HAIL no and a circumcision! We strongly urge you to not see The Purge, at least not for $9.<br/><br/>Check out our reviews on Facebook @ The Germ and The Jew Movie Review"

","The one thing I expect from a movie is to be entertained for about 90 minutes. Now without criticizing little details and convincing myself that the movie is lying about reality or looking for flaws in the story or idea of the story I ended up liking this one. Sort of like saying Superman doesn't exist so this movie stinks. I don't think the writer or director is trying to pull a fast one in The Purge. This movie is meant to be fiction and that's how it comes off as well as keeping your interest. Job well done for the money that was spent on this film. As per the ending I've seen worse. What would your ending be? I thought it was appropriate giving you something to think about hours after the movie ends."
"anghela19","4","1","2","23 June 2013"," Good Idea but TERRIBLE film overall...
","OK first, let's summarise the film in a couple of sentences: The film starts showing a very rich family (James, Lena, Max and Adeleine) having a good time, having dinner, talking, etc... Then the Purge begins and a couple of minutes later a homeless guy appears and cries out for help, saying that he won't hurt anyone, and of course Max lets him in. Next some random creepy masked guys appear asking for the guy otherwise they'll kill all of them. James then refuses, so the weirdos break in, and one of them manages to kill James. Then just when all of the family are about to get killed, their neighbours come in and help, but it turns out that they wanted to kill the family as well, but the homeless guy helps them and then the film just ends with a guy talking on the radio about different crimes that happened during the purge. The film has a interesting and exciting idea, but overall there isn't enough suspense, not enough action, etc... So I'll give The Purge a 4/10. Not a good film and not recommended."
"creepycarray","3","1","2","23 June 2013"," Hmm
","I was SO excited for this movie, the concept was and still is a great idea. I did like it but I just hope they adapt this idea into much more.<br/><br/>I wish more was viewed in the film as it was short and much more could have been added, like other peoples ways of dealing with the Purge instead of one families. And also very unrealistic when dealing with the man who the son let into the house. I wouldn't risk my families life to save a stranger who could have easily killed any of the family and I wouldn't allow a family to risk their lives for me. <br/><br/>I probably would have liked the movie much more if the unrealistic twist with the neighbours happened. Sure, we all hate our neighbours from time to time but really hating them to the extent of risking your lives just so YOU can kill them? I don't think so.<br/><br/>The ending was the part that really ruined it for me. It was such an anti-climax, it felt a bit rushed at the end to finish which was weird considering the movie was quite short, so it could not have been that.<br/><br/>I would recommend this film, but just don't hold high hopes for it. The ideas surrounding the Purge are great but they just weren't shown enough. It hid behind the families struggles with the Purge, more could have been done."
"sandiglendinning","4","1","2","22 June 2013"," A dystopian future, where all movies are disappointing
","The Purge is a home invasion movie, set in an American future-possible dystopia where citizens are given the constitutional right to spend one night of the year running about murdering who they like (supposedly as an outlet for their repressed animal urges). Sounds promising so what will you find here?<br/><br/>Ethan Hawke is a security system salesman and has done rather well for himself out of the Purge. He lives in a nice house in a gated community is married to Lena Headey and has a family, they all look a bit like Scientologists except the daughter who seems to always be inexplicably running around in anime schoolgirl cosplay (maybe in the future all schoolgirls have to dress stupidly). Next the Purge starts in earnest and there is a lot of inevitable violence. His Skrillex look-alike son cocks things up and then they get besieged by annoying whiney sixth formers in stupid masks, led by an adolescent John Malchovich wannabe.<br/><br/>I can see what this film is getting at. Like all dystopian tales it takes the paranoia and worries of a society and presents it to the audience in a way that makes the subject matter more palatable for discussion. Dystopias are a mirror for our fears when they are excellent they are both entertaining and mind expanding. 1984 however, The Purge is not. I sense that underneath a largely banal plot is the desire to discuss mistrust of government, gun control and perhaps issues of class, race and social inequality. There are also attempts at psychology pitching the idea that allowing a society one night to vent their supposedly uncontrollable inner beast results in a happy crime-free society for the remainder of the time. <br/><br/>Neither the idea of the internal 'beast within' or anything else is given anything more than lip service. Great dystopian stories use great storytelling and the everyday to make these themes prominent, universally easy to understand and often terrifying. The Purge does not do this successfully because it has a weak plot, there is little explanation of government oppression or authority and the antagonists are simply unintimidating. The teenage Purge-gang leader I'm pretty sure is based on the psychotic youths in Michael Haneke's Funny Games, the problem being that he is not very scary or very psychotic and this is not Funny Games. He just comes across as an over- privileged brat who needs a good slapping. <br/><br/>All in all this is a film that should have been very clever, really wants to be clever but just is not. Neither is it scary. Psychological horror relies upon psychology, and it's pretty impossible to get into a person's brain unless you explain things either in a visual or literal way. This film does neither and it really is just a terrible mess of pointless violence and stupidity. I really wanted to like The Purge because I adore Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey too, but it really fell short of what it should be. Disappointing to say the least.<br/><br/>If you want to see a better home invasion movie try Funny Games, if you want a dystopian movie, there are no end of others to try. I'm not really sure who in particular would enjoy this film, take your chances if you like though."
"view_and_review","6","1","2","19 June 2013"," A sequel is in order to rectify some things
","Imagine one day of every year in which all things are legal, including murder. Imagine being allowed that one day to act upon your frustration, rage, hatred, curiosity? Would you do that? Most people, including myself, probably would not because of their core beliefs; whether it's God, Love, Karma, the Golden Rule or other than that. But, what would it look like if people did act upon those base desires? The Purge explores that. It's a novel concept but the execution wasn't that great. Granted, this movie could have been done a million different ways, but they chose to focus on one family. Unfortunately, it was this family that took a potentially classic movie and made it simply another movie.<br/><br/>Every movie needs, as TNT says, drama. There has to be a conflict and usually a resolution. The drama in this movie was borne from the acts of two children. The children and their roles in this movie were very cliché. How many are the movie children that create issues because they are either rebellious, naive, curious or just plain vulnerable. This movie had the rebellious and the naive. The actions of the rebellious, smart-mouth daughter brought about a certain fracas and likewise the action of a naive, well-meaning son brought about conflict.<br/><br/>After a slow start the movie kicked into gear with the dramatics and the action. Whether or not you can get behind the individual family members in this movie or get behind them as a whole, this movie does cause you to pick sides, so to speak. The Purge does cause you to ask yourself questions pertaining to the entire event and just where you stand or what would you do.<br/><br/>All in all, this was not a great movie but I'd like to see a sequel. Perhaps with the right feedback they could make a better part two."
"printzr","7","1","2","17 June 2013"," Kind of a mix between horror and thriller
","The great thing about this movie is that it was about a family stuck inside a house with ""purgers"" trying to come inside the house. The bad thing about this movie is that it was only about that. The movie felt really really short. At the end, I had the impression ""that was it""? <br/><br/>Well to be fair, the movie was about a family stuck inside a house with ""purgers"" trying to come inside the house. I thought it was going to be different. Throughout the entire movie, I was waiting for a plot twist, a turn, something! Anything for me to believe it wasn't just about a family stuck inside a house with ""purgers"" trying to come inside the house. But there were no surprises, no plot twists. In fact the only surprise was the characters introduced in the first 30 minutes were the actual characters. I was let down because I was waiting for someone to be an undercover spy, or a 10 star general or connected to the mafia, but no.<br/><br/>The other let down is the entire movie, less the first 30 seconds, was literally filmed inside the house. Nothing outside the house was filmed, so I kind of got bored. <br/><br/>I felt like the director was trying to connect Shirley Jackson's ""The Lottery"" to the Purge as kind of a weird ritual that their modern society accepts. However, I believe the director did not pull it off as well, and just made the movie look a little weird. <br/><br/>Well, I thought it was something to watch with a group of friends where you don't really have to pay attention to the movie to get the main idea or entertainment from it."

","I give my 5 Stars purely for the performance of Rhys Wakefield, who plays the leader of the pack. This movie was a disappointment. The concept is such a good idea but yet it was predictable, short lived and over all bored me. Could of been a great movie with such an interesting take on how to deal with crime yet they failed. I found the characters irritating from start to finish, there was nothing in the plot that surprised me; it was all very obvious, I went expecting to watch a violent, gritty story but was highly bored and lost interest. It was as though it was a dumbed down version for a younger audience but in this genre and idea for a plot it targets adults so the film should of been much more violent, had a bigger story and/or people involved and not have been set in one location."

We jumped like once! it's a thriller your supposed to be hopping off your seat every 10 minutes!<br/><br/>First of all it takes ages for the real action to begin, by this time you've already fallen asleep. We spent the whole time watching the film guessing what will happen and we got it all 100% correct.<br/><br/>Secondly the film is set in a very classy neighbourhood, where are the cats? there was not a single cat round that neighbourhood at all. every neighbourhood has a cat, I have a cat. my street is full of them. in fact there was nothing happening at all.<br/><br/>Lastly, what the hell was his daughter doing the whole time during the film! one minute she's there the next she's disappeared. Also! the girl just lost two very important people in her life yet she's completely capable of shooting a man multiple times but the killers aren't capable of doing this at all?!

"rjwenzel","2","1","2","10 June 2013"," Mediocre at best
","If you take this movie for what it was billed as (a quick thriller/slasher story) it falls short simply because every character is just so extremely stupid and cliché that it's distracting - and those are the people that we know. We simply are not given enough information on any of the ""bad"" people to care one way or the other about them. The only thing they all seem to have in common is that they all have almost no self-preservation instinct. I don't usually mind shutting down my brain a bit for this sort of thing, but there are limits. And if I'm supposed to be rooting for somebody or hoping to see the villains get clobbered, then they've got to make me care about them a bit more in order to give it some entertainment value.<br/><br/>Now if we take this movie for what the writers want us to, then it's just plain insulting. Clearly the idea is that ""rich people suck."" You might try to make a case for it being more complicated than that, but I'm not buying it. I'm sure that this is just the latest round of Hollywood's ""villain du jour"" but I can't help but wonder why they can't just make a simple thriller/slasher flick where the characters are not totally moronic, the villains have at least some small amount of depth, and I don't have to spend extra time trying to ignore the blatant politicizing."

","The idea for this movie is really intriguing and it kept the family talking about it all the way home (30 minute drive). Unfortunately the director decided to make it an action film rather then follow the psychological and political implications of the original idea and then compounded the error by doing most of it in a dark house so it was really hard to see what was going on.<br/><br/>The character development was just plain poor. I am not posting for spoilers but they use 1 or 2 sentences in the beginning to elude to how characters will behave at the end and you just don't buy it. And beyond that, some of the main characters don't seem like real people; more like archetypes. <br/><br/>There is also the subtext of how this situation benefits one socioeconomic class at the expense of another - I'll leave it to you to figure out which is which. I felt like I was being forced to watch another preachy Ronald Emmerich movie i.e. 2012/Day after Tomorrow.<br/><br/>Even with the low number I recommend you watch it as a date movie before dinner...That way you don't have to pay full price because it isn't worth it, and it will give you a lot to talk about over dinner."

For in a revamped America, to cut down on crime or the frustration that causes it to happen in the first place, people are allowed to break any law without recourse. Simply put, for twelve straight hours the ""Land of the Free"" becomes a no-holds-barred riot and the upper class needs high priced protection.<br/><br/>Enter family man Ethan Hawke as James Sandin who, with the best house in the neighborhood thanks to a lucrative job in home security, has made a killing off his neighbors: When the annual Purge happens you need to keep the bad guys out. And for the record, STRAW DOGS wasn't only remade once: During the final act of the 1971 Sam Peckinpah film, a husband and wife harbor a desperate man that a gang of unruly antagonists want in exchange of their lives. The heavies cause havoc in the exterior, and eventually interior, of their seemingly impenetrable home. Same plot here: after Sandin's kindhearted son allows a hunted man access inside, a gang of mask-wearing loons prance around the front lawn with one lethal goal in their twisted minds. <br/><br/>Despite the preposterously far-fetched plot, the contained atmosphere builds suspense within the perspective of each family member as the invading foes encroach. The video camera device from the low budget PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise is used sporadically... the camera being part of the son's remote control vehicle adding a horror flick atmosphere to the bloody action. And while Ethan Hawke has a good character arc, turning from mild mannered rich guy into John J.

","If you had one day where no there were no laws what would you do? Would you go crazy and murder or steal? Me, personally I would loiter my a** off and there would be nothing they could do. If you are wondering what the hell I am talking about, I am talking about The Purge you moron didn't you read the title and that is the exact premise of this movie and believe me it pretty awesome of a premise. It is your pal Brandon with his review of The Purge. I just have to say this we shall be seeing less audio reviews and more written only because it is such a pain to get the guys together to record so I hope you like reading boys and girls. <br/><br/>Everyone and there mother loved this premise of one day a year for 12 hours there are no laws. Except the fact you cant go after any five star general and above. Isn't that typical government crap, like oh you can kill anyone but us so go nuts. The movie surprised me on one fact how many douche-bag bros and people who tend to love the worst movies. I was in a theater with these people and it was the worst I used to think old people were the worst movie goers. I was dead wrong the Bros are without a doubt the worst movie goers they should never be allowed in the theater unless they are alone. The movie isn't about the no laws the movie is truly about the rich vs. the poor. It makes sense because the rich can afford the big old security systems, but the homeless don't even have homes so no wonder they are targeted. I will have to say if you think this movie is a horror film it really isn't this is a survival film. For those of you who don't know the movie is about this kid lets a hunted homeless man into the home and the people trying to kill him are breaking in to kill everyone. The family must survive the night to live to see another day. <br/><br/>The biggest name in this movie is Ethan Hawke who plays the father of the family and he does a great job. He is the most rational member of the family for the most part even more important he has one scene in this movie where he is just a complete bad mother f*****. I do have to say his daughter in this movie is drop dead gorgeous, Adelaide Kane is so freaking hot in the movie it made me a happy camper sitting in that theater. No need for me to say what is truly going on in my head during those scenes with her. I will have to say the James Sandin and Mary Sandin (the parents) would have been much better off if they never had kids. There son may have rational views but he is too damn compassionate with the fact he lets a man being hunted into the house and when the family is looking for the man he hides him. His daughter as fine as she may be is a moron to say the least I won't say what happens but damn is she a dumb son of a b****. The performance I thought was very well done was Henry (Tony Oller) he was the leader of the group trying to kill the homeless man. The guy was clearly nuts but he was so polite you almost could have been like well let him kill the homeless man he said please. <br/><br/>This movie was directed and written by James DeMonaco he is a big TV writer, he wrote The Killing Point and Crash. I liked the Killing Point a lot as a show and I think he did a great job with the dialog and the overall pace of the movie. It is paced perfectly once it gets going it's bat s*** crazy. I hope to see more movies from him because I believe James did a great job with this movie and how everything plays out. <br/><br/>Overall this isn't a deep movie as it might at times try and be but it is a fun movie and if you are a jumpy person this is the movie for you. This is just a really goo thriller, survival horror whatever you want to call it, it is well worth the price of admissions.

","Great concept, not so great film. The film is set in the future and during this time the new US government has decided to have an annual purge to do away with the violence that happens on an every day basis by allowing people to use the purge as an outlet. The purge is a 12 hour time span from 7p-7a in which absolutely everything becomes legal including murder...there are no police, no hospitals, no anything for 12 straight hours. The government believes that by allowing people those 12 free hours to do as they please violence will decrease...interesting concept as it has never been done before, but that's as far as the good goes. I think the movie was just poorly scripted, they took too long to get to point (and this isn't even a long movie) and focused too much on small irrelevant stuff beforehand. This could have been a very good film had they found a better story line or maybe gone a bit deeper into the story line."
"mailinghunt-j","Null","1","2","9 June 2013"," The Purge
","With a high concept evoking a sense of morality reminiscent of 'The Hunger Games', 'The Purge' has an intriguing premise that it fails to fully explore.<br/><br/>In this thought-provoking thriller, the citizens of America are left without emergency services during an annual twelve-hour period where all crime is made legal. To avoid the anarchy which they simply must wait out, a typical suburban family lock down their house while 'The Purge' is occurring. When a persecuted stranger manages to take refuge in their home, the moral fabric of the family is tested as they must decide how to manage the situation and escape with their lives.<br/><br/>'The Purge' has great scope for exploring the sheer chaos that would occur in a realistic portrayal of these events, however an eye-opening first act becomes a typical horror-thriller, running with the home invasion thread and working it into the ground. Perhaps the micro-budget dictated this was all that could be possible, but the missed opportunities are far too many for the film to make a bold enough point about its subject matter. The marketing for 'The Purge' carried the foreboding tagline 'Reminder, All Emergency Services Will Be Suspended'. Why then, is there not a single reference to this concept besides the fleeting sound of sirens as the film closes? <br/><br/>As the generic horror the film reduces itself to, 'The Purge' is a minor success thanks to some solid performances across the board, and Jason Blum's trademark chills and thrills. But as the disturbing social commentary it should have been, 'The Purge' wipes itself out. If a sequel is developed, there is not only the chance to indefinitely up the ante, but also to give the premise some much needed depth."

Each of the feeds was from a different city, and one of them was not too far from where I currently live. I thought it was a cool choice to bring the audience into that world. <br/><br/>The acting was not the best in the world, with the exception of the lead Purge creep. His smile gave me chills. <br/><br/>The main plot with the family was interesting, but I would have liked to see more on how The Purge came into being. In this world, there are ""new founding fathers"" and the characters speak about them with a cult-like reverence. The filmmakers never get into who these new leaders are or if they were elected or anything like that. <br/><br/>The movie explored a lot of themes in its 82 minute running time including if humans are naturally predisposed to be killers or use a moral compass and poverty.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a horror film, you will be gravely disappointed. It is a dystopian thriller which left me with a million questions. Again, it is not the best movie I have ever seen but they did a pretty good job with $3 million budget."

","After watching this movie I felt compelled to right my first and maybe only review and the way I see it is that there are two ways to go into this movie.<br/><br/>First, as a movie goer that believes the plot is what defines the movie. Well if this is the case, let me say, save the however many dollars you'll have to spend. In a nutshell, the government has found a way to boost the economy while also reducing crime, and this is through the annual 'purge' where all crime is legal for 12 hours. There are several major characters and a lot more minor characters in this movie. Obviously there's the family that consists of the mom, dad, son and daughter, and the minor characters that I want to refer to as the purgers. Many possibly interesting conflicts emerge and a few, if not none at all, get resolved in any meaningful manner. There is little to no character background; the only person there is the slightest background for is the dad, everyone else's background is literally only shown in small 10-20 second clips and cut-scenes through the beginning of the movie, and we know even less about the purgers. If you ever do find yourself getting somewhat into the plot a character does something completely ridiculous and you find yourself loathing the movie again.<br/><br/>If, that's not what you came for, and you've came to just watch the film it'll somewhat be worth the money spent; but only a little. The moment you decide to not care about what happens and what lead to these certain situations you can get pretty interested. As the movie trots along the action builds up, but then just stops... There are several points in the movie where something happens and you just expect the movie to end at a point where it would actually make sense but doesn't, then it continues, you think it's going to end again, it continues, then it ends in the absolutely worse way, at least in my opinion.<br/><br/>Plot - 4; Interest Level - 7; Overall - 5.5 (F grade): Applaud the effort but still a fail. Giving the benefit of the doubt and rounding up, it's a D; below average... it'll get you by but isn't necessarily a good thing."
"cattsheppard","7","1","2","7 June 2013"," Decent movie, would recommend to anyone who likes thrillers!
","I went to see this movie based on the premise alone, and I was pretty pleased by it. The premise appealed to me because I like movies that make me think about moral issues. I left the theater very entertained.<br/><br/>The whole idea behind the annual ""purge"", to have one night a year to let out repressed hatred and rage upon whomever is unfortunate enough to be caught in the line of fire, is kind of unimaginable. As I was watching, I kept thinking about what my life would be like in that kind of future. I live in about a middle class situation, definitely not wealthy, so I don't think I would fare very well. Without enough money, the only ample protection you could have is a gun or some other kind of weapon, but even that wouldn't guarantee your safety.<br/><br/>I was also thinking about a point that was brought up on some of the news broadcasts in the movie, that the purge was being used to rid society of the supposed ""undesirables"" (homeless, poor people, etc). These people seem to be considered less valuable as people (like when the leader of the purge gang kept referring to their homeless target as a ""pig"" and ""swine""). I don't know if this was trying to convey a point or a message about society, but that's what it made me think about.<br/><br/>The only thing I can say irritated me about this movie is that there are a lot of moments where I felt like yelling at the screen, ""What are you doing?! You idiot!"" This may have just been me.<br/><br/>Overall, I really enjoyed The Purge! The part at the end right before the alarm to end the purge sounded pleased me greatly. Nice note to end the movie."
"naregian","6","1","2","7 June 2013"," A fairly decent film...if you end it at about the 70 minute mark.
","I'll keep this review short and simple. To get straight to the point, I will admit that after you get past the obviously ridiculous main premise of something like The Purge actually existing, you can let the film hook you in. It gives you an interesting hour or so of not too scary, but still a bit dark and disturbing violence and thrill, with a side of horror and terror. <br/><br/>After the home invasion and actual terrorizing of the family got a little old, you start to wonder..""wait a minute, these bad guys just wanted the man who entered this innocent family's home..who are they?!""<br/><br/>The ending is among the laziest, weakest, and most poorly conceived/written endings in all the horror films I've watched. I won't spoil all of it for you, but it really is just so lazy. <br/><br/>NONE of your questions get answered. Who the heck are these creepy bad guys? What do they want with the mysterious black man who sought refuge in the family's home? Who was the guy anyway? <br/><br/>One thing I will comment positively on is Rhys Wakefield's performance as the creepy, mysterious bad guy who was so eerily similar to Heath Ledger's portrayal of The Joker. Don't get me wrong, I am definitely not putting them in the same category, but I will say that his portrayal was strong, dark and disturbing, and gave the film a bit of enjoyability."
"carleyweinstein","7","1","2","7 June 2013"," The Purge: Longing For More
","I'm glad I went to see this film, but I would not go out of my way to recommend it to others. It had its moments where the entire audience would jump and scream. There were points where the theater would clap and cheer. And to get a crowded theater silent for most of the movie is quite an accomplishment. To say I loved the movie is an exaggeration, but it was a good one. The movie ended not with a feeling of ""I want to know what happens next."" It was more like ""that's it?"" I left less satisfied than expected. But then again, that happens to me when I go into a movie with high expectations. The action scenes were quality, the effects were great, and I loved the plot. There were some twists I didn't expect, as well as some I wish would have happened. So the big question is: ""Is it worth your money to see it in theaters?"" Yes! A television will not give this movie justice. On t.v., I probably would have rated the film a 5 or 6. But you be the judge. Let me know what you think!"
"RyanDangerously","6","1","2","7 June 2013"," Disappointing and average
","I was looking forward to this movie because of the premise. It's a pretty unique twist on the home invasion scenario and I was hoping that the film would explore the actual event. Unfortunately the most we see of the actual purge is probably during the film's opening credits where CCTV footage is shown of various attacks. It was powerfully effective and set the whole film up nicely, but then the next scene has a family in their home....and this is where you are for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>What is ultimately shown is an average thriller with a bunch of jump scares. I say average because it's not terrible by any means, but it certainly isn't memorable. The film relies on the same clichés: dark corners, serial killers in masks, random jump scares that don't mean anything...that sort of thing. If you like the feeling of tension from characters exploring a dark house them you'd enjoy The Purge. But if you were looking for 12 hours of crime and chaos being fully explored, you'll be disappointed.<br/><br/>That being said, The Purge does have at least some unique elements that set it apart from the other stale horrors out there. After 12 hours nobody can hurt anyone, so there's a sense of urgency for the night to quickly be over. It's also interesting knowing that the killers are just normal people in their messed up society, and not actually doing it mindlessly; they are after (and this is the only name I can really call him) a black man who we do not know much about. The mystery about him could have made an amazing, or at least surprising twist but that never really happens. Ultimately it feels like The Purge has some sort of racial message saying do trust black people, because they'll save your ass in the end. <br/><br/>It's a good premise that's not explored much, if not at all. The acting is decent enough although it doesn't match the acting of films like Funny Games where you can feel the true horror of a family's space being invaded. I jumped a few times but few were worthy. It's a fun time but that's all."

","SPOILERS!!!!!<br/><br/>This movie had me excited because it had so much potential with such a good concept but failed so miserably. The plot holes far exceed any 80s slasher flick. Characters that add nothing to the story, stupid bad guys other than the main guy. they only added to the kills, which by the way were pretty cool but some things you were expecting from the trailer fell short of what could have been. The machete gets no use for instance. the biggest thing that gets me is that ALL CRIME IS LEGAL but no crime is committed other than murder. you would expect to see robbery,GTA, and other things but no one has any other motive than kill kill kill! I understand that it revolves around one family but its like the The actual purge is rated pg-13 and cant have to much violence. When i first saw the trailer i was expecting to see crazy acts of violence since its all legal but the whole movie was flawed by things that mad it bad such as the kid and his HORRIBLE acting!!!! it feels like he cares more for the person who he lets in than his own family and trust me if you see it you will know exactly which scene i am talking about involving his sister.<br/><br/>ALL in all it has a great concept but falls short of being remembered and will be seen at the 10 dollar rack at Walmart in a couple of months."
"ThePaddyMoista","5","1","2","5 June 2013"," Begins promising, however progresses downhill rapidly.
","The Purge is set in the near-future. Where crime is at an all-time low and unemployment is at 1%. This is due to the annual purge in which all emergency services are shut down and American's are granted the freedom to commit any crime to anyone for 12 hours. A family, who does not participate, must come to terms with their own morality as they allow a homeless man into their home, it just happens that a local group of people who target one person and kill him, are after him and provide the family with an ultimatum: All of them, or just the stranger. <br/><br/>The Purge stars Ethan Hawke, Lena Heady, Max Burkholder and Adelaide Kane and is written and directed by James DeMonaco. <br/><br/>To be honest, I found the concept of The Purge to be incredibly absurd. However, I felt it contained potential in terms of maybe portraying the difficulties of being human and I also wondered if it would focus on the morality tale as well as providing some well required social commentary. What I received was all of them, however they were delivered incredibly poorly you could almost overlook them. <br/><br/>I think the directing suited the film and was appropriate, however I felt the writing was lacking. It just appeared, to me, like DeMonaco was unsure of what genre of film he wished to depict - Horror/Thriller/Sci- Fi - so he happened upon the conclusion that he was going to unite all three and make something spectacular. It just felt sloppy and disorganized.<br/><br/>In addition to the poor writing, a major factor of it was defiantly the dialog. Also, the stupidity of certain characters was amazing, especially the daughter. It was just ridiculous. Everything it was attempting to portray was undermined by it's obviousness. There was no vacant space for you to fill with your own personal interpretations. In other words, there was no subtlety. <br/><br/>It actually began promising, surprisingly enough, but then went completely downhill after about 20-30 minutes. It appeared like it would really address the societal issues of our innate thirst for violence, but alas it didn't. It just decided to be a generic thriller with horror incorporated. And also include obvious ""twists"". And that's purely the writing. <br/><br/>The acting was decent, it was pretty generic and each actor was interchangeable. Ethan Hawke did a decent job, however it seemed a little too familiar to Sinister in terms of how he acts. I also found Tony Oller to be completely underutilized. If you're going to make a horror/thriller film, at least include a good villain, which they did to an extent, however he was incredibly underutilized. The character and the actor. <br/><br/>5/10. Began promising, progressively became a generic horror/thriller. Very poorly wrote in terms of it's approach to the concept and it's intelligence. Simplistsically, it could have been handled better in better hands. Wasted opportunity. However, is still somewhat enjoyable if you look at it from a horror/thriller perspective and are willing to overlook it's all it's insane obviousness."
"megan-craig-704-378147","7","1","2","5 June 2013"," Anti-climax
","I really was looking forward to this film, it seemed like the perfect combination of violence and drama. I hyped myself up to it being amazing after reading several good reviews explaining how spine-chillingly good it was but I have to say I was rather disappointed. Not only did the film seem rushed the acting had a lot to be desired. I really enjoyed the film, don't get me wrong. The entire concept of it was unbelievable, quite frankly whoever thought of the storyline deserves an award because it was so complex but simple to understand for those who aren't massively into films. However, I came out the cinema feeling disappointed. It was probably one of the most anti-climatic films I've ever seen. I was really looking forward to some good old-fashioned torture scenes and grimy violence (as sadistic as it sounds) but it just didn't happen. Everything happened at once, with barely a build-up to it. It's as if the producers said ""Look, you've got 85 minutes to make it work. No less, no more."" It was so crammed into a short period of time that the audience didn't have a chance to sit on the edge of their seat, shaking with tension. Not only was the timing an issue for me but the storyline was PREDICTABLE. Now, I'm pretty good at guessing story lines to films just because of my interest in them but seriously? This was like elementary guessing. You could see a ""jump-out"" scene coming from a mile away, so when it actually happened you all but skipped a breath. In addition to this the acting was just... Well for those of you who're planning to see it you'll understand. I would recommend this film, but don't hype yourself up for a thrill ride of a lifetime because it's far from it."
"Viddy24","4","1","2","4 June 2013"," The Purge is all cheap thrills and spills
","The Purge had every potential to make a mark on the horror genre. The concept was original and with the producers of SINISTER and INSIDIOUS behind it, there were high hopes for myself (and i'm sure many other horror fans). However, the reality, was far from pleasing. <br/><br/>The Purge took it's original concept and rushed through it with no real backing as to what this whole idea was even about. It was flimsy and lacked basic explanations about who the characters were, when this Purge concept came to be and why exactly it has actually helped society only have 1% crime-rate. (and no, saying ridding someone of their inner hatred for a night isn't sufficient, thank you very much). <br/><br/>The film moved painfully by as I sat there cringing at it's cheap thrills and it's extremely forced use of 'creeping' the audience out. The masks were scary, don't get me wrong, but were forcefully used and placed inappropriately around the film in order to gain a cheap reaction from the audience as the rest of the story seemed to sink in a puddle of cheap quick sand. Shots of people in the masks on swings, tilting their heads, skipping through the house (which seemed incredibly unnecessary when attempting to kill a family), was just a little too forced and was my confirmation that the director had definitely lost all artistic integrity (and/or hope) in this film. <br/><br/>The shock end that saw (SPOILER AHEAD) the lead character Ethan Hawke die was about the only risky and exciting thing that the film did. In a film that ended up feeling like a cross between a cheap horror TV programme and a constant string of people who are 'just about to die but get saved in the last second', killing of the lead character was somewhat of a relief. At least James DeMonaco, who has actually had no directing experience before this, did something right. Too bad it was too late. <br/><br/>The Purge is just another disappointment in a genre that is desperately trying to reinvent itself, but keeps losing it's footing. Oh well - at least the bitch neighbor got what she deserved. (Kind of. Even though I know everyone was secretly wanting her to get shot)"
"pfodey-984-894923","Null","3","12","10 June 2013"," Without seeing it, I know this movie stinks!
","I try not to be prejudiced toward any film I have yet to see for myself, however, sometimes it is impossible. For example, I did not need to see Steve Martin in ""The Pink Panther"" to KNOW that it sucked. Likewise, I didn't need to see Vince Vaughn as Norman Bates in the shot-for-shot remake of ""Psycho"" to know that it SUCKED!!! In fact, almost all of the countless remakes of 1970s films are abysmal. Why not just watch the original? ""The Purge"" SUCKS, and I have not seen it. I don't need to - from the ads, it is clearly modern Hollywood garbage, with a premise SO ridiculous I can't freaking believe it. In a crime-free society (like that's possible), citizens are allowed to ""purge"" one night of the year. Yeah, okay! Then, (I guess the brain-dead filmmakers didn't realize) the remainder of the year will be spent rebuilding smashed and burnt out buildings, providing physical and psychological care for countless victims, etc.... I am so disgusted at the state of cinema today it makes me want to puke. Occasionally a great film comes along (Argo, for example), but you'd be wiser to tune into some of cable TV's dramas, such as ""Breaking Bad"" and ""Sons of Anarchy"". ""The Purge"" - shame on you, Ethan Hawke."

","one of the creepiest movies I've seen in a while in terms of the storyline. the storyline could've been written better but how it was played out in the movie was good with the effects used. Ethan Hawke is such an amazing actor for these kinds of story lines in movies although I wish he had a little bit action in this movie and the movie in general could've used a little bit more action but it was still good. I also think that the storyline could've maybe had more detail in it like looking at how the stranger got into the position that he did. The first time watching the movie it definitely held my interest a lot but the second time seeing this movie I felt like there was some dull moments about this movie that I didn't catch the first time but its still a movie I could watch over and over again and not get bored by it. I hope there's a sequel to this movie."

There are few moments where we feel why the character took particular decision, he could had done the other way, but at the later stage you realize it was wise decision and it more about not to lose the humanity. The concept of killing during PURGE phase (12 hours) sounds weird, but in movie they have given their own explanation for the PURGE. Its up to you as how much you digest.

","The year is 2022, not too distantly into the future and America's crime levels are at an all time low, as is unemployment and the economic problems it has been suffering are almost a bad memory. The drastic solution which produced these results is something called The Purge. Each year, for 12 hours from 7pm to 7am, all crime is declared legal and the police and security services are suspended. In short, for 12 hours, America has become a state of anarchy. <br/><br/>Cue: idealised American family the Sandins. Father Ethan Hawke is a security system salesman, Mother Lena Headley is a homemaker and mother. Along with their 2 children, Charlie and Zoe, this family seem the ideal. They all live in an exclusive community in beautiful, massive homes and surrounded by gossipy neighbours. <br/><br/>The film begins just shortly before The Purge. Ethan is coming home and Lena is preparing a family meal and chatting with neighbours. Everything is as it should be. Nothing afoot. The couple's family is also joined briefly by Zoe's older boyfriend, who her father disapproves of. A family meal erupts into a feast of rude comments then the idealised family go into the communal security room and wait for the sirens to go off, signalling the beginning of the yearly Purge. <br/><br/>As the family home becomes a Sandin fortress, Charlie wanders around and tries to settle down. Zoe makes out with her boyfriend and both adults talk about the benefits of The Purge, safe in the knowledge, that they won't be affected by its problems. <br/><br/>All is well, until Charlie the son spots a fugitive pleading for help within the community. He's in deep distress, being shot at by a crowd of 20 something masked anarchists complete with smart suits, white dresses and horrid masks. Charlie decides to help the man and disarms the fortress system to let him in. <br/><br/>Thus does the dynamic of the story change. Both parents don't know what to do with the stranger. To make matters instantly worse, his assailants are right behind him, a bunch of masked anarchists hungry for his blood, lead by a smartly dressed young man. Said young man wants them to hand over the fugitive so that he can be slaughtered and hey can be left alone. Easy choice really?<br/><br/>So begins a real tale of moral dilemma on a par with films like Straw Dogs, Panic Room and The Strangers, a French movie on similar lines. Anarchists continue to taunt the family and ask them not too politely to turn 'the swine over. Family struggles trying to tie him up, preparing to throw him back to his assailants. It is at this point that the film descends into familiar territory. Still, matters not. It is a good idea which may have been better added to but doesn't suffer for not straying away from its main premise. There is an element, particularly at the end where you realise you don't know who your friends are."

The film concentrates on one family of some wealth. They lock themselves in their home with steel windows and doors. Unfortunately the outside world has a way of making its way indoors as the film becomes a home break-in movie with a theme, and study in individual character mirroring us as a society. Lena Headey plays ""the mom."" She represents compassion, the ""It is not about who they are, it is about who we are.""

","I had seen clips or trailers for this dark looking film, and then I heard a little bit about the concept, it certainly sounded like something I could like, and I'd also seen the creepy poster a few times, so there was nothing stopping me trying it. Basically in the late 2010s came economic collapse, so ""The New Founding Fathers of America"" established a new totalitarian government and a police state, in 2017, the 28th amendment of the U.S Constitution is ratified, establishing one night a year, March 21 to 22, from 7pm to 7am, called ""The Purge"", in which all crime, including murder, is legal, and all police, fire, and medical emergency services are unavailable for 12 hours. The only rules of the Purge are that high level government officials are not to be disturbed, and high grade weapons such as explosives, grenades, bazookas, rocket launchers and so on are forbidden, those who violate these rules will be publicly executed by hanging, the Purge has resulted in crime and unemployment rates plummeting and a strong economy, it is meant for catharsis, but in reality it is a method of artificial population control, as unemployed poor people are usually the main targets. In 2022, in an affluent Los Angeles suburb, top security systems salesman James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) lives with his wife Mary (Game of Thrones' Lena Headey) and two children, Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and Charlie (Max Burkholder), they are preparing to wait out Purge Night. Zoey's boyfriend Henry (Tony Oller) managed to sneak into the house before the security system was engaged, he plans to confront her father about their relationship, meanwhile Charlie is watching the security monitors, he sees a wounded man calling for help, he temporarily disables the system to allow the bloody stranger (Edwin Hodge). James races to reactivate the system, he holds the man at gunpoint, then Henry enters to pull a gun on James, he fires at James and misses, James fires back, mortally wounds and eventually kills Henry, during this chaos the man disappears and hides, James takes Mary and Charlie back to the security control room. As James reprimands Charlie for letting the stranger into the house, they view on the surveillance cameras a group of masked young adults armed with guns, axes and hammers approaching the house. The leader, a polite stranger (Rhys Wakefield), removes his mask and demands they let out the homeless man, or they will ""release the beast"", meaning they will break in and kill them, James admits to Mary that the security system is only supposed to discourage potential invaders and cannot protect them against heavy force. The gang cuts the power to the house, the man reappears and attempts to take Mary hostage, but James and Charlie subdue him, the family know they are no better than the gang waiting outside, they decide not to turn over the man, but instead to fight back. Their deadline passes, the gang uses a truck to rip the metal plating off the front door and enter the house, James kills four of the men, before the leader stabs him to death, Charlie sees on the surveillance cameras their neighbours leaving their homes to fatally shooting gang members, just as the gang is about to kill Mary, several of the neighbours arrive and kill most of the gang, the leader is shot dead by Zoey. Mary thanks the neighbours for their support, but they reveal that they are angry at the Sandins for their their wealth acquired by the money they paid the Sandins with for various security systems, they tie Mary, Charlie and Zoey up with duct tape and plan to kill them. As the neighbours make final preparations for the murder, the homeless man from earlier reappears and shoots dead one the neighbours, he holds another neighbour Grace Ferrin (Arija Bareikis) hostage, he forces the neighbours to free the Sandins, he asks for Mary's call to kill the neighbours, she decides to let them live, instructing them there will no be further killing for the remainder of the night. As dawn breaks and the end of Purge is minutes away, Grace attempts to grab a shotgun, but Mary pulls it away from her, she uses the stock of the gun to hit Grace in the nose, she breaks her nose throwing her face down into the glass table, Mary strictly reminds her there will be no more killing in the house for the remaining Purge. After some time, sirens are heard, announcing the end of the annual Purge, the neighbours leave to return to their homes, and the homeless man leaves, Mary, Zoey and Charlie wait and watch the emergency services retrieve the dead, a news broadcast states that this year's Purge is the most successful to date. Also starring David Basila as George, Nathan Clarkson as Freak, Tisha French as Mrs. Halverson, Chris Mulkey as Mr. Halverson and Dana Bunch as Mr. Ferrin. The performances are fine, and writer/director James DeMonaco is used to these kinds of films, having done The Negotiator and Assault on Precinct 13, political and ethical questions come into play, is is a thriller with a simple survival of the fittest premise, the threat and a little blood is creepy, it is not that scary, but it is an interesting enough social science- fiction action horror film.

"lolidunno16","6","1","3","25 May 2015"," Great premise, but botched execution *SPOILERS*.
","The premise of the film is absolutely amazing, but sadly, the execution of this was severely botched. We see the purge from the perspective of one family inside one household. That's it. The whole film. There is almost no action and almost no killing.<br/><br/>So the film is enthralling and you actually wonder, are these people going to make it out alive? Everything falls apart when the family's stupid son lets a total stranger in the house by lowering the shields. Does this strange-looking child have a single brain cell?!? This makes the house a prime target for a man and several masked killers. After some filler, the masked men get in and a huge action sequence starts. When the sun is setting, you feel the tension rising and you can almost feel their cabin fever. This gives the film lots of credit from me.<br/><br/>But then the second half of the film is just... infuriating. I lost count of the number of times a character was almost killed and then was saved at the last second by divine intervention. In real life, they'd all be dead within an hour. Simple. Yes one can argue it's many people in a small house, but still, the chances of THAT many divine interventions is less than those of being struck by lightning twice in one day.<br/><br/>This was infuriating to watch, and became more so after every time this happened. Which was pretty much constant during the second half. And of course, surprise surprise, it's the father that gets killed. Because it's always the father. We all saw this coming. Could this have been any more predictable? It was a real shame. I really thought they would throw a curve-ball and have the kid that started all the problems die. Or how about have them ALL die? That would have been certainly a subversion of expectations. But nope, we just get the head of house dying. And the girlfriend who didn't even need to exist in the film.<br/><br/>So I have highly mixed views on this film. 6/10 for the absolutely amazing premise and the 60% of the film that had me along for the ride, but minus the 40% that was one big cop-out."

","After seeing the coming attractions in the movie theater, I felt excited to see this movie! The concept of allowing people to ""Purge"" one night a year could be feasible if there was a story behind it. ""The New Founding Fathers"" allowing the Purge is to weed out the defenseless, poor so that they will be eliminated so that the economy flourishes. This concept is so ridiculous and the fact that the Sadin family beliefs are so different that the son would risk his family's lives over a complete stranger. If I went to the theater to see this movie I would have left my minute 30. I wasted 90 minutes for a terrible and ridiculous movie. It makes no sense, story line is inconsistent, and there was such division between this ""perfect"" family, it was just plain stupid. Don't see this movie! Waste if time!!!"

","The Purge. It starts with a concept that is very promising. But it has too many strange turning points.

First thing what would go through my mind after having control of the situation with the neighbors and a gun in my hands: ""what about next year's Purge? Hell no, I'll kill them now, now I have the chance!"".<br/><br/>Therefore, I'm not sure what the director wants to tell / teach me with this movie. I had a deja-vu with Home Alone, from the moment the family is turning it's house into a fortress. Unfortunately Joe Pesci and Daniel Stern didn't turn up, but some upper class kids.

Even the ending I was able to predict as soon as the cookies were given.<br/><br/>One obvious issue was the fact that people can just go on holiday during the purge, if they do not want to be a part of it.<br/><br/>That is just one of the many obvious problems I found in the movie.<br/><br/>To fix the holiday issue; they could have just made the whole world ruled by one government/leader who makes the purge a global reality.<br/><br/>The scope of my version would have been in the league of Hannible/ben-hur. However, instead of being a mega blockbuster: the real movie ends up being at a ""B"" movie standard by the end.<br/><br/>Some of the performances are worth seeing and will make the actors seem more suitable for different role types in the future.<br/><br/>The first 20mins were really good and so thats what my ""4/10"" rating is for.

"bushtony","5","1","3","29 June 2013"," Purged of any suspension of disbelief
","OK, yes, I know cinema - especially the horror/thriller genre - assumes some reasonable suspension of disbelief as a given. But THE PURGE is a film that makes it so hard for the audience to achieve, it ultimately falls flat on it's face due to the complete illogicality and irrationality of the narrative and the mind-blowingly stupid actions of the characters. In a comedy/spoof you'd just about get away with it. But my guess is, THE PURGE is not intended as a rib-tickler.<br/><br/>The concept of targeted, channelled violence into recreational pursuits as a means of imposing political control through catharsis is a sci-fi mainstay and is nothing new (DEATH RACE 2000, ROLLERBALL, THE RUNNING MAN, etc). That it's a generally ludicrous conceit (go to a UK football match for proof) doesn't matter providing the fictional construct depicting it has some internal logic going for it that enables effective suspension of disbelief. You gotta be able to buy into it.<br/><br/>Here, we are expected to believe that citizens can vent all the anger and violent urges they have suppressed for the rest of the year and let it explode over a twelve hour period. Then, when the time is up, go back to being a law-abiding citizen for another whole year. They can kill, mutilate, slaughter with no psychological ill-effects and carry on as normal. This, we are told, has reduced crime in the US to almost zero and has cut down on poverty and homelessness because it's the poor and homeless who are the main targets for victimisation.<br/><br/>In the UK the current Coalition Government are trying much the same thing with increased taxation and benefit cuts instead of outright mass homicide. It's sort of backfired, though, and is in fact increasing poverty and homelessness. Maybe they'll see this film and consider the approach for their next election manifesto.<br/><br/>Anyway, the premise is absurd, but I can live with it. What I can't live with is:<br/><br/>1. Hotshot home security genius heading for the top spot at work who has a feeble and next to useless security system installed in his own home.<br/><br/>2. ""Intelligent"" techno-wizard son who overrides the security system on Purge Night to allow sanctuary to a bleeding black guy he doesn't know. The streets are awash with homicidal stalkers toting some serious weaponry. He knows this. He also knows the security code - who the hell gave it to him and why? Put yourself in this kid's position. Wouldn't you at least mention your plan to your parents first, considering everyone's life is on the line? What, no discussion? Just do it? Smart kid. Really. You just got everyone killed. <br/><br/>3, Teenie daughter who, once an unknown person with an unknown agenda is loose in the house on the most horrific and deadly night of the year, wanders off on her own like some petulant Tinkerbell. OK, arguably she was traumatised by the death of her boyfriend who had just tried to execute her father. But come on, she knows the score. What is she, three? <br/><br/>4. You're a home security hotshot and you don't have a panic room or a feasible defensible position in your home. <br/><br/>5. Once the house is invaded by a bunch of sociopathic killers with guns, axes, knives and cudgels, everyone splits up and wanders around in the dark, rather than staying together in the most secure, defensible area of the house and letting the nutbars come to them and then letting rip with their collective firepower. In the film ZULU there's a reason why the troops at Rorke's Drift didn't randomly wander off separately into the veldt looking for the ZULU warriors. Any ideas? <br/><br/>6. No one looks behind them to see if there is anyone there. Why?<br/><br/>7. Why spend ages duct taping the black guy to a chair rather than just immediately throwing his incapacitated ass out through the door as per the attacker's demands?<br/><br/>I could go on and on, but that's enough or I'll be here for a week.<br/><br/>On the plus side - although the dialogue is largely tripe - the performances by the actors are generally solid, even if their characters are terminally clichéd: model wife, exec husband, hormonal teen daughter, nerdy son, histrionic pantomime villains, token black victim (who just happens to be a homeless, poverty stricken loser and societal pariah). Decent production values for what it is, some well orchestrated fight scenes with accompanying bloodshed and a pleasingly downbeat if slightly preachy and moralising ending.<br/><br/>Although purged of any capacity to engender suspension of disbelief, in fairness it's never boring or tedious, just illogical and frustrating. The germ of a good movie is in place and maybe the proposed sequel will put it to more satisfying use. But then, we know what most sequels are like. Right?"

","21st century has given different low-budget thrillers where the events develop in a limited space and limited time, often with a rich family involved, e.g. Panic Room or Trespass or Funny Games. All tense in a way or another, focusing on tough choices and pondering on human value and dignity. The Purge is another movie in that row and, as the topic is exploited too often, it brings along too many clichés, improbable solutions and odd ending. <br/><br/>However, good actors like Ethan Hawke and Lena Headey squeeze the most out of it; at the same time, those depicting children or gang members are not inviting. And what was the purpose of including an African American - an attempt to widen the audience? <br/><br/>Not to mention the fact that the idea behind/beyond the purge is rather dumb; I could picture a day when criminals could be punished and disputes settled out-of-court, but the meaning visible in this movie is just a mind-twister without any logic.

","Despite the trailer being immensely satisfying and convincing of a good blockbuster, the film fell short of it's own expectations. The film was filled with thrills and twists at every turn, but the created emotions always seemed to be destroyed by the clearly staged 'acting' on-screen. The suspense built upon stalking the 'Target' created a great immersion into the shocking story of - The Purge, but this however was quickly ruined by the 'fight' scenes in the film, due to their shear repetition of the same old 'smash and block' technique being used by Ethan Hawke as James Sandin. Another huge let down was the lack of location which the trailer promised viewers by showing clips of multiple crimes of varying magnitudes being shown all over the city not just the one street. The title of The Purge suggested a wide spread 'cleansing' but, viewers were instead given an extended clip of one man being hunted with splashes of fights and threats added into the already flat mixture. An overall let- down, for a promising concept."

","I personally was a little disappointing with this flick. Based on the trailers and from what I read prior to viewing it I had pretty big exceptions upon walking into the theater. The acting was good but some of the decisions made by the characters were at points ridiculously unnatural and unrealistic. It was far from all bad though. I was on the edge of my seat for most the movie and it had plenty of suspense and at times the writers incorporated some pretty cool ideas.I enjoyed the first half of the film a lot. My biggest complaint was the ending of the movie which was totally deflated, it was one of those situations where you stick around for the credits thinking there has to be more but to my disappointment there wasn't. It just seemed like a really lazy way to end the movie.<br/><br/>I don't regret seeing this movie in the theater. As I mention I was quite entertained throughout most of the show but from what I viewed as a very cool idea for a movie, I expected much more and had higher expectations. I got the opinion from the end that they were setting up for a sequel so lets hope they get it right next time!"

","TO MY FELLOW CRITICS I, too, maintained unreasonably high expectations regarding this film. And like the rest of you, who were immensely, profoundly, sorely, and utterly disappointed amid watching it: I share in your discontentment. <br/><br/>TO THE UNSUSPECTING VIEWER I must I own that I found the film so terrible that I could not endure it in its entirety--I only lasted about 40 minutes before abandoning the theater in disgust--therefore, you may find my critique irrelevant; although, the events preceding ""the commencement"" were mostly tolerable. <br/><br/>Admittedly, the film possessed so intriguing a plot that it captivated my attention for months. It had a decent and recognizable cast (award nominee, Ethan Hawke, ""300""'s shrewd Queen Gorgo of Sparta, Lena Headey,that kid from that one film, Max Burkholder, and etc.), a marginally decent director, James DeMonaco (hey, ""The Negotiator"" was pretty awesome!), and three-time ""MTV Movie Award"" winner, producer, Michael Bay (...); and so I thought, 'surely, it will at least be decent.' Well, as aforementioned, I could only stand 40 minutes of the film--despite their not having skimped on the clichéd details(the culminating adolescent girl with pent-up aggression and daddy issues, and her failingly humane younger brother) to assure the audience that some stupid decisions will be made. <br/><br/>Once ""the commencement"" commences, it seems reality is tossed to the wind. One unrealistic action after another (from the son disarming the security system and unwittingly placing his entire family in jeopardy,to the daughter's love-obscured indiscretions) had quickly diminished my interest in the film--yet, I remained in hopes that it would improve. Following the entrance of the presumed vagabond (whom, having invaded the home of a man who supposedly installs security systems for a living, seemed incredibly, remarkably elusive) and the angry mob's arrival is when my interest further diminishes--yet, I remain still. <br/><br/>After finally apprehending the intruder, their efforts to bind him verge between ridiculous and outright infuriating (I could not, for the life of me, determine why they simply could not bind his legs and hands, CARRY HIM, and then toss his a** outside?). However, the straw the proverbially broke the camel's back was when the wife conveniently experiences a sudden mode of compunction (I wanted to yell at the screen, ""Woman, the man just threatened your daughter with a gun; dump the SOB outside!"") and decides that defending their own lives is morally wrong. It is at this juncture that I angrily finish drinking my large Cherry Coke and storm out of the theater. <br/><br/>I could care less if the film would have improved after that scene; I just cannot stand to watch such idiocy--despite having spent $10+ dollars on a movie ticket."
"Tcarts76","7","1","3","23 June 2013"," Great Concept, fairly standard movie
","So the set-up for ""The Purge"" is simple. In a Dystopian future crime has almost been completely eliminated due to one day of the year being designated as a day where complete lawlessness is accepted. Not a bad set up, and novel concept.<br/><br/>The Good: Yes, as I said the set-up is good. It got a lot of people excited of the possibilities of this movie and will draw in some crowds. The acting, hmmm, not to bad, not horrible for sure like most horror genre films, but nothing spectacular either. Ethan Hawke has had a decent renaissance in his career ever since ""Training Day,"" and he does a good enough job in this one that it is a decent stand-up movie. <br/><br/>The Bad: OK, this is not going to win any awards. Beyond the dystopian set-up this one just becomes more of a family held hostage by maniacs on the outside type of movie. I think judging by the low rating so far (5.6 at the time of the review), people were expecting a lot more from the deliciously novel concept. It doesn't deliver solidly on that. If you set expectations aside, it is however worth a little more in my opinion.<br/><br/>Lastly, another bad aspect. This is a thinly veiled idealism propaganda movie. It has a strong left wing stance trying to hint that this dystopian future is based on conservative ideas, set up in order to make sure ""poor"" people are the victims of the purge and they eradicated each other. Rather strange because historically it has been far left governments who have actually ""Purged"" people more often than right wing ones. Don't let it bother you and just watch an entertaining movie. It's not great enough of a movie to take a message like that seriously.<br/><br/>The verdict for me is a 7. Great set-up, average acting (which is above par when it comes to horror movies), decently entertaining movie even if the kids in the movie seem to be the dumbest kids ever. Just don't get the hopes up to high as to the fantastic possibilities running through your head when you see previews."

Or save it for the Purge.<br/><br/>Does this describe something you would do? Then The Purge is making a social comment about you, and I couldn't agree with it any more. They are trying to say that the world we live in now is worse than a future we live in during which it is legal to kill rape and molest people. This was done in many ways including rubbing it in our faces by making things the doll-faced creeps do humorous, such as when the girl jumped up in the air and got shot and went flying. Half the people in my theater were dying laughing at this. I think the makers of the movie threw this in there to show that our culture has become so adjusted to violence that we laugh at it. Go ahead, think I'm crazy, but I think there were a lot of things like this that were added that made the film a unique experience never before seen. (I never like to give away theme in my reviews, as I've said before, so sorry if this seems underdeveloped. Just go see the movie and see for yourself.) The place that bothered me about the movie is the plot that accompanied the great idea behind the film. The simple home-invasion concept seemed like it didn't suit to the idea properly, and made it seem like the idea of the Purge wasn't even necessary for the plot. Something like the characters are driving home from somewhere, get stuck in traffic during the commencement of the Purge would have been a greater idea. And yes, characters do make very stupid decisions, along with many other horror clichés scattered through out, though there was something that made it almost okay.<br/><br/>The Purge brought about a new style of horror movie that reaches suspense not through characters or situations present, but in human nature. It brings out a fear of people substituting themselves for characters throughout the films. It brings out not terrifying suspense, but more of a type of cutting fear (it is so hard to describe this, just see it for yourself). It is a style of horror I've never seen before.<br/><br/>Overall I really liked The Purge, and don't listen to what other people say. It isn't stupid, they just don't get it. There is so much hidden behind it that many people could not catch it. It is quite the experience that you must witness in a theater to get the whole experience so go out and see it quickly.<br/><br/>GRADE: B+"

","The Purge could be a brilliant piece of social commentary, however it throws that out the window in order to become a much less appealing predictable horror film full of unneeded violence and predictable horror movie clichés.<br/><br/>The film has a promising first 20 minutes that introduces us to the family led by father James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) and mother Mary Sandin (Lena Headey) and also introduces us to the idea of the purge. The purge is a 12 hour period of time in which all crime is legal, it is meant to provide people with a release so that they can ""cleanse their souls"". In the futuristic American setting it had been working like a charm and gained the support of many. <br/><br/>I would be lying if I said this movie didn't boast solid performances from a few of its actors, namely Ethan Hawke and Rhys Wakefield. Wakefield is probably the brightest spot as he very effectively portrays the main villain who gives the Sandin family a hard time. However, the problem with this film is that these performances are put to waste due to the painfully dumb script. It is unmercifully cliché and old. The main conflict is created in such a poor way that it makes the rest of the movie a joke. Had the writers found a different way to create conflict than through an ignorant child then the film would undoubtedly been a much better one.<br/><br/>The movie is full of your typical horror clichés and is written with a low sense of creativity. The concept itself sounds like a brilliant plot for a fresh new horror film with an underlying social commentary but that is not the route it takes. Instead it becomes a boring almost humorously dumb unoriginal effort. If you looked up wasted potential in a thesaurus you would probably see a movie poster for The Purge. <br/><br/>5/10"

","So, for 24 hours once a year, the people of the United States are free to kill, rob or even vandalise a car if they were feeling light hearted, without the risk of being arrested. All emergency services are suspended, and the people are left to fend for themselves. The 'annual purge' as they like to call it in 2020, is a very, very interesting concept, something that draws a lot of the 'what if's' and 'I don't know what I would do' (something I heard numerous times while watching in the cinema). But, with that said, the film doesn't draw us in with the horrors of crime being legal for 24 hours, it doesn't dwell on our fears of crime and the intrusion of your own home, but gets you with cheap scares and loud gunshots. It works (to an extent), but I wanted something a lot deeper, and with a hell of a lot more layers to the story and the characters. Henry's character seems pointless, and after killing him off, we hear nothing more, which doesn't seem to affect Zoey, even though she loves him. The homeless man who the antagonists wanted is no where to be seen for the majority of the film, which kind of made me forget about him all together. Not the best outcome when he is the only character who seems to drive the story! The storyline delivered to us is flat; family gets ready for the purge, family encounter problem with the purge, family try to deal with the problem, and subsequently manages the problem, even though our protagonist is fatally wounded (which, by the way, was not as sympathetic as it should have been). It's a pretty basic follow through. However, the writer did try to make it that bit more crazy at the end; getting the neighbours who we thought were our friends involved, twisting their oh so pretty faces into demonic killing machines. Which, was funny, but it seemed a little too thrown together and a quick and easy end the film. The acting was dull, melodramatic, and forced, with Lena Headey's capabilities brought way down as she portrayed a mother who was constantly being kept back in safety by her somewhat annoying husband who soon lets his inner 'pro purge' come out. I got the feeling the film was a comment on the USA's ongoing gun problem, but to me, it only seems to enforce the individual's ""right"" to have a gun. 4/10, would not recommend for film goers who want to watch something worth paying for."

The movie starts promising enough and like I say the idea itself is so close to the wire that we were hoping for the best. It seems to start with a script but after that the actors just do whatever they want. It's a senseless killing spree which ends as soon as it starts and if all crime is legal we were expecting other crimes to be thrown in to the mix which would shock accordingly. Hawke is utterly forgettable in this performance, his children odd looking and annoying and when it ended we thought perhaps there would be something else. The supposed twist at the end I saw coming a mile off, in fact in the first few scenes. Wouldn't even bother seeing it if you haven't already."

I, for one, just could not help the laffability of the stupidly weird members of the cast. Lastly, I would simply avoid this comical farce. Let's hope Hollywood execs start to find meaningful scripts that deserve a shot."
"hilariousimmaturity","5","1","3","9 June 2013"," Bad Idea; Poor Executed
","First off, I hated the idea to begin with. It is SO unrealistic. The government is going to allow people to do whatever they want for 12 hours. It's purely ridiculous. In the statement on the TV from the government, it says ""All crime, including Murder, is legal for the next 12 hours."" Even if this would happen, they wouldn't point out Murder. <br/><br/>Second, this movie is full of poor acting. The father, mother, daughter, and the 'Purging' people are awful actors. It really irritated me. <br/><br/>Third, why are the 'Purging' people wearing masks and acting all weird. They are regular people/neighbors, yet they make them seem like crazed serial killers. What is the point for the masks? ALL crime is legal, so you can kill people, yet they wear masks to cover their identity? Doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Fourth, why did the family stay at their home? The father knew that the security system couldn't prevent them from getting in their home, so why not go on vacation to Europe or some other country where they don't Purge? <br/><br/>Lastly, I wouldn't recommend this movie. Even with the bad plot idea, it could've been a better movie than it was."
"Normanholic","5","1","3","8 June 2013"," Set up for greatness but nosedives as it begins
","This movie was totally set up to be a iconic horror movie, the plot was a new idea, and not a stereotypical demon demon ghost ghost horror movie. The masks could have been some of the most recognized masks in horror history along with Michael Meyers, Ghostface, etc... You maybe could have seen people dressing up as characters from The Purge for Hallloween. But sadly, this movie wasn't well done enough for it to be in horror history. If they hadn't relied so much on jump scares, they could have legitimately scared people just by the horror that The Purge really is. If they would have made it more suspenseful it could have been great. If they would have focused on the feelings of rage that the characters had against other characters that made them want to kill each other, it could have been an amazing and thought provoking movie. But sadly, it falls short of being anything more than a summer horror flick. The Purge trailer really captured my interest. It had a very intriguing plot with actors and actresses that I like. However, only a few minutes into the movie I could tell it was going to go downhill from there. It all started with the characters. All of them were WEIRD! They had no depth and just came off as dumb and careless. I felt like Ethan Hawke's character was just narcissistic and obsessed with the fact that they had a nice home and lots of money. When his death rolled around, I truly didn't care. I had no feeling of sadness because they didn't write his character well enough that you were rooting for him and his family to live. Charlie was the most normal character, and I liked him. He seemed to be the only one with a sense of feeling, remorse, and what was right and wrong. Zoey was just a stereotypical dumb & ditzy teenage horror movie girl. Oblivious to what her boyfriend's intentions were when he snuck into her house to ""talk"" to her father. That part was SO predictable. I don't really know what to think about the mom, I didn't really like her, but I didn't think she was as bad as some of the other characters. Now let's talk about the stranger that wanted to kill the guy Charlie let into the house. Oh. My. Gosh. That was some terrible over-acting and terrible lines going on whenever he was on screen. And I'm not trying to be harsh, but it just wasn't good. OK, that's enough about the characters. Now for the script. The script had me shaking my head from the beginning of the movie to the end. It just wasn't written well. No backstory on any characters, and it didn't make you have any feelings toward them. And there were also a few scenes that the cinematography made me cringe. Sometimes it was way too close to their faces, sometimes I could barely tell what was going on. It wasn't all bad, but a few scenes were not shot good and I would have definitely changed some of the angles they shot. And the ending, oh my... The whole theater was laughing when Mary said ""lets end this night in peace"", or whatever she said. It was just plain stupid. It's almost like the writers ran out of idea's on how to end it and just said ""OH WELL!"" Even though this review sounds harsh, it wasn't an awful movie. It holds your attention throughout because you want to see what happens. And it didn't feel like it was dragging out the story. The masks were creepy and one of my favorite parts about the movie. It was an OK movie. I didn't hate it, but I did think it was pretty stupid at times. If you're interested in watching this, I'd say wait to rent it. Thank you for reading!"
"xDTrammell","3","1","3","8 June 2013"," They Should Have Called This A Comedy Movie.
","The idea for the this movie was a great idea but poorly executed. The movie took an hour of the movie to build up to any real action. The beginning was actually interesting then it just goes downhill from there. More people laughed in the theater than people actually getting scared. The ending was awful and it drew laughs to the entire audience. If they plan to make a sequel for this movie they should actually go more on the concept of what the beginning was about and the actual events in the city on the night of the purge instead of watching one family search for a guy the entire first half of the movie. Like I said the concept was good but the way they directed the movie was just painful to watch the hour and 25 minutes felt more like 2 hours while just waiting for the ending to come."
"Al_The_Strange","5","1","3","8 June 2013"," ""Release the beast, boys! Let the killing commence!""
","This film has a wicked and interesting premise that initially lured me in: in the near-future, the government allows a single night for everybody to go nuts and commit any crime they desire...including murder. All emergency services are shut down, and the US becomes a massive free-for-all of mayhem, destruction, and bloodshed.<br/><br/>Alas, the film never really shows that much mayhem, destruction, and bloodshed. With its focus solely on a single family trying to survive the night, the film limits itself, and it takes its sweet time getting to the climax, where all the real terror and action takes place. For the most part, the film purposefully moves at a turtle's pace, relying solely on the threat of intruders to maintain any interest. For this movie, however, I would have probably been more interested and more moved if it had greater intensity and relentlessness; as it is, the film came off as being rather dull.<br/><br/>It's the story that disappointed me the most, however. The premise is the stuff that dystopian sci-fi dreams are made of, but The Purge is no A Clockwork Orange, no matter how hard it tries. The movie digs up some interesting sociological and psychological reasoning for its premise, and the implications can be staggering. They can be, that is, but in the film, such themes never materialize into any tangible form.<br/><br/>Nope, at best, the film is a pure home-invasion thriller. It's populated with average characters, some of whom make really stupid decisions for the sake of driving the plot forward. The film tries to boldly assert that the human spirit and moral goodness are things worth fighting and dying for, but thanks to this direction, the characters wind up making even more dumb decisions. By the film's end, I don't think I really cared who lived or who died. The plot is dulled further with far too frequent use of Deus Ex Machina: that is, too many instances where characters are randomly saved by other characters or events. That ultimately brings me to a myriad of lesser nitpicks: the house is apparently so huge that people get lost and pop in and out of the scenes whenever they feel like it; these people should have invested in more firepower; the whole situation seems incredulous; and so on...<br/><br/>As a film, it's pretty standard thriller fare, with jittery camera work throughout the more exciting scenes, along with dark and bland lighting and color schemes. Acting is not bad: Ethan Hawke and Leena Heady provide the most sensible performances, while the kid actors do their best to be plausibly dumb. I think the biggest standouts will be the villains, with Rhys Wakefield as the head bad guy, for they are genuinely creepy. Writing is okay, but more detail, exposition, and better plotting would have worked wonders. This production uses very spartan sets, props, and costumes, and they get the job done. Whatever music the film uses is utterly forgettable.<br/><br/>This film is promising, and the main idea could have been hammered out into something ingenious. As a dystopian sci-fi story, however, the film fails to resonate; it's more at home among other slashers and thrillers, but it's still somewhat mundane. There are far better movies out there in either field.<br/><br/>2.5/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Poor | Film: Marginal)"
"user-704-474751","4","1","3","6 June 2013"," Some good/bad aspects
","As I only just watched this film I felt the need to give it an immediate review. I'll start with the main narrative. I feel as if the writers could have written a much better plot to the story, perhaps should have filmed it from different scenarios instead of just one rich mans home. <br/><br/>As well as this I felt the actors for this could have been a lot better, and as well as for the kids. It seemed totally unrealistic (I know the subplot is unrealistic) but the stupid child 'Charlie' had such a Sh*t personality it actually made me want to hunt him down. Maybe this was intended to be the oppositional reading. <br/><br/>I feel as if the antagonist roles were played brilliantly, the creepy face/f**cked up persona gave it the perfect role for the antagonist, although some of the fellow minions of there purge seemed stupid as hell and feel as if the directors tried to milk it a bit by using the masks, all in all it did give a scary feel.<br/><br/>Like I say I do feel as if this film may vary for different audiences due to the 'scare' factor, and how it sort of mixed genres with the 'satire & dystopia' felt movie. All in all I'd say it was an average watch and perhaps see for yourself."

It feels like the psychology behind this is sooooo weak and thin. <br/><br/>If the actors were amazing and the cinematography were stunning, this movie still would not reach a high rating.

"tadpole-596-918256","8","1","4","21 July 2013"," A blue-print for the post-Obama era:
","Though some viewers may think that THE PURGE is racist just because 12 cackling and chortling white ""purgers"" are trying to legally ""execute"" (their word) the only black male among the 30 folks in the cast of this flick, most likely the talent agents for THE PURGE were unable to find anyone other than Edwin Hodge suited to convincingly play a homeless war veteran. Where the filmmakers perhaps take a wrong turn is in suggesting that hordes of middle class white people would WANT to get slaughtered by a 12-1 ratio through attacking able-bodied war vets, just for the sake of conducting a little Tea Party-style ethnic cleansing (as it's one thing to purge the eligible voter roles of such military heroes as the states of Florida and Pennsylvania did during the last election, and quite another to risk life and limb with no government cop enforcers to back one up). If the rules for THE PURGE actually WERE in effect as depicted in the movie, at least half of middle class whites would make themselves instant widowers along the lines of all those Peterson guys, and the other half of white adults would be killed off by their daughter's boyfriends (as ALMOST happens at the beginning of THE PURGE). The streets would be EMPTY; no one would be running for their lives; ALL the killing would be taking place among the family units (and don't think certain ""god-fearing"" people would be exempt; the Lifetime Channel runs ""based on actual events"" movies about pastor's wives killing their husbands every other week, and THE PURGE rules are not even in effect yet!)."
"will51224","8","1","4","19 July 2013"," Original plot could've been explored further, but it still gets the job done
","The year is 2022 and America has evolved into a nation that has an unemployment rate of just one percent, and crime is at an unprecedented low. This is mainly due to the New Founding Fathers' implementation of the annual purge, a twelve-hour period in which all crime, including murder, is legal and emergency services are suspended. This chaos that is created once a year is the perfect outlet to get all of the citizens' anger and frustration out of their systems before it builds up, right? The mayhem that is caused during that one night is worth the near-utopian society that it produces for the other 364 days of the year, right? All the disruption and all the lives lost are justified, considering all of the good that the free-for-all causesright? On this particular night of purging, wealthy salesman James Sandin, played by the unappreciated Ethan Hawke, plans on waiting the night of uncontrolled violence out with his wife Mary (Lena Headey) and their two kids Zoey and Charlie in their solidly sealed home. James made his fortune selling security systems that are specifically designed for protection during the purge. A good portion of James' sales have been to the members of their neighborhood, and one of their neighbors lets Mary know that they all have been gossiping about them.<br/><br/>All seems to be going as peacefully as planned until Charlie notices a ""Bloody Stranger,"" as he's referred to in the credits, begging for someone to let him in. Charlie punches in the security code and allows the badly battered stranger to slide inside just in time before James and Mary can stop him. Soon after, a group of masked ""purgers"" show up and their ""Polite Leader"" (Rhys Wakefield) unmasks himself to reveal that if the Sandins don't release the stranger to them alive, they will bring their hardcore tools to break in and slaughter them all.<br/><br/>The interesting concept is what drew me in, as it was a relief to see an idea that had never been done before, at least not in a mainstream movie. I agree with many critics who have said that more could've been done to expand on the plot, and it fell victim to many clichés of a standard home invasion film, a la The Strangers. In some ways it reminded me of The Happening, where an original idea was wasted by not exploring the unique plot further. However, while the execution of The Happening was horrid, The Purge compensates for its clichés with solid performances, especially from Hawke and the creepy as hell Wakefield, as well as some plot twists you'd never see coming. I give the movie credit for having the balls to go places that other films wouldn't dare go.<br/><br/>Another plus is that aside from some of Charlie's gadgets and the extravagant security system, the filmmakers didn't try too hard to sell the setting as being in the future. I'm glad they decided not to go overboard with futuristic technology because, especially for a thriller like this, it would've been distracting and taken away from the terror that the family was enduring. Nine years from now is not too far into the future, and I can't imagine things will look significantly different by then, considering that things haven't changed much since 2004.<br/><br/>One aspect that the filmmakers should have dove deeper into was its political commentary on how our society thinks of poor people as being worthless and expendable. They suffer the most during the purge because they can't afford the high-tech security systems. It's hinted that the murders of poor and/or homeless people, such as the stranger in the film, are what caused the unemployment rate to plummet, and the purge was created for the purpose of improving the economy by eliminating those who are considered to be unworthy of taking jobs from the middle and upper classes.<br/><br/>Despite mixed reviews, The Purge made $16.8 million on its first day at the domestic box office, more than five times its $3 million budget, and landed at number one with $34 million for its opening weekend. Due to its financial success, a sequel is already in the works. I can honestly say that I'm looking forward to a sequel because it could potentially explore other aspects of the purge and show how other people deal with it, as well as address any unanswered questions and fill any plot holes that the otherwise well-made first film left."
"Rendianami","5","1","4","19 July 2013"," A bit bland
","With a concept like this, you could go above and beyond in the plot. This movie reminds me a lot of Skyline, which consisted of people running around in a house for the entirety of the movie. Now, I can't say I may have expected something better, or even imagined anything that would be better, as I haven't really thought about what one may do in twelve hours of freedom.<br/><br/>If it were to be an annual event in real life, I would have been terrified to death of the concept. I can't imagine why any sane person in the movie wouldn't be at least a bit fearful of the events to come. It's unsettling how calm they are; they put too much faith into security, and that's what really hurt my interest. <br/><br/>Events were pretty predictable, but the movie wasn't exciting enough to watch more than once. I can't say I could come up with anything better (rather, I'd show a different scenario), but then again, you can only come up with so much for a two hour span movie."

It has a great build up and even if you choose not to think to deeply into the message it tries to communicate(the real important things in life)it does entertains you(especially if you like horror) after all that is the point of a movie isn't it?

The unique idea of this movie is the only positive point, but that is completely overshadowed by the terrible execution. <br/><br/>If you're happy to watch a unrealistic movie that turns a decent plot idea, into a boring, lack-luster movie, then give 'The Purge' a go, but I'd advise you to pick something else to watch."

There are some things that I would personally change, and the actions of some of the characters will make you bang your head against the wall, but it does what thriller/horror movies should make you do which is to ultimately speculate.<br/><br/>If you have 85 minutes to kill and want to see a film that is as original of a concept as you'll see in this world today, it's definitely worth it.<br/><br/>If you are somebody who feels the need to critique every single second of every film you watch, you simply won't enjoy it.<br/><br/>Remember, this is a thriller/horror movie.

The movie is set in the year 2022 when crime is at an all time low and the economy is doing very well, all thanks to 'The Purge', an annual one-night-only ""legal"" crime spree which happens in March each year. Everything from petty theft to first degree murder is allowed between the hours of 7pm until 7am to help the population ""regulate"" itself. This is where the Sandin family come into the fray, as James Sandin (Ethan Hawke) has made a lot of money from selling security systems to help people protect themselves on this one night every year from becoming victims of 'The Purge'. But on this particular night, things don't go as they had planned. I liked the premise of this movie, although it probably could never really work, and I liked how this film had me intrigued in what was happening. Some of the characters had me annoyed, but that was because they were obviously meant to have that affect as in the context of the film it becomes apparent to why you feel that way - it all works out in the end. Now some people didn't like this movie (as I read some reviews that said so), but I really liked this film. Gritty, engaging, compelling, and much better than another film called 'TRESPASS' which starred Nicolas Cage and Nicole Kidman, which this movie reminded me of in some ways. I recommend this film.

Ethan Hawke is good as the devoted father, who just wants to save his family, no matter what the cost. But all the actors give good performances, from the kids to the strange neighbors, to the black guy who is on the run and trying to escape with his life.<br/><br/>There are some nice and suspenseful scenes with a building tension, and no cheap scares. I really liked the ending as well, with its neat twist. This is much more of a thriller than a horror, but does have some fairly graphic scenes of violence, so that is something to keep in mind.

","I bothers me that you would think in this movie that the government would actually think it would keep the crime down with a purge like that. Legalizing crime for 12 hours a year. That is the dumbest thing any one could think of. That is like starting an Apocalypse. To me that reason for doing the purge is not cleansing the earth, its causing the earth to collapse in crime all at once, once a year for 12 hours. 12 hours the authorities are on break or vacation while people are killing and murdering others, and doing all manners of crime.<br/><br/>I can understand that this is a movie, and it would never happen or will it. Will the government actually get an idea from this movie and do it? I would rather end my own life, before they ever do something as stupid as this. I give this a 7 out of 10, because of the stupid concept, that kind of ruined the movie as a horror movie. So now there will be a sequel of the next years purge. I don't know who actually came up with this story, but it is awful story line for a horror. Sinister is better than this. Terrible reviews that are saying this is the worst.<br/><br/>I did not like the concept they came up with, but it was a good watch. I will watch anything that has a lot of action. It is just that idea sounds stupid. That people actually think its a good concept or say it is, is going to give the government more stupid ideas to actually do this. I hope they don't, because we won't last long if this actually happens. Each year with this going on would make only last a few years of this world being here. That is a lot of killing, and I don't see how that much killing could cleanse the earth. Must be Jehovah Witnesses that believe only 144,000 will be saved, that come up with this story. Kill everyone so only that many is left. <br/><br/>How can they say that 144,000 will be saved, when they got billions of members? That right there just contradicts their religion. They must of been drunk when creating the religion. If they do a purge at all it should be the end of the world purge. All out kill each other until we are all dead. No one lives. Not one soul. The only way to do it is just gas the whole earth. Massive poisonous gas released, and movie is just people trying to stop it from happening. That would be better.<br/><br/>See this would be a great concept and horror movie: <br/><br/>Very big and tall business building with lots of people working. Seems like a normal day at work, and everything getting done. A very new security system of the future is installed. It some how gets hacked from the outside and is on lock down, but some of those people that hacked it planned on having hundreds of people that work with them are kept inside, and are there to murder, rape, and kill anyone that is in the building, even if they kill their own people that are in there. That would be one massive killing spree of horror. All out count the bodies as the go great horror movie. To bad we can't get something like that.<br/><br/>The only problem with this movie the purge is that it was only all about the family. Did not really give us the full concept of the world doing it. You just have to imagine it happening else where, which is lame. People that say gore should not be in horror movie is lame. Gore is part of horror, and when you take it out, then the movie is lame. If the movie is lame, then the people that like it and rate it high is lame. They can't handle much if they can't handle the gore.<br/><br/>Tired of the PG-13 horror is better than the rated R and unrated horror. They aren't and never will be, because we the people that are true horror fans of horror can enjoy and handle it. The ones that can't are either anyone under 18 or adults that are just babies, and just put their heads between their legs and cry. So sick of people defending the PG-13 horror movies. They are pretty much just light versions of true horror, that should be called Thrillers in the first place, because thrillers are actually scarier than the PG-13 horror. Cheap thrills from PG-13 horror.<br/><br/>Get a clue directors of horror. Get the real horror. True life of this world is horror. Seeing is believing. The real stuff is what scares people and PG-13 stuff is just more fake, than any rated R or unrated horror. Anything from the 80's horror stuff is better than today's horror movies. They need to come out with originals not remakes or reboots. Sorry, if this is long, but I need to make it long to get rid of all these terrible reviews. People have no idea what bad is until they seen a PG-13 horror movie.<br/><br/>To end this, horror is for fun, and gore just helps that fun."

","This movie was very short and the plot was do dumb. One day of the year where there are no laws and people can do ANY crime they want with no consequences by the law? Just so people can take their anger and frustration out? That is retarded.<br/><br/>The first 25 minutes of the film were a little interesting but after that, it just got dumb.<br/><br/>EVERYTHING in this movie happened because that little boy let that black guy in the house, and what was that black guy's name? They did not mention his name at all. A nameless character who is actually important to the story. Wow. Ethan Hawke's character was also stupid. Instead of handing over the black guy, Ethan Hawke wanted to fight back. Was he retarded? Those maniacs outside of his house were ARMED. If he just gave them the black guy, those maniacs would had just left Ethan Hawke and his family alone. I seriously did not understand why he wanted to fight back. Oh and Ethan Hawke's character died later on because he didn't want to let the maniacs to have the black guy. And why did those maniacs with the masks want that black guy specifically? Why was that black guy so special to those mask-wearing freaks? Lena Headey was pretty hot in this movie, she was a real MILF, but when 2 of the killers were on her and tried to kill her, 2 other people showed up and decided to save her by shooting those 2 mask-wearing purgers. None of their blood got on Lena Headey's character. Are you kidding me? 2 people got shot right next to her and none of their blood got on Lena Headey. That was just dumb.<br/><br/>It turned out all of the people who saved Lena Headey and her family were her neighbors and they eventually became the antagonists and wanted to kill the family themselves. When Lena Headey asked the blonde lady why they were trying to kill her, the blonde lady said they all wanted to kill Lena Headey and her family just because they were cocky and thought they were better than other people. Like seriously, you're going to kill someone just because of that dumbass reason? Then the black guy decided to show up and become the hero of the day! Speaking of that black guy, where was he? What was he doing while people were getting killed? Was he hiding or something? That black guy got stabbed in the stomach a couple hours earlier and you're telling me he can just walk like nothing happened to him? After the Purge was over and everyone who tried to kill Lena Headey and her family just left the house, the family acted like they completely forgot the fact that their DAD JUST DIED. Like seriously, Ethan Hawke's character was dead for a while and the family acted like they didn't give a sh!t.<br/><br/>Hopefully, Anarchy will be better than this stupid ass movie."

","Good idea, good execution. I really don't get the bad ratings, who probably thought the sequels/series were better. I didn't. The thing I liked the most about this one, was the fact that the characters weren't straight out of a video game. They were human. The « good guys » I mean. In all this chaos, most characters managed to stay reasonable, and those who weren't, payed for it. And it was refreshing compared to most 2010s horror movies indulging in their lowest instincts. Ironically, this movie about letting people do immoral things for 12 hours, without any legal repercussions, had morals and a very satisfying ending. And the fact that it was a home invasion movie, following the struggle of a certain family, in this particular night. Rather than a faux documentary about a group of people who decided to kill or be killed, when they ended up on the streets, like the sequels. Was for the better I thought. I probably won't rewatch this any time soon, but I sure had a good time watching it."

","As the trailer shows: This movie takes what is in your mind as far as the worst possible horror scenario and puts it to the screen. ""What if breaking all the 'thou shalt not commandments' ranging from robbery to rape to torture and murder were all legal for one time period? What's the scariest time? Nighttime, of course. And, let's take it one step further. What if all emergency assistance and medical help was also suspended for that night? But let's take it a bit further... what if acting on these horrible behaviors was not only legal but it was ACTUALLY YOUR CIVIC DUTY?"" What would happen then? Would innocents die? Would the population greatly decrease? Would people be permanently disfigured? Psychologically harmed forever? Do people actually STOP cold when those Purge Sirens sound again to alert it's all over? Maybe...and maybe not. I think you will just have to watch the movie to find out. That is what the trailer tells you to do so I did it. I was surprised at the twists and turns. Without giving away any of this story's actual plot, it circles around a family as the trailer shows. It's extremely well acted and the characters are well rounded and you're quickly gripped and dragged in. It isn't a movie you can watch without stopping, getting up and regrouping, mentally. Trust me, I had to stop and mentally regroup a few times to finish this. But, it's worth it. I think that's how you can tell a good psychological thriller from a bad one."

"Koma-Mo","4","0","1","30 August 2019"," A good premise with lackluster presentation.
","The film does have an interesting premise that would have been better utilized if it was as a social commentary, but instead, this film is a generic thriller that doesn't go through with what they have introduced in the beginning and delivered a film that was more of a snore than a thrill. The film doesn't do anything with this concept and fails to have us see and develop our own opinion toward this one night event of murder. Instead, we are given dialogue and exposition to know how successful it is.<br/><br/>What would have made this film better was to allow us to get to know the characters a little more by having them react to this event and to see their perspectives of this night. By doing this, we get to connect with them more and to feel for them when things get out of hand later on. What we are treated with instead is a plot of literally nothing going on until the last 20 minutes of the film. I did, however, enjoy a few aspects of the film, such as the climax and how they ended it, but until then, nothing really happens in this film. There are no conversations or conflicts between the characters about killing people, there is nothing at stake and most of all, these people are not interesting.<br/><br/>The film follows a typical trope and doesn't do anything new and exciting to allow people to be invested in it. When things get out of hand, that is where the film does deliver the fun aspect, although the execution was a bit sloppy. There is a bunch of nothing happening here and it's sad to see that despite what they have here, the director didn't do anything with it. Also, the film fails to give a proper explanation toward how and why something happened. Everything happens in order for the plot to progress and because there is no proper explanation, it just feels lazy and further deepens my disinterest toward the film. Even when the characters are faced with a certain dilemma, they either do nothing with it or is quickly resolved in a second without any sort of explanation to why people made the decisions they made.<br/><br/>Each character follows the annoying trope of doing something stupid, even to the point of having one character disappear throughout the movie and just being a waste of presence until this character does something heroic at the end. It's sad as none of the characters stand out, despite having two great lead actors. I did like Rhys Wakefiled, who plays the absurdly psychotic character. He added a strong presence based on his performance and he made it a bit interesting to watch.<br/><br/>Due to the lack of excitement, logic and a properly structured story, I felt that this film failed to be something memorable, despite having a few good scenes here and there."
"J_Batek_II","7","0","1","22 August 2019"," Philosophical Horror. Low Budget Brilliance Exploits Timely Income Disparity To Create Authentic Fear.
","I first saw this movie advertised in a pile of DVD's in the power aisle in front of the electronics department, as I held my breath and tried to escape a WalMart one afternoon. My first impression - probably another ****** low budget horror film that scored a PG-13 rating and got to hang a sign in 1000 WalMart locations for a couple of weeks. As the years went on, I saw more Purge ads for more films. I saw them on Netflix. I saw trailers for sequels on television and on YouTube. 'The Purge' seemed to be everywhere. It took me 5 years to finally watch the first film. Although I knew it wasn't a great movie, I became obsessed with the theme and quickly devoured the rest of the films and the season of television. So, what is it, exactly, that makes all of those WalMart customers and I so crazy for these movies?<br/><br/>'The Purge' series is 'Thinking Man's Horror', or 'Philosophical Horror'. We live in an era of political extremism, cultural intolerance, and income disparity. Our government admits that it drastically underestimates the true unemployment rate, by excluding entire groups of the population and placing a time limit on how long a person can look for work before they disappear from the government reported ""total available workforce"". So, if you happen to find yourself on the bottom end of any of these themes, or if you happen to be a member of a group that has been targeted by right-wing extremist politics, then you might find this future scenario quite possible.<br/><br/>'The Purge' series creates an almost universal appeal by leading each viewer to consider their own Purge behavior.<br/><br/>Would you go out and commit crimes on Purge Night?<br/><br/>Would you steal?<br/><br/>If so, what would you steal?<br/><br/>Would you do something worse than stealing?<br/><br/>Would you purge?<br/><br/>Would you purge someone you know?<br/><br/>If so, then 'The Purge' becomes more about criminal fantasy than political commentary. Tales of revenge are as old as the film industry, and they are ubiquitous. Most people have lottery fantasies, about what they would acquire if they suddenly didn't have to work for anything. My thoughts on my own personal Purge behavior have evolved over time. I have had discussions with many people that spoke passionately about their ""Purge Fantasies"", and they all seem to have put a great deal of thought into the subject... WAY more thought than most low budget horror films are able to inspire.<br/><br/>This isn't a perfect horror film. More people would use Purge Night to rape and pillage than to murder, and no theft or sexual crimes were depicted (or even implied) in the film. Boooo. Rule #1 in low budget horror - Nudity Is Necessary. Shame on you, Cersei Lannister... Shame.<br/><br/>This film is another example of how I was wrong to have prejudged a movie based on marketing.

"ysalinepicard","7","0","1","18 August 2019"," Good but not perfect
","First of all, If you're not a big fan of horror movies like me, you can watch the purge, it's not very scary nor gory, it is just supposed to be nerve-wracking. I'm not saying it's not but it could be better. I think if it was a little longer, the movie would've had the time to set the scene better and to introduce us more to the characters in order for us to connect with them, which is not the case here. The problem if you don't care for the characters in a movie in wich they suffer, is that you don't, and so it is kinda pointless. Furthermore, everything is happening too fast so you don't even have the time to fear the threat.
What a shame for such a good idea of concept which in itself is very interesting and scary, I would'nt like to live in a society which allows this kind of brutality even tough it's just one day in a year.
But finally, I couldn't say I hate this movie or that it is bad on all points because it did scare me a few times and it was dealing well with fear. There was no big mistake for me.
To put in a nutshell, it could have been a great movie if it lasted 2 hours or more."

","I found this uninvolving. I was unconvinced by Ethan Hawke's performance and matters are made worse when, after initially being presented as a prat, we are supposedly swing around and cheer him as hero. The whole idea is rather silly and although I really liked the background news bulletins, they did not take away from that notion. Interestingly 'un-American' in tone and reminded me a little of the class war elements in Brian Yuzna's Society (1989). This is a much more modest affair, however, and one of its strong points is that it is not over long. Rhys Wakefield intrigued as the 'polite leader' but is really just one more example of the US notion that a 'true Brit' is a sign of a really bad person. I believe the guy is actually Australian but he certainly plays the part here as if some obnoxious English public schoolboy. Not a terrible film and I will watch the follow up (claimed by some to be an improvement) for although there is much to not like here, it is effectively put together and not afraid to ask difficult questions."

","The Purge involves a pretty inventive idea which could spark various excuses for some horror or thriller plot lines. Despite political arguments, for innovation, the purge receives 5 stars. However where it goes wrong is going down the typical lockdown in a house, in darkness with a family to protect against masked lunatics. Its been done over, to couple it with this superb idea is madness. After a strong start it dwindles out to an average jump out of nowhere fest. There is a bout of pure violence which was enjoyable however it became a little cheap and the ending felt too improper after all that had happened. It built some decent tension through the chilling idea backing it however it turned out as an average horror movie.

The mob tells the family they must return their escaped victim alive or else they will kill him and the entire family. Okay well there's your story for this film. I was expecting a ton of chaos, blood on the streets and a bunch of riots. But nope we never see that in this one. If that's the kind of horror action you're looking for then I recommend it's sequels, The Purge: Anarchy and The Purge: Election Year.<br/><br/>Now for the positive review on this film I actually did find it to be quite suspenseful at certain scenes. The violence was pretty solid as well as the bloody scenes.<br/><br/>Now do I recommend this to horror fans? Yeah sure I'd say go ahead and watch it at least once or maybe twice.

","Never has an idea, particularly in the current modern age, such as an annual purge been so relevant. Rise in gun crimes, murders, robberies and all round destructive behaviour has granted us viewers with a politically charged tactic to eradicate crime for the rest of the year. 12 hours of pure carnage where the public's inner anger and hatred is unleashed. So why are we just watching a family protect their home and run around in the dark for an hour and a half? What a waste of potential! With such an intriguing premise to then only showcase a home invasion thriller was wastage of the highest order. Nuclear waste! The script writers need to be purged for not exploring this enthralling concept. However, as a home invasion thriller it is just fine. Hawke and Headey bring in some much needed star quality with the former always dependable in committing himself to the performance. A few thrills are maintained with some intriguing directing techniques, such as utilising a horrifically half-charred doll as a remote control camera. The antagonistic purgers harnessed a sense of civilisation balanced out with absurd insanity, a synecdoche of society if you will. The pacing was well structured with a surprising ending that certainly wasn't underwhelming by any means. Just...the whole film was underwhelming instead. Filled with stupid character choices, particularly from the children, that represent convenient plot devices in order to make a thriller. Oh and the boyfriend...don't get me started on him. What a stupid decision to make, how was that going to benefit him in anyway!? No political stimulation or mental thought-provoking themes, just a family protecting themselves which we have seen far too often in similar films. Some may prefer a reduced scale thriller like this, but for such an interesting idea I wanted far more exploration.

"a_chinn","8","0","1","5 March 2018"," Great set-up becomes a routine (although very well done) siege film
","Writer/Director James DeMonaco provides a dynamite set-up with the opening title card that reads, ""America. 2022. Unemployment is at 1%. Crime is at an all-time low. Violence barely exists. with one exception..."" That exception is The Purge. A government sanctioned annual 12-hour period in where all criminal activity, including murder, becomes legal. It's an insane premise that's ripe for unhinged Devil's Night mayhem along with all sorts of possibilities for commentary on society, politics, economics, ethics, and human nature. What's disappointing is that doesn't explore it's thematic potential and is instead a fairly routine siege film. The story follows wealthy home security salesman Ethan Hawke and this family on Purge Day, hunkering down when they find themselves the target of a well armed group trying to get in. There are some thematic nods regarding the economics of the haves and have-nots, but it never really goes all that deep. Despite my disappointment in terms of unexplored thematic potential, ""The Purge"" is a well done exciting and suspenseful siege film. It's not up to John Carpenter ""Assault on Precinct 13"" standards, but it's leaps an bounds better than Bruce Willis' ""Hostage"" or WWE's ""The Day."" The film also benefits from a stronger than average cast for a genre film, which besides Hawke also features Lena Headey as his wife. Rhys Wakefield, who was previously unknown to me, is also very memorable as the ""Polite Leader"" of the group trying to get inside their home to murder a homeless man their young son has given shelter to. And one bit of film geek casting that had me giddy was the casting of character actor Chirs Mulkey as one of Hawke's neighbors. Given the film's modest budget, it understandably couldn't have had the scale that the story premise could have lent itself to. According to IMDB, writer/director DeMonaco said that if he ever got a chance to do a second film, it would be more like ""Escape from New York."" He's since made two sequels and a fourth is in the works, so I can only hope that the sequels are worthy that build up (I'm actually very excited to watch the sequels now). Overall, even though the film's subtext is left largely left unexplored and the siege elements of the film were very familiar, the strong cast, the unique story premise, and DeMonaco's tight, suspenseful direction make ""The Purge"" a real winner for genre fans."

"rodjohaness","7","0","2","7 October 2016"," Cheap thrills the movie
","The Purge follows the story of the Sandin family and their overnight lockdown shenanigans during the 2022 Purge. The Purge is an annual event (in this fictional universe) across the USA in which all criminal activity is legal, which the movie sort of sums up to basically 'you can kill anyone you want without any legal consequences'. There's also no police and no health services available until the purge is over, so basically people are left to die for sure. The Sandins have a top notch security system at home so they should be fine, but suddenly things go awry when 2 intruders enter their home. Can they survive the night?<br/><br/>So first, why the need for this? According to the little info bits here and there, this allows people to reshape society in their own hands, by basically getting rid of people that are the ""non- contributors"". Or, at least that's the intended political purpose for many. Ultimately each person would tackle the event to their own benefit. It is often mentioned that it is the one night everyone gets to release all their anger, which implies that there's more peace for the rest of the year. Also, this allows the more dominant groups get rid of the weaker groups, which supposedly helps improve the economy and lower crime rate, among other good things that make the country better.<br/><br/>Yeah... I don't know. I mean it's a very ridiculous concept but also it's an intriguing one. I mean I suppose if you concentrate all crime to one day and not even count it as crime, then obviously crime will go down. And if a lot of poor people that can't afford security get killed, then obviously there will be more wealthy people left. But whatever, let's just go with it for now. <br/><br/>The movie was surely entertaining but I have one big problem with it: it just throws you into the action almost right away. There's very little backstory and character development, it literally just does a couple first scenes to tell you 'this is the main guy, this is his wife, this is the boyfriend of the daughter' etc. Since the concept of an annual purge in real life would be a very psychological mess, I was surprised they didn't bother to exploit that for the first half of the movie. By the time the more messed up things happen later, you have very little reason to care for anything. I kinda wish they made us relate more with the people so we actually cared for their survival.<br/><br/>With that said, while I wanted to hate the movie when it ended, I couldn't. In its overly extreme and borderline ridiculous premise, I got some enjoyment of the thing. The movie has the weirdest progression, but it does make you think and question how political ideas can affect and radicalize society. It is a potentially harsh concept that just wasn't used to it's better potential, but I suppose it is an OK non-scary popcorn thriller."

","The Purge - how excited I was after reading about you prior to your release. I loved the idea - an American where once a year for 12 hours there are no laws, allowing citizens the chance to ""purge"" themselves of any evil inside. I thought I'd be in for a zombie-like, apocalyptic movie only with breathing humans doing the killing en masse. It sounded terrifying. What I got instead was 85 minutes of a weird Ethan Hawke character defending his family inside his home. The film never leaves that stupid home. The whole concept is only a device used so that this ""home invasion"" film can continue on without the intervention of police. Because of this, the film actually ended up being LESS creative than even the most basic films of this genre. There was no unique room setup as in ""Panic Room"", nor was there the frightening ""why are you doing this"" dread as in ""The Strangers"". No, this movie turned out to be 85 minutes of Ethan Hawke fighting against a group of young, educated home invaders who have been given the freedom to perform their acts by the Purge holiday.<br/><br/>This movie stunk. The characters are totally unlikable, to the point where I just hoped they all got killed. <br/><br/>I gave this 3 stars mainly for the cinematography, which was good at times.

","Among many other things, I have a weakness for dystopian Sci- Fi/action movies, and I'm also the type of geek who likes to philosophy and discuss whether or not the dystopian perspectives could work for real. James DeMonaco's ""The Purge"" starts off with a killer – pun intended – premise: in the United States of the year 2022, not that far ahead of us in other words, all types of crime are legalized during a 12 hour period on the 22nd of March. During this so-called purge-night, hospital emergency services shut down, the police and fire departments don't respond to any calls and you can commit literally every horrendous crime – including rape or murder – without having to bear the consequences. According to the script the impact of the annual purge is enough to keep America crime-free for the rest of year, and it even stimulates economic growth and a decrease of unemployment rates! Interesting enough concept, but the skeptical geek in me seriously doubts that one wildcard-night is sufficient to compensate for 364 days of peace and welfare. Sour critics also proclaim that ""The Purge"" is a typical American movie because a very large share of the population is pro- war, in favor of possessing weapons and in favor of unlimited defense of own property. Okay, maybe this partially explains the film's gigantic box-office success, but I don't want to rant about political undertones and, besides, the parody aspects are a lot more interesting. In a relatively short period of time, the infamous purge night turned into a kind of festive national holiday, like Halloween or Thanksgiving, and the people are joyously sharing their purging plans via radio shows or shamelessly sharpen their machetes in their front garden! The story centers on the wealthy Sandin family who are living in a fancy residential area in the suburbs. James Sandin got filthy rich selling hi-tech alarm systems and supports the purge, but he and his family nevertheless choose not to participate in the violence. When the eerie siren rings to announce the commencing of purge night, James hermetically seals off the house and plans to watch a movie with the kids. His dumb son Charlie ruins it for the whole family, though, as he opens the door for a hysterical man on the run for a bunch of frantic ""purgers"". Their leader then sets an ultimatum for the Sandins: hand over the stranger or everyone gets killed. In spite of its innovative premise and enormous possibilities, ""The Purge"" rather quickly turns into an ordinary slasher/vigilante thriller with nasty executions and lunatic characters. The masks of the attackers are inarguably horrifying, but the authentic ear-to-ear smile of leader of the pack when he looks straight into the intercom camera is conceivably even more disturbing! ""The Purge"" certainly isn't a great film or even a notable highlight in the genre, but it's at least entertaining and I wouldn't even mind watching the two sequels it already spawned in the meantime."

"nitzanhavoc","8","0","2","7 January 2016"," Profoundly original, terribly underrated
","Even though I had heard of this film around the time of its debut, I only got around to actually watching it now. My main conclusion is that I should have watched it sooner, and the only slightly secondary conclusion is that (as always when Horror is considered) one must never rely on IMDb raters when choosing a film. At the time of this review, the film is rated 5.6, which is no less than an atrocity of justice in my opinion as a devout Horror fan.<br/><br/>Like many other Horror titles, the strongest and best aspect of The Purge is the story. In an alternate reality, the US has been able to make unemployment, crime and violence almost extinct, thanks to a new ""national holiday"" known as The Purge, which takes place annually on the night of March 21st. During that night, for 12 hours, any and all crimes (with the main focus given to murder) are decriminalized, in order to allow Americans to ""purge"" themselves of hatred, anger and violence by committing heinous acts against their fellow citizens.<br/><br/>It's no coincidence that I've chosen to describe March 21st as a ""national holiday"", as the film presents it as nothing less: there's a special holiday greeting (""safe night!""), special television broadcasts, and everyday conversations referring to a night of violence and murder as any other mundane annual traditional celebration. Purging is not just a custom, it's a civil right no different than the first and second amendments. The reality presented is original and groundbreaking, offering philosophical moral dilemmas (the individual vs. the collective) for the audience to debate amongst itself throughout the film.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the Sandin family, with whom the first connection to The Purge is established as the father is a successful salesman of home security systems (used mainly to defend families locking themselves indoors to survive The Purge). Ethan Hawke is, I must say, less than impressive and not the best casting choice for the part. The plot thickens when the family's youngest son (a lot of unfulfilled potential shown by young actor Max Burkholder) notices a man crying for help on the screen showing live feed from the security camera, and decides to unlock the doors and let him in. Soon after, a group of experienced revelers arrive at the Sandins' door and demand that they turn in the man, lest they break into the house and exercise their right to purge on the entire family. Rhys Wakefield demonstrates profound and unparalleled acting skills as the leader of the group, with facial expressions, body language and diction that run chills through the viewers.<br/><br/>What is the ""right"" thing to do? Should a father sacrifice a stranger in order to save his family? Is something morally allowed just because it is legalized? These questions are only some of the thinking process beautifully forced on the audience of The Purge. As a Horror feature, it is mediocre at best, and in my opinion fails to replicate the thrilling tension bar set by other titles such as The Strangers. However, combined with the ethical dilemmas and the original story, The Purge offers an excellent viewing experience which I would highly recommend to anyone (even non-Horror fans). I was going to rate it a well earnt 7, but seeing as how other reviewers have made it so annoyingly underrated - I chose to give it an 8, in a futile attempt to salvage some justice."

Unfortunately, the main villain of the film (played by Rhys Wakefield) tries way too hard to channel the ghost of Heath Ledger in his creepily polite and occasionally eruptive psychopath role, and I feel like I'm watching the guy who came top in his class in GCSE drama but didn't feel the need to get any better.<br/><br/>One of the criticisms levelled at this film is that the writers have been rather superficial in dealing with the socio-economic problems brought up by the concept (some people can afford to defend themselves better than others, for example), but then if they had spent more time on that it would have been a totally different film. This is, after all, a silly horror/action/sci-fi flick.<br/><br/>Blumhouse have developed a reputation for producing films that are sometimes excellent, sometimes OK, but always worth a look. This is a pretty good one, and it's definitely worth a look. I think if we'd seen this marketed as a thriller rather than a horror, it would have gone down better<br/><br/>Verdict: flawed but fun!<br/><br/>yetanotherfilmreviewblog.tumblr.com"

","The idea is good, but it's resemblant of Battle Royale, Hunger Games and other breakdown-of-society sociopathic style films. So it's not exactly original, but it carries the same sense of dread and unease, the feeling of a loss of safety.<br/><br/>I gave it 5 out of 10 because it's really not below average. Some of the action, tension, and underlying conflict is very good, and Ethan Hawke does a siege really well, Precinct 13 and the Purge are good films from that standpoint. The purge characters are unique and sinister almost in a Clockwork Orange kind of way. It's a very different film, it can be quite eccentric.<br/><br/>The biggest dropping points are the kids, their acting is pretty terrible, they don't act like human beings at times. In general the film lacks a great push or edge to it, it can feel a bit boring and the pace feels slow too.<br/><br/>If you're the type of person who's really good at getting past silly things then you'll be able to get through it and probably enjoy it. My own level is an enjoyment of Star Wars Episode 1 in spite of the presence of Jar Jar. This film was harder to watch than Episode 1. I'd definitely recommend the sequel though, it fixes a lot of the issues with this film"
"hnt_dnl","9","0","1","31 May 2015"," Underrated social commentary
","Having seen THE PURGE (2013) several times, I've come to the conclusion that it's an unfairly maligned, underrated, socially conscious film. Not just another run-of-the-mill suspense thriller, 'The Purge' actually makes some persuasive statements and arguments for and against the fictional annual national ""cleansing"".<br/><br/>Highlighting the film is James Sandin (superbly played by strong veteran actor Ethan Hawke), a prominent corporate employee of the security firm that provides the protection systems for he and his neighbors. These systems are needed for the recently enacted annual U.S. 'Purge', a 12-hour period of cleansing where citizens are allowed to commit virtually any crime they want against virtually anyone they please. Only high-ranking government officials (the ones who came up with the idea, the irony) are immune for the criminal activity. <br/><br/>Sandin's family includes his wife Mary (excellently played by the reliable Lena Headey) and two kids Zoey and Charlie (solid work by Adelaide Kane and Max Burkholder). The Sandins' strained family life is subtly displayed in the hours prior to the purge, as Zoey in particular is a rebellious type who against James' wishes is dating a boy quite older than her. Also, we meet the Sandins' neighbors, the main one being Grace (played in a pitch perfect performance by Arija Bareikis), the de facto hypocritical, nosy ""Gladys Kravitz"" of the neighborhood. The undercurrent of false community is subtly established early on.<br/><br/>And so the purge begins! The scene of the family silently watching the national broadcast of the start of the purge is very effective. Soon after it starts, a Stranger (brilliantly played by Edwin Hodge in a strong, silent role) runs through the neighborhood screaming for help, as Charlie de-activates the home security system to let him in, then all hell breaks loose! A psychotic young man, the Polite Leader (played to creepy perfection by Rhys Wakefield) trespasses on Sandin property imploring them to give over the Stranger to he and his crew of young purgers. There's a strong undercurrent of racism and targeting that permeates as the Stranger is a homeless, black man.<br/><br/>During the course of the battle of wills between the Sandins and the Purgers, strong social commentary shines through as the family has the moral dilemma whether to give over the Stranger to protect their home and family, yet by giving him over, they violate their moral beliefs in being humane people. The internal and external struggle among the family members, especially between James and Mary, really provides the heart of the film. The ending scenes are very powerful and by the end of it, a strong statement about the society we live in is made. Don't believe the haters. This one is much better than given credit for!"

The logical thing to do for the average middle class American would be to buy a plane ticket to Canada or Mexico the day before the purge and fly back afterwards . On second thoughts going to Mexico might a case of out of the frying pan in to the fryer but Canada would be a good bet . Just lock up your home with shutters and Canada here we come for a relaxed weekend . This however doesn't occur to the Sandin family or any of the other characters in the film . The Sandins are wholesome middle class middle America and are complete idiots .

","In the near future crime has fallen to an all-time low thanks to what is known as ""the purge"" - a yearly one-off 12-hour period where the government has allowed all types of crime to be committed without fear of consequence. James & Mary Sandin, along with their son, Charlie, and daughter, Zoey, are preparing themselves for the purge when Charlie let's a potential murder victim into their house for refuge. However, the group who have been chasing the stranger gives James an ultimatum - give them the stranger or face the consequences. Torn between the choice of protecting his family and morality, James has to decide what to do - and doesn't have much time to do it.<br/><br/>The Purge never had a really good write up by a lot of people but in all honesty I actually quite enjoyed it. It's nothing fantastic, but it delivers a good bit of tension & suspense with a couple of wee twists.<br/><br/>The idea of crime being down to only 1% is a fantastic thought, but the idea that the film puts forward on how to get that 1% is very contentious. I mean it makes you think - would you be OK with crime being at an all-time low if there was only one specified period of the year where all services are non-responsive within that time and crime is non-punishable? The film kind of raises those morality issues. But even if you don't want to get ""that deep"" into the movie, it's still good just to watch without too much thought.<br/><br/>The characterisation in The Purge I think is done pretty well too. Ethan Hawke does a good job as James Sandin, a well-off businessman but isn't arrogant about it. The ""strangers"" are annoying but they're meant to be with the leader being played well by Rhys Wakefield. You do find it quite hard drawing up any kind of sympathy for the Sandins' daughter, however, with her being the typical bratty 16/17-year-old.<br/><br/>Anyway, The Purge is a decent film to watch. It's not Oscar winning but it's not meant to be. Definitely worth a watch."

","The Purge is a terrifying theory, which was set up by the American's demented national government to allow all crime for one night. I paused the movie at the beginning thinking what if this was a real life scenario. I don't think I'd make it too long. Anyway, the cast is so-so, not a big Ethan Hawke fan but he was better than the majority. The movie was directed and written well, a tad predictable at parts but still held my interest. I loved how insane the criminals were, skipping , singing and laughing, truly bizarre and creepy. The most kick ass part of the Purge is definitely the last fifteen minutes of the movie. It's not a shocker of an ending but it was the right ending. Check out The Purge, definitely worth the time for a fan of horror movies."

Over all the film was basic I really like Rhys Wakefield and thought he played the part of the random purger really well!

","I'd rank this as a ""high-concept"" film that asks a question:if you could commit a crime without having to worry about getting caught, what would it be? The concept is that in the near future, America has a severe prison overcrowding problem, so, one night a year, all crime, including murder, with a few exceptions, is legal. Everyone, to keep safe, observes this with a ""lockdown"" at their house. (Can you really blame them?) Sociologists and Politicians thoroughly agree with the Purge. The action takes place at Ethan Hawke's house as he locks down, a stranger appears at his door and gets in, and gangs start ""purging.""

"koen_smit","8","0","1","19 August 2014"," The threat of the house invasion is much more interesting than the invasion itself. Well done.
","I am not so keen on home-invasion movies because most of the time it involves a lot of mental and physical torture. That is what withheld me from watching The Purge because I was expecting something like The Strangers. Today I have finally watched it and enjoyed it very much.<br/><br/>The set up is clear: everyone hurries home to lock up well for the annual Purge where (almost) all crimes are allowed, including murder. A 12 hour period for those who feel the need to kill of 'low-lives' or someone they hate or just for the sake of cleansing society from bad seeds James Sandin supports the Purge with his wife Mary and he made quite a living from it by selling security systems. Their daughter is hitting puberty hard and their young son doesn't understand why people would feel the need to murder another in the first place. They lock their home and after the sirens that start the Purge sounds, they are safe inside. At least they think, until the son lets a homeless man who seeks shelter, inside the house and a bunch of freaks come looking for their right to Purge by killing him.<br/><br/>It's not the most mind-blowing script with plot-twists that surprise you until the end. No, it's a genre movie (It's not a horror movie, it is more of a thriller) and what you expect you will get: scares, tension and fights till the death. But it's all put in a nice story where choices have to be made and twist change the position of the leads from victim to hero and back and forth. Those twists I definitely saw coming, but I didn't mind one moment because they were well executed. I liked the end where Mary decides to keep the peace until the Purge is over. Even though you want her to hurt the neighbors so badly, killing them would not be satisfying, because that would not fit her character. Finally she does give us a moment of cheer when the neighbor tries to grab her gun and Mary smashes her head on the table. I couldn't help myself shouting out a big YES and clap my hands. Just in time, cuz seconds later the sirens sound again and the Purge is over and she wouldn't have gotten away with it.<br/><br/>The main actors are good, well cast and stay true to their character. The built-up towards the end is well done, the tension inside the big dark house (because the freaks cut the power) where everyone loses sight of everyone is great and once the freaks enter they don't linger but ruthlessly go for the kill – that's what they are here for. The director easily could have stretched the invasion, but I'm happy he didn't. Well, he added some elements to make the threat towards the invasion much more interesting than the invasion itself. Well done.<br/><br/>Clearly, I thought this was a very enjoyable movie and Lena Headey is starting to become one of my favorite genre-actresses."

I liked the actors which is an important part because if you have horrible actors it makes it hard to watch the movie. The only thing I think the movie should have had was an alternate ending, so that the father would have survived instead of died. Also, I thought it was a little ironic that the guy they let in came to save them towards the end. which was good. I also thought where the mother hit the neighbor lady with the butt of the gun was pretty funny. I think the theme of the movie was based off of politics and pointed at them. All around I thought the movie was good."

","Let's face it... films are a divisive topic of conversation. I guarantee at least a hundred people will hate your favourite film (and vice versa). However, with 'The Purge' it seems that practically everyone can agree on one thing: the premise for this film is awesome! Set in the near future, America now has an annual twelve hour period where ALL crime is legal (and no emergency services will help out or arrest you). It's certainly an interesting idea. After all... what would you do? Would you barricade yourself in and hope no one tried to steal your telly (or worse - your life), or would you run to the nearest bank with a pickaxe (or find that bloke who cut you up in his car at the traffic lights and have more than just a few strong words)? Sadly, despite its awesome premise, the execution is lacking. Have you seen a 'home invasion' movie? One where the innocent family are tormented by some sort of invading force in their own home. If you have then you've basically seen this movie. The great premise is soon discarded in favour of a family under siege and therefore adds very little to the overall film.<br/><br/>It's not so bad. It's short and to the point. It gets the job done and has reasonably good performances all round. If you like home invasion films then you'll probably like this. It's just a shame that the great premise wasn't expanded on a little more. However, a sequel is in the pipeline, so maybe it'll be addressed then (and with the obviously expanded budget).<br/><br/>http://thewrongtreemoviereviews.blogspot.co.uk/"

In this movie you won't get bored at all (except for the beginning)and there is nonstop suspense.<br/><br/>Now for the plot. The idea is pretty unrealistic, for the government to make an already growing gap between the rich and the poor. Sure, the growing population would go down, but the rich people's workers would get killed so that there would be no workers and put the country in poverty. Also, if this was just in the US, why didn't they go take a vacation and put some extra security on their house? It's just that this would never happen.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie had great acting, no filler music (it was so action-y they didn't even need it), and it was pretty scary.

","Producer of 'Paranormal Activity' movies, 'Insidious', 'Sinister', and 'Dark Skies', Jason Blum (my favorite producer) decides to team up with writer and director James DeMonaco to produce 'The Purge'. The movie stars Ethan Hawke (main character in Jason Blum's biggest movie, 'Sinister'), as the main character, James Sandin, Lena Headey, who plays his wife, Mary Sandin. I thought that the Casting Department in this movie did a good job, because these actors worked well. The movie has a great idea and good characters, but does this movie execute itself well? I thought so.<br/><br/>'The Purge' jumps into the story very fast. I don't think it's very long before the purge in the movie starts. That short time slot is the time used to introduce the characters. So, we don't really know the characters very well. I understood that, though, because we don't need a boring beginning to introduce the characters, when we just want all of the action to start. You think it's cool when it shows all of this futuristic technology, but sadly that's the top of the hill of the very beginning of the purge section of the movie. There were a few things that happened, but they were predictable to me. That part was very different than I expected it to be. You saw in the trailer that one of the kids let this random guy who's calling for help into the house. That was part of this section of the movie: the beginning of the purge part. It was a little entertaining of the family having to do a few things because of him, but it could have been better. So, the movie hasn't gone very well so far. It would have to redeem itself with very cool action later. It did that very thing.<br/><br/>After the boring part ended, the thriller part of the movie started. There were people invading the house and trying to kill the family. This was the part of the movie that they executed well. There were many action and thriller sequences that were very cool, intense, and enjoyable. Yes, some of them were very predictable, but some of them weren't. The weird thing is, this part of the movie wasn't very long. Well, the whole movie wasn't very long. It was only about eighty minutes long. I wondered if the movie were longer if it would be worse or better. I thought that they made it that short so that it wouldn't be boring and it wouldn't have that much time to make itself bad. Anyway, when it got closer to the end of the movie, some very unpredictable things happened. Some were good, and some were bad. Well, I actually thought near the end only one or two of those things were bad.<br/><br/>So, the movie, as a whole, was good. It was enjoyable, thrilling, and a little intense. My 7/10 means that this movie is good and I liked it, but this movie could have gone in a different direction and it would have been better. The idea of 'The Purge' is very good. I thought if it didn't focus on just one family or not gone in the direction of a slasher movie, it could have been really good. It also could have been done a little better, too."
"LadyFriday","6","0","2","6 July 2013"," Not that bad... plenty of predictable moments tho.
","As mentioned, it's pretty predictable as a current thriller movie is concerned. However, it's not a bad movie to watch. Loved the characters, and have to admit I only watched it because of the trailers and Ethan Hawke as a main cast. Ethan Hawke has been in a number of movies I've enjoyed and thought this would be a good twist to his character role (not that I think he's typed-cast).<br/><br/>The premise was interesting. The Purge, a good movie for the NRA to watch and see what may happen if they keep turning a blind eye on what they support. Futures like this is for fiction, and we should keep it that way.<br/><br/>This movie is thought provoking, something to talk about around the dinner table. For that reason, I will not purchase it and am not trilled I paid money to watch it.<br/><br/>Silver-lining: good story line, interesting plot, and a wonderful ending."

","Didn't know what to expect as all I knew it was a ""horror"" movie. And so good, it blew me away!<br/><br/>It's really a cut above any thing in the horror, even more so in the thriller genre that I've seen in quite awhile.<br/><br/>The best thing about it? It really had a story, a real concept to it. The whole movie finely done was an excellent carrier-wave for interesting messages.<br/><br/>At first I thought the concept just another ""what if?"", but then the idea started to permeate my psyche and it really hit me. Expletive, expletive!, Yea wow!, what if say this really happened? And to say the very least it rattled my nerves. I was on the edge of me seat the whole movie.<br/><br/>I haven't seen anything with this kind of spirit and edge since ""Assault on Precinct 13"" 1976 (not 2005 remake). The 2005 version was okay, but you have really have to see the 1976 version to appreciate it. Another classic movie in the same spirit is ""Westworld"" 1973, and the edge of ""The Andromeda Strain"" 1969.<br/><br/>Has a sort of John Carpenter-ish feeling. It wasn't that surprising the director, James DeMonaco, also made the ""Assault on Precinct 13"" 2005 version! He's one of my favorite directors now, I'm definitely looking forward to ""The Purge 2"" and what ever else in the future.<br/><br/>I was pretty surprised this movie has such a low score by some other reviewers. It's obvious what I think, but here is the thing: The message, the idea, might offend some people. Perhaps to a greater or lessor degree reflect on their own feelings/ideas/beliefs on society, morals, religion, etc. Questions like: Are people basically evil, or are they good? (I believe the later). Better works of art (what ever mediums including cinema) have this two way communication quality to them. You sort of look back at what you see and experience. Probably, possibly, this was a little to far for some people. <br/><br/>Don't be deterred as in the end the stats don't lie. Looking here on IMDb I see this movie has actually done pretty well at the box office, and they are making a sequel too!<br/><br/>If you like horror, thrillers, a thinking person's movie, or just great movie entertainment at it's finest, see this!"
"Christian_Dimartino","8","0","2","23 June 2013"," It is mildly disappointing, but I liked it.
","I only saw one trailer for The Purge, and it had me. Then, the reviews came out, and it lost me. Most were mainly the same: something along the lines of, ""It starts off with such promise and then fall flat."" I have friends who even said the same thing, but everyone said different things. It really does have such a smashing premise, so I felt like I really had to give it a go. Is it worth it? Just wait.<br/><br/>So, here's the premise: In the year 2022, the crime rate doesn't really exist anymore. Why? Because instead, on one day every year, crime is legal for 12 hours. The film centers on one family, the Sandin's. The father (Ethan Hawke) builds the security systems that keeps all normal people safe during The Purge day. After letting an injured homeless man into their home, they are targeted by this group of psychopaths, desperately looking for blood.<br/><br/>Basically, what starts off as something fresh and exciting turns into something... familiar. But you know, familiar isn't always bad. Just as World War Z worked, The Purge works also. Though, I must say, I do sort of see what everyone is talking about. It could have been a better movie. But I suppose I am happy with what it was. That said, I still have one slight criticism to make.<br/><br/>The next flaw is the twist. I am definitely not going to blow what I'm considering ""the twist"" in the movie, because I'm not that guy. But, I have to say that the reasoning behind the twist is sort of... dumb. But, I don't want to ruin anything, so I'm afraid that I can't elaborate further. But I will say that The Purge is a hell of a thriller, and, all flaws aside, it is worth seeing. So, see it.<br/><br/>B+"

","Ethan Hawke has once again made a wise choice to star in yet another well-crafted Horror film. 2012 saw Hawke take on the lead role in supernatural thriller Sinister, which proved surprisingly scary. This year sees him play the patriarchal role in the recent home invasion flick The Purge.<br/><br/>The Purge, directed by James DeMonaco offers a refreshing take on the well-known sub-genre. The film's premise is slightly unconventional in comparison to other films of this kind. Set in the not too distant future in 2022, the United States has undergone a ""rebirth"" where crime statistics are at an all time-low and unemployment rates have decreased to a mere 1%. Sounds ideal, this is however not the case as for one night per year, the government have instilled a programme known as ""The Purge"", where anybody is entitled to carry out extreme acts of violence during a 12-hour period, this disturbingly includes murder! The film's protagonist is of course Hawke's character James Sandin. A wealthy, upper-class and successful businessman, Sandin has created and sold-out state of the art security systems which has created a slight animosity amongst the neighbors. The main setting is Sandin's luxurious home which he shares with his wife Mary (Lena Headey), teenage daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and young son Charlie (Max Burkholder).<br/><br/>The first few moments of the film establishes the family well and their relationships with each other. They could be described as archetypal as they embody the usual family issues of maintaining communication which is established through the run-of-the-mill dinner scene where Sandin probes each member on their day in an organized fashion. However, it is clear there is an equality between the husband and wife characters which is evident later on once the carnage is at its height. These key scenes allow the audience to become involved with the characters very quickly and end up rooting for them.<br/><br/>The film plays on some thought-provoking themes. If you had the opportunity to commit violent crimes without consequence, would you? How far would you go to save your own skin and those you care about for the life of another? The way the film depicts these ideas comes across in a psychologically disturbing manner and gives a profound analysis of the corruption in the US government.<br/><br/>The action kicks off when Charlie, who is played with a sense of innocence and naivety as well as intelligence disarms the security system to allow an unknown African-American (Edwin Hodge) into the Sandin's home. Soon, a group of well-educated, middle-class thugs appear at the door demanding the ""bloody stranger"" for themselves with a sophisticated yet extremely psychotic leader (Rhys Wakefield). The thugs donne unnerving masks which adds a sense of creepy imagery to the piece. The previously non-violent Sandin's are now placed in the position of sacrificing another life for their own safety. This aspect of the film is portrayed with much complexity, bringing in the notion of unpredictability for the audience.<br/><br/>Plenty of twists and turns and shocks and scares are in store as well as some unexpected moments among the standard conventions of the home invasion film. The Purge displays a sense of psychological brutality with a truly terrifying idea that suggests its acceptable to kill. You will remain on the edge of the seat and won't want to turn away from the screen. Issues of prejudice relating to poverty and more subtly race are also questioned, demonstrating the so-called power of white supremacy. The majority of the film is shot in darkness and has the family separated all over the house which ramps up the tension as its unclear who will be around the corner! The Purge is a clever concept. Its well acted, directed and shot. Its themes are handled well on top of it being very suspenseful. Even as the credits roll, it reveals how twisted and disturbing the law really is, you will find it a difficult film to shake off. Although its not overly original, it most definitely provides a different and interesting angle on its sub-genre. I'd go as far as saying its my favorite genre film so far, this year."
"rivertam26","8","0","3","9 June 2013"," Brilliant
","I've heard that a lot of people have felt disappointed by this film. Critics as well as the general public. It had a phenomenal weekend. Costing just 3 million dollars to make and netting almost 38 million. The concept must have hooked people. Because in a cinematic genre age of remakes and sequels the rare original flick with the intriguing concept will net a lot of attention even if people come flocking to it for all the wrong reasons. From what I've heard people expected to see something broader concerning the concept, something more action packed and entertaining. What I saw a standard home invasion horror thriller amped up by an unusual twist. Ten years from now in the future a new group is the government and they have authorized all crime legal for twelve hours once a year. Since people are allowed to exorcise all their violent and psychotic tendencies. Crime has dropped substantially as well as poverty and unemployment. Set in 2022 on the day of The Purge a family gets accidentally involved in a ""purge hunt"" when a young boy lets a wounded victim into their home. As a result a cult of psychotic yuppies targeting him decide to take out their aggression on all of them. If you go in expecting something that's gonna be action packed you will be disappointed. If you go in expecting something that will take the concept on in a broader scenario in which you can witness the brutality across the country you will be disappointed. And lastly if you go in expecting a movie that's going to glorify the violence you will be sadly disappointed. The Purge despite what you may think is a small intimate film that explores the morality of it's concept on a smaller scale to execute a feeling of how everything and everyone is affected individually. It does have broad scope in what it's trying to communicate but is done in a controlled location so it can build characters that frustrate you while you care for them. It makes no subtleties about exploring the bowels of human nature. those feeling that the concept is unrealistic would be right but than again you probably shouldn't see this movie. it's intended as an exercise in taut suspense grounded by a intense observation of the human condition. Furthermore The director smartly orchestrates the situations so that you change the way you feel constantly throughout the film so that you question yourself and those around you. It's a disturbing film. But it's also a brilliant one filled with two strong lead performances from Lena Headey and Ethan Hawke much better here than Insidious. That being said some of the scare tactics are a bit too desperate and come across hammy such as the mask where goons montage and some unnecessary skipping. The twist at the end of the film is the most disturbing part and everything culminates in a way that will leave you speechless. The film runs 85 mins and honestly I'm happy it does cause it ratchets up such disturbing intensity I almost couldn't bear it. It's a taut, unnerving ride that will echo long after it's over. 4/5"

","I saw ""The Purge"", starring Ethan Hawke-Sinister, Training Day; Lena Headey-Game of Thrones-t.v., 300; Rhys Wakefield-Sanctum, Broken Hill and Edwin Hodge-Red Dawn-2012, Die Hard: With a Vengeance. <br/><br/>This movie has an interesting premise. It takes place in the not-too-distant future of 2022, where crime rates are down, poverty levels are down, and the economy is on the rise. And, it's all due to the government's newly instated annual Purge. Every year at 7:00 p.m. on June 21st until 7:00 a.m. on June 22nd-for 12 hours-any and all crime is legalized,with a few exceptions. During this time period, anyone can commit any crime, without any interference from police or medical personnel. The Purge, at least according to this movie, helps people release their pent-up anger and resentment that has been festering all year long-one person is overheard saying, 'I can't wait to kill my boss, he deserves it!' Of course, if you do not want to participate, you can stay indoors until it's over. Ethan plays just such a person, and it might be because he sells home protection services for a living. You know, with steel doors and windows that come down to lock up your house. Lena plays his wife. Everything is set for their annual Purge; the house is locked down, when Edwin shows up at their doorsteps being chased by a Purge hungry group led by Rhys. After Edwin gains access to the house, Rhys demands he be returned to them so they can Purge all over Edwin. The problem is should the Cleaver family give up a total stranger to be killed, just to prevent the Purge hungry clan from attacking them? As I said earlier, it's an interesting premise. It's rated ""R"" for the violence and language and has a running time of 1 hour & 25 minutes. I enjoyed it and I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

","It is the near future, and the USA has discovered that it can enjoy a near zero crime rate by means of having a once a year amnesty, when anyone can commit any crime, including murder, with no consequence. Over one night, from 7pm to 7am, sensible people batten down the hatches while danger roams the streets. While the poor, unable to afford security, suffer particularly badly, the Sandin family have done very well due to Dad James being very good at selling high-spec security systems. However, he didn't bank on daughter Zoey's boyfriend sneaking in just before the shutters came down, nor of son Charlie raising them to allow a fugitive from a murderous mob to escape within. And the mob want him back...<br/><br/>This film - which seems to have caused enormous annoyance to those who find its basic premise unbelievable - falls clearly into 3 acts. Act 1 sets up the basic conceit of Purge Night and introduces cocky nouveau riche Dad James (Ethan Hawke), everywoman Mom Mary (Lena Headey) moody teenage daughter Zoey (Adelaide Kane) and neurotic and sensitive son Charlie (Max Burkholder), as well as various neighbours. Act 2 kicks off purge night and deals with the immediate consequences of the two unwanted guests. This is also perhaps the most interesting sequence in that it poses the moral question of what should the family do? Provide shelter and protection for the mob's victim despite the risk to themselves if the mob can breach their security, or hand him over for slaughter? Act 3 is fairly routine action/adventure stuff involving fighting back against home invasion.<br/><br/>If you find the basic conceit so unbelievable that it becomes a deal-breaker, then I quite understand, and it is very unlikely that I am going to change your mind: if so, I suggest that you do not see this film. Personally, I was happy to go along with it. I liked the moral dilemma in act 2, I liked the action shenanigans in act 3, I thoroughly enjoyed Rhys Wakefield's unsettling mob leader, I liked the fact that it didn't play out exactly as I expected, and the final sequence contained the most gratifying piece of physical violence since John Wayne laid out George Kennedy with a wooden ladle in The Sons Of Katie Elder (darn it, I'll go back to Wayne smacking Akins in the back of the neck with a shotgun in Rio Bravo).<br/><br/>But on the other hand, there were a number of things which irritated me. One was expected follow-ups which never happened - was Charlie's hypochondria really only there so that he had a heart monitor for a later sequence? Couldn't better use have been made of Zoey's boyfriend? Likewise Charlie's remote control video thingie. Also, even if you accept the premise of the story without question, there was much that was unbelievable in what happened, foremost among which was leaving it until the last minute to put the shutters down. Come on, you'd have them down as soon as everyone was indoors, wouldn't you? You wouldn't sit there, have dinner and an argument, and then put them down at 6:59? I quite enjoyed this as I was watching it, but the more I think about it, the more I come to the conclusion that it's probably not as good as I thought it was last night! I'll still watch it when it pops up on TV, though."
"cinematic_aficionado","7","0","2","2 June 2013"," A stimulating experience that could have been much more
","What would life be like, if people were freed from the oppression of the laws? <br/><br/>This is the case examined by this movie whereby the government decided to give people a 12 hour reprieve from any legal wrongdoing. <br/><br/>I must confess, I found this to be a fascinating subject and not just for a movie as it raises some very important questions such as ""do we need laws"" and/or ""are people inclined in the absence of any obstacle to simply submit entirely to their animal instincts"".<br/><br/>The story focuses on a particular family who believe they are safe in their rather lavish house and simply sit and wait for the 12 hours of lawlessness to end. Everything seems to be running smoothly until the young son breaks the rules and due to compassion for a chased homeless man he allows him to enter the house, providing the story with a turning point, as those who are after him are prepared to go to any lengths to get him.<br/><br/>I was grounded to my seat from the opening scenes and the rather chilling atmosphere it conveyed added an aura of mystery and intrigue, not to mention the endless moral questions it raised, which by no means is a little thing. This remained the case, shortly after the invaders entered the family house, where from then on the experience took a slide, albeit not too great.<br/><br/>Much as the makers of this movie, were effective in portraying the landlords strong and weak in turns as they endeavoured to protect their property the invasion was almost predictable in the way the perpetrators were terminated the very moment they were about to kill a family member. On the same note and during the very same sequences this film had a psychological thriller tone to it, which added to the already intense atmosphere.<br/><br/>The ending was to an extend anticipated, with the homeless man playing a part to redeem the risk taken by others to save him.<br/><br/>Overall an interesting, stimulating experience that could have been much more and was just few notches away of a cult status."
