","I read a lot of previous posts about this movie. This is one of the best films of the year, and of recent years. This is a perfect blend of action, suspense, thrills and film-noir. The plot is intelligent and fresh. People saying it is not original must have slept through the movie. Tom Cruise is fantastic, Colin Farrell is amazing, as well as Samantha Morton. Spielberg again proves that he is the master of cinema. A truly great director. I'll agree, the ending was a little too happy, but not worth complaining about. This film is not about product placement as previously suggested, it is simply a entertaining and yet realistic glimpse of what our future may look like, as advertising becomes more advanced and intrusive. The film creates many moral questions and issues, and should leave you thinking. Is being arrested for doing something you actually havn't commited yet fair? It is worth seeing again and again. As a film lover and critic, i can say it is one amazing movie."

","The future, we are told, are what we make of it. Philip K. Dick did not want to take that chance, so he wrote many many many short stories about the future of man and where we, as a society, were headed. Blade Runner, Total Recall, Paycheck, Screamers, and Minority Report are all short stories written by Dick about the future that have been turned into a movie, and most have a less than enthusiastic view of where we are headed. In Minority Report, we see the effects of predicting the future to the point of crimes are prevented by arresting murderers before they kill. If that does not appear logical, there is a quick little scene early in the movie that addresses those concerns, and on the surface makes sense. Tom Cruise plays the Washington, DC pre-crime chief, John Anderton, who runs the investigators who rely on 3 scientifically engineered beings who can see murders before they happen. The system, of course, raises civil liberty issues, but seems to work perfectly, that is until Anderton is fingered for a murder. The rest of the movie, Anderton tries to not only prove that he is innocent, but also that he was set up, possibly by an oily Department of Justice figure who is investigating Precrime before it goes national after an election, played by Colin Farrell. Directed by Steven Spielberg, Minority Report plays as both a ""Whodunnit?"" and a futuristic exercise of science fiction. Much time was spent on designing the Washington, DC of the 2050s, including cars that run on magnets, virtual reality stations, and much more throughout the film. The most interesting design is of the ""sick sticks"" used by cops to bring down criminals. The blueish tint given to the film also gives us a cold feeling, a future that is not as loving or as hospitable as the time we live in, another trait of a Dick story. A wonderful movie the works for both the crime buff and the science fiction fan."

","I think some people just write reviews for sites like this because they like to complain. I actually find myself wondering if all the gripers here have actually seen Minority Report, as I just have, because I have to say that is one of the most gripping and involving movies I have seen in quite a while.<br/><br/> The content is amazing - all the little details that put the audience firmly in the middle of the 21st century. Personally I can absolutely believe that technology will have advanced in the kind of ways portrayed in the film within 50 years. Just look back 50 years into the past and you should be able to see why. The lives of everyday people in the film, where they are scanned and advertised 'at' all day every day, apart from an excuse for product placement (and why not?), certainly make you think about a world where 'they' know your every move (a future towards which we are already hurtling with some speed).<br/><br/> The style is amazing - why the wooden balls? Because they're cool is why. I like to think that as we progress as a civilization we will keep a few such elegant idiosyncrasies knocking around. The plastic, chrome and glass sets, objects and architecture all looked clean and functional and the way that they suck the color out of a scene worked well and gave the film a distinctive palette. The cars are the best looking vehicles I have ever seen in a film. I have only one criticism here - why do all the computer displays look like Macs? Surely a touch unrealistic ;)<br/><br/> The story is amazing - complicated, yes, but also engrossing, exciting and scary. There are elements here that are only hinted at, but which give the plot a depth increasingly lacking in modern action flicks. And it asks the kind of questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society that'll keep you thinking for much longer that the film's two and some hours.<br/><br/> The direction and performances are amazing - the pre-visualization on this movie must have been a nightmare and yet all the incredible special effects blend perfectly into a visual style that is completely natural and assured, as might be expected from Spielberg and Michael Kahn. There are, of course, numerous references and homages to the work of Stanley Kubrick, which have given a hint of the edge and flair of 'Clockwork Orange' or '2001'. I hope it will continue to be a big influence on Spielberg.<br/><br/> Cruise delivers a first class performance as usual, but the discovery of this film is Samantha Morton as Agatha. Who saw the film and didn't share her terror and vulnerability? Little touches such as the way she clings to Cruise, almost like a baby's reflex, make her a character you immediately care about, innocent and tragic.<br/><br/> Anyway, if that's not enough to recommend the film, then you'll probably never find another one you like again. But if you need another reason, go to see it just for another fantastic soundtrack from the master, John Williams.<br/><br/> Full marks, five stars, a must see several times and buy the DVD movie."
"rbverhoef","9","106","135","4 February 2003"," Looks great, interesting story
","May be this film has some flaws but while watching it I wasn't too distracted by that. Here we have one of the greatest directors alive (Steven Spielberg), a very big star (Tom Cruise) with a great ensemble (Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Peter Stormare, Samantha Morton, Tim Blake Nelson) around him, a good cinematography (Janusz Kaminski) and a nice score by John Williams all packed in a great story (based on the novel by Philip K. Dick) with perfect visual effects.<br/><br/>In the year 2054 murders can be predicted and stopped before they happen. If you were about to kill but stopped you are locked. Tom Cruise is one of the agents who stops those murders. Then he discovers the next murder they have to stop will be committed by himself.<br/><br/>I will not reveal more of the plot. The story itself is great. It is intelligent, but also exciting with great action scenes. The visuals are truly beautiful and perfectly support the sci-fi story. If you like action thrillers and you don't mind they are set in the future (with some futuristic gadgets) this is your film. 9/10."

","This gets high marks for being an involving film that, despite a long length of almost two- and-a-half hours, keeps ones interest all the way. Being a Stephen Spielberg-directed film, it's no surprise that the photography is first-rate. This is nice-looking movie. Tom Cruise also was very good in here, not the obnoxious character he sometimes portrays (or did more often in his younger days.).<br/><br/>The film is a good mixture of action and suspense. Only the one chase scene was overdone with Rambo-like mentality of the good guys not getting hit when they should, and vice- versa.<br/><br/>The subject matter is interesting, too: what would do you (or the police) had very reliable information on crimes that were about to be committed, that you could prevent things from happening before they actually did?<br/><br/>I recognized two people in here who went on shortly thereafter to become recognizable in TV series: Kathryn Morris (""Cold Case"") and Neal McDonough (""Boomtown""). Add Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow, Samantha Morton and you have an interesting cast. I am of the opinion that this is one of Spielberg's underrated gems."
"will_liao","Null","189","249","14 August 2004"," One of the best/most complex science fiction films
","Steven Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive themselves and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a ""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.<br/><br/>We learn all this in the first ten minutes of the movie. After this introduction, the plot really starts when Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds out that the precogs saw him kill someone, someone that he has never met. He finds himself in a race. With the forced recruitment of a precog, Agatha (Samantha Morton), he must clear his name before the predetermined murder. All the while, his old buddies, now helped with a special agent from the FBI (Colin Farrell), are trying to track him down.<br/><br/>Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created. The muted blues echo the style of black & white film noirs. John Anderton is similar to noir's morally ambiguous characters--a good cop with an illegal habit that is forced (by circumstances and desire) to betray the very things he loves.<br/><br/>But this is not just a special effects or mystery movie. The characters, all well drawn, are supremely acted by the cast. Tom Cruise is a good physical actor and he shows it here. By the way he sits or walks, we can intuit the grief and confusion that's going through him. Samantha Morton does a good job of portraying a haunted young lady who has seen too much. Colin Farrell skillfully balances the ambitious and professional sides of his character. As always, Max von Sydow authoritatively plays the respected father figure.<br/><br/>This is one of my favorite Science Fiction films. I would also recommend the following films. These (I think) influenced Minority Report.<br/><br/>""The Maltese Falcon"" ~ film noir ""A Clockwork Orange"" ~ science fiction ""Blade Runner"" ~ science fiction (also based on a Dick story)<br/><br/>***** out of *****"
"Anonymous_Maxine","9","106","138","26 December 2002"," In the world of the blind, the one-eyed man is king
","This is spoken in Minority Report by a drug-dealer on the streets with no eyes at all, so I suppose its free advice for John Anderton, our hero, or a bit of wise-sounding advice meant to get across to the audience but with no other good place for it to fit in the film. This is fine with me, too, because Minority Report is such a taut futuristic thriller that an incongruous little bit of wisdom like this is not to have any negative impact on the film as a whole. John Anderton, played with precision by the great Tom Cruise (oh shut up, the man's awesome), is the chief of the Pre-Crime department in the District of Columbia, which has successfully eradicated murder entirely for the last six years. He works with a group of `pre-cogs' that, together, dream of murders that have not yet taken place and project enough information for Anderton and his team to watch the video emanating from their heads to determine where and when the murders are to take place and to get to those locations and stop the murders from happening before they happen. <br/><br/>This is obviously a formula for a highly successful action movie, but the thing that really makes Minority Report succeed is that it pays so much amount of attention to things that would occur in this situation in real life. It is explained very early in the film that the invention of Pre-Crime has eradicated premeditated murder, as this is most easily detected by the pre-cogs. The majority of the `business,' then, of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia, are crimes of passion. This not only provides the possibility of a lot more tension in that these crimes leave a lot less time for prevention, but also avoids complicating the plot with the details of premeditated murders. We don't care about a guy who wronged another guy five years ago or drug deals gone bad, all we need to hear about are a guy who comes home to find his wife in bed with another man and loses control.<br/><br/>
Given the fact that the movie involves some sort of time-travel (even if information is the only thing traveling through time), it leaves itself open to criticism about plot holes. This is obvious, because plot holes like this even permeated the unparalleled Back to the Future series, which obviously had plenty of plot holes but handled them spectacularly well. Given the amount of movies that I have seen that involve time travel, I have come up with this equation: Time Travel = Plot Holes. This is a universal equation that is never escaped, but it does not mean that any movie that involves time travel will be brought down by the subsequent and unavoidable plot holes. Minority Report did not suffer from its necessary plot holes and neither did the timeless Back to the Future series (which has FINALLY been released as a complete set and which no respectable movie collection could possibly be without). <br/><br/>My esteemed colleague and close friend Christopher Brown (see his brilliant reviews at http://us.imdb.com/CommentsAuthor?625436) points out one of these plot holes in his review of Minority Report, but makes the mistake of suggesting that, given the nature of the precognition and of the crime itself, Anderton's murder should never have been predicted since it did not entail premeditation. Sorry, Chris, but you've missed the boat on this one. The only thing that this does is bring up the fact that it's impossible to tell where precognition starts. It could be argued perfectly well that the pre-cogs played a part in their own precognition. They predicted that Anderton would commit the murder under the circumstances that he would have been watching the thoughts of the pre-cogs and seen that he would commit murder, and then obviously sought to find out for himself how he could have been expected to commit a murder against a person he has never heard of. In this case, if he had called in sick that day, all of this would have been avoided. But he's the best at what he does, he has personal reasons for wanting to stop murder, he does not slack off, he does not call in sick. John Anderton was predicted by the pre-cogs to commit murder because he was at work that day. <br/><br/>The action in the film comes from the possibility that the whole prediction of Anderton's murder might be what is called a `minority report,' where the pre-cogs disagree on something that is going to happen. If he can prove that only one of the pre-cogs came up with the vision that he was going to commit a murder, it might cancel out the entire prediction because it is unreliable. On the way to this goal, we are presented with everything from a tremendously dedicated investigator (played brilliantly by Colin Farrell) to some amazingly creepy but strangely accepted identification spiders that scan John's implanted eye in one of the more uncomfortable scenes in the film. <br/><br/>Minority Report is one of the best and most unique thrillers to be released in years. It is the conglomeration of such a dizzying array of films that it is difficult to contemplate them all at once. We see elements of action films, futuristic thrillers, crime films, science fiction, and of course, the influence of Stanley Kubrick is never far off. There is even, especially in the later portion of the film, a heavy influence on the soundtrack by Bernard Herrman, who was the composer for most of Alfred Hitchcock's films, among many others. It's always nice to see such a respectful homage like that, and it is only one of the many things that makes Minority Report yet another addition to Steven Spielberg's extensive list of high-end films (the last of which was the spectacular A.I.). The only thing I can think of that holds Minority Report back from joining Spielberg's list of timeless classics is that it does not have the scope as far as its target audience as such films as E.T. and Jurassic Park. However, despite not having quite as large of a target audience, Minority Report stands as a strong entry in Spielberg's growing list of great films."
"Dennison327","10","114","161","30 November 2003"," ""Minority Report"" excels above all.
","Steven Spielberg is at his directorial best with this action, adventure. Tom Cruise is at his acting best as a futuristic cop on the run.  I was pleased to see one of the best directors team up with one of the best actors to make a brilliant movie.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of the Pre-Crime unit of the Washington D.C. police department.  This unit stops murders before they happen, with the help of the ""Pre-Cogs.""  The ""Pre-Cogs"" are three psychics who see the murders before they happen, and Cruise is the one who puts their visions together to predict the location, the killer, and the victim of the future crime. So far, the ""Pre-Cog"" division has been successful, with its six-year span going on with no murder ever happening.  Things get complicated for the future of Pre-Crime when Detective Danny Witwer, played by Colin Farrell, is sent to inspect the operation.  Anderton is suspicious of him, because he starts to see cracks in the system.  When Anderton believes that the cracks are minor, he believes wrong.<br/><br/>
Anderton sees another murder happening in the Pre-Cogs' visions and is shocked to see that he is the man committing the murder.  Now that he is on the run from his own men, which of course is under the command of Witwer, Anderton must unravel the mystery of why he has to murder a man whom he hasn't even met yet.  As time runs out, Anderton finds clues that there is a conspiracy behind it.  Can he figure them out in time, or will Pre-Crime see its first murder in six years?<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" is a movie with a fantastic storyline, one of the best I've ever heard of.  The actors are great, the directing is great, of course, it's Spielberg.  Even the effects are great, they are done with ILM. Roger Ebert says that this movie ""reminds us why we go to the movies in the first place,"" and I agree with him."
"argv","Null","6","6","21 June 2002"," Action/thriller with Signature Highlights from Spielberg to Cruise
","Minority Report is the latest film from Stephen Spielberg that stars Tom Cruise as a cop from the year 2054, who works in the pre-crime division of the Washington D.C police department. The division's ability to stop murders before they happen is based on the psychic ability of three people who were mutant byproducts of a failed genetic program designed to help babies born from drug-dependent mothers. Cruise's character, John Anderton, is motivated by the loss of his own son, who was abducted and murdered six years earlier. Accordingly, he's a strong supporter of the controversial program, whose opponents feel it could potentially make an error and people might be wrongfully convicted, if not potentially rehabilitated. That action begins when Anderton is identified as a future killer, and he hits the road running. This may sound a little like The Fugitive, but in this case, you don't know if the man on the run is--or, rather, will be--guilty.<br/><br/>Based on a short story by futurist Phillip K. Dick, author of Blade Runner, the atmosphere of a dark world with high technology having gotten out of hand, almost as though it snuck up on us without our knowing, remains the theme. To remind us that we aren't controlled by technology, but are nonetheless overrun by it, there are frequent references to current-day familiarities, such as department stores and restaurants, such as The Gap and McDonalds, where impressively entertaining high-tech mass marketing gadgets know what you've purchased before and offer new suggestions for consideration. (Sounds like a visit to amazon.com?) Spielberg lightens up the tone with his signature wit and humorous quips and visuals now and then, as opposed to Ridley Scott's more serious and consistently dark visualization portrayed in Blade Runner.<br/><br/>As a plotline, Minority Report is intelligent, has a good consistent flow, isn't always predictable (at least not that long before it happens), has many twists and turns with legitimate dead-ends, and above all, tells a plausible story (even if the basic premise itself requires considerable suspension of disbelief). As Anderton begins to unravel the true story about the corruption behind the pre-crime program, he is lead even further towards his destination as predicted by the `pre-cognitives' who predicted his crime. To tell any more of the story would disclose too much; besides, it isn't necessary. You know all you need to know here.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are so good  from the high-tech special effects to the light-hearted humorous moments to the good, steady flow of the action and plotline  that the problems with the film are easily forgiven. That said, my main gripe is the presumption that, in the future, anyone convicted of a crime before it happens is immediately sent to a state of suspended animation, an alternative form of the death penalty. This is obviously one of the main sources of controversy within the storyline, but anyone can see that, in almost all cases, the predicted murders were not premeditated, if not potentially accidental, in which case, psychological counseling and some form of probation would be enough. There's nothing to suggest in the film that the context is a police state, which would allow the premise to make sense. Yet, so much of the movie is based on this premise, that may be bothersome to the discerning viewer. There are many such similar oversimplifications, each of which could be quite easily solved with a minor change or a quick dialog line or two, hence a mild sense of sloppiness in direction.<br/><br/>Still, in the end, these didn't bother me that much. I still had a great time, and enjoyed it as the frivolous and wonderfully playful action/thriller it was intended to be."
"Quinoa1984","10","61","88","21 June 2002"," You still have a choice...
","Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors around today who can still manipulate an audience in one sense while dazzling and daring that same audience with storytelling and character skills fused with ingenious visual effects.  Minority Report is a shining example of that, which also has the grace of having an intelligent concept to start with, which so many sci-fi films lack much less summer sci-fi films (look at MIB2 to see what I mean), and also better than average acting.<br/><br/>Cruise takes the lead role here as John Anderton, who leads, more or less, the agency of police that prevent all murders on the basis of predictions from three Pre-Cogs (one of them Samantha Morton who has the most important role of the three).  The system is presumably perfect, until to the surprise of Anderton, he is seen to commit a murder and so starts his quest to try and find out if there is a flaw in thirty six hours.  This could be the basis for average sci-fi fodder (Impostor, a film based on another Philip K. Dick story that came out earlier this year, is an point of that), yet Spielberg elevates a story and creates a unique atmosphere to coexist with his characters; by the time the film is HALF way through you'll be exhausted in entertainment.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is the type of picture to see twice, first to get the feel and presence, and the second to clear up any misunderstandings in the plot (or maybe to avoid Scooby Doo and Windtalkers), since this is indeed one of the best pictures of the year and one of Spielberg's best recent pictures. Grade: A+ or A"
"jofitz27","9","71","106","15 February 2005"," Excellent futuristic thriller
","Steven Spielberg is a genius. So many great films he has directed. The Man who created ""Jaws"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""Schindlers List"" is back for more. In one of his best pictures yet. <br/><br/>It's 2054. A new method of crime prevention ""pre-crime"" allows the police to look into the future and see the horrific results of murder and rape as they unfold. After a quick introduction to this process, were straight into the big and bold; main man John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of a future murder- to a man he's never heard of. So he's on the run, from a harsh detective (superbly played by Colin Farrell) as he uncovers some horrible truths and has to go back to the unwelcoming past. <br/><br/>Minority report is very good, but also very disturbing- the fact that this film was a PG-13 or a ""12"" in England is shocking. Parents, a note: if your child is under 12 at least I would strongly recommend you watch this film first. It's dark, compelling, and disturbing- particularly in a scene where he has to exchange his eyes for protection... <br/><br/>This is a fantastic film however that should be viewed and loved by everyone bold enough to come in its path. Never fail to believe: Spielberg has come up with yet another masterpiece. <br/><br/>Overall: ****/ out of ***** (4 and a half out of 5)"
"Spleen","10","138","229","20 June 2002"," One of the rare, great science fiction movies
","It's an open secret: the Oscar is jinxed.  Spielberg's triumph with ""Schindler's List"" was followed by the longest hiatus of his career, which was broken with ... ""Jurassic Park II"", a lifeless sequel of the kind you'd once have sworn he'd never make - the single worst and most anonymous movie he's ever directed (""Hook"" had its moments).  His next two films were improvements (there was nowhere to go but up): the first anonymous but not bad (""Amistad""), the second bad but not anonymous (""Saving Private Ryan""), but they were both pompous gestures which appear to have been designed to win still more awards; and it wasn't until eight years after ""Schindler's List"" that the skilled director of old times re-appeared (with ""A.I."" in 2001).<br/><br/>But he's well and truly back now, and I'm happy.  I've even learned to welcome it when he makes decisions which infuriate me, so long as he makes them with the right kind of self-assured arrogance.  I didn't like the voice-over at the end (we didn't need to be told that stuff; we could have worked it out), or the way he caved in to the modern tendency to be needlessly revolting (at least he don't play his gross-out moments for cheap laughs), or even the style of photography (it's easy to manipulate us into thinking the future is a grim place, if you push-process the film until even the images which in the normal course of events would be luscious and rich, are grimy and desaturated - there are other ways of getting colourless images, as Spielberg well knows, and many of them are better).  Yet, in the end, big deal.  The story is a knockout, the action is taut, the future rich, dazzling and believable.  Spielberg is to be particularly congratulated on how completely he has avoided the unimaginative dystopia of ""Blade Runner"".  The future we see here is a MIX of dream and nightmare, so convincing a mix that we can't always tell them apart.<br/><br/>Here's a measure of how good the movie is: in an interview, Spielberg revealed that he completely misunderstood the issues which drive the stories - and there's simply no way of telling this from the finished product. Unless Spielberg was just opportunistically latching on to the hook forced on him by a dim-witted journalist, he THOUGHT the movie was about how much freedom we are willing to give up in exchange for safety (in order to prevent terrorist attacks, for instance).  This is interpretation is strained.  Three people (the precogs) do indeed give up their freedom in order that millions of other people may be safer, and yes, there is an issue here.  When one of the Crime Prevention officer says, ""It's best not to think of them as human"", I was surprised to find myself nodding in agreement.  The benefits of the system are so great that OF COURSE I'd rather not look too closely into the burden that must be borne by three - just three - individuals.  Aside from the three unfortunate precogs, nobody is asked to give up any freedom at all.  (Except, of course, the freedom to commit murder.  But under the law we are already unfree to commit murder, and a good thing too.)<br/><br/>The interesting issues that DO fall naturally out of the story concern the futility of revenge.  After people who would otherwise have committed murder are prevented from doing so, they're sent to prison anyway, presumably on the grounds that that's what they deserve - and no doubt it IS what they deserve.  But it's clear enough that locking these people up, however much it may be in the interests of justice, serves no purpose.  It's exacting revenge on criminals for the sake of exacting revenge - which is exactly what the U.S. justice system is committed to doing at the moment, which is why the future is a realistic one.  (Apart from the precognition, that is.) Anderton's mistake is to believe in the value of revenge, and he's never more admirable than when he realises his mistake.  (THAT was a great scene; it's a pity I can't tell you exactly why.  Suffice it to say that when we think we know where the story's going, we may indeed know where the story's going - but Spielberg is only allowing us to see so much of what's coming up in order to obscure the rest of it.)<br/><br/>The final sign that Spielberg is again at his peak lies in the performances. They're all good.  Tom Cruise's weakness as an actor is that he is only ever as good as his director, and the fact that he's so good here means that ""Minority Report"" was directed by the real Spielberg, the old Spielberg, the Spielberg with the same ability Charles Dickens had to make even his most grotesque creations, and even his LEAST grotesque, come to life."
"j30bell","6","52","81","20 December 2004"," An addition to the compendium of Spielberg might-have-beens - SPOILERS
","This film is worth watching for lots of reasons. The best is Philip K. Dick's dystopian vision. And the acting is good too: Cruise as the high priest of pre-crime, catching murderers before they commit their offences using the mysterious power of the ""pre-cognitives""; Max Von Sydow adding his usual air of gravitas (how can Hollywood justify treating him so badly?) The look of the film is somewhere between Total Recall and the leeched colours and retro chic of Gatacca. <br/><br/>Others have commented on the plot, so I'm not going to; it's good enough. Would have been better without the last 10 minutes, but Blade Runner suffered the same affliction. Suffice to say - for those who prefer to switch off Blade Runner after Gaff turns to say, It's too bad she won't live, but then again, who does?  the ending for MR will probably set your teeth grinding too. But this is just one problem.<br/><br/>Firstly, the film is a real cut and paste job. It looks like Gatacca, has the plot twists of Total Recall, has that media-savvy thing from Robocop. All good stuff, all been done. OK, so this is a better film than his mate George Lucas would have made, but this just goes to prove that Spielberg is still more of an engineer than an artist.<br/><br/>And if it is meant to be SF film noir, it's a very white shade of black. Spielberg seems to shy away from anything the least edgy (note the keystone cops chase with the jetpack - ""but, yee, we can't have our hero hurt any good guys"" and the comedy fight between Anderton and Witwer). Even Peter Stormare is less Hannibal Lecter and more the comedy-Russian he played on Armageddon. <br/><br/>Then there is the riding off into the sunset ending. Can someone please explain to me what would have been wrong with Cruise ending up in the vault and Max Von Sydow, turning his collar up against the rain, walking out of a bustling pre-crime department to the sound of Schubert's 8th Symphony? Von Sydow's should be the most interesting character in the film  and the man worked with Bergman for goodness sake  why not use him.<br/><br/>SF films have a reputation for being more ""deep"" than they really are. A few manage to be thought-provoking though (2001, Bladerunner, Gatacca). One of the key things that sets them apart seems to be a willingness to leave the audience thinking about what the film is trying to say. All the audience is of MR is left with is the feeling that ""well, that's alright then."" <br/><br/>Enjoyable. 6/10just."
"smoky_air","8","17","24","4 December 2005"," A critical analysis of the film
","The beginning of Minority Report engages the audience with mise en scene to establish a genre. The audience can easily see that the film is set in the future due to the bright lighting and a blue overlay colour. This implies cleanliness and a utopia. However due to the atmosphere created by the dark shadows and low saturation of the colours an implication is created that this futuristic world may not be a utopia but a dystopia. It gives a sense that without colour in the world there is no emotion and people actions are now based on what a machine says rather that acting on human instinct. In detective films in the present, the police station is often seen as a messy but friendly place with coffee mugs and paper everywhere. But in Minority Report the police station is empty; even the lights seem to dark and have no impact of the white surfaces. This may reflect Spielberg's views towards the future. That in fact the future may appear to be perfect but is actually the opposite.<br/><br/>This idea of Spielberg's ideology is a recurring theme throughout the film. Near the beginning of the film there is an advert to promote the use of the pore-cognatives to encourage the use of pore-crime nationwide. This suggests there will be no more suffering and everything will be right in America. However, there is a false sense of security throughout the film. The scene of the promotional advert leads straight into the complete opposite; of the hero 'John Anderton' running onto a dark alley looking to buy drugs; and buys them from a man who sold his eyeballs for money; which is a common thing to do in future the audience finds out. This is a clear message about the opposing views there may be in the film and not just those of Spielberg. In a way it reflects America in the present also. While many Americans enjoy the good life and are wealthy, just as many live in very poor conditions. These two extremes have been brought out into the open in the film.<br/><br/>The film may well have been designed to attract the male audience as it is usually men who are drawn in by crime and detective films. However due to the level of action and the originality of the idea teenagers and young adults would find this film enjoyable. This interplay of detective work and action is cleverly placed throughout the film. A general story is introduced about the pore-cognatives and the hero is introduced. This is a detective moment where the pore-cogs foresee a murder. An action scene then follows as Tom Cruise (John Anderton) goes to prevent the murder which involves coming out of a helicopter and busting into a house. This is the action sequence. The whole film is played out like this and I believe this is how Spielberg manages to have more that one target audience.<br/><br/>The film subtly hints that in the future the world will be over run by media and advertising. Where the adverts in the street actually refer to you by name and talk to you. Another idea of this entrapment is the eye recognition machines that track you where ever you are. This gives the implication that there is no freedom for the people of the future and that again like in the police station their lives are heavily influenced by machines and technology. This new idea of entrapment and inescapability adds to the imperfection of the future world which is presented to the audience.<br/><br/>It is only as the film progresses and the hero is forced into the underbelly of city life that this idea of entrapment continues to the next level. He needs to run from the police but due to the inescapable future he cannot hide. Therefore he himself is lead to have his eyes removed and have new ones put in, so that he has a way past the claustrophobic machines and devices. But the future has another trick up it's sleeve. The use of robotic spider like creature which are designed to penetrate any home of place of holding. They then climb up you and scan you retina; which is much like a finger print, in that everyone has their own unique pattern, representing their individuality. So once again the idea of the future being like a prison that you cannot escape is brought around.<br/><br/>In the end the designer of pore-crime Lamar Burgess turns out to be the villain. So the very man who was promoting the perfect-ness of the future turned out to be fake. Which is the final say in the idea that the future is misinterpreted and although appears to be all wonderful with problems is in fact the opposite. A place where poor people or people who have committed crimes, sell their eye balls as a means of escape from the world they live in."

","Not much left of Dick's superb short story in this film apart from the central idea. It's glossy and gimmicky and laced with pointless action sequences and the usual Spielberg happy ending syndrome. The Dick story ties up elegantly, the film's ending is messy and over-complicated. Plenty of dumb moments: on the run Cruise getting back into the police HQ through a 'back door', the computer system quite happily to admit him. Cruise disappearing down a plug hole with the psychic woman which somehow allows them to escape from the building - how? And so on. Spielberg had a great opportunity here to produce a dark, intelligent and classy piece of work. But what we get is forgettable fluff."

","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Speilberg continues in his reborn quest to be an intelligent filmmaker. Once again, he starts with an idea that is remarkably sophisticated. And once again his biggest enemy is himself as he lards on all the junk he is addicted to.<br/><br/>First the intelligent idea. The primary thing an smart filmmaker does is make certain basic decisions about the stance of the narrator and camera. The most sophisticated options are provided by the detective story. In the basic form, the filmmaker and viewer engage in a joint voyage where they both collaborate and compete to invent a world by discovery. But over time, this template has proven amazingly flexible and fertile. For instance the greatest experimenter of the form, Agatha Christie, once wrote a story that revealed at the end that the narrator was the murderer.<br/><br/>`D. O. A.' was a sweet turn on the form. In that film, the murdered man staggers into a police station. With moments to live before the poison finishes him off, he recounts his detective work to discover who killed him. In `Minority Report' we have the obverse: we learn early who the murderer is, and the story is one where he uses his detective powers to determine who and why he will kill. In literary recognition of the trick, the head `precog' is named Agatha. (The other two are also named after mystery writers whose styles salt the story.) <br/><br/>It is a very intelligent device extended in an even more intelligent, cinematic way: the precogs have visions that are `recorded' and sorted out with a futuristic display. The detective in this case mirrors the viewer who is presented with a collection of visual fragments and tries to make sense out of it. The screenwriter played a similar trick in `Dead Again.' So we have Cruise's detective spending lots of time shuffling through the images, looking for patterns and clues. He manipulates the images physically, which is precisely what an actor does as he works on-screen. Some of this ground was seeded by Greenaway in `the Pillow Book,' where the actor literally had the script written on his body -- an idea more commercially exploited with `Memento.' A fragment on this idea is preserved in the sequence where Cruise's eyes are removed and he is left in a room with huge old films projected on the walls.<br/><br/>Add to this the further notion -- dropped in production -- that the entire film may be recalled images from an imprisoned Cruise as he sorts through his own visions plus Agatha's. This trick, used to great effect in `Brazil' and  in another form in `Forbidden Planet' was abandoned by Speilberg because it was `too intelligent' and not entirely accessible to a ten year old, his target mental demographic. Along the way, many similar compromises were made in the name of entertainment: certain thriller and science fiction conventions were adopted and the whole project sunk to just a `me too' commercial product. One great compromise was the use of Cruise, who like Speilberg was a promising talent mired in mawkish self-marketing and reliance on technique.<br/><br/>The problem is that if this film is judged as a science fiction thriller alone, it fails. The invented future isn't novel, consistent or even engaging. The chased hero routine lacks control in the pace. The unfolding of the logic is unrewarding -- our iconic doctor of evil inexplicably performed a murder that he is elaborately covering up. When all is revealed, it seems too thin an armature for all the flying sheet metal.<br/><br/>Agatha here is played by a remarkable actress who completely bests Cruise. She had played `Jane Eyre' in a vision of the book much like the original idea of this film: she plays both the author writing and the character written. In `Emma,' she was the character ineptly written upon. Speilberg has her stagger in an actorly manner and pop out of the water for amateurish utterances. But she finds all the emotional spaces he can't see and fills those well. Watch her here and in the future. I predict good things.<br/><br/>Ted's Evaluation -- 2 of 4: Has some interesting elements."
"BA_Harrison","8","9","12","7 December 2016"," Full of imagination.
","Before they joined forces to give sci-fi fans their hugely disappointing version of War Of The Worlds, Spielberg and Cruise worked together on Minority Report, a near-future tale based on a short story by Philip K. Dick in which violent crimes can be predicted and prevented from occurring, the perpetrator intercepted before they can carry out the deed. Star Cruise plays pre-crime cop John Anderton, who finds himself on the run after it is predicted that he himself will commit a murder.<br/><br/>The good news is that Minority Report is a lot more enjoyable than the duo's H.G.Wells debacle, with an engrossing murder mystery plot, lots of great visuals, excellent production design, and some well executed and extremely fun action set-pieces, all of which help detract from the story's inevitable paradoxical issues and Spielberg's occasional, frustratingly unrestrained direction (Cruise leaping from car roof to car roof on a towering vertical road stretches plausibility a bit too far, but at least it's not 'nuke the fridge' bad).<br/><br/>7.5 out of 10, rounded up to 8 for the 'sick stick' a police baton that makes the victim projectile vomit."

","Spielberg does it again. <br/><br/>Minority Report is another fine film with a tone-deaf epilogue. It's hard to put my frustration into words. How many brilliantly crafted, intelligent science-fiction flicks do we get today? Very few... and, when one finally arrives, it ends with a whimper.<br/><br/>But I should have seen it coming. Spielberg is a peerless visual storyteller, but he is an odd choice to direct a movie based on a story by a pessimist like Philip K. Dick. It's like John Hughes adapting Lovecraft.<br/><br/>Minority Report takes place in a future where three ""Pre-Cogs"" can predict murders, so the Pre-Crime Unit led by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) can stop the killers in advance. When the Pre-Cogs see him shooting a man he doesn't even know, Anderton finds himself on the run, trying to unravel what's happening.<br/><br/>Cruise, Colin Farrell, Max Von Sydow and Samantha Norton all give solid performances. For most of its running time the movie is clever, thrilling, fun, Spielberg at his best; there are some really neat scenes, like the vision of the first murder and Anderton's rush against time to prevent it, or the sequence with Anderton and Agatha evading the Pre-Crime.<br/><br/>Alas, during its last act Minority Report collapses; it reaches several potentially interesting endings and ignores them all, choosing a sappy cop-out.<br/><br/>Still, what precedes it is good enough to recommend the movie - if only to ponder what could have been.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","In the year 2054 the murder rate in Washington is zero because of the Pre-Crime division.  Pre-Crime uses three pre-cognitives to see the near future and direct officers to arrest the murderers before they can commit the act.  However during a visit by an assessing authority the pre-cognitives see chief officer John Anderton kill a man.  John runs, escaping the pre-crime police and trying to find out how and why he was seen killing a man.<br/><br/>This contains many levels of seeing, maybe linking up with how Speilberg sees his films  at first the visions are easily controlled but then they are fallible and more complex.  Anderton even changes his eyes at one point to show how his vision is changed.  Aside from these metaphors the film itself is a lot more complex than Speilberg would have done several years ago.  The film deals with a complex future where we are pre-judged by a big brother style police and the film does have an element of the moral questioning that this throws up.  However for the majority it is a complex mystery film and this carries it no problem right up till the end.<br/><br/>The end (I'm not spoiling it) is where it trips up a little  the conclusion is a little too easy and the ends are too tidily tied up, showing that Speilberg perhaps isn't yet the mature director he almost is.  His vision however is very good, yes, we have all the CGI we need and only occasionally does it not look good.  However more than all the CGI, Speilberg mixes the present with his futuristic vision rather than having us all living in pods!<br/><br/>Cruise has become more mature as well.  His Anderton starts out as an Ethan Hawk character  full of confidence, but later he is able to add more layers and more doubt.  He is also able to act well beside some other strong performances from good actors like Max Von Sydow and a strong Colin Farrell. The rest of the cast has some famous faces like Ayre Gross, Sam Morton, Tim Blake Nelson, Stormare etc but outside of them really it's Cruise all the way.<br/><br/>Overall it may disappoint the Jurassic Park/Matrix audience expecting a fast, action packed thriller  the marketing makes it look like the Matrix when really it's much more like the noir of Bladerunner.  The moral complexities run nicely alongside the action but eventually it falls into Speilberg sentiment mode with a disappointing end.  Overall though this is very good but not quite Bladerunner."

","The best film to date so far this year as of 8/02! This film is about a John (Tom Cruise) who is haunted by the disappearance of his young son many years ago. To cope with the grief he works at a crime pervanetion network founded by Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) that can predict murders and stop them before they occur. However, one day while at work Tom Cruise is shocked to discover that it is saying he will be the next person to try and commit murder. John thinks that an agent named Danny  (Colin Farrell) who is investigating the the unit is trying to set him up. To add to the problems, the person John is accused of trying to murder is a person he does not even know and it says John will kill him in 48 hours.<br/><br/>Fast paced, exciting and deeply moving & thought provoking film. Tom Crusie does good work here. Colin turns in a deliciously nasty performance. However the film belongs to Max Von Sydow who is absolutely genius here. Director Speilberg treats the audience to some highly original and creative visual effects and has presented us with a fun story that covers all the bases. The ending is especially good. <br/><br/>Rated PG-13; Violence and Profanity."

"shadowman123","9","9","13","28 August 2007"," My 100th review!!!
","For my 100th review it could not of gotten any better than this. Minority Report proves when Tom Cruise keeps his out-landish behaviour to him-self why he is probably one of the best actors to come out of the past century. From the surface Minority Report seems to come across as a super futuristic action thriller but once you check it out you come to the realisation that nothing is what it seems as this is a story with a lot of complex human emotion rolled into it with lots of philosophical arguments on both sides which all in shows both sides of the coin and what it feels like for the hunter to become hunted. The acting was completely flawless from all corners whether it be Cruise, Farrell or Sydow with a pacey story which wastes no time and plenty of twists, turns to keep you moving and guessing. Words are not really that are used to describe Minority Report because it tends to open it-self up like a flower and one has to watch it for him-self . To conclude put Minority report on your '100 films to watch before I die list' as it is one of those movies which will make you think after its done my only complaint was that it was just a little bit too long but the film kept on moving at a quick enough pace and there was quite a bit to take in but the arguments presented to you in this movie really make one wonder what is moral and what is not giving the situation of the world we live in.<br/><br/>MINORITY REPORT : 9 OUT 10<br/><br/>IN THE WORLD OF THE BLIND , THE ONE EYED MAN IS KING!"
"ubi-guy","1","56","109","30 November 2003"," SCRIPTWRITING 101 *****MAJOR SPOILERS*****
","Minority Reports, MAJOR FLAWS in scriptwriting:<br/><br/>1- The set up is this, in the future a police force uses 3 ""mediums"" to foresee murders before they happen. Then the cops drop by and arrest you just as you are about to kill someone, caught in the act before the murder is committed. It is understood through other characters that if you make the choice NOT to kill etc, you'll be ok. Tom Cruise (a cop) is set up so that the mediums see him killing a guy in 36 hours. Tom Cruise runs away and succeeds in getting outside the medium's reach. 24 hours to go. What would YOU do?!!! NO-He goes back to the city (`I've been set-up, I need to find out who's that stranger I'm supposed to kill!'). No more explanation than that ONE sentence... He could have waited 24hrs, be innocent THEN use ALL the police's resources in finding that stranger (whose name he was told on top of it!) 2- Everywhere you go (billboards, stores, even newspapers) continuously scan your eyes to discover who you are and talk to you (EX: Tom Cruise enters a GAP store, a holographic sales clerk appears `Hi Mr. whatever, nice to see you!'). When he escape, he has a surgeon removing his eyes and replacing them with new ones (a MAJOR plot idea that, as it turns out, serves no real purpose in the unfolding of the plot other than to have that useless ""spider"" sequence). He brings his OLD eyes with him in a zip-lock bag. The REASON is that as soon as ANYTHING (even a newspaper) scans his eyes, the police would be alerted. Well he gets to the POLICE HEADQUARTERS, walks up to the door, pulls his old eyes out of the Zip Lock and scans them. The Security door opens up ` Hello, agent Anderton!'... YOU'D THINK THAT IF THE NEWSPAPERS AND BILLBOARDS WERE<br/><br/>ALERTED, SO WOULD POLICE HEADQUARTERS BE!!! 3- BAD CLICHÉ. You know when in movies you have a guy that we know did something bad, he's with someone who doesn't know and we're waiting for THEM to discover it? You know when the guilty person  says one thing he's NOT supposed to know (that only the murderer would know)? `I'd check to see if a girl was drowned, what was that name you said?' `Mrs. Marsh, but I never told you she'd been drowned!' 4-Scriptwriting 101- When you study scriptwriting, they teach you the 3 basic mistakes made by bad writers A-DEUS EX MACHINA (When the character is in such a bad<br/><br/>predicament to invoke a God to save him, such as the T-Rex appearing out of nowhere inside a building at the end of Jurassic Park that no one felt coming) B- Not tying up loose ends and C-When a story is so convoluted that at the end you need a long speech to explain it (like Harrison Ford does at the end of The Fugitive). At the end Tom Cruise calls the bad guy, and TELLS HIM for like 10 minutes ALL HE did, and WHY he did it etc so that WE, the audience, may finally understand this mess!<br/><br/>If Spielberg wasn't the money-hungry hack he's now become he would have asked for a re-write."
"hagerp","1","29","53","4 March 2003"," Good acting, effects -- insultingly bad plot [SPOILERS]
","For a work of speculative or science fiction to be credible, it must limit the number of demands it makes upon viewers/readers to suspend disbelief. For example, a top-notch, space-based science fiction story may allow for faster-than-light travel, but it generally has to stick to plausible science after that.  If a work is pure fantasy, then it is possible to demand more of viewers/readers, but even it must remain internally consistent to whatever set of rules it creates.<br/><br/>Spielberg & Co. attempt to tell a story in which we are asked to accept that law enforcement in the near future has the ability to foresee murders before they actually happen.  Fair enough -- we accept this impossible premise in order for the story to unfold, but if the story is to be believable, we should expect no further impositions on our credibility.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have commented on various plot problems, which, though valid, are not fundamentally impossible.  There is, however, a major plot element involving the `murder' that Anderton is supposed to commit that is impossible.  SPOILER FOLLOWS:<br/><br/>We see the pre-cog vision of the shooting multiple times as we approach the actual confrontation.  In this vision, the victim, Leo Crow, has been shot at a distance (one image), and Anderton is seen holding his pistol with arm outstretched, pointing at Crow who is falling away (second image).  The second image would be perfectly consistent with someone firing a gun at someone standing a few feet away.  However, in the actual event, Anderton doesn't deliberately shoot Crow  he starts to read him his rights (a very well done piece of acting by Cruise).  Crow then begs Anderton to kill him, revealing the planned frame-up.  In desperation, Crow rushes forward, grabs Anderton's gun hand, pulls Anderton and the gun to his chest, and is able to make the gun discharge.  We then get a short (probably less than a second) repeat of the second pre-cog image, now supposedly real, of Crow falling away with Anderton in exactly the same position, body turned sideways, arm outstretch with the pistol aimed at Crow as though he had just shot him. Impossible!!!  This would require that after Crow was shot, Anderton would straighten his arm, turn sideways, and point the pistol at Crow.  Aside from there being no time to assume that position, no one having just inadvertently shot someone would behave in such a fashion.<br/><br/>It gets worse.  A contact pistol wound is very distinct  so much so that even the average layperson would be able to distinguish it from a wound made from several feet away.  We therefore must assume that no one would notice the obvious discrepancy between the pre-cog vision of the bullet hit from several feet away (image one) and the reality - seriously undermining the supposed perfection of future crime detection.  This problem in elementary forensics is one that was going to exist once the writers decided on how events would plausibly unfold.  Maybe one could overlook this problem by saying that police organizations didn't do forensics anymore, and no one involved ever looked closely at the body of Leo Crow.  Like the absurdities with the eyes that miraculously didn't deteriorate to unusability after a few minutes (let alone hours), it would be one more block in the pyramid of improbabilities (noted by other reviewers) needed to keep the plot advancing.<br/><br/>Spielberg & Co. clearly wanted to explore the idea of determinism versus free will.  They also wanted to examine whether a perfect crime detection system that saved hundreds of lives every year could be balanced against the exploitation of the 3 people who made it possible - a classic moral question of, do the needs of the many (to paraphrase Mr. Spock) outweigh the needs of the few?  But there really is no moral question at all since the system is not perfect.  Pre-cog image one is wrong and free will triumphs over determinism.  Spielberg & Co. obviously decided that it wouldn't do to have all of the exposition required to explore the morality of utilitarianism go down the tubes when Leo Crow is shot, so viewers were tricked by false, impossible image two into concluding that this particular (very gifted) pre-cog's visions were perfect but incomplete.  This is sloppy script writing and arrogant (or lazy) film direction.  It is the final insult, for this viewer at least.<br/><br/>I'd sum up the movie this way: good acting, good sfx and cgi.  Message movie ultimately subverted by very badly written plot."

Using sophisticated computer and neural technology, the police are warned of crimes that will occur (via ""previsions"") in the future and they try to stop them. With a 100% success rate and no murder in their jurisdiction for the past six years the system looks flawless. A coming vote, which looks very hopeful for PreCrime, will instill the system nationwide. But when Chief John Anderton, a loyal and decorated PreCrime cop, is seen to be killing someone in one of the previsions he suspects that someone set him up and that not everything is as perfect as it has been made out to be.<br/><br/>It doesn't happen very often that a big studio production with a big name star produces such a great movie. But here it is. Spielberg and his team have crafted an engrossing vision of the future that is not only good looking with its top-notch special effects, but thought provoking and actually interesting on a pure story level. Adapted from one of science fiction's cleverest authors the story is complex and thought provoking on many levels. Not only does it get you thinking about the possibilities where the film can and cannot go, but it will get you thinking about what you yourself actually do.<br/><br/>The direction is also among Spielberg's best with a terrific pace and nail biting tension in some scenes that almost recalls Hitchcock. Backed up, of course, by a great score from John Williams. The movie's vision is also great - the whole futuristic world is shown in what are not just money/eye candy shots, but shots that really place you in the film's world and take you for a terrifically exciting ride. Also of note is Peter Stormare, who has a brilliant, but brief, appearance as a whacko surgeon.<br/><br/>One of the best science fiction films to come out of Hollywood in a long while. 10/10<br/><br/>Rated PG-13 for violence"

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This is an absolutely horrible movie and a travesty to both film and to the short story it was based on. SPOILERS...<br/><br/>First of all, you can't judge a movie ""based on a short story"" without considering and comparing the movie to the book itself.  We always hear 'the book was better.'  Well, not only is the book better...it's also very different.  I have no idea where Spielberg gets the notion that he can completely destroy the work of Philip K Dick by making this nonsense.<br/><br/>Let's start with the title:  Minority Report.  The Minority Report is a VERY IMPORTANT item in the short story.  It's critical to the plot.  However, in the movie, there is no Minority Report.  There's a mention of it (""where's the minority report?"") but it is dismissed quickly and absolutely (""there is no minority report"")  That's it.  A critical element of the story, and the TITLE OF THE DARN MOVIE is...non existant.<br/><br/>I won't explain the role of the minority report...just visit a bookstore, grab the collection of short stories, and you can read the whole Minority Report ""book"" in about 30 minutes.<br/><br/>Another conflict is: In the book, Anderston ABSOLUTELY and above all else loves and defends Precrime.  At the end of the book, he decides to go ahead and kill the guy just to ""prove"" that precrime ""works.""  However, in the movie, he fails to do this.  Further, he works at the end to bring it down by confronting his nemesis, remarrying his wife, having another kid and living happily after.<br/><br/>What else isn't in the book?  Anderton getting new eyes, Anderton getting divorced, Anderton losing his son, Anderton getting setup by his own boss, Anderton running around town with a precog, Anderton having a drug problem, doctors who burned their patients, jetpacks, spiders....you name it. Anderton in the novel is no Tom Cruise, but a 300 pound slob, but why mix some book facts with a bad movie?  This movie resembles the original short story as much as it resembles The Wizard Of Oz.<br/><br/>For those that say ""well, I didn't read the book and the movie looks great,"" I can only say: this is one of the most ill thought out, poorly constructed movies with entirely too many plotholes.<br/><br/>One example that comes to mind is Anderton's eyeballs:  they could track Anderton in his car and reroute the car, yet, even after he was being pursued, he still used his eyeballs to easily enter the precog room.  How? Don't you think they would have turned off his access?  Hell, laid off employees get their card access turned off...surely, access to the most important room in the PreCrime building would have been turned off?!? Funnier still, even after he is IN JAIL, his wife uses his eyeball to gain access to the prison...with a gun...to free prisoners.  You figure it out.<br/><br/>What about the movie saying ""precogs can only see murders"" yet Agatha the roaming precog can see rain coming, balloons needed, etc?<br/><br/>What about the movie saying all the precogs must be ""connected"" in order for it to work, yet with Agatha running around solo she is seeing the aforementioned umbrella, balloons, etc?<br/><br/>Why didn't the precogs see the Witwer murder since that was premeditated?<br/><br/>Spielberg has said that he added in extra twists and turns as the book didn't have enough...that's bogus.  Anderton suspected even his 'loving' wife of possibly framing him in the book, or was it Witwer, or was it... plenty of twists.  Anderton electing, at the very end of the book, to go through with the actual killing, was also very interesting.<br/><br/>I feel bad for Spielberg.  He's washed up.  He hasn't made a decent flick since the 90's.  I just hope he doesn't ruin any more of my favorite books or short stories."

","But alas, this one does.<br/><br/>First of all, there's no point reading this if you've not seen the film unless you trust me entirely. I'm reviewing this to broadcast my opinion to those who may not realise its two critical errors.<br/><br/>FIRSTLY. John Anderton discovers, with the help of the precogs, that he will kill Leo Crow (a man he does not even know). This is the ONLY THING that causes Anderton to go looking for his victim. In other words the precogs led HIM to the discovery of the man he is supposed to murder. Without the aid of the precogs, Anderton would not have gone looking for Crow and would therefore have committed no murder. So why was one predicted?<br/><br/>SECONDLY. At the end, when Lamarr Burgess is face to face with Anderton, Anderton gives Burgess a lecture in how he can change his future if he wants to, saying ""No doubt the precogs have already seen this"". But how would Burgess know he was supposed to kill Anderton? Did he see the pre-vision? Did Anderton see it? No. Therefore neither of them knew for sure that Burgess would kill Anderton. In the end, Burgess turns the gun on himself. Which means that he was never destined to kill Anderton. The precogs could have refrained from making the prediction and it would have made no difference. So, again, why was this murder predicted?<br/><br/>This isn't even taking into account other, smaller, yet silly flaws, such as: why was the missing person's case of Anne Lively never pursued? Or why didn't anyone else in Pre-crime remove Anderton's security clearance (he was still able to get through the doors by the use of his eyes)?<br/><br/>Poor, poor film. Probably the worst I've ever seen in terms of storyline."

Why is it that he thinks that we should have to struggle to make out what the characters are saying?<br/><br/>That said it wasn't a 'bad' film; just clichÃ©d with some glaring plot holes and a 'hidden' villain who was identifiable in the first ten minutes. Tom Cruise didn't do too badly with the part, but then he is at his best with vapid 'techie' action heroes.

","I really do not understand the critical acclaim this film is receiving. (I may give away some of the story, so only continue if you know it.)  It started big, and then fizzled away into nothing.  People claim that it is intellectual, that it makes you think-but I can't disagree more.  After A.I., Spielberg is now attempting to take the place in our cinematic world of Stanley Kubrick, stooping so low as to add a lame pastiche of Clockwork Orange.  Spielberg is not Kubrick, and this film is far from intellectual. The strands of the plot, such as the entire concept of the minority report, fizzle out and are not picked up again.  The correlation to the current terrorism problem is cute, but not really there.  This is a situation where people can actually see the future (and I might add that their ""slavery"" to this cause is also not addressed-the Pre-cogs are completely de-humanized into alien-like, pale-faced victims that are not really treated like victims).  At the end of the film I really didn't care about the girl whose mother was murdered by the leader of the Pre-Crime organization.  Sure, it was kind of cool to watch, but I think this is another Spielberg film that wows us with really cool effects, what turns out to be a cheesy plot, and the usual happy-dappy American ending.  I am constantly amazed at how Spielberg seems to fool the critics into thinking he is good, that he produces work that makes you think-when it never does.

"auberus","6","4","5","24 July 2002"," A nice visualization for a movie with no Vision
","In the summer 2002 ""everybody run"", so I ran to see Minority Report the 42nd movie of Mr. Spielberg (as a director) after the disappointing A.I. in 2001. Mr. Spielberg is part of those directors to whom you will always give a chance no matter what. Unfortunately this ""no matter what"" just happen once again with Minority Report. The main concept of the movie is the obsession of vision / visualization. In fact the dynamic between vision and visualization is the dialectic, the key that we need to take the movie a little step further. The movie describes how a vision is generated then visualized and finally how this visualization is rationalized and used: triplets mutants lying in a bathtub filed of amniotic fluid generate visions of future crimes that are visualize on a screen and organized by John Anderton (chief police Tom Cruise) in order to find clues that will help the pre-crime department to arrest the suspect/convict before the crimes are committed. Obviously Mr. Spielberg tried here to raise some fundamentals questions: 1)Isn't the concept of Justice linked (in theory) with the concept of certitude? In other words is what we see always certain or subject to interpretation? 2)Isn't Justice supposedly ""blind"" but however subjective in essence? 3)What degree of freedom are we willing to give up in exchange of safety? Meaning, who is suppose to watch the people who are watching us...isn't it a dynamic base on a ""vicious circle"" principle? The positive thing about Minority Report is that the movie lays out pretty well those questions and do so through an almost perfect visualization on screen. The picture is perfect: very nice bleached blue grain reinforce the ""cold techno"" ton of the movie. The acting is nothing special but still can be ranked as good. Some scenes are just a jewel and are very powerful: to note the floor by floor identity check by the robot spiders. However Minority report has 2 major problems. The first one is the lack of originality. The picture grain is the same as in ""A.I"", the cars reminded me of ""Tron"", the police squad erupting from the roof are straight from ""Brazil"", even the ""film noir"" atmosphere that Spielberg wanted to impose is a re-creation from ""Blade Runner"". The second problem lies in the scenario itself. The concept of the triplets who can visualize the future is a little bit hard to believe: their visions are limited to a certain area (why?) and they can only see crimes (why?). Above all the personal story of John Anderton (Tom Cruise) completely lacks of depth and ends in a fire works of cheesiness with a sparkle of ""zero-creativity"" stained with ""uselessness"". I mentioned that this movie is about vision and visualization. Mr. Spielberg is a master of visualization, unfortunately he did not have any vision for this movie. The same way he invited the audience to run he ran for an easy success but forgot that in sci-fi, Vision is about re-inventing the genre. As a result we have a nice movie but not a masterpiece."

","I went to see ""Minority Report"" as a Philip Dick fan, not for Tom Cruise. <br/><br/>As soon as I heard he was cast, I knew he was either mis-cast or the movie would substantially change the original story. Ed Harris would have been a brilliant choice for Dick's intent in showing a mid-life crisis of faith with bureaucracy, and more logically setting up the conflict with his older (Max von Sydow as his usual craggy self) and younger (terrifically aggressive Colin Farrell) competitors.<br/><br/>In Dick's story the titular discovery is a shocking revelation of the bankruptcy of policy-making behind bureaucratic intent, whereas here it's just a means to an end for Cruise's character to clear his name. Instead we get an action story that grafts Dick's story outline onto a tribute to George Lucas's brilliant student thesis project ""THX-1138,"" which he himself later expanded into a feature film; I always cite those films as the best visual analysis of bureaucracy. I guess Spielberg wasn't satisfied that we never really knew what the politics were in Lucas's films so he provides explicit reasons via a personal rather than systemic conspiracy theory for the chase and an optimistic conclusion.<br/><br/>On its own, we get a rippling Hollywood chase movie with a soupcon of the old ""The X Files"" paranoia, now newly relevant about our Justice Dept. arresting people, and even several laughs.<br/><br/>The cinematography for the future is wonderfully metallic and there's so many clever CGI's that the long credits list three ""in memoriam""s to colleagues.<br/><br/>Lois Smith is very effective as a cynical inventor, reminding me of the last time an older woman made a key appearance in a sci fi epic, ""Outland"" in a role not necessarily written for a woman.<br/><br/>John Williams's music is interferingly bombastic.<br/><br/>(originally written 7/5/2002)"

"alafolle","7","9","15","13 January 2003"," Should have been much better...
","This was an enjoyable movie, but ultimately disappointing because it should have been a truly memorable film.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg should simply steer clear of any story that contains the slightest element of film noir.  His directing style is completely unsuited to this type of project.  This movie careens wildly between noir imagery and heartstring-tugging sentimentalism, between stylish action sequences and bubble-gum.  It never builds any lasting tension.  It never takes the time to revel in its glorious futurish sets.  The camera rarely steps back from its claustrophobic POV to give us a sense of atmosphere.  Spielberg is always more interested in pushing his viewers' emotional buttons than in creating a coherent work of art.  This impulse serves him well when making family-oriented movies, but it has haunted him in his recent efforts to make serious adult-minded films.<br/><br/>To the extent that ""Minority Report"" succeeds in engaging us, it owes a great debt to its source material.  Phillip K. Dick's short story, upon which the movie is based, was one of his classic brain-teasers.  In the future, murders can be predicted in advance and prevented... but only if people are willing to cede many cherished safeguards of freedom to a creepily totalitarian government agency.  It's a thought-provoking concept that the movie fleshes out fairly nicely... until a completely unnecessary and haphazardly tacked-on ending sequence opens up mile-wide plot holes and dilutes the impact of Dick's message.<br/><br/>This film worked best when it stepped away from its narrow storyline and engaged us with its its vision of 2053 America.  The billboards which scan people's retinas and deliver individually-tailored ad pitches were a nice Orwellian touch.  The oddball side characters (especially Peter Stormare as a creepy black-market eye surgeon) lent a unique character to the movie. The cyberpunkish set design was generally quite good.  Unfortunately, the strengths of ""Minority Report"" were consistently undercut by its uneven direction and the weaknesses in the script.<br/><br/>This is what happens when a good film gets Spielberged.<br/><br/>
I think most people will enjoy this movie, just don't set your expectations too high.  And don't think too hard about how much better it could have been in the hands of a truly edgy and daring filmmaker."
"jordanbeaver","4","6","9","2 October 2003"," Overhyped.. Undermade.
","Worst Spielburg yet? I think so.  I've had never turned off/walked out of a Spielburg film until last night.  With me, Spielburg has always been a hit or miss director, but his misses have never been so wide as with Minority Report.  After a few hours (I watched another, much better film) I returned to where I'd left off in Minority Report and was pleased to see that the film did improve (however slightly) during the latter half.<br/><br/>The first image the audience is handed in watching Minority Report is a robotic lathe that looks like it was drawn up with some 10 year old CAD software by a drafter bent on one night of heavy drinking.  This special effects showcase was off to a bad start to say the least.  In fact.. the only special effects worth giving merit were the ""spiders"".  The entire world's ability to go from muted color sharp photography in one frame to air-brushed soft focus (and poorly textured) CGI in the next was staggering. One minute I'm watching a grungy cop flick.. the next I'm watching Blues Clues as our hero pretends to jump from one moving vehicle to another without drawing undue attention to himself.  I kept waiting for him to miss his mark.. look at the camera.. and then, upon looking down, fall with the full Looney Toon orchestral accompanyment.  I couldn't suspend my disbelief for an instant.. special effects?  3/10<br/><br/>One of the worst sins of this flick was the touchless interface used in the pre-homicide detective's work area.  Sure.. it looks cool... I thought we'd be in for a real treat when the lights dimmed, Cruise lowered his head, raised his arms, and we saw a spectrograph form across the middle of the screen.  I figured Spielburg would incorporate some music after creating such an image of a Hi-Tech conductor.  No.. no.. instead we see yard-long hand motions made to do the same functions (select, drag, zoom, focus) I can do with my mouse, one hand, and 12-18 square inches of area to move within. If you're going to create a futuristic computer interface, at least try to make it more practical than what we currently have.  A keypad, a mouse and two jog-wheels would have made the whole process 10x more productive.  The set being filled with lexan screens that were glued together with ugly, poorly formed seams was a letdown as well.  I figured the future would have something better to offer.<br/><br/>The storyline was very contrived, yet used very basic character generalizations.  There was nothing difficult to figure out since every aspect of the plot was spoonfed to you, so the intellectual aspect was ruined.. if you try to actually sink your brain into the intricacies of the plot, you see it holds less water than a sieve.<br/><br/>Anderton undergoes 12-16hours of pain to have his eyeballs swapped out, so that he won't be IDed by the sensors in every public domain.. only to whip out his old eyes (during one extremely pointless scene) so that he can scan himself into the Pre-Crime headquarters.  Good thing he got those new eyes... or ..or else  *shrug*  Anderton purposefully enters the room where he's been fated to murder someone (with the murder weapon armed) simply because he's a moron... There is no reason established for him to enter the room, other than to advance the already disgusting plot.<br/><br/>Didn't know Colin Farrell was in this one until I saw him step into view.. If that was his first mainstream exposure to an American audience, I bet he's glad some people saw him in good flicks like Tigerland before passing judgement... what a poor role.<br/><br/>Bottom Line:  Cold pointless summer flick that doesn't hold a candle to most others in the special effects, action or philosophical realms. Tripe."
"Li-1","Null","6","9","9 May 2003"," A sci-fi thriller that's actually intelligent and exciting.
","**** out of ****<br/><br/>If not for Kurt Wimmer's fabulous Equilibrium, Minority Report would probably be my choice for (so far) the best sci-fi thriller of the decade. Pretty hefty statement, I realize, but Minority Report's a pretty hefty movie, one that plays as an innovative mix of futuristic sci-fi and film-noir. And I'm a little surprised nobody prior to Steven Spielberg has tried for for a similar formula (cases have been made for Blade Runner and Dark City, though I can't entirely agree).<br/><br/>Minority Report is set in the year 2054, a future that, outside of the roads and constant eye-scans, still visually resembles the present (or the past, in this movie's case). Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton, one of the heads of Pre-Crime, a division in Washington, D.C. that has the ability to stop murders before they happen, thanks to the work of three Pre-Cogs, psychics (two male and one female) permanently placed in a watery bath, delivering info about the future to the Pre-Crime division (just how it's done is revealed in a very clever and tense opening sequence).<br/><br/>
Anyway, there's a debate over whether or not Pre-Crime should go national, and it's something that the people are going to vote on. The creator of this division, Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow), is a bit wary of the FBI agent (Colin Farrell) sent to investigate the way the division operates and the possible infallibilities.<br/><br/>Anderton himself has a bit of a mess in his personal life. He lost his son six years ago, is divorced, and is addicted to illegal drugs. But matters grow even worse when the Pre-Cogs' latest vision displays a pre-meditated murder (unsurprisingly stated as a rarity in D.C.) and the killer happens to be Anderton himself! Going on the run, Anderton struggles to escape his old teammates and discover the truth behind this vision; is it a mistake or a genuine view of a nightmarish destiny?<br/><br/>First off, let me say hats off to Steven Spielberg. The man's always had unfounded criticism tossed at him with virtually every film he's ever made. It's nice to see he's never dissuaded (or influenced) by such complaints, he's a filmmaker who's always crafted his films with a touch of confidence and genuine emotion that few directors could even hope to achieve in decades worth of work (in case you can't tell, I'm a Spielberg fan, meaning I've just incurred the wrath of David Lynch lovers).<br/><br/>Spielberg's work here is, right off the bat, much unlike anything I've ever seen him do. Sure, there was A.I., but not a segment in that film resembled Minority Report's opening scenes, a montage of quick-cuts awash in blue colors that builds in both violence and intensity, in spite of the fact this sequence moves backward (meaning the violent act is committed first, then we see what led up to it). The segment ends with a close-up of an eye, with the camera pulling back to reveal a woman lying in a pool, ominously stating the word, ""murder."" It's a chilling, daring intro that holds a lot of promise, and instead of disappointing, the rest of the film actually manages to improve upon it.<br/><br/>The future that Spielberg presents here is entirely believable, from both a societal and technological viewpoint. Most interestingly, when I first saw the previews, I'd expected a ""Big Brother"" type society akin to 1984, one in which the government monitored all the actions of the people. But that's not the case here. The government presented here questions the ethics and logic behind Pre-Crime because if this were reality, it would be a subject matter of serious concern, and not just hive-minded behavior and blather about how this is for the good of humanity. Finally, we get a film that features a dark view of the future, but simultaneously gives us reasonable, intelligent characters that realize there are pros and cons to everything.<br/><br/>On a dramatic level, Minority Report delivers with as much resonance as A.I., and maybe even moreso when you factor in just how coherently and cleverly Spielberg and the writers tie all the subplots together. The emotional baggage is handled mostly by Tom Cruise, who does quite an admirable job; maybe that's an understatement, like the man or not, he delivers one of the better performances I've seen all year.  In vital supporting roles, Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton shine with charismatic and powerfully dramatic performances, respectively.<br/><br/>Plot-wise, the film is on solid ground with a few admittedly major stumbles. One of the movie's narrative burners is the move to make Pre-Crime national, which when you consider the logistics, is almost impossible (3 pre-cogs, an entire country, the cops have to decipher the location through the visual clues; let's face it, you'd need thousands of pre-cogs to pull it off). (Major spoiler here) The film's big plot twist, while fairly surprising and thought-provoking, doesn't completely hold water. It's a nice, well-done time loop, but if you consider what happens, then by that basis, I'd suspect a LOT of people could just as easily be accused of murder on such thin ground.<br/><br/>Whether or not Minority Report would appeal to the traditional summer crowd is a little iffy. There's not a whole lot of action (though the jetpack chase/car factory fight is one of the most hectic, exciting action scene I've seen all year, probably surpassed only by the climactic battle in Equilibrium), the story requires undivided attention (and maybe even a repeat viewing to gather in all the themes), and the downbeat, almost pessimistic tone will throw a lot of viewers off. But for those who do get caught up in this twisty tale (and that should apply to most people), Minority Report offers a lot of rewards, more than you could reasonably expect from a big-budget blockbuster.<br/><br/>A lot of people see Minority Report as a warning for how far technology could go and bite us back. While such a statement works to an extent for A.I., Report is mostly about morals, accepted ethics, and an intriguing look on just how far people are willing to go for their own survival in this ""winner takes all"" society. As far as science fiction goes, the genre hasn't been this damned smart and thought-provoking since Dark City."
"bluenotejazz-64946","6","2","2","21 June 2020"," Looks like I'M in the minority here...
","Based on the mostly positive reviews for this, it looks like I'm in the minority here (wink), because I don't think that this film quite worked the way it should have, or the way it could have. It's quite rare that I leave a moviegoing experience feeling dissatisfied, but I think that the movie set high expectations with a very cool premise, but then lost it in a mess. I can break down my thoughts into two categories:<br/><br/>
1. Plot<br/><br/>The notion of ""precrime"" is pretty slick, and I don't mind that the first 20 minutes of the movie spend time explaining and demonstrating it. But it sets rules and guidelines that are ultimately broken by the end, leaving me quite confused as to why I should buy into these plot points in the first place. I don't really find myself feeling like they are plot holes, but more that the premise becomes loose and messy. To be reductive, in a movie where beings are predicting the future, there really shouldn't be too many surprises or plot twists, right?<br/><br/>2. Tone<br/><br/>This is what stuck out to me first. This movie plays it pretty straight, and doesn't have comic relief characters (like Goldblum in ""Jurassic Park). So when the first big fight scene breaks out, the tone shifts and things start to get quite silly (bumping a breakfast table, interrupting a student practicing saxophone), and then all of a sudden it feels like ""Men in Black."" I welcome moments of levity, but the ones here did not feel earned. Any cheerful or ""funny"" moments really stuck out from the rest of the film.<br/><br/>I won't dock it any points for weird SFX or anything, even if I think that the ""conducting"" while using touchscreens looks super forced and unnatural.<br/><br/>Ultimately, its 145-minute runtime allows it to explore more plot twists. The movie doesn't necessarily feel long or slow, but it does have a moment towards the end where it felt like it should have ended. I think the script was trying to do way too much, and resulted in having four separate stories that barely dovetail gracefully.<br/><br/>I don't feel inclined to give Spielberg or a Williams much credit here. I think there are some cool sci-fi moments, and some good performances (though I don't think that anyone delivers a Top-5 performance here), and that's why I feel like a 6/10 rating is appropriate."

"bkoganbing","7","2","2","23 May 2016"," Interpretations
","It's the year 2054 and mankind through the good graces of pioneering criminologist Max Von Sydow we're about to abolish crime all together. Von Sydow employs three psychics, no doubt the three best in the world and while it looks life is a pretty dull thing for them, spending all that time in water the better to receive images they're doing yeoman service to mankind anticipating murders to come. Right at the beginning of the film we see them in action as police are dispatched to capture Arye Gross as he's about to murder his wife and her boy toy.<br/><br/>But some disturbing images come in regarding police chief Tom Cruise murdering a man who he doesn't even know. Now Cruise is a Richard Kimble like fugitive and he hasn't done the terrible deed he's supposed to do. But one of the water bound psychics turns in a different interpretation of the images she sees. It's that Minority Report that Cruise is interested in so Samantha Morton is taken by Tom who wants very much to find out what's going so he can alter his destiny if possible.<br/><br/>I won't say more other than destinies can be altered and images can be manipulated and wrongly interpreted by some malevolent forces at work.<br/><br/>Cruise and Von Sydow and the rest of the cast turn in some fine performances for Steven Spielberg. And Spielberg's own vision of the future is fascinating. I did love those images of horses making a comeback as a method of transportation. I'm guessing that fossil fuels had polluted the planet enough and we wanted biodegradable waste once again.<br/><br/>Science fiction is always interesting, even the worst future films offer us someone's vision of the future be Steven Spielberg or Ed Wood. Spielberg at least has the talent to bring it off.<br/><br/>And maybe crime prevention taken to its ultimate is not such a good thing. Watch Minority Report and see how you feel."

Dystopia does not need a happy ending. But far worse, do we really need to find out that the abused human crime sensors, who have spent a life immersed in an isolation tank, get to live happily ever after in a cozy cottage? In AI, a whole half hour finale separated the film from Kubrickian quality. Here it's only 10 minutes, but entropy being what it is, 10 minutes of garbage can destroy 2 hours of vision quite easily.<br/><br/>And what a vision it is. Cruise as a detective bereft of his son, himself a son-figure to the fatherly von Sydow who developed a crime prediction program that arrests murderers before they get a chance to carry out their crime. When Cruise is on the verge of discovering how his mentor pulled off a premeditated murder to save the program, Von Sydow uses Cruise's dead son against him, and the detective becomes a hunted man. Crime mystery, action and science fiction are deftly blended in the plot, in the set design, and even in minor characters like the woman geneticist who surrounds herself with flesh-eating plants, or the eye transplant doctor who had a previous encounter with Cruise: Cruise comes begging to him to avoid detection by the ubiquitous eye scanners of the future. Silly action like Cruise escaping 10x by a hair trapped inside a car assembled by industrial robots does not help the film, pulling you out of the sense of futuristic reality created by the cinematography.<br/><br/>So, good, but not great. When Spielberg makes Ubiq, I hope he just sticks with Dick's story, without the alternate ending. Philip K. Dick is already 'alternate' enough as it is."

","John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the service of precrime in Wanshington, tries to prove his innocence against a system which has indicated him as a future murderer. <br/><br/>In Order to give life to a rather pessimistic universe, from the American writer Philip K.

At least after a while you feel the same agony about the hero."
"zetes","7","9","16","18 July 2002"," Good, but very, very flawed
","Steven Spielberg has made a couple of clunkers in his career, that's for sure. When sitting through Hook or The Lost World: Jurassic Park II, it's difficult to believe that the same man who made Jaws or E.T. or Close Encounters had a hand in them. Most of Spielberg's output, though, has been fantastic. Despite the occasional 1941, his films, even when flawed, soar above the average film. Minority Report falls into the category of fantastic and soaring, yet deeply flawed.<br/><br/>Minority Report is, above all else, an enormously entertaining film. I personally like actioners and thrillers and sci-fi, and Minority Report fits well into all these categories. There are a couple of action set pieces that are simply amazing, like the chase through the car factory or the spider scene. Unfortunately, in the idea department, the film is kind of a dud. Critics have immediately pointed to the politics of today to show how prescient Minority Report is, but no matter how large and powerful the intelligence industry gets I seriously don't believe that we'll ever live in a world where, even if it were possible to predict crime, law enforcement could arrest someone for a crime they were about to commit. And then, without a trial, apparently, they not only imprison the pre-perpetrators, but they encase them in suspended animation goo, apparently forever. At least they never say whether these prisoners are ever to be released. I mean, what happened to correctional institutions! And, what's worse, almost every perpetrator chooses to murder for reasons of passion since everyone knows that it's impossible to commit premeditated murder. That means that a man who was about to stab his wife and her lover with a pair of scissors - a horrific but understandable crime - is doomed to never see the light of day again (apparently). And I haven't even mentioned the time frame: this story takes place in just over 50 years from now. It specifically states that the ACLU still exists. Perhaps if the film took place a hundred and fifty years from now and the ACLU had been disbanded or something (with some heavy explanations in that department), I may have bought the story. The screenwriters never come close to making the situation believable.<br/><br/>And even if it weren't so unbelievable, the film has dozens of flaws besides that, and several poor, not very well thought out scenes. For example, the crimes are predicted by three psychics whose origins are dubiously explained. Part of the plot of the film is that this Pre-Crime department is supposed to expand nation-wide. The three pre-cogs are supposed to be the only ones alive, so where are they going to get others to predict the murders of every other city in the United States? These three only cover Washington D.C. I assume they aren't going to now cover the entire country (and soon, the world!). Okay, so maybe more exist. Perhaps I misunderstood that part of the exposition (which is generally very bad in this film). But if these three cover a populace only as big as the capital, they're going to need hundreds if not thousands of pre-cogs, and the three that they show in the movie seem to be so important and irreplaceable that the logistics of the project seem completely unfeasible. Then there's a scene where Tom Cruise kidnaps one of the pre-cogs to help him avoid the murder that he is accused of having been about to commit. First of all, you must know that the three pre-cogs are kept in a sort of sensory-deprivation chamber where they are suspended in a vat of liquid nutrients that is supposed to foster their psychic abilities. So Cruise kidnaps Agatha the pre-cog and escapes from the authorities in a ridiculous manner (there's apparently a drain in the bottom of the pool big enough for two people to slide down; the Pre-Crime division must have a hell of a time preventing the pre-cogs from accidentally being flushed in the first place!). Agatha, for the first time in a long while, begins to exist in the present. Then there's this scene in the mall, where she is able to protect Cruise by predicting every second of what's going to happen. She couldn't even do anything near this in the nutrient bath, and even there she could only see one thing: murders; but outside of it she sees every single thing that's ever going to happen. It just doesn't make any sense. And then there are the poorly calculated scenes. The scene with Peter Stormare (Fargo) as a black market surgeon makes little sense. It's completely ridiculous and also rather foul. The writers set up a whole history for this character, but don't follow up on it at all. And Cruise's whole backstory is very lame. Has every single individual who works for any law enforcement body had a child or wife who was murdered?<br/><br/>
All the good stuff in Minority Report is technical. It's often beautifully done. Spielberg's direction is often fantastic. The set designs are miraculous - it would be insulting if it didn't get nominated for an Oscar in this department - as is the cinematography (a very beautiful, bleached look). The acting I would rate as merely adequate. Tom Cruise's character is not developed well enough, and therefore the performance isn't anything special. Max von Sydow, as nice as it is to see him in a summer blockbuster, has a very stereotypical role. Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou?), as Gideon, the warden of all the criminal tubes, should have been axed. Nelson is totally wrong for the movie. The only great performance in the film comes from Samantha Morton, who plays Agatha. She is amazing at times.<br/><br/>Many critics have praised this, saying that it's a great rebound after the failure of A.I. That's so incredibly insulting. A.I. is by far the superior of the two. Overall, Minority Report is a fun movie when you're watching it, but the more I think about it, the more my opinion shrinks. I give it a 7/10. Good entertainment, far too many flaws to even count. I think I could go on for days pointing them out."
"gojiraskreeonk","1","9","16","28 June 2002"," Spielberg has lost the magic.
","Let me start by saying that I think Philip K. Dick is one of the best science fiction writers ever. Conceptually he is matched only by such greats as Frank Herbert (Dune), Robert Heinlein (Stranger in a Strange Land), and Isaac Asimov (Foundation). Typically, his books have turned into some pretty good movies. Bladerunner (based on his  novel 'Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep) is one of the better Sci-Fi movies out there. Even the under-the-radar Screamers was a pretty good movie. That's why it's such a shame that Minority Report, which had a huge budget and big names, was so bad. I must admit that I liked the way the movie looked. The effects were certainly top notch and the 'washed out' look definitely made things more interesting. There were also a lot of great ideas concerning what advertising might become in the next few decades. But the movie just loses its focus within the first half hour. Let's not forget that this is based on a SHORT STORY, not a novel. At more than two and a half hours, the movie takes longer to watch than the story does to read. Why? Spielberg Padding. He just can't let it die. So, now you've got a really long movie that drags because it doesn't have enough story to support it. This would leave us with something mediocre that I would have enjoyed, just not enough. Unfortunately, ,it gets so much worse. At some point or another it was decided that this dark film noir-esque movie should have some slapstick humor thrown in. This is where things go from boring to painful. In one scene Tom Cruise has some eyeballs in a bag which he needs to sneak into somewhere. That part makes sense. It's just the shot of him scampering down the hallway chasing the eyes as they roll away from him that reminds me of the Keystone Kops which bothers me so much. How about during the intense jetpack fight when some burgers get singed from the action? These stupid scenes don't constitute a majority of the movie, just enough to make you really question what the hell they were thinking. And in the end, that's what I walked out of the movie asking myself. What the hell were they thinking?<br/><br/>Good: Special effects, film's look, some of the acting (not much though) Bad: Everything else.<br/><br/>If you thought Independence Day was a great movie, then go see this. If you though BladeRunner was a great movie, rent that instead."

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","6","10","20 August 2008"," A beautiful, intelligent science fiction film, and certainly one of Spielberg's best
","Although Spielberg has made several genre films, none of them have approached the intelligence and sophistication of his two successive sci-fi masterworks, ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and ""Minority Report"". Although ""AI"" is certainly an impressive film, ""Minority Report"" was the film which simply wowed me in theaters and did so every time I saw it after that. This stunningly tense and thrilling look at the judicial system in the near future could have been a simple action thriller but ends up a spectacular, unique mesh of genres. If I had to I'd label it I'd say it was a futuristic sci-fi mystery noir with hints of the sort of social drama Norman Jewison and Sidney Lumet would pull off occasionally. Then there's the whole humor angle too. The bottom line is that ""Minority Report"" is wonderfully unique. There's films similar to it, but nothing will give you quite the same feeling you'll get from watching this.<br/><br/>This decade has been simply tremendous for Spielberg. With the possible exception of ""Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull"" (a fun summer film, perhaps, but one obviously made without any real artistic purpose), Spielberg has made nothing but extraordinary, wonderful films this decade, with ""Catch Me if You Can"" seeing the light-hearted Spielberg at his absolute best and ""Munich"", ""AI"", and ""Minority Report"" all being astonishingly strong and important films. What's most refreshing about his work this decade is that little of it seems lazy. There's real inspiration here, a real sense of enthusiasm and devotion.<br/><br/>The screenplay is wonderful, combining intense drama, some action, a serious examination of some real social issues, and even a little bit of humor. This is the sort of science fiction we ought to see more of, the sort that leaves one thinking well after they have finished viewing the film. The characters are well-developed and interesting, the plot (all you should know before seeing the film is that it involves pre-crime, a crime-fighting system which allows the authorities to see murders before they occur and stop them) is well thought-out, involving, and unique, the dialogue is sharp, the world well-developed and just quirky enough to be both tremendously entertaining and believable.<br/><br/>A film that juggles so many elements, such a complicated storyline and mythology, and so many characters as gracefully and skillfully as ""Minority Report"" does is rare, and it is proof of Spielberg's immense skill as director that he manages to do this, especially given how radically different not only the material but also the technical aspect of the film is to most of his earlier films. There's some stuff in this film that Spielberg probably hadn't even thought of doing before, and I don't doubt that this is partly a result of his partnership with cinematographer Janusz Kaminski. ""Minority Report"" looks like nothing Spielberg's done before (except for ""AI"", perhaps), and it's remarkable how well-realized this future world is and how stunning the visuals are. It is, quite simply, brilliant. <br/><br/>A technical and visual masterpiece, ""Minority Report"" also boasts a brilliant screenplay, making it an outstanding, unforgettable science fiction masterpiece that will almost certainly continue to inspire and enchant audiences for many, many years to come. If not, it will still always be one of my personal favorite films. <br/><br/>10/10"
"boort","2","6","10","14 March 2003"," Could it be a Screenplay Problem?
","*spoilers*<br/><br/>Minority report was an okay movie for the first while.  The last act really bombed.  Why?  I suspect it had to do with a hasty screenplay rewrite.  I'll bet anything that in the original draft of the screenplay, the man in the hotel room (Crow) really was the man who abducted our hero's son, he is shot dead on purpose, and the movie ends darkly.  Spielberg could not allow such a dark ending, so he ordered a hasty screenplay rewrite that tacks on an absurd fourth act, complete with jarring plotholes.  <br/><br/>Think about it. If the movie ended in the hotel room, without the lame conspiracy plot, all this movie's plotholes would be gone.  This is just another example of the way that Hollywood wrecks movies.  You couldn't possibly have a mainstream summer blockbuster if the main character was actually a murderer.  If the movie stars a criminal and has a sad ending, it would make less money.  Mom, Pop, little Billy and Spot wouldn't understand that.  They don't like criminals.  They like happy endings.  So it's worth it to ruin the story by adding a poorly thought out and overly long fourth act.  <br/><br/>It's disgusting.  Yet another symptom of what's wrong with America."

","This unimpressive science fiction film has an interesting premise, but ultimately fails to deliver anything more than an average cinematic experience. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, an expert cop in the field of pre-crime. Pre-crime is a method of catching criminals before they commit murder through the use of psychics. The society has been using this technology for some time and crime rates are at an all time low. Ironically he discovers that he will commit a murder in about a day, and the movie follows him as he tries to determine what will lead to this impending act, all the while his fellow comrades are hunting him down. It is a fascinating premise, but it just did not pull me in like other science fiction movies, such as `The Matrix'. The futuristic designs are impressive, and the acting is okay, but there was not enough to keep me immersed in the film due to the underdeveloped characters. Most of their actions and their motivations did not make any sense, and the plot seemed designed only to provide twists. It is almost like the writers thought of the plot twists before anything else, and then wrote the rest of the movie around them. It did make me think about the possible moral issues that would be raised if such a system crime was used to put people in jail, but the movie merely skimmed over these issues. Overall it was an okay film, but the plot twists were somewhat silly, and it dragged on because of pointless subplots."

","The year is 2054 and the murder rate in Washington is zero, the reason? Three Pre-Cognitives (each named after a literary great) whose combined abilities witness murders before they actually occur. Apparently faultless, it's then something of a surprise to Pre-Crime chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) when the Pre-Cogs predict he is to murder a man named Leo Crow. Forced to go on the run, and haunted by a family tragedy, Anderton must evade the system he so perfectly executed himself. Can he find a flaw? Or is he actually about to commit a murder?<br/><br/>Everybody Runs! That was the tag line that accompanied the explosive trailer for Steven Spielberg's, Tom Cruise starrer, Minority Report. This marketing tool indicated that the great bearded one had adapted from the Phillip K Dick short story and created an action monster? He hadn't, he had in fact created something far far better than popcorn fodder.<br/><br/>Minority Report was the next project for Spielberg following the equally dark and intriguing AI: Artificial Intelligence, both films serving to note that Spielberg was capable of thought provoking science fiction outside of the standard crowd pleasers that many critics love to decry. In fact, it's arguable that Spielberg may have hit his creative peak with Minority Report, for the messages and crawling dystopian bleakness on show paint a picture not so much as a future far away in our lives, but of one we live in now. Big thematic points of reference dot themselves throughout the piece. Such as the changing of eye balls, or that in these post 9/11 years we yearn, and always will, to be safer.<br/><br/>Here in this bleached shadowy world, a world of metallic tones and visual stings (ace cinematographer Janusz Kaminski on duty), we are safe under Pre-Crime. Yet still it's a world without soul, it has no heart, it's almost as if inhuman in itself, suggesting that the World's problems are not easily vanquished by technology - a total sacrifice of the World's inhabitant's souls. Spielberg of course is well served by the supreme professionals he has at his disposal, he has also managed to garner a great performance from Tom Cruise, something that critic and fan favourite directors have not managed to do previously. Believable grief, action work as strong as ever, it is however with his ability to imbue a tortured film noir protagonist where Cruise excels the most.<br/><br/>Alongside Cruise and operating with great impact are Samantha Morton as Pre-Cog Agatha and Max Von Sydow, the latter adding that touch of experienced know how needed for his particularly important character. The odd casting choice appeared to be Colin Farrell as the meddling, almost vindictive Danny Witwer, but he plays well off of Cruise, this even if he veers dangerously close to comic book villainy at times (check out a holy smoke Batman scene). What action there is is first rate, from a jet back pack pursuit, to car jumping heroics, the sequences are crafted with Spielberg's deft eye for an action sequence. While the sick sticks (yes you read right) metal spiders and a brilliant Peter Stormare cameo should hopefully have you squirming and grinning in equal measure.<br/><br/>Which brings us to the finale, an ending that may not be a complete surprise (yet it still doesn't cop-out in context to Anderton's tragedy), but things are rounded off in true classic noir tradition, where it closes down a thinking man's tech-noir. Superb. 9/10"
"jhclues","7","3","4","8 August 2002"," A ""Minor"" Success for Spielberg
","Preventative maintenance can go a long way in getting a lot of extra miles out of that new car, and without question, applying the same principles to health care can add years to your life.  That's what `prevention' is all about; averting disaster and tragedy by taking measures to stop it before it happens.  It's certainly not a unique concept, by any means (at least when it comes to things like cars and health care), but what about in terms of crime?  Murder, for example; can there possibly be a way to anticipate and prevent even that?  It's a proposition that director Steven Spielberg addresses in `Minority Report,' a drama/thriller set in the near future, in which a kind of `HMO for Crime' has been established that does just that:  A system that unerringly predicts and prevents murder.  But just how accurate is it, really?  Can such an operation be infallible beyond any doubt? That-- as they say-- is the question.<br/><br/>In Washington D.C., 2054, a `PreCrime' unit has been in operation for some six years now, under the leadership of Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).  Using a system whereby murder can be detected before it happens-- and thus averted-- the unit has successfully eliminated that particular crime in the D.C. area.  One of the driving forces behind it all is Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who has something of a vested interest in making this system work:  Just before the inception of this revolutionary unit, Anderton suffered a tragedy in his own life; the kind of tragedy he hopes that no one else will ever have to endure again because of their efforts here.<br/><br/>Anderton's unit has been something of a prototype, however, and with the success rate they have enjoyed, the U.S. government is interested in taking the project nationwide.  But they want to look a little deeper into the operation first, and so agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is dispatched to investigate and root out any potential flaws that may have been overlooked on the local level.  Burgess and Anderton maintain that the system is infallible, but then something happens-- Anderton himself is `seen' committing a murder in the near future.  And it's going to happen in about thirty-six hours...<br/><br/>With films like `Schindler's List' and `Saving Private Ryan,' Steven Spielberg has long since established himself as one of the `Greats' among film directors.  Much of his success comes from the fact that he likes to tell stories about `people,' and he always manages to find the human element within the story that make his films so engaging.  Even the best filmmaker, however, is not going to produce a work of genius every time out; just as within every human being there is `good' cholesterol and `bad' cholesterol, so it must be with the films of an artist of Spielberg's magnitude-- it is natural that his resume will include both.  And this film-- which, without question is a good film-- is just not as compelling as some of his previous efforts.  One of the reasons, I think, is that it is an inherently dark tale, and Spielberg is by nature too positive to take it to the depths that would have really made it emotionally absorbing.  <br/><br/>As good as Spielberg is at exploring the complexities of human nature, he tends to get distracted by the environment within he must work to tell certain stories (like this one).  He seems to have an innate aversion to things too dark, at which times he seems to turn to the gadgets, toys and myriad F/X at his disposal for diversion, and quite frankly, his vision of the future in this film fails to evoke that necessary sense of disquiet or foreboding in the way that Ridley Scott did so successfully in `Blade Runner,' for example.  The `look' of this film is more `amusement park ride' than the gritty realism of Scott's film.  Compare and consider the differences between this film and `A.I' (another film with a dark, decidedly `non-Spielbergian' theme), and `E.T' and `Close Encounters of the Third Kind.'  The latter, while falling within the Sci-fi genre, are basically upbeat, positive stories, with `E.T.,' especially, focusing on the characters rather than-- or at least equal to-- the events as they occur. And nobody does a film like that better than Steven Spielberg. <br/><br/>
This film was written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen, based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, and If only Spielberg (and the screenwriters) had been more willing to embrace the dark side of this story, he may have been able to create the kind of suspense that made `Jaws' so on-the-edge-of-your-seat riveting.  But, again-- though this is a decent movie-- it simply is not the taut thriller it could have been, like Tony Scott's `Enemy of the State,' which in many ways is similar to this film.  There again, the sense of paranoia and suspense Tony Scott achieved with his film was due to the fact that he embraced the darkness and immersed himself (and his film) in it.<br/><br/>
As Anderton, Tom Cruise gives a convincing performance and (as evidenced in `Vanilla Sky') he is continuing to mature as an actor.  His trademark smile is there, of course, but he is relying on it less and less, which is helping him to develop his characters with more depth and detail, as he does here with his portrayal of Anderton.<br/><br/>Max von Sydow, as usual, turns in a believable performance as Burgess, but the character is intrinsically stereotypical, and he simply isn't afforded the time to develop his portrayal much beyond that.  <br/><br/>The standout performances come from Colin Farrell, who lends some real nuance to his character and manages to make him truly three-dimensional; and from Samantha Morton, who creates the most emotionally involving character of the film with her portrayal of Agatha; and it's part of what makes `Minority Report' (like any Spielberg film-- even the `lesser' ones) worth the price of admission.  7/10."

","""Minority Report"" is a glossy, glimmery, gossamer, ultimately empty little flick: use it as a pretty screen saver on your 65"" Plasma HDTV while you're waiting to watch a better film. It's the cinematic equivalent of Japanese food: looks nice, smells nice, goes down easy, and 15 minutes later you'll be hungry again. There is, however, a slight catch. Like uber-Filmmeister Steven Spielberg's other mega-flop ""A.I."", ""Minority Report"" has already been done better, faster, smarter, and wiser: see ""Blade Runner"" for the soul-crushing dilemma of whether it's moral to use a machine to do things no human would do, or even ""Kafka"" for an incisive study into the guts of a society that would judge a victim guilty before a crime even occurs. So why give this pretty, shiny, happy, but empty movie even two stars? Because it has a singularly impressive, very nasty sick joke, played (best of all) on Tom Cruise. At one point in the flick, Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise playing Tom Cruise) goes to a black-market eyeball surgeon for a little much-needed wetware transplant. I love Peter Stormare: I usually relish his insanity, and in ""Minority Report"" he's in top form. That alone earns the flick gets one star. One extra star goes for the rotten ham sandwich in the refrigerator. Dr. Eddie leaves some milk and a fresh sandwich for his patient when he ultimately comes to his senses, then scoots: Cruise wakes up hours later, mostly blind, and staggers to the fridge for a little late night snack. Unfortunately for Cruise, Dr. Eddie isn't a very tidy housekeeper. See, there's a bottle of curdled milk and a rotten ham sandwich (evidently intended for an earlier patient), in close proximity to the fresh stuff. Moral: before eating the unidentified and sight-unseen ham sandwich in the underground surgeon's refrigerator, always do a smell-test. Where were we? Ah yes: the soul-crushing ethical dilemma is the new Department of Pre-Crime with its Amazing Young Men (and Woman) in their Psycho-tropic Fluid Machine, who can aid law enforcement in tracking down crime before it actually occurs! Call John Ashcroft! But wait a minute-you're not here to spend two hours wrestling with a soul-crushing moral and ethical dilemma concerning civil rights and free will, are you? Naw, man-you're here to see Tom Cruise and high-tech shiny things! And in that department ""Minority Report"" fulfills in spades. It's what would happen if ""Crate & Barrel"" had a movie for a twin sister. Tom Cruise does is spot-on in his one-note role as the obsessive Pre-Crime honcho Jon Anderton, and fingers those psych-profiles like a pro. Samantha Morton (Agatha) is spot-on in her one-note role as the pool-bound female psy-op, and proves girls just wanna have fun. Colin Farrel (Detective Witwer) is spot-on in his one-note role as the obsessive detective. Max Von Sydow (Director Burgess) is spot-on in his one-note role as the cackling founder of Pre-Crime with a deep dark secret (and a ridiculous plot twist). Neal McDonough (Officer Fletcher), as usual, gets no respect in his role as a tough-as-nails soldier, but does get a wild ride up to the top of the city with Tom Cruise, which is more than most can say. The futuristic Lexus Mark-12 is spot-on in its one-note role as the futuristic Lexus Mark-12. Again, it looks really pretty on a high-end plasma TV, and it's got Pete Stormare and a rotten ham-sandwich. You could do worse with your two hours. JSG"

"Chris Knipp","Null","4","6","24 June 2002"," A frigid blockbuster from a reformed sentimentalist
","Steven Spielberg is a popular artist of genius, a wildly ambitious filmmaker with some amazing contributions to latter day celluloid folk mythology, but his results are more hit-or-miss than his millions of fans seem to recognize.  Out of 44 directorial credits, roughly 13 might be worth remembering, and of those only a handful could qualify as imperishable popular art classics. When he scores, he scores big.  Sometimes, though, the score is more box office than artistic.  In between the `Close Encounters' and the `ETs` and `Schindler's Lists,' there are some clinkers, and sometimes, as in `Saving Private Ryan,' an unforgettable patch is weighed down by an uninteresting body, and at other times Spielberg's eagerness to please, his childlike sensibility, and his sentimentality can sink him. Spielberg's movies are behemoths technically, emotionally, and in their box office expectations.  They arouse great expectations in the public, too, and they can be exhaustingly disappointing.  `A.I.' was that for most people (those who even went to see it).  It's too long -it had about three equally elaborate endings - but I was one of the few who loved it and found it magical and deeply touching and think in time it will be recognized as a classic, however flawed, and a worthy homage to Kubrick.  `Minority Report,' made after long delays while The Great One was editing `A.I,' doesn't have the magic or the emotional power of its immediate predecessor, nor does it have the bite Spielberg thinks it has.  If it was conceived as an antidote, it doesn't work that way, because there's nothing cynical, nothing ironic, about this movie.<br/><br/>`Minority Report' is cold and uninvolving and borrows from so many sources it has no personality of its own. As a sci-fi action film noir story starring Tom Cruise, it's big box office and ought to do way better than `A.I.,' but it sadly does not stand out from the other summer blockbusters, some of which are definitely more fun.  The first problem with `Minority Report' from which all others flow is that this is another movie made from a story by Fifties sci-fi pulp great Philip K. Dick, a wrecked genius and a born cynic.  Spielberg is an optimist and a sentimentalist, if a reformed one, who is trying to make a `dirty' picture, something a lot rougher and nastier than `The Color Purple' and more sophisticated than `Jaws.' Unfortunately, though there is a special kind of craft visible here as always, the result is disappointingly ordinary and the plot is full of holes. Ridley Scott's `Blade Runner' may not do justice to Dick's ideas, but at least it captures a private eye tone and has great visual style, and its action is full of panache.  Visually, `Blade Runner' and `Brazil' are hard acts to follow, even for Spielberg.<br/><br/>By making us care about a robot boy so advanced he could love and seek love, `A.I.' made moral issues of future technology gut wrenching: can you just throw a creation like this is the junk pile, or dump it by the road like a stray dog?  It was the old dilemma of Frankenstein - whether man can play God without disastrous results. In `Minority Report' Spielberg seems to have grown cold to the very same moral issue of technology's eroding our humanity that exerted such a strong force in `A.I.'  In effect he has said in public that the recent curtailment of civil liberties in the US doesn't bother him because he feels it's necessary after September 11.  I guess that kind of attitude explains why `Minority Report' overlooks the real relevance of `pre-cogs' and `pre-crime' to the very up-to-date John Ashcroft world of racial profiling and wholesale roundups of guiltless `suspects.'  Maybe it's moral insensitivity to Philip K. Dick's story, and to the pessimism in Dick's view of the future, that has made `Minority Report's' elaborated story end up being so poorly constructed. Spielberg and his writers lost track of where the premise was pointing.<br/><br/>Typically Spielberg says he prepared for this movie by watching a lot of movies including film noir, Hitchcock, and John Huston, and he has incorporated elements of Ridley Scott, Gilliam, Kubrick, Huston, Hitchcock and bits of many other movies. Ultimately they are at best held together only by the force of Tom Cruise's personality and the propulsive energy of the action and the special effects - an energy that grows flaccid with the film's excessive length.  There are so many borrowings that `Minority Report' ends up seeming fussy and overcomplicated.  I left feeling tired and empty.  No real film noir would be half this long.  It's all so uneconomical, such a monumental waste of time and talent! Good film noir doesn't require a big budget.  Indeed, a big budget makes a film anything but noir.<br/><br/>Sure, there are good moments-Samantha Morton's acting in the challenging and rather thankless role of the pre-cog Agatha, Lois Smith's Kubrickesque cameo in the animated hothouse, the retinal ID spiders who invade Anderton's post-eye-op hideaway, and the whole grotty eye op episode, which blends bits of `Brazil' with bits of `Blade Runner' but adds a delicious new level of disgustingness.  The Lexus factory episode is remarkable and sticks in the mind even as it seems reprehensible and preposterous, as do the personalized commercial ID's. Smaller roles like those played by Tim Blake Nelson and Jason Antoon are well cast.  Inside this clunky behemoth there's clearly a wonderful movie violently gesturing to be let out. I'm bothered, though, that the writers have said they didn't really `get' Philip K. Dick's story. If Dick's interesting enough as a sci-fi writer to base so many movies on, why take a story of his only to trash it - to weigh it down with pastiches and cameos from modern movie history?"

","I may be in the minority (lol bad puns), but I was less than impressed with the film ""Minority Report"". I wasn't bothered by the fact that the movie deviates from the short story of the same name by Philip K Dick. I was looking forward to seeing how the concepts of the source materials could be explored in new and interesting ways as well as with more action scenes. Unfortunately, what we got was a standard action film that pretended to be more intelligent than it actually was. John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) is a detective who works for a special agency called ""Precrime"", where he helps prevent crimes before they actually happen using the predictions of a group of psychics known as ""Pre-Cogs"". The movie briefly touches on the moral and ethical principles of such an organization arresting people who haven't actually committed any crimes when Anderton finds his own name selected as a future killer. From that point on, Anderton is hunted by the organization he used to lead in some of the worst chase scenes I've ever seen. In an attempt to make Anderton look cool, they make everyone else look incompetent. To prove his innocence, Anderton attempts a ridiculously convoluted plan to capture one of the Pre-cogs in order to prove his innocence. This fails and ends up having no impact on the plot other than having the pre-cog become a character. Eventually a conspiracy by the agency is exposed and Anderton manages to clear his name by proving that the Precrime unit was a stupid idea. This whole movie just talks in circles, making simple ideas seem complex and deep. Most of the scenes serve as nothing more than showing off the futuristic environment, where you can't help but think that the future has way too many unnecessary advancements (talking cereal boxes?). Minority Report talks a big game, but fails to deliver anything of real value other than the aesthetics. This movie defines style over substance. Don't waste your time with this trash. There are better action and Science Fiction Films out that deserve more attention than this one."

"bcady","3","6","11","1 July 2002"," Weak movie with too many holes in the plot.
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** This review contains spoilers.<br/><br/>Minority Report causes me to once again ask:  Can anyone make a good action movie?  Minority Report strived to be just that, but it has holes in the plot so big you can drive a truck through them.  Some of the plot holes I found in the movie are listed below:<br/><br/>1. In 52 years, is human slavery going to be considered acceptable?  The movie contains three `pre-cogs' who are being held against their will, in a drugged state, being tortured with nightmarish visions, and nobody seems to care.  Even when Tom Cruise is running around the city with one of them, he is treating her more like a tool to provide information than a person. The movie should have dealt with this issue in some way.<br/><br/>2. If police are currently tested for drug use, and drugs continue to be an issue in the future, then how could Tom Cruise's character John Anderton be a cop with a long time drug addiction?  In addition, if his character has an any common sense, why would he leave drug paraphernalia all over his apartment?<br/><br/>3. When Tom Cruise's character is pre-identified to commit murder, why is it a brown ball (the murder is premeditated) rather than a red ball (impulsive crime of passion)?  Before he enters the room, he knew nothing of the victim, and he suddenly learns of the individual's alleged link to his son, and shoots him out of anger (according to the pre-cogs).  He has less time to plan his actions than the character who almost kills his wife and her lover early in the movie, but that one was a red ball (or double red ball to be more specific).<br/><br/>4. If the Pre-Crime Director Lamar Burgess wanted to commit murder, why didn't he just get the victim out of the Washington D.C. area?  It would have been much easier and less risky to arrange a meeting in some other city.<br/><br/>5. The movie centers around the idea of pre-crime being taken nation wide. If there are three pre-cogs, and they only seem to be able to see murders in their own area, then how are they going to take it nationwide?  There may be a logical explanation for this, like expanded human slavery, but the movie doesn't show it.<br/><br/>6. When the John Anderton character removed his eye bandage early, why didn't he go blind?  The movie repeatedly stated that if he removed the bandages before 12 hours were up he would go blind, but that didn't seem to happen.  Since the bandage was removed from one eye, and he retained one of his original eyes, I expected a tie-in, but that would have required a little forethought on the part of the producer/director.<br/><br/>7. When the eye surgeon performed the operation, why did he keep talking about how John Anderton ruined his life, and how he was going to return the favor, only to do nothing in revenge?  A moldy sandwich doesn't exactly make up for years of abuse in prison.<br/><br/>8. If Speilberg makes a point showing that the pre-cogs can see murder, but nothing else, how is it that when running around the mall, the pre-cog knows everything?  Even the mother of pre-crime emphasized that it was the pre-cogs nightmares of murder that came true, not that they could tell everything in the future.<br/><br/>9. If Retinal scans set off alarms wherever John Anderton went, then how could he and his wife continue to use his removed eye to access the most sensitive areas of law enforcement without setting off a single alarm?<br/><br/>10. Automated cars and plants that attack people have been used in movies for years, and in 152 years it may happen, but I don't think it will happen in just 52 years.<br/><br/>11. How sappy can an ending be?  I was waiting to see the Mickey Mouse ears on the characters before the end sequence was complete.  I know Steven Speilberg is known for happy endings, but this one goes a little far.<br/><br/>I don't know if Steven Speilberg is no longer capable of seeing holes in the plots he creates, if he is too arrogant to ask the opinion of others, or if he feels that a big glitzy movie with Tom Cruise makes up for a substandard plot, but Minority Report is a weak movie dressed up in blockbuster clothing."

The movie quickly deteriorated into action-explosions-shooting-jetpacs-vomiting-punching-snot-strangling...you get the idea.  This was followed by more dizzying ""action.""

As I left, I stopped at the popcorn counter, and the woman told me many people had also walked out.  It's amazing how this film can be called ""the best film of the year.""  By what measure?

","Knowing that this will make it to the ""0 out of 189 people found the following comment useful"" category I will say this: I thought of giving Spielberg one more chance after the abysmal ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" where he destroyed the undisputed talents of Haley J. Osment. Boy was it a mistake to give him that chance.<br/><br/>It is not enough that the movie was a run-of-the-mill chase-the-good-guy movie which they've made since 1903. Nor was it that it had to last for two and a half hours with absolutely no reason. No, the worst thing was that it had the same crappy over-contrast no-subtleties look as the Saving Private Ryan or the otherwise potentially good Band of Brothers. Really, Star Wreck: In the Pirkinning, which was shot on PAL Digital Video cameras looked better than this zillion dollar turd.<br/><br/>And somehow, this story was supposed to be originally written by Philip K. Dick. They've hidden the original very well, even better than with Total Recall.<br/><br/>I made this promise in the late 1980's, but this time I'll keep it: I will never ever watch a Steven Spielberg movie again. Never. Ever. Vote me to hell, I don't care."
"segacs","3","5","9","5 February 2005"," severely disappointing
","This movie joins the ranks of A.I. and Pearl Harbor as a film that looked promising from the previews and then ended up being immensely disappointing. And, like A.I., it is another case of a movie that could have been a decent conceptual or action flick, but was ruined by Steven Spielberg with excess sugary-sweet sentimentality. It mysteriously got great reviews, but I'm having trouble figuring out why.<br/><br/>Firstly, the story is extremely creative and thought-provoking, but its execution falls short. Set in the future, Minority Report tells the story of an experimental new way of fighting crime, using three ""Pre-Cogs"", or humanlike creatures who supposedly can see murders before they take place and provide the names of the killer and victim. In this way, the Pre-Crime unit can arrest the suspect before any crime is even committed, thus preventing murder from happening. It sounds like a great idea in theory, but alas, nothing is ever as perfect as it seems. The head of the Pre-Crime unit, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is shocked when his name turns up as the future killer of a man he's never even met, and spends the rest of the movie trying to get to the bottom of things.<br/><br/>This is a great idea for a movie. There's so much to explore - the conflict between determinism and free will, for example, or the moral and legal implications of convicting someone for a crime that hasn't been committed yet. Add action sequences featuring vertically-flying cars, virtual reality, and jumps from high elevations, and its potential rises even more.<br/><br/>But that's where the fun ends. Because that's where other elements come in. An ex-wife whose crying on cue is only slightly more nauseating than her sudden concern for her husband. A crazy old lady who has man-eating plants as a security system. A scene with eyeballs that can only be described as gratuitous grossness. Pre-cogs who spend most of the movie lying completely still, and then suddenly develop the ability to speak, interact, and have character traits and histories. All in all, the movie never really gets going and never really gets to where it could be.<br/><br/>In other words, a serious disappointment."

"funkyfry","4","5","9","10 October 2002"," Only a minority of the audience seemed to enjoy this one
","Some effort WAS made to do a good sci-fi movie, despite the disappointing result.  A big part of the problem has to do with the fact that Spielberg can't seem to make an honest to god sci-fi movie (I haven't been able to bring myself to see A.I., so I'll reserve judgement on that one, but I have my suspicions...., and Close Encounters isn't my sci-fi cup of tea for sure).  The characters can't be motivated primarily by fear, nor do any of the issues of political infighting from Dick's story emerge strongly, but we do have a dead kid.  That's Spielberg's answer to everything:  throw in dead kids.  Well, it's been working for him for a long time (from ""Jaws"" to ""Shindler's List"") so I guess he'll keep doing it until people stop pulling on their own heartstrings so hard.<br/><br/>Yes, that's this movie's excuse for a plot motivation (Dick's story had a political motive behind the murder in the majority report).  Instead of being good science fiction, it just becomes another dumb shoot 'em up movie. It has great special effects, like all these 100+ million dollar movies do, but that's getting to be kind of standard-issue these days.  This movie needed a compelling story to make the effects and this vision of the future seem special, and it didn't have one:  all it got was this dead kid.  Over and over again, Tom Cruise mourning and stalking around his apartment because of a dead kid.  And of course it turned out that Max Von Sydow was behind it -- anybody who's seen any of these movies will expect that Sydow or Christopher Lee or Ernest Borgnine or whoever it is will end up being the bad guy.  <br/><br/>No wonder when I saw it at a theatre in Berkeley CA I saw (and heard) at least five of the fifty or so people in the audience sleeping.  In the middle of the afternoon.  Yes, this film is siesta time.<br/><br/>Of course, it's not all bad.  But it's got enough good stuff (good ideas from Dick's story, good actors like Tim Blake Nelson and Colin Farrell and, come to mention it, Tom Cruise) to make the pretentious, obvious film that emerges seem even worse because of it.<br/><br/>Is it a coincidence that Spielberg's now working with Tom Cruise, the last male lead in Stanley Kubrick's last film?  I was amazed to discover that after Stanley Kubrick died, Spielberg was suddenly his best friend and wanted to make the movie he COULD HAVE made with Kubrick 7 years ago instead of ""Jurassic Park 2"".  Of course, I don't really blame Spielberg for not wanting to direct a movie under Kubrick's production -- nobody really knows what that would have been like.  But now he's making Kubrick's movies and working with the last actors he worked with.  It's like some kind of sick hero identification, or midlife crisis or something, and somebody who cares about Spielberg should talk to him and tell him to make his own movies -- if he has any.  It seems like his whole career he's been in the shadow of others (Jack Arnold, and now Kubrick).<br/><br/>Also, I'm getting a bit tired of all these movies going for the same urban/gothic/exotic look that Bladerunner established in the 80s.  This film is one of the poorer ones to try so far -- the only one I've seen that does it with any success is the mid-90s ""Dark City.""  I think sci-fi fans are getting a little sick of seeing this look over and over again -- I mean, enough with the cyberpunk hair cuts and fancy holographic photo equipment, if I wanna see it I'll take out my DVD of Bladerunner.  I'd rather just keep watching one good movie than a bunch of imitations."

Everything I felt for it and experienced the first time around was reconfirmed, except it was even worse the second time. This movie just meanders and meanders around without ever delivering anything memorable other than some interesting futuristic tech shots, which even still, today, really surprisingly seem outdated and long surpassed. Could this be the first movie of its kind that decided not to edit itself down by at least 1 hour, which has been a long-running trend with pretentious Hollywood flicks as of late- the last two decades.<br/><br/>The movie is a failure because it had everything you would need to be great: Spielberg directing, Tom Cruise in the lead role, a very interesting premise and conflict, decent supporting acting and a relatively ambitious scope to it in a time when originality was still abundant in filmmaking (2002), but it just didn't live up to its potential.

","The whole idea is pretty interesting but the movie introduces at least two flaws into the story that killed it for me: 1 the prevented murders are not murders, the victims live, period. Society could treat the suspects different to actual murderers and probably would, eg. psychotherapy, counseling, social help/adjustment program etc.<br/><br/>That they - without difference and as it seams without trial - put the suspects in an artificial coma is not made plausible, especially as this whole thing happens as an experiment in one state of the united states.<br/><br/>2. Another real obvious flaw is to me, that that the trick to cover up a murder by ""blinding"" the clairvoyants/the precrime system with some reenactment (or whatever, it does not matter) to actually commit the murder without being caught *before* just leads to: a committed murder. Did this justice system just assumed there are no murders and stopped investigating missing persons? So for me 5 stars for the effort."

","Saw this in the original theatrical run and was impressed at the time. It exceeded my hopes for an adaptation of one of Philip K. Dick's best stories. Flash forward 10 years and I wonder what I ever saw in it (the film, that is). Visually it holds up, though the CGI segments are looking shabby already. Action scenes are well paced, plot nuances are treated deftly. Some of the supporting roles are badly miscast--I laughed out loud at the abrupt appearance of Mike ""Mind of the Married Man"" Binder--but Peter Stormare and Jason Antoon were both great and Max von Sydow probably carries the film.<br/><br/>Still the preponderance of bad easily obscures the good. The clever bits are more or less forgettable, while Spielberg's knack for clichés and remarkably immature sense of humor stink up the film (like when the robot spiders canvass the apartment building, or when Cruise chomps down on some spoiled food, etc. etc.) Then there are the pervasive cornball Spielbergisms--anybody who remembers Close Encounters, Hook, Jurassic Park, and the rest knows what I mean. The primordial will to schmaltz is always right below the surface, even during his most imaginative and skillful storytelling. I think the worst might be when the precog is narrating to Cruise and his sickly-looking waif/wife about their kid going off to college and falling in love, blah blah blah (this unbearable moment of fake drama is soon shattered in a preposterous shift).<br/><br/>With the last 20 minutes the movie degenerates rapidly. In retrospect, an oddly mediocre effort!"
"johnnyboyz","5","4","7","7 January 2010"," Arrogant and misjudged science fiction blockbuster trying to combine thrills with spills with nasty, visceral content resulting in sheer mediocrity.
","Spielberg's Minority Report is a sprawling, maddening, grotesque spectacle; a film that darts all over the place, catering for mainstream tastes in chase and action sequences but desperately trying to provide more substantial weight and content for the rest of us in the form of typically dystopian futures full of technology and modernity run amok; all the while complimented by wondrous visuals. Included in a number of top ten of the year lists when it was released and equally so for the decade, although mostly from American critics, mind; Minority Report's pompous and nonsensical attitude is matched only by its misjudged and somewhat misguided approach of romping through a beautifully created world, spawned entirely from computer generated imagery, as fans of either Cruise and/or Spielberg get to attend their latest flick and tick off the genre conventions under a faux banner of entertainment.<br/><br/>The film, one of those from Spielberg that again sees him attempt to combine style with substance and filter them both through a number of genres so long as there's a glut of action in there somewhere, does not match what he achieved in the likes of Jurassic Park and Saving Private Ryan; films that maintained a steady sense of threat around a number of sequences that although contained a fair deal of action, saw overwhelming odds stacked against the characters we focused on as superior forces moved in for the kill. Where once was genuine threat has been replaced with a hollow, inconsistent film-going experience. Minority Report sees a similar basis for a would-be action film unravel, but it feels unfocused and the scenes of chase twinned with the evasion of apprehension evoke more of a sense of excitement than a genuine sense of fear. Spielberg's maturity as a director over the years has seen him be able to combine degrees of substance with his approach of providing a spectacle, and its been on display in the past through better films than this; but in Minority Report, he gleefully hops along from chase, to gross-out content, to flimsy cover-up narrative in what is a pretty ordinary film.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Washington D.C. It's the year 2054, a further example of a Spielberg film not set in the present day. It sees Tom Cruise's John Anderton work as law enforcer at the 'pre-crime' unit, a branch that sees future crimes before sending units out and preventing them from happening. The opening murder takes place in one of those typical, supposedly idyllic American suburban neighbourhoods, as a crime of passion plays out - something instigated by a married man going back for his glasses which, of course, enable him to 'see' everything better than he already can – there are a lot of references in the film to eyes, and the ability to 'see' stuff. Like many-a lone male lead living in far off dystopian futures, Anderton has a past tragedy he must live with, something that fast tracks development in a character and reveals the character's soon-to-be evident ability to deal with anything that comes his way – if he can suffer through the loss of his son and consequently live with it, he can wade on through anything, right? <br/><br/>Minority Report uses a harsh, would-be rough around the edges approach combined with a polished and generally gleaming aesthetic to attract crowds in order to produce something that wants to be gritty and edgy, but just comes across as well refined, pseudo and quaint. This, as notions and ideas of 'looking' and 'watching' over the population by the state itself in this future world crudely evokes Orwell, while the exploration of these ideas are presented by way of daft, clumsily included quotes on behalf of supporting characters the lead casually interacts with; best highlighted when laugh inducing lines such as ""In the valley of the blind, the one eyed man is king"" are uttered from a blind drug dealer. On another occasion; an ugly, naked, young woman whom lies in a shallow pool of water all day foreseeing the future, known as a 'cog', grabs the lead's arm and melodramatically asks him ""Can you see!?"" <br/><br/>The film's primary source of antagonism is a joke of a villain in Colin Farrell's suited, booted, stern faced bad guy named Danny Witwer; a guy who swaggers around issuing obligatory threats in an obligatory tone and jabbers some spiritual nonsense which makes him seem smarter/scarier than he actually is. His presence renders the film one in which a powerful, mostly unseen enemy hunts a somewhat harmless and decidedly innocent individual caught up in a fantastic predicament that wasn't any of their doing, combining this with a labyrinth of a narrative we loose all interest in long before it concludes. For better examples that come with more substance, see either 1959's North by Northwest or any of the first three Terminator films. Minority Report maintains a pretty nonchalant attitude throughout, it's more in awe of itself than we are. The film's extended screen time that it gives to shots of the technology at the pre-crime lab's disposal, very early on, when all the moving around of this and that on some screens are overly emphasised – the camera lingering on Cruise use the technology for longer than it needs to.<br/><br/>With a stuck up tone, a load of caricatures running around another world brought to life, but wasted on with a tired chase/corruption narrative as well as a distinctly misguided tone, Minority Report is a wavering mess; a truly daft experience running on empty. The worst scene is the occasion in which the lead stumbles into an over-sized greenhouse where an elderly woman lays out the entire film for us: pure exposition. For all the running around and evading capture, an awful lot feels like it gets done than actually is done. Spielberg would make edgier, more interesting films than this nonsense later on in the decade; see those attempts over this one."

","A fascinating Sci-Fi Thriller about the minority perspective. In a Democracy the majority vote wins. However, what if the minority is right most of the time? Better yet, what if the minority is right when it counts most? Steven Spielberg has achieved a great philosophy in his films as his spirit merges with the art. The sad part is that film is only allowed to go so far with truly showing us what we are as consumers and human beings.<br/><br/>Minority Report is haunting as is Truth when it appears too bright to accept. The film touches on this ""truth"" as we watch the future seer suffer through a different perspective, a view that is right made wrong by the Majority.<br/><br/>The question is: When do we listen to the Minority?<br/><br/>It usually comes with a voice. The Nazi's were once a minority and Hitler was their voice. Yet, who was the minority along with the Nazi's? The Jew? Their voice is and always will be God."
"Dr_Coulardeau","10","4","7","7 November 2006"," Crime is not predictable at all!
","The human race has always been obsessed by the future, which is probably one distinctive trait that makes it human and takes it out of animality. Humanity has to plan its future in order to survive, hence it has to predict its future needs. But humanity remains an animal race in many ways, including of course its survival instinct. So crime is part of the picture, what we call crime in our human ethics. But this is nothing but the individual survival instinct that goes against the collective survival instinct. Then the collectivity, human society decides to consider the individual survival instinct as being a crime and as deserving punishment. It is, and has been, tempting to predict what and which individuals will become criminals in order to prevent that crime. It was for instance suggested under President Nixon to preventively take away into reform schools all the kids, aged six or seven, that had the « typical criminal » psychology before they realized their destiny which was considered as inescapable and necessarily criminal. This approach was essentially behavioral. Then another appeared, essentially genetic this time and some still believe that the DNA of any individual contains its destiny that is absolutely inescapable. So let us put away those who have the « crime » genes. Steven Spielberg deals with this dilemma but based this time on a modern embodiment of the seers of old. Three people have been transformed by some genetic manipulation into seers of the future and their predictions are considered as absolutely infallible since they always seem to agree. Then the criminals are arrested before they commit their crime and put away. The effect is the disappearance of crime from Washington D.C. in just a few years. But Steven Spielberg goes further and demonstrates that there are several flaws in this theory. First the three seers don't always agree and there might be a minority report from one of them that is over-ruled by the two others and not communicated to the precrime police. Then this precrime police is a private enterprise and it was necessary to prove its efficiency to get the business. Little by little it appears that the founder of this technology manipulated it in order to prove his theory by arresting someone who was supposed to kill a woman just before he did. That one was paid by the inventor who then afterward committed himself the very crime exactly the way it was supposed to happen which enabled this second crime to be understood by technicians as a simple echo of the first one that was prevented and to be disregarded. The death of the woman only became a missing person. That is the flaw of the film : why didn't anyone investigate this « disappearance » ? But then he also had to trick his own associate, the main detective of this precrime police. He does that by getting the latter's son killed in such a way that the crime will remain unsolved. But this enables the boss to nourish in his associate a desire to know who killed his son. This associate's coming around to that knowledge will make him become a criminal and thus he will be neutralized and put away but after the crime is committed for reasons that are not clear. But a few facts were brought together and sorted out by this cop's wife and then she manages to get her husband free, which sounds quite iffy, and this triggers a full process of truth discovery and public broadcasting. The end is yours to discover. But this approach, with marvelous special effects and beautiful action, seems to overkill the point it wants to make : The future is inescapable and predictable, and yet the future can be tampered with and manipulated. The first principle is excessive and even wrong. The second is probably true. But both together are just absurd because contradictory. The point is then disproved by this very contradiction. But it is a great film nevertheless that reveals this question of the future and its possible prediction is essential to man and humanity.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University of Paris Dauphine & University of Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne"
"Ricky_Roma__","Null","4","7","27 November 2005"," Something of a disappointment (spoilers throughout)
","A complicated plot should never be confused with genuine complexity, as a story that relies completely on twists and narrative gymnastics is as shallow as cinema gets. Sure you may be worked hard to figure everything out but if the answer is essentially meaningless or trite, then so what? And that's kind of the feeling you get from watching Minority Report. You're made to struggle and you're made to decipher a labyrinthine plot, but the revelation when it comes is like something out of Agatha Christie. Basically the film's a whodunit with bells and whistles on.<br/><br/>The emotions, too, don't help the film. As you'd expect from Spielberg every emotional moment is covered in a thick layer of treacle. There's the bit when Samantha Morton talks about how much love used to be in Anderton's house. It could have been a nice moment but the bright light, tears and sappy dialogue is ordering you how to feel. And then there's the video of Anderton's dead son. Again it could have been a nice moment but instead the kid is so gosh-darn cute that it defies belief. Ordinary kids just aren't like that.<br/><br/>Much more successful, somewhat surprisingly for Spielberg, are the darker moments. There's a great scene when you see Anderton and his kid at the swimming pool. Anderton sinks to the bottom to show how long he can hold his breath, but then when he resurfaces his kid has gone. It captures all the terror of losing a child with great skill.<br/><br/>I also like the scene where Anderton is confronted with his child's 'killer'. Anderton, quite rightly, is utterly deranged and Cruise does an excellent job of selling the character's anger and grief. Therefore it's slightly annoying that these great darker moments have to co-exist with such schmaltz. Just take the ending. Pre-crime is shut down, Anderton is reunited with his wife, Anderton's wife is pregnant and the pre-cogs live happily ever after. It's far too neat and tidy, especially for what's supposed to be a gritty thriller.<br/><br/>Another regard in which the film is a disappoint is the action. You've got silly jetpack fights, dull fistfights (the Cruise/Farrell fight in the factory is a snoozer) and a computery sequence where Anderton superhumanly jumps from speeding car to speeding car. Plus the action is often punctuated with broad humour. During the jetpack fight the characters crash through ceilings and walls where people are obliviously going about their daily lives (they don't seem to hear the tremendous racket) and at the end of the scene where Anderton escapes from the car he crashes into a yoga class where people are folded in half; the humour feels dim-witted and out place. But the most ludicrous use of humour is when Anderton chases after his eyeballs. In another film it could have been quite funny, but again here it's misplaced.<br/><br/>The eyes remind me of another problem: the many plot holes. I mean, how come Anderton can get back into the police station after being identified as someone who's going to commit a murder? Surely the first thing that would happen would be that his security clearance would be revoked. And then later his wife uses the eyes to get into the prison to free her husband. It's lazy plotting.<br/><br/>Just as lazy is the way that Lamar (Max von Sydow) reveals his guilt to Anderton's wife. She mentions a murder and then Lamar, supposedly not knowing anything about the murder in question, mentions drowning even though he hasn't been told as such. It's the way that criminals reveal themselves in Murder, She Wrote and Columbo. It shouldn't happen in a film of this calibre.<br/><br/>Thankfully, though, for every bad thing in the film there's something good. The pre-crime murders (especially the opening one with the scissors) are superbly filmed (as is the arrest), the scene with the electronic spiders is excellent (I like the overhead shot of all the rooms as the spiders methodically go about their work), the nightmarish eye operation and subsequent recuperation is terrific and the pre-crime advertisement (""I was going to be stabbed"" ""Right here."") is suitably cheesy. I also like the cleverness of the murder that is disguised as an echo and the suddenness in which Lamar shoots Farrell's character. But even the ingenious murder doesn't necessarily stand up to scrutiny. There's an attempted murder, the woman is saved and then the police just walk off and leave her alone. Then Lamar pops up and kills her. I would have thought the police would have at least taken care of the woman and given her a lift back home after a close brush with death.<br/><br/>But the film's biggest success is in portraying a perfect world that would actually be quite hellish to live in. The cops here are like the Thought Police. Suddenly you're being arrested for something you haven't done but something you're going to do. The whole system abolishes freedom of action. And while that may be good if you were going to be murdered by your spouse, it wouldn't be so good if you were intent on killing someone that had done great wrong to you  someone that was bribing you or abusing a loved one. Plus if a despot somehow entered the White House, any violent form of protest would be up that famous creek without a paddle.<br/><br/>And the system in the film itself is pretty corrupt. They keep these three pre-cogs locked up in a chamber and pump them full of drugs so that they can continually suffer nightmarish visions. What an evil bunch of bastards.<br/><br/>But the one thing I haven't mentioned is all the time paradoxes. And the reason I haven't mentioned them is because thinking about them makes me go cross-eyed"

","I've never been a huge fan of Speilburg, I find his movies have great moments or sequences I enjoy but overall leave me feeling kind of cold. This feels like Speilburg was trying to make a movie just for me- he loaded it with actors I like (Max Von Sydow, Jessica Harper, Peter Stormare, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton), put in a little gore (the whole groovy ""eyeball"" sequence), even served up a scene where one person vomits on another (always a favorite). But no matter how Sir Stevie panders to me, I cannot like this movie.<br/><br/>There is a festering pile of boogers in this movie, and it's named ""Colin Ferrell's Acting"". Hasn't anyone noticed how terrible this guy is? Why do they keep putting him in movies? He's awful! One needs only to look at the chase through the car factory: After performing a perilous climb onto a piece of machinery, Farrell pulls out a cross and kisses it. Later, when Tom Cruise is escaping, Farrell slams his fist into his palm ala a bully in a Nickelodian series. And it doesn't help matters that most of the dialog in this movie is god-awful.<br/><br/>And why does this movie end and then go on for another twenty minutes? There's a point where the conspiracy is reveiled via a character giving a big long monologue (like Velma on the Scooby Doo show), then there's a nice, grim, downbeat ending that satisfied me. But no, it keeps going, and going, and has another character give a long monologue explaining stuff that's ALREADY BEEN EXPLAINED. Did the writers think the audience was so stupid they couldn't get it? Or couldn't handle a downbeat ending?

Can one be judged by his intentions to commit a given crime, even if one does not actually commit such a crime ? Also, playing the «Time Machine» game would, in fact, be «useless» in the sense that TIME could then be run forward OR backward... In other words, all real actions could then be annulled and re-enacted... endlessly... again and again... Anyway... Am I one of the very few rare viewers who did NOT enjoy that film ? I hated the bluish all-invading tints (so very «COLD» and very unpleasant to look at!). Tom Cruise, whose profile is somewhat «birdlike», makes for a boyish, almost midget-like «hero» (notice his constant elevator shoes that hardly make up for his short 5 foot 7 stature). Although the special effects and the pictorial inventions are amazing (with obvious echoes of «A.I.»), it's just another action fare disguised as a futuristic, so called philosophical fable. As almost always with Spielberg's films (perhaps apart from «Schindler's List»), when I was viewing it, on the spur of the «action/moments», I got involved.

"zardoz-13","5","3","5","11 July 2007"," Tom Cruise makes a convincingly vulnerable hero . . .
","You know that a science fiction film, like the new Steven Spielberg movie ""Minority Report"" starring Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell, is in trouble when the background elements are more interesting than the foreground elements. Based on a sci-fi short story by legendary author Philip K. Dick, whose writings have inspired Gary Felder's ""Impostor"" (2001), Ridley Scott's ""Blade Runner"" (1982), and Paul Verhoven's ""Total Recall"" (1990), ""Minority Report"" tops the inept ""Impostor"" but lacks the exciting agility of either ""Total Recall"" or ""Blade Runner."" While the 'what if' premise of the Philip K. Dick short story and the script by Scott (""Get Shorty"") Frank and newcomer Jon Cohen provokes thought, director Steven Spielberg bungles both premise and promise. Not only does Spielberg wear out his welcome with an exhaustive epic that runs a half-hour too long, but also he botches what could have been the equal of any of his action-packed ""Raiders"" trilogy or ""The Lost World."" Quite simply, ""Minority Report"" degenerates into a shallow, derivative sci-fi saga that bogs down too often in its own pseudo-technical gibberish and never delivers the hallowing hair-raising heroics that it promises. <br/><br/>""Minority Report"" unfolds in Washington, D.C., in the year 2054. Over the past six years, nobody has murdered anybody, thanks to a pioneering crime-prevention program called 'Pre-Crime' that can predict a homicide before it happens. Inventors Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow of ""The Exorcist"") and Iris Hineman (Lois Smith of ""The Pledge"") devised this system that relies on three psychics (one woman and two men) called ""Pre-Cogs"" buoyed in a wading pool who have visions of future crimes. The Justice Department dispatches Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell of ""American Outlaws"") to check out the system before they adopt it for nation-wide use. Witwer suspects the system is flawed, no matter what Pre-Crime Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise of ""Vanilla Sky"") claims to the contrary. Suddenly, Anderton finds himself in a predicament when the Pre-Cogs say he has murder on his mind. Anderton is supposed to kill somebody that he has never met in the next 36 hours. Predictably, Anderton runs. Not only does he resist arrest, but also he kidnaps one of the Pre-Cogs, former crack-baby Agatha (Samantha Morton), who insists that he would kill and run. Along the way, we learn Anderton lost his son; uses illegal drugs, and is divorced.<br/><br/>Spielberg blows it from the beginning with an action scene that wanders in circles. Things grow worse as the plot thickens, and we learn how the lottery style 'Pre-Crime System' works. At least ten continuity errors crop up, but what is worst is Spielberg never lets the action scenes off the leash. Instead, peripheral elements, such as the Magnetic Levitation traffic system that prevents traffic jams and the 'sick stick' that the cops use to incapacitate wrongdoers by making them instantly vomit, are more interesting than the contrived, drawn- out, convoluted story. Tom Cruise makes a convincingly vulnerable hero, but nothing about ""Minority Report"" is as convincing or insightful as his performance."

I am always very skeptical when I begin watching a movie and I suspect it to be real in that sense that it doesn't have logic errors or lacking realism in general. Of course, in a sci-fi these borders are pushed in contrast to a regular drama. However, when seeing how Cruise moves his hands in front of the screens (which felt like several minutes) I couldn't help myself but saying ""Hey - stop already!"" It's neither cool nor interesting to see. It WOULD have worked if Cruise would have had some Japanese elegance in his movements, but he hadn't. It simply looked awkward, or the timing between his movements and the images was wrong.<br/><br/>Considering the whole movie, I felt that they tried too hard. This is what I think some of the filmmakers dialogue would have been: ""How do we make the future look cool? Well, we use all this cool colored lights pointed at the camera. And we have found out these übercool screens which you control by the movements of your hands."" These Hollywood productions often focus on some aspects of the technology too much. They simplify it, tells how it works in a very brief statement and then the audience is to believe it. I didn't.<br/><br/>This film follows the de facto recipe of Hollywood productions. If you know what to look for, you can easily predict what will happen in the film. There are numerous examples: The home video showing Cruise's son, the dialogue about how the eyes can be exchanged to mask ones identity. It's just too obvious that Cruise's son is dead and that he is going to buy a new pair of eyes. When things are too obvious like this - you don't buy the story.<br/><br/>For me, I need a movie to be serious all together to take it seriously, to believe it, to feel one with the story and then give it high ratings because I liked it. When these comic reliefs are added it totally destroys that mystic cool auro of the future that the movie did manage to portray later in the film.<br/><br/>In despite of my critique, the movie wasn't only bad. OK, the car factory plant being there to show off the Lexus didn't really help to get into the annals of best picture, but there were greater moments.<br/><br/>The inventor of the precog was a cool character! She and all her magic surreal plants was a fresh addition to the blasse action elements. The Precog who was on the run was also very interesting. Why? Because it was something new.<br/><br/>All in all the movie was too streamlined and ordinary to be a really good sci-fi, although Cruise's performance and the other highlights mentioned above make it a descent film. But the lack of focus is so sad. Why destroy a promising movie by adding comic relief elements? To answer to the need of having mass market appeal of course, but seriously, I t think this movie would have earned more money in total if it would have stayed serious all through."

","To be fair, I do not like Tom Cruise as an actor.  Pretentious Hollywood trying to do another ""formula"" movie is an insult to anyone with more than a couple of brain cells at their disposal; that being said, I was waiting for a homogenized AOL like - ""Here's your movie!"" to jump out at me when I put the DVD in the player and sat down to watch Minority Report.<br/><br/>As an aside, Spielberg has made some great movies.  That does not translate into ""Everything Spielberg touches is gold""; with Minority report he wound up with lead... and a big fat movie check.<br/><br/>The premise of this film deals with a potential future without really explaining how and why we got there.  Crime in D.C.??  No kidding there's crime in D.C.! (In the ghetto and on Capitol Hill... what else is new..??) Are we to believe that some tweaked out vegetables lying in a hot tub mystically carving up croquet balls are the answer here?  Perhaps my bias is really showing through...<br/><br/>Minority Report is a self indulgent formulated movie that is not entertaining.  It is far too long, and far too complicated; (even for the high brow folks...)"
"cvw","5","3","5","21 June 2002"," BIG disappointment...
","Okay, ""Minority Report.""  Everyone seems to think this is utterly brilliant, and I can kind of see why: it's certainly the riskiest film Spielberg has made in, well, ever.  The visuals are amazingly cool, and the plot is rock solid.  So it's a great movie, right?<br/><br/>Good God, no.  It's a visually impressive, admittedly challenging motion picture, and is certainly grittier than anything else coming out of Hollywoodland.  But it's got some pacing issues, it glosses over subtext that needs more breathing room, and...well...<br/><br/>Let me just say this flat out: there is a chunk in the middle of the movie (I'd guess it's about 30 minutes or so) that was so jarring, hamfisted, incongruous, and thoroughly irritating that I nearly walked out (no mean feat, since I'm paid to watch the whole thing for flaws in the film stock.)  I can't really elucidate without some minor spoilers, so consider yourself warned.<br/><br/>The first 30 minutes or so are fantastic, and I was really a little giddy with the prospect of seeing a fully realized, big-budget Sci-Fi mind f*ck.  The ideas come fast and thick, the characters may be somewhat clichéd, but not annoyingly so.  The film LOOKS great, and the idea is fascinating: why is John Anderton going to kill a man he doesn't even know? Solid, serious, great stuff.<br/><br/>Then the chase sequence kicks in.  It's actually a great chase sequence as far as these things go, but, thematically and tonally, this is where Spielberg not only started to lose me, but started to actively annoy me.<br/><br/>It starts, as these things so often do, with vomit. In order to create a distraction to get away from the cops around him, Anderton hits one in the neck with a stun gun, causing the poor guy to vomit.  And vomit he does: copiously.  Twice.  A WHOLE lot of vomit.  It's a very quick scene (we're talking less than two seconds,) but it's so VIVID it's jarring.  It wasn't until a few seconds after that something occurred to me: was, um...was that supposed to be FUNNY?<br/><br/>I pushed the idea away as ridiculous, but the next 30 to 45 minutes forced me to reconsider.  Beginning with the projectile hurl, Spielberg tries what looks to me to be a blend of serious, disturbing, and, er, slapstick.  It fails.  Spectacularly.  At one point we're in a second rate ""Blade Runner,"" with blatantly gratuitous art design (who watches TV on a bedsheet on the wall?  Especially in the middle of a fly-by-night operating room?)  Why is there a hideously ugly Nazi-esque female nurse humming idiotic tunes and grabbing Tom Cruise's butt?  Why do we need to see some guy graphically clear what looks to be a pound and a half of snot from his nose?  Why would Spielberg take what was a taut, fascinating action/Sci-Fi blend and stick in a scene of a blinded Tom Cruise gagging on spoiled food, then washing it down with spoiled milk?  You can almost hear the trumpet going ""wah-wah-wah-waaaaahhh.""  And what's with making us think that the guy who is operating on Cruise is gong to exact some revenge on him, just to have the whole thing vanish completely 30 seconds later, never to return?<br/><br/>And all this happens after a long, long scene with an old woman tending her plants in a hothouse that has to be the single most hamfisted thing I've seen outside of MST3K.  It's a necessary scene, thematically: enormous amounts of information are imparted by a character I'd call ""Mrs. Exposition.""  At first I thought she was simply a horrible actress, but then...she KISSES him.  Full on the mouth.  It is neither explained, justified, humorous, daring, or anything else coherent I can attribute to it.  When she kissed him, I stopped thinking she was a horrible actress: no, her character is just exaggeratedly, needlessly, self-consciously bizarre.<br/><br/>Now, don't get me wrong: weird can quite often be good (I'm an Alexandro Jodorowsky fan, for God sakes.)  But this is rootless cinematic masturbation, Spielberg ""taking chances"" by indiscriminately going outside the realm of what he's good at.  Mindless, directionless energy generally doesn't work if your movie's not called ""Tetsuo.""<br/><br/>As if all of the above weren't off putting enough, at a certain point (right after Cruise saves one of his eyes from rolling away...don't ask) all this ""humor"" just STOPS.  Cold.  Suddenly, we're back to the first movie, and if it weren't for the fact that some changes that happened to the character are still present, we might be forgiven for thinking someone at Dreamworks accidentally put some reels from some other film in the cans.  At this point, things continue where they left off: plot intricacies winding around each other, and what's with that thing about Anderton killing someone?  Y'know, the movie we were so immersed in before?<br/><br/>This is where the pacing and subtext start to dissolve.  While the plot has not wrapped itself up yet, things feel like they should end long before they actually do (shades of AI, anyone?)  The moral and political implications of the Precrime system are glossed over and all but discarded in favor of making the film a fairly pedestrian, twisty murder mystery (we sat through nearly three hours for that?)  It's a long run for a short slide, and the generic God-Is-In-His-Heaven-And-All-Is-Well ending is about the only place it can really go.  Yippee.  Like we needed another one of these.<br/><br/>Now, I should mention that many of the people present in the theatre loved this.  The LOOK of the film is great, and it does have the otherworldly feel that some geeks could immerse themselves in, irregardless of plot (and believe me, I'd have to disregard the plot to lose myself in this.)  I'm sure many will disagree with me.  Vehemently.  I don't really care. I was seriously disappointed, and what's worse, in some ways I was disappointed in EXACTLY the was I afraid I might be.  Self-conscious weirdness is not daring or challenging, and I can't help but think that, if Hollywood's output wasn't so uniformly pathetic, people would see through this kind of thing with greater frequency."
"petertagliabue","4","4","8","22 June 2006"," Interesting movie, but stick to Dick (MAJOR Spoilers!)
","Philip K. Dick has written loads of short stories that have evolved into screen-plays. Some have worked (Blade Runner, Total Recall) by basically developing a life of their own and becoming something independent of their source, while still staying true to the story their based on. However, this movie is not one of them.<br/><br/>The problem is not the craftsmanship. The digital effects are incredible, probably best viewed on the big screen. The acting is good, maybe sometimes a bit over the top by Agatha, the pre-cog. And Tom Cruise is, of course, his own flashy self. And a few moments of slapstick-humor to spice things up a bit. And yet, this movie seem like a waste of time. Why? Let's take a look at the story:<br/><br/>John Anderton works for ""Precrime"", an institution that predicts murders days before they are about to happen. They do this by using ""pre-cogs"", humans kept in a state of drug-induced helplessness, who get visions of the future and pass them on. Knowing what is going to happen, Precrime can act accordingly and stop any crime before it is committed. One day, Anderton sees his own name as a ""future murderer""; however, the victim is no one he's ever heard of. He now has to prove his innocence against a system that seems to know his future before he does.<br/><br/>Great and imaginative story. And yet, the movie wasn't satisfying.<br/><br/>It might be because Steven Spielberg and Philip K. Dick are completely incompatible in regards to their world-view, and come to opposite conclusions. And that poses a gigantic problem for the script:<br/><br/><ul><li>Dick sees the future as something that cannot be changed, not by our own individual choices at any rate. However, because of free will, there our several ""alternate"" futures, which is also the reason for there being THREE pre-cogs. They ""vote"" for a future that is the most likely to happen, but knowledge of that vote naturally changes the course of events. But the fact that you'd change your mind if you knew about your future can also be foreseen by the pre-cogs, so their vision changes accordingly. Therefore, the pre-cogs are always right, no matter what you do. This idea is reminiscent of the Oracle of Delphi in ancient Greece.</li></ul><br/><br/>Stiil with me? I knew you were.<br/><br/><ul><li>With Spielberg, it's an entirely different matter. He views free will as an entity in itself. For him, there are not millions of preplanned events, that we slide through by taking this path or that; there is only ONE way, one that we determine by the choices we make. Therefore the pre-cog system doesn't work, as by these choices we can negate any ""vision"" of the future that is brought up. This is a very individualistic ideal, and, in a sense, the ideal that Hollywood and, specifically, Stephen Spielberg have always represented.</li></ul><br/><br/>Now imagine a Greek tragedy, done in a ""Hollywood"" way. See the problem?<br/><br/>My advice: Read the short story, hate it or enjoy it depending on your world-view, but skip this movie. It just doesn't know which direction to take..."
"punkmacinally","Null","4","8","11 May 2004"," Cack
","What an over-rated movie this truly is. That was my first thought when the credits rolled, but for the life of me I couldn't work out why. The story was very original, it was directed by Steven Spielberg and it had a huge star taking the lead in Tom Cruise. Ah, I thought. Therein lies the rub.<br/><br/>I think there is a lot to be said for casting unknowns in certain lead roles. Detective John Anderton is a shining example of such a role. You see, the problem in this instance is Tom Cruise. Undoubtedly a massive star and fantastic in Top Gun and A Few Good Men, Cruise nevertheless is essentially a one trick pony. And if you cast an actor with limited range in such an original movie (especially someone as big as Cruise), then, in this case, it turns into just another Tom Cruise action/drama picture. In every scene we see a bit of Maverick, a bit of Ethan Hunt and a smattering of every other character he's ever played.<br/><br/>Now, consider Minority Report with a carefully chosen but unknown actor in the lead. Suddenly, the film is purely about the story; the unknown brings something to the lead part that no-one has ever seen before. A perfect example would be 28 Days Later - a tremendous film, but would it have been as good if someone like cruise had played the lead? I doubt it.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the big-budget, all-star action movie has it's place in the cinema. It offers the viewer a chance to escape for two hours without having to think too hard. The problem arises when the John Woos and Jerry Bruckheimers try to turn it into something it's not. They should just stick to blowing stuff up.<br/><br/>So there."
"El Guapo-2","1","4","8","18 August 2003"," The Terminally Boring
","I recently sat down to watch this movie again more closely, and decided to re-write my review. In specific, to clarify on why I don't like it at all. It's because Steven Spielberg has the skill to make a movie that will really knock you on your ass. These days, an intelligent movie is almost certain to get an R rating, because the character of Tom Cruise is a Philip K. Dick character. This guy wrote stories where almost every time, the main character was tripping out in his own head as a different person, experiencing things and discovering things along the way, and so do we along with him. This trick is briefly explored, but in the end it doesn't matter anyway, because it was decided this film had to be a PG-13 hero saves the day family entertainment type of film, the demographic that Spielberg has catered to all for almost all of his career.<br/><br/>The visual style they are trying to use here, which involves extensive use of a blue filter on the lens, really doesn't look pleasing to the eye. In fact, the film is rather ugly to look at, the design is unimaginative. A noir film is filmed at night! When you film at day, and put a blue lens on your camera to make it dark anyway, it doesn't make sense. Has anyone reading this article seen a movie called ""And God Spoke""? It's a fake documentary where two idiot z-level direct to video filmmakers decide to make a film about the bible because ""it's the biggest best seller of all time, the biggest target audience."" During the production, they decide to hire a polish cinematographer who is obsessed with Sven Nykvist. He thinks if he films exactly like Sven Nykvist, who is famous for his creative uses of dark lenses in brilliantly lit scenes, he will be like Sven Nykvist. He idolizes the man. When they film the garden of eden sequence, it's a cheap production, they barely have any lights, but the cameraman has put very dark lenses on the camera to be like Sven Nykvist. The end result is, they can't see anything, it's too murky and dark. He wasted several hundred thousand dollars in re-shoots in overruns. The point is, Minority Report is so boring that's how I was able to think of this connection. Doesn't Spielberg know that history grinds away at hacks?<br/><br/>When the plot can be summed up as ""you used the memory of my dead son to set me up""... that is awful writing. I would expect that kind of writing in an Edward Bulwer-Lytton junk writing contest."

","This is a film with a good story, which is no surprise being an adaptation of the writer Philip K. Dick's short story 'The Minority Report'. What the movie lacks is an atmosphere which is one of the most important elements of such films. All the futuristic implications of the film comes from gadgets and poorly designed cars. Urban areas doesn't look much different from present day cities and the film doesn't care much about the social developments of people in the 2050s. When this is the case, one expects more about the characters and their psychology but you don't get much out of them either. Behaviors of the precogs sometimes gets distractingly comical. On the good side of the movie it has some humorous moments well placed in good action. This is more of an action film than sci-fi and when you watch it as one, it is an enjoyable action-pursuit movie."

","Just a so-so movie IMO. In spite of its huge budget, it barely makes it as a sci-fi epic: there's only one jet-car, for example. The scene in which Tom Cruise (as Anderton) grabs on to a cop and uses his jet-foil to escape is colourful, but silly. (There's even a blatant continuity error, in spite of the massive budget.) The plot is absurd, with so many holes in it that that our heads spin with the multiple flashbacks, or flash-forwards or whatever they are. The female ""pre-cog"" has a see- through garment that exposes her nipples while she's in the water, but later there's an undergarment that makes her decent. We're never quite sure whether Anderton committed the murder or not, which is wildly confusing. The ending is just discursive, via a cell-phone call, and bang the bad-guy shoots himself. Really disappointing. There's not even a chase at the end: very poor film-scripting! Overall, miss this one is my recommendation."
"KnightsofNi11","5","2","3","20 July 2010"," Lackluster
","Minority Report is a futuristic sci-fi action film directed by Stephen Spielberg. It is set in the year 2054 and murder is now a thing of the past thanks to three prophet-like beings called the Precognatives. The Precogs, as they are called, have the ability to see a murder before it happens. The Precrime Institute uses their ability to go out and stop these murders from occurring and arrest the murderer before they ever commit their crime. Tom Cruise (Top Gun, Born on the Fourth of July) plays the chief of Precrime Police John Anderton. The film begins by introducing us into the seemingly picture-perfect world where there is no murder. Of course something this perfect has to has its flaws, and Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) is sent in to find these flaws. His introduction kicks off a chain of events which leads to the real story, when the Precogs see Chief Anderton himself commit a murder 36 hours in the future. Anderton proceeds to flee and the chase begins.<br/><br/>As this plot unfolds a mystery is unraveled that can keep your attention for a while, but eventually becomes tedious and overlong. A lot of this is due to Mr. Tom Cruise. I personally am not a fan of Cruise at all. Nine times out of then he delivers a lackluster performance and never convinces me that he is acting, so much as pretending. Anderton's backstory concerning his dead son and ex-wife ends up playing a major role in the mystery and due to Cruise's stale acting, I wasn't invested in the character by this point. The idea of Precrime is an interesting and intriguing concept, yet it isn't executed as well as it could be with a lacking script and an unconvincing main character.<br/><br/>A movie with the name Spielberg attached to it should almost always be visually stunning. Sadly, this is one area where Minority Report lacks to an extent. The futuristic scenery is very nice looking and the whole plot traverses a creative array of settings. Yet Spielberg irritatingly washes out all these potentially beautiful scenes with blinding white light that floods the screen and greatly distracts from everything else. It is also the action sequences which fault the film. There's nothing special about them and often times they are unbelievable and even goofy. Some of the scenes extend the laws of physics and gravity to overall silly extents. Spielberg also finds it necessary to throw in comedic relief amidst his action for no apparent reason. Every time something like this happened, instead of being entertained and amused, I was only irritated because the movie obviously couldn't get its priorities straight.<br/><br/>I'll admit that the film picks up towards the end when an interesting twist is revealed, but overall the film lacks in its story and characters and I was mostly disappointed by what an interesting subject matter such as Precrime was able to deliver."

","Indeed the storyline, on its own is a little meagre, even ""predicable"" pardon my Pre-Cogs. Alright the idea that you're caught before the murder, is special and let's you think on the consequences, the whole concept of it is scary stuff. But now the film, nice special effects, not to unrealistic or overpowering, and than you have the problem, its soooo slow, half way you saw everything. The fight scenes between the pre-crime cops and the hero are annoying, and much to long. The hero is dull and boring, of course I'm not a fan of Mr Tom Cruise, the rest of the group, I recognize from serials as Cold Case, Medical Investigations and the Practice, good there but not in this one. Also Mr Colin Farrell, I don't see the fuss people are making about him, he has much to learn about acting in my point of view, being beautiful is not everything! Even, and I'm a big fan of John Williams, the music sucks, nothing new or special, John's heart is not in this project. Overall and this is my point of view, not a Steven Spielberg's masterpiece, lucky for me, I saw it on TV and not on the big screen that would have been a waste of money and time."
"candclovefactory","5","2","3","30 August 2003"," the film was convoluted, underused it's actors and was way too long
","This may contain spoilers of the plot, so be aware if you continue to read:<br/><br/>Minority Report was a film that after seeing the trailers, I already knew it would not meet my expectations.  Unfortunately, I decided to give it a shot after discovering that my brother had it on DVD (it was free, why not?). I had heard so much positive feedback from others who had seen it, that I figured it would at least be worth my time.<br/><br/>Sadly to say, that was not so.  I found the plot extraordinarily convoluted (even for a sci-fi film), felt that character's roles were underdeveloped, and given the fact that I felt it had already reached it's climax at 2 hours into the film doesn't speak very well for the remaining 30 minutes that followed.  These are just some of the items I will focus on below.<br/><br/>For starters, one piece of advise to Spielberg:  you have achieved your goal of making some of the finest and most profitable films in history.  Don't let that clout go to your head anymore and insist on making garbage like this.  If you are going to film more movies where you lay down the law for the characters like (spoiler) ""do not take the bandages off for twelve hours or you will go blind"", then make sure you follow through and make them blind for doing so.  He still had 5-6 hours to go, didn't he?  Well then, why didn't he go blind?  And likewise, (spoiler #2) why did the pre-cog at Cruise's house near the end freak out for him to run, even though in the very end, he is free and acquitted of the murders?  If she really could see the future as far as their son was concerned (at the house), then wouldn't that mean that she could see Cruise's future too and know that all would work out ok?  Oh yeah, that's because they still had no clue how to end the movie until they were at it's doorstep.  That just to let you know, means that they were inconsistent with the plot-line.  Very convoluted.  Bad move.<br/><br/>But that's just one example.  There were many other parts that were in violation of the trust the film-goer gives the filmmaker in order to enjoy the set-up.  Too bad there's not enough here for those other examples.<br/><br/>Then there was the performances.  I'll just focus on Colin Ferrel's. Nice and all, but hey, all of a sudden (spoiler #3) we're killing him off near the end after barely having any screen time in the movie.  Why?  I guess to make the bad guy look even more bad.  I personally didn't catch any real motivation from the bad guy in the movie, so if there is anyone else that did, please remember and tell me if I ever bump into you on the street. Good thing for him, he didn't need this role to show he's a great actor. Thank goodness!  (PS, I used to have enough trust in Spielberg that if I saw something like a (spoiler #4) bloodpack under an actor's shirt after being shot, then that meant that he wanted us to know that the character really wasn't dying, only that he was maybe fooling the person that shot him making him think that he died.  But then he did die.  Made me very confused.  I guess the days of Spielberg being very careful about his filmmaking techniques are over.)<br/><br/>As far as the length goes, holy crap, I was so ready for it to be over after Cruise realized he was set up, that the remaining half-hour dragged on so slow, I kept asking my wife ""Is it over yet?  Why isn't it over yet?""  It wasn't just the end though, Act II pretty much dragged.  Why did we have to know (spoiler #5) the exact situation and wherabouts of everybody in the building when the spiders where eye-scanning people?  The shot showing us all of that was way too long and could have been completely cut short.  I remember being told that if there is something that doesn't help tell the story then it should be cut out of the film.  A shot that's close to two-minutes long telling us how the spiders crawl in and get scans of people's eyes needs to be shortened extremely.  There were likewise other examples where scenes could have been cut-short, but once again, you get the idea.<br/><br/>So all in all, I was very disappointed with the movie.  I don't think I'll be paying any money to see any more of Spielberg's movies until he can throw away all the garbage that got him to where he is now and go back to his roots.  Let's focus on some good reality-based storytelling.  That's what I used to like him for."
"Twillhead","5","2","3","23 February 2003"," Potentially Great Film Falls Flat
","By the end of ""Minority Report,"" I felt cheated that a wonderful premise, fraught with social and political ambiguity, and the makings of a potentially great film, so completely, tragically missed its mark. It is difficult for me to believe that this is the film Spielberg wanted to make. It is visually interesting, if self-consciously so, but there is little substance behind the high-tech crap. And moments of 'levity'--inserted, I suppose, to occasionally lighten up the tone of the film--is sophomorically, embarrassingly silly (small SPOILER: like Tom Cruise chasing after his runaway eyeballs). The only aspect that was, for me, mildly engaging was the plight of the ""precogs,"" especially Agatha, movingly portrayed by Samantha Morton. The only other performance of note is by the wonderful Tim Blake Nelson (of 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?' fame), who certainly knows how to make the most of a small role. The rest, even the great Max von Sydow, cannot rise above the clumsy script and even clumsier direction (sorry, Steven). Dashing Tom Cruise slaps on a face of grim determination and tries to pass it off as acting. Colin Farrell, equally dashing and determined, pulls off a Javert-like performance that is solid, if not illuminating. (One more possible small SPOILER) The happily-ever-after ending was especially annoying to me, and persuaded me from a passive ""oh-well-you-can't-win-'em-all-Steven"" attitude to an active dislike for this unbelievably sloppy film. ** out of *****."

","Pairing Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise must undoubtedly be a nightmare for many people, but for those in their fan clubs it had plenty of promise, and ""Minority Report"" is a definite return to form for the master after ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" - itself flawed but not as bad as many claim it is.<br/><br/>Like ""Total Recall,"" this expands on (and from what I'm told almost totally changes) the Philip K. Dick story it's based on, and if the result is essentially ""The Fugitive"" with a bigger budget, harking back to that fine example of Action Movies With A Brain is no bad thing. You all know the plot (Precrime cop Cruise discovers he's wanted for a murder he's going to commit in just over 50 hours and goes on the run, etc.,), but Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's screenplay offers intriguing notions alongside all the thrills, and Spielberg delivers a welcome return to basics - let's not forget this is the man who did ""Duel"" and ""Jaws"" - while not betraying the ""Thank goodness he's grown up"" crowd. (Yes, we all know ""Schindler's List,"" ""Amistad,"" ""Saving Private Ryan"" and ""A.I. Artificial Intelligence"" were children's movies, right?) One moment we're experiencing a high-speed chase through an automobile factory, the next we're pondering the ramifications of a system that allows crime to become almost extinct. Somehow I can't imagine ""Scooby-Doo"" doing that.<br/><br/>The movie's filled with special effects, of course, but Spielberg movies always have them serve the story instead of vice versa, and it continues here - throughout the result is that of a believable future world (love the ever-changing newspapers and magazines). And instead of complaining about the product placement in ""Minority Report"" (something which I've personally never really had a problem with), let's look at another aspect of the tale. Throughout the movie, water is a recurring motif; the Twentieth Century Fox and DreamWorks logos are presented through water, several crucial scenes take place around bodies of water (a coastline, a swimming pool), and Cruise's police officer evades his pursuers at one point with the help of an umbrella and a downpour. There may be other theories about this, but since it's associated with the good guys throughout the movie (and note the last shot of the movie), my own view is that you can see through water, and thus get a clear view of what's happening - thus, water = the truth.<br/><br/>Whether you agree or not, you have to agree that blockbuster movies that give you a rollercoaster ride and food for thought are to be encouraged. Spielberg, his writers, his crew and cast keep the tension running high for nearly all of its length (the final confrontation between Cruise and the villain is just a bit off, and both it and the first scene are a little too TV-ish for comfort), but in the end ""Minority Report"" works for considerably more than a minority of viewers. The master still has it. The Dream still Works.<br/><br/>PS: I didn't spot Cameron Diaz, but the lady Cruise and Samantha Morton encounter in the mall does look a lot like Lucy Liu..."

","Great concept, one with themes of predeterminism vs. free will, as well as the use of advanced technology to fight crime with the drawbacks of loss of privacy and potential for abuse. There are some pretty cool moments, but overall it's flawed in execution; you'll have to suspend disbelief too many times, and there are lots of groan-inducing moments. Maybe the biggest one for me is Tom Cruise's character weepily saying ""I want him back so bad"" in a scene about his son, and there are several others where Spielberg should have trusted his actors to deliver emotions nonverbally, instead of having them say cheesy lines.<br/><br/>For my taste, the film would have been better pared down and darker both visually and in tone. Think of what it could have been if it had focused more on the weightier philosophical or police state aspects, as opposed to settling for the sentimentality of a personal story amidst an excessive number of plot twists. Think of the possibilities for an ending with either a skyrocketing murder rate or an injustice, something ambiguous or chilling. Think of what it might have been like delivered ala Blade Runner (1982), which was also based on a Philip K. Dick story.<br/><br/>With that said, Spielberg targets a blockbuster popcorn movie and there's a certain appeal to that, and it's reasonably entertaining. I also loved seeing 73-year-old Max von Sydow."
"filipemanuelneto","9","1","1","18 December 2019"," One of the best films of 2002, with moral issues and a good story behind it.
","What would happen if we could predict a crime with details and certainty before this same crime actually happened? This is the basic premise of this film, set in 2054, where a system was set up (Washington D.C. only) called ""Pre-Crime"" that allows the authorities to take precautionary action by arresting criminals in the act before committing the act. However, the entire system relies on three people with a knack for seeing crimes that have not yet happened, and which are held virtually captive and asleep, called ""Pre-Cogs."" However, doubts arise when Pre-Crime Division Chief John Anderton is spotted by the pre-cogs while committing a future assassination. Anderton will therefore try to understand how everything will happen and ensure that it does not happen.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film is very well done. Set in the near future, there is much of the Orwellian universe here: people who are identified by the retina anywhere, as if a ""big brother"" watched over everything and everyone, a strong and controlling authority ... the movie, at this point, reminds a lot the works of this writer, famous for the pessimistic way in which he faced the future of humanity. The scene of the invasion of the condominium by the police spiders, in order to identify everything and everyone, is one of the moments that most reveals the controlling nature of the authorities, as if the ends justified all means, including the invasion of privacy and the home of each person. Of course, the weaknesses of the Pre-Crime system are exposed by the film and this raises complex moral and ethical questions. There is some poetic justice here, as it is someone in the system who tries to undermine the system to save itself. However, from a certain point in the movie, everything becomes increasingly clear and predictable, moving towards an ending that may, in fact, leave us wanting something more.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is an actor I don't particularly like, but I must admit that with this movie he got one of the best performances of his career so far. John Anderton is a good character, and Cruise was able to gradually destroy the character's confidence convincingly. The way he worked and brought to life the main character is one of the pillars that underpins the entire film, although he collaborates well with other good actors such as Max von Sydow and Colin Farrell. They never match Cruise, just giving you the support you need.<br/><br/>On a technical level, and being a futuristic sci-fi movie, we should highlight the positive visual, special and CGI effects that Spielberg (who already has school at this point) has secured for the film. It was a job well done. Only those cars and airways didn't convince me, looking like something out of the Jetsons universe. Other than that, the focus is on realistic holograms, advanced computing, recreational 3D, robotics, etc. everything seems to be in line with the way humanity is developing.<br/><br/>It is undoubtedly a good movie, one of the best in that distant year of 2002, and it still has room on the shelves and movie channels of our day."

Expections have got to be high when the original book is by Philip K Dick, the screenplay by John Cohen, the director is Spielberg, and the stars are Cruise and Colin Farrell. And my expectations were fully met. Sure, there's pseudoscientific mumbo-jumbo as in most sci-fi, but they make it work here. The pace is good, and there is just enough dark humor (love Peter Stormare) , chases, fights, and emotional moments to easily keep the viewer's attention the whole time. The couple of plot twists are well done and not too obvious, and even the villan seems human with a semi-legitimate motive. Of course it helps that he's played by the legendary Max von Sydow. Samantha Morton was superb as the severely distressed precog, and Lois Smith's cameo reminded me of the Oracle from the Matrix, which is a very good thing. Bravo to everyone involved in this."

","28 June 2002. The fuel-celled, powered cars looked something like a scene from the animated Disney movie, ""Tron"" and the special effects of the cars almost seemed to be the same, about 15, 20 years old. This movie while fun and engrossing doesn't really rise to the qualitative level of the visionary ""Blade Runner."" The overemphasis of style over substance in the beginning felt more like a director who wanted to try to show off the futuristic gadgetry except with less success than in ""2001: A Space Odyssey."" There are irritating lapses in believeability, where Tom Cruise overlooks the simple fact that he can be located through electronic surveillance of his retinal patterns, as a top cop he can't even physically defend himself successfully from an amateur Justice Department sleuth, that stun guns aren't used when they would be most effective, and crime fighters can even set up a trap to ""surround"" someone even when they know where their suspect is going to be.<br/><br/>Overlooking these obvious glitches, the movie moves apace with a decent plot and some interesting futuristic set designs and gadgets that were created based on real ideas about the future. The personal emotions of the characters poured through at appropriate times, though the use and manner of humor in the movie tended to diminish the seriousness and realism that a director such as Ridley Scott would have brought to the screen - here Spielberg was trying to be too cute. This movie won't win any awards except for technical and special effects and design but it will bring in the bucks for action. This movie probably raises more questions in this time of heightened terrorist fear and civil rights sensitivity than it answers.<br/><br/>In short, ""A Minority Report"" is just about picking the right sandwich and milk bottle from a refrigerator when you're blind and groping through the darkened alleys of the imagination of Phillip K. Dick, the sci fi author who penned the short story upon which this movie was based."

"zkonedog","7","1","1","11 March 2017"," A Concept Film That Also Wows With Action
","Imagine if you could be charged & arrested for a crime you were ABOUT to commit? That is the premise behind Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"".<br/><br/>For a basic plot summary, the film (set in the future) focuses on John Anderton (Tom Cruise), chief of the highly successful ""Pre-Crime"" unit, which (with help from three special pre- cognizants) are able to predict a murder BEFORE it occurs, rendering the crime rate almost nil. However, Anderton suddenly finds himself the target of a pre-crime investigation, and embarks on a crusade to prove his innocence...which in itself is in doubt until the shocking conclusion.<br/><br/>In terms of plot, the film excellently delivers a high-concept topic in a way that both creates high drama and gets you thinking about the possibility of such events actually occurring. At its heart, ""Minority Report"" is a concept film, but one in which the events are portrayed (thanks to Spielberg) in such a linear, easy-to-understand manner that it actually feels like an action- adventure epic.<br/><br/>The acting, with Cruise leading the way, is also entertaining, as Cruise plays a very convoluted Anderton. On one hand, he believes in the PreCrime system with all his heart. On the other, he grapples with the fact that he himself could be a casualty of that very system.<br/><br/>About the only thing I didn't like about this film were some of the extended action scenes. While flashy, in terms of real-ness they were much more suited for, say, a James Bond film. In other words, a bit too fakey for my tastes.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a great concept film that will keep you thinking, draw you into the characters, and keep you on the edge of your seat. Creatively, I compare it to Blade Runner, although much better in terms of the action/adventure angle, whereas Blade Runner seems so bleak."

","Steven Spielberg is one of the Definitive directors of our times he's done everything and has changed cinema more than once but out of all his films over all the decades that he's been a director Minority Report in my opinion is his greatest achievement and is my second favourite movie of all time. I love everything about this movie from its through provoking plot to its gorgeous world. The main story of this film seems all but to realistic you can't help but debate with yourself about the system they have in place is it the fight way to do things? Is there a better way? Questions like these are what make Minority Report more than just an average action thriller. The opening scene of this film is one of my favourite openings in any movie, it perfectly presents to us how things are done in this future and the effectiveness of this team. The world in this film is incredible but not blown out of proportion it feels like it could exist one day, the blown out whites that Spielberg out into this film made it feels like the future and never seemed distracting. Tom Cruise is so good in this film, I really liked his character he was not just a perfect police officer but a damaged one that added a layer of complexity to him, you understood perfectly why he was the way he was and you were able to sympathise with him all the way through. Max Von Snydow was fantastic in this movie not only did he have great chemistry with Cruise but he just had a presence to him when ever he was on screen and when he eventually shows his true colours you completely understand his motivations. That's another great thing about this movie everybody has a reason for the way they feels they all have their own views and opinions, nobodies a mindless drone in this film. The way this film approached the murder mystery was enthralling, it was built up perfectly to another one of my all time favourite movie moments the scene were Cruise confronts who he thinks killed his son, this scene truly proved how good an actor Cruise is you believe his rage but when he chooses not to kill him you feel so satisfied. In my opinion this is one of the only movies dealing with time manipulation that doesn't really have any plot holes to it, any hole you might see in this system is carefully countered through intelligent conversation between characters. The way this film ends between Cruise and Snydow is amazing, it's very physiological you really don't know what's going to happen and everything comes together perfectly for an intense ending that perfectly wraps up the physiological war between these two characters. Know I know the most common complaint about this film is its stereotypical happy ending but I really like it you get the sense that these two characters have had some closure and are ready to move on.<br/><br/>Minority Report is a flawless movie it's intriguing and engaging, never boring its directed beautifully, has the greatest future since Blade Runner, has excellent performances and thought provoking arguments that ring true to real life and will forever be one of my favourite movies and a constant reminder of why I love cinema so much.<br/><br/>100%/A+"

"RResende","Null","1","1","3 May 2009"," noisy Kubrick
","I always appreciate Spielberg's efforts to make real films, those that go beyond the simple entertainment that permeates his career. He gave us and still gives, from time to time, joyful moments. He is anchored in stories, and he has a visual shape to his own world, and that's something not that common in the work of directors who so often aim at massive diffusion. But he also wants to make good work, and indeed he knows what molds the great films. He knows it as a spectator, and he understands it as a filmmaker. But in this field, he is an incomplete creator, because he is never able that film selling mundane golden rule of giving the public what the public wants.<br/><br/>Here he tackles Kubrick. He had done it the year before with the disastrous Artificial Intelligence, which was a project Kubrick himself was apparently cherishing at the time of his death. Spielberg couldn't handle it, and made one of his worst films, which is not at least watchable. He tries to make it up here, and he partially does it. He chooses Cruise, who had been in Kubrick's final effort. Cruise is relatively weak, or at least not suited for adventurous flights, he is straightforward and what he does as an actor doesn't reflect any kind of understanding of the rules of the game he is supposed to be playing. Kubrick didn't took him, he took a couple who was it already for the publics eyes. Besides, Tom's character there is supposed to be clueless. Well, here as well, but he is allowed to take the lead of the narrative. That is one of the flaws in this film: to allow Cruise to be the action figure everyone expects him to be blurs the emphasis the images and how they build realities should have. Also, the useless branches in the narrative main course deviate from the interesting potential this film had. Why do we need the revival of the romance between Anderton and his former wife? Or underlining so much the sorrow for his past losses? Well, because that reduces the risk that the audience would be put away by the film, and the producers wouldn't want that, and Spielberg wouldn't say no. Moralizing about how apparently perfect and fair systems are usually corrupted and their highest hierarchies is a minor flaw.<br/><br/>But there are very good things in this film, and Spielberg is as well to be granted its strong points. He picks a Phil Dick story, which means he will work with memories, possible worlds, provisional realities. Dick's stuff is highly cinematic in its roots, because it is usually visual (literally here) and explores narrative: stories about storytelling. Also, that is the stuff that permeates some of Kubrick's most deep works. So that is table were Spielberg lays his skills, and he knows that. And he builds the skeleton well enough. We have a cop whose work is to interpret images. Those images are provided by three beings with a divine aura (the ability to provide us with images is sacrate!). The cop concludes the reality of the film through the images within the film. Because the validity of those images is unquestioned in the world of the film, the power to bend those images is limitless. So the story is a quest for being able to distinguish between truth and lies, but, and that is the real trick, truth and lies told by the images. Some bits are precious, like how the images that foresee Anderton as a murderer match the real events, or the footage of the drowned lady. But we don't watch these images long enough, and the images themselves are not powerful enough most of the times, and the outcome of everything is done in the fields of common, now outdated action films, not in the films of the images, like it would (and was) perfectly done by Kubrick, Antonioni, Wenders or de Palma.<br/><br/>If i hit hard on Spielberg is because i treasure his imagination and his ambitions. I wish he'll do really well some day.<br/><br/>My opinion: 3/5<br/><br/>http://www.7eyes.wordpress.com"

The plot seems to be nothing more than the usual run'n'hide for Cruise, but the good twists keep it lively. Only REALLY negative thing I have to say about this, are the kids that can see the crimes before they're committed. Of course they explain why this is possible, but it's quite far fetched.

","Knowing the pedigree of this film (original concept by Phillip K. Dick and directed by Steven Spielburg) I had some pretty high hopes for it. Sure, I could see that it was an action vehicle for Tom Cruise, but Minority Report followed a recent Hollywood trend of hiring supporting good actors for action movies, so I knew that everything wasn't going to rest on Cruise's acting shoulders. The previews also showed an interesting set-up, so I had some high hopes for this film. Having seen it, my opinion of Minority Report is this:<br/><br/>It is a good film providing you don't think about it.<br/><br/>Once you start to think about it, you start uncovering plot holes of varying sizes. And every plot hole niggles away at the premise of the film. The pacing of Minority Report is such that you probably won't have time to think about the plot holes as the scenes flash by and you are distracted by the gadgets and narrative twists. Once you leave the cinema, you'll start to go, ""Hey, what about...?"" and the credibility of Minority Report will drop.<br/><br/>I can appreciate that adapting a short story for a feature film is hard and that social metaphysics often don't translate well in action films. But for every review that mentions Bladerunner in the same breath as Minority Report, consider that this appears to be Spielburg's Bladerunner, where even the dark and dingy areas of the District of Colombia (the film's setting) appear sanitised.  Where Bladerunner contained a number of metaphysical issues about the nature of humanity, Minority Report adds in a cool looking gadget. The issue of Precrime (stopping murder before it happens) is brushed over with no discussion of substance - it exists, just accept it.<br/><br/>Minority Report does require a huge suspension of disbelief on behalf of the audience to maintain its credibility. This suspension is aided by the fast pacing of the narrative and by very good acting performances (Samantha Morton as Agatha and Max Von Sydow are great to watch). But as soon as you start to think about it..."

","Phillip K. Dick based movies are somewhat tricky. When in the right hands, they can turn into true gems (Blade Runner, Total Recall); although they also tend to become mediocre from time to time (Paycheck) or just plain messes (Next). This time around, though, P. Dick gets the royal treatment, with the help of one Steven Spielberg (director) and one Tom Cruise (star). This dynamic duo of extreme talent hands out one of the most accelerating and captivating sci-fi adventures to ever embrace the silver screen. The film, as a whole, left me very satisfied – thanks to the accurate storytelling, engaging special effects and unique setting and vision of the not-so-far future.<br/><br/>The story follows John Anderton (Cruise), head of Precrime, a futuristic police force whose genetically enhanced employees have the unique ability to foresee the future, therefore helping the unit's policemen to prevent crimes before they occur. This technological advancement quickly gets out of hand when Anderton becomes the prime suspect of a future murder he is about to commit. Thing is, Anderton doesn't know the victim, and soon becomes a victim of the system he so dearly embraces. Questions of the morality of justice and law enforcement ensue, as Anderton embarks on a journey to both prove his innocence as well as find out who's really behind this crime.<br/><br/>Once the action shifts gear, you'll have a blast. Look out for excellent performances by Collin Farrell (in one of his earlier roles) as the investigator trying to beat Anderton at his own game; and Samantha Morton as Agatha, one of three Precrime enhanced predictors, who has the ability to see the ""Minority Report"" and predict the flip-side result of the upcoming crime."

","'Minority Report' is gripping and intelligent for most of the film but the impact falls away towards the end.<br/><br/>First of all, the premise is cool and so is the way the film handles everything. We all know Spielberg is a capable and quality filmmaker and the whole pre-crime concept is introduced and explained well. There are nice touches here and there such as 'conducting' the search for the murderer. Its true that some aspects of this film like plot devices and technical choices (all films agree that the future will have cold, blue light) are kind of standard and not that original. Not only that but red herrings like new alphabet letters and pills that make time pass faster were promised beforehand.... However, this doesn't really rankle that much. Spielberg doesn't go overboard on the futuristic gadget stuff but concentrates on the characters/story instead.<br/><br/>What's irritating, though, is that some of the plot turns are inconsistent and fairly implausible. I mean, at the start we're told the pre-cogs can only see murder because murder is what most affects the metaphysical universe, however the filmmakers don't stick to this rule later on.<br/><br/>However, As Anderson hurtles towards the future murder he is accused of, the film is mostly tense, thoughtful and gripping. Some of the best scenes don't have to do with chase scenes but character interaction such as Anderton's meeting in the greenhouse and a discussion about his son later on. Unfortunately, after the main event, the film becomes sort of unnecessary and overblown. The ending (concerning pre-crime) isn't very believable at all when you think about it. The early 21st century films - 'AI: Artificial Intelligence,' 'Catch Me if you Can,' and this one seem to be good/great Spielberg. Its nice to see him back at the top of his game, though, with the absolutely heart-stopping 'War of the Worlds,' and the extremely intelligent, respectful and courageous 'Munich.' Spielberg's usual pals in cinematography, score and editing do nice work here but nothing that will blow you away. Cruise does a fairly good job but sometimes seems stretched in some scenes - his 'War of the Worlds' performance is much better. The acting star of the film is Samantha Morton as pre-cog Agatha. She shudders, gasps and sees murder over and over again with wide eyes and raw believability. Colin Farrell also shows smarmy promise here.<br/><br/>In conclusion, a great Spielberg film would probably be considered a triumph for most other people. I recommend you watch this film.<br/><br/>PS: One last thing. If you were Anderton, wouldn't the best thing to do to clear your name be to hide out somewhere and lock the door? That probably wouldn't make for a very interesting film, though, would it?"

","This film marks a triumphant return of the Fritz Langian (Dir. of Metropolis)/ Kubrickian style of film making, one that questions government and personal freedom. What Spielberg did here was part of his ""Running Man Series"" (A.I, Catch Me if You Can, Minority Report), where he presented a multi-layered character, John Anderton, running from the law after being framed for a murder he did not commit. Yet. I stress ""Yet"" because of the Pre-Crime System that is the leading tool in crime in the year 2054, which leads the police to chase after John. The film follows the wrongfully accused John as he evades both the law and his past and tries to seek justice in the end. This film is truly a smart and cunning look at society today and where we are heading. For those of you who are fans of the original 100+ page short story by sci-fi guru Philip K. Dick, you will notice that the subject matter has taken a morose yet poignant turn, giving John more of a past and a purpose.

"owen_twistfield","5","2","4","18 May 2005"," Minority Report: the gravity of unbelief.
","A story is a bit like sleep: wake me up all-of-a-sudden and I am not going to be in the best of moods. Certainly not. This happened to me with Minority Report. It is flawed with moments which drag you out of the story, with incidents in which the suspense of disbelieve loses from the gravity of unbelief. Just a list. The first thing was the usage of stereotypes: - The weird sex frustrated guy who takes care of the precogs and wallows over the female precogs. - The depraved doctor who helps cruise getting a new set of eyes. - The sleazy guy who does all for money and helps cruise download the images from Agatha. But Max Von Sydow's role and that of cruises ex wife are much of the same issue. <br/><br/>The second thing is the hassle with gimmicks: the eyes (or should I say eye scans) for instance. They are too much of a story maker: cruise carries them around in a bag (after having had them replaced), they give access to everything, billboards react to them and at the end his ex-wife liberates him from prison with them. It's rather too much to believe in. And eye scans seems to be the only way in 2054 of identifying people. There is a John Doe in prison, which can't be identified because he has changed his eyes. How odd. What happened to things like photographs, finger-prints, dental patterns and DNA? The same can be said of the way they investigate the pre-crime. We see one guy doing all the work. That's is an inefficient way of working? Why not use a whole team assisted by computers? Well otherwise cruise wouldn't be a star I think.<br/><br/>The third thing is that the plot is helped along by unbelievable plot turns. An example is that nobody bothers to revoke cruises access to high security area's or his bank account nor are there any alarms going of when he uses them. He and his ex-wife uses his eyes to get access to the precrime HQ and the prison even up until the end of the movie and this is no mere bickering from my side: without this access the movie would have fallen apart. Also cruise seems to have no problem withdrawing money or getting access to crucial files. <br/><br/>The fourth thing is the action scenes. Some are good, but probably in an effort to outdo the matrix cruise takes on 5 to 6 opponents at the same time. This is a bit much for me to accept, as cruise is no neo. He is merely human.<br/><br/>All in all there are too many moment of wakening and to few moments of greatness who help you sleep.<br/><br/>(Post mortem:) Some say this movie is a bit like a film noir, but it's not. A film noir is a dark movie in which a cynical pessimistic main character is sucked into a world of crime and evil and this decline usually reflected in his own personal decline (he is beaten up, grows a beard, drinks, smoke etc). The struggle against the world of crime and evil is mirrored by a personal struggle between what is good and what is bad. Cruise looks as dandy at the end of the movie as he does at the beginning nor see any drawn out struggle in his persona. Usually the hero is a small fish: a detective (either free lance of from the police), a journalist or a gangster. A marginal figure. Nothing of this has anything to do with cruise; he's the head of pre-crime a hero type who through decisive action wins all. Although not a strict requirement: there is no femme fatale. It would have made this movie probably far better if there had been one. It lacks the typical film noir language (cynical remarks, lucid discussions and interest tag lines for instance). It lacks the cynical dark mood or the associated film style. It's no film noir."

"Silverzero","10","2","4","16 May 2003"," Spectacular, dazzling futuristic sci-fi thriller, demonstrating Hollywood at its very best.
","`Minority Report' is without doubt one of the greatest sci-fis in a long, long time. Popcorn entertainment for the eyes and mind. What it really is, is a demonstration of how outstanding technology is in the high-tech world of today. Of course one of the main problems that effects these blockbuster hits is that it may overload on special effects and be very poor in the script and dialogue. `Minority Report' avoids this problem with delightful relish. Of course the visuals are mesmerising as expected, but the plot holds your attention and the dialogue is never clunky, wooden or unconvincing. <br/><br/>Another thing that the film has in spades is imagination. It tries to show a well-detailed portrait of a gloomy utopian future. You can see that a lot of work went into the script and the imagination is simply oozing out of its sides. But it has a minor deficiency of one thing- heart. While there is plenty of genuine grievances with Tom Cruise's character and his wife, the rest of the cast doesn't seem to have that many emotional reactions. However, there's still more heart present than in similarly themed big-budget outings. Besides, the body is big enough to carry the brains around. <br/><br/>`Minority Report' is divided into three different parts, each a different branch of the sci-fi genre. It starts off as a futuristic noir with a cool plot, in which cops must race against time to prevent crimes. The second part is rather like `The Fugitive' with the classic man-on-the-run scenario. But there's the extra-added twist that keeps us on the edge of the seat- he kills someone in 48 hours who he's never heard of or does he? The least glamorous of the three parts, the conclusion is a gloomy but enjoyable `clue-in-the-clock' mystery/suspense thriller. Of course the story does seem complicated, but it makes sense if you give it your attention.<br/><br/>
In a film that headlines Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, one would have the highest of expectations, and I certainly wasn't disappointed. They are two of Hollywood's biggest icons and it's about time they worked together.<br/><br/>
`Minority Report' is simultaneously a dark vision of the future and Hollywood at its most glamorous (excelling brilliantly both ways). With some many great things, the minor quibbles are virtually erased to make this a chilling, outstanding and above all else enjoyable science fiction movie. My IMDb rating: 8.4/10."

This is as close as Spielberg's ever gotten to film-noir. The movie is a whodunnit, (or more rather, a ""whowilldoit"") with a new piece of the [VERY CLEVER] story revealing itself at every turn.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are filled with such whimsicality that only Spielberg could make them work.

"dee.reid","10","2","4","22 December 2002"," ""Minority Report"" - 10/10
","""Minority Report"", I think is about as realistic as a future science-fiction thriller could possibly get. It has a very realistic setting, characters and a police system that sometime, not too far down the road, is eerily possible. The whole ""pre-crime"" issue is what is at this film's heart. <br/><br/>Suppose a person was to get arrested before they are able to commit a crime.<br/><br/>Even today, this is possible, but only through the most careful of planning. But we cannot rely on careful planning forever, though. So in ""Minority Report"", we have the Pre-Cognitives (pre-cogs), three psychic human beings who are suspended in a flotation tank and are able to sense future crimes that are going to be committed. We learn that they are never wrong. (The actual details of a crime can be a little fuzzy, but it usually is nothing serious that will detract from making an arrest.) But they can sometimes disagree. So a ""minority report"" is filed whenever there is a disagreement amongst the pre-cogs. This sets up the film's plot which involves pre-crime cop Tom Cruise going on the run to prove his innocence when the pre-cogs name him as a future murderer.<br/><br/>This is by far Steven Spielberg's most complex film to date. Though this is not Spielberg's first venture into science-fiction, it is his best. Tom Cruise makes a very believable protagonist here. The entire issue of ""Pre-Crime"" is treated as something of a flawed advance in law enforcement. It raises questions of how the police can be truly certain that a person is going to commit a crime or is it inevitable that the future can be altered. You see, it is all just too complex to really put into words here, you just have to watch the movie and form your own thoughts."

Two computers in the same small high-tech room more than 50 years in the future use removable media to communicate rather than being networked. Anderton (the greatly overrated Tom Cruise) could have simply hid out in the wilds for 36 hours and shown the warrant against him to be baseless rather than suffering an eye transplant and risk capture or worse to find the ""minority report"" on him.  The ""precog"" Agatha, Anderton, and Burgess (Max von Sydow) all admit that individuals have a choice while the latter two also insist that the future crimes are predestined -- just one of many examples of the film defying its own logic.

Notwithstanding a few eyebrow-raising special effects, Spielberg's attempt at informing us that we're all in control of our own destiny is spoiled by one dimensional characters and a very predictable plot. All the caricatures are there:- the geeky nerd with a perm wearing shorts and a flowery shirt, the white-collared bad guy, the cute kid with a bowl haircut (you just want to slap), and Cruise getting serious. Even the tagline, ""Everybody Runs"" was clearly just a promotional after thought, as John Anderton (Cruise) is the only pre-crime suspect that runs, and the phrase is embarrassingly thrown into the godawful script once or twice.

"Buddy-51","Null","2","4","8 July 2002"," another indication why Spielberg is one of the great movie artists
","`Minority Report' is the latest audacious triumph from America's premier filmmaker, Steven Spielberg.  Unlike most successful directors, who are content to rest on their laurels and keep producing works of similar theme and content, Spielberg is not afraid to test the limits of his medium by producing works that are both spellbinding and visionary.  He is even willing to risk alienating a mass audience unequipped or unwilling to come along with him on his journey of discovery (which partly explains the relative box office failure of his masterful `A.I.' in 2001).  It is ironic that Spielberg, who is often charged (falsely) will being largely responsible for the `dumbing down' of American movies over the past several decades, is now making more intelligent and adult-oriented films than virtually anyone working in Hollywood today.<br/><br/>The theme of `Minority Report' is very similar to the one found in `A Clockwork Orange':  just how far are we willing to go in trading away a person's civil rights in order to achieve a society devoid of the threat of crime and violence.  In `Orange,' the society of the future attempted to head criminality off at the pass by `reprogramming' potential criminals before they had the chance to actually commit the crimes.  `Minority Report,' based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, creates a future society that has managed to find a way to do virtually the same thing, only, in this case, scientists have enlisted the aid of genetic mutants who have the ability to witness murders before they happen and can then pass that information on to the authorities.  Law enforcement now becomes a matter of apprehending and imprisoning criminals BEFORE they have even committed the crime.  The problem arises when John Anderton, one of the `Pre-Crime' agency's top cops, is himself shown to be a future murderer.  The plot of the film becomes, essentially, the classic chase story, in which an `innocent' man must elude his pursuers while at the same time unraveling the clues that will ultimately lead to his proving his innocence.  From this material, writers Scott Frank and John Cohen have fleshed out an intricate and fascinating plot that keeps us guessing all the way to the film's finale.<br/><br/>In many ways, though, it is not in the narrative details that `Minority Report's true greatness lies (after all, this story is basically a redo of this year's earlier, abysmal `Imposter,' which, by the way, was also derived from a Dick story).  It is the vision that Spielberg brings to the material that sets it apart.  Rarely have we ever seen a future world brought so vividly and believably to life as it is here.  Set in 2054, the film is a total visual masterpiece.  Aided by astonishing production design, cinematography and special effects, Spielberg has created a universe unlike any we have seen before.  One of his most triumphant moves is to not try and imagine the future in totally unfamiliar terms.  Most of the clothes and furnishings seem strangely similar to what we have today.  The effect of this is to help us identify with the characters in a way that might not have been possible had everything been made to seem alien and unrecognizable. What the filmmakers do emphasize in their vision of the future world is the constant barrage of audio/visual stimuli that come in the form of things like personalized holograms and animated periodicals which pinpoint just how close our own world is moving towards this sort of all-encompassing sensory overload.<br/><br/>In a day and age in which even the most elaborate special effects can elicit a yawn from the audience, Spielberg still shows that he has the ability to dazzle us.  There is a chase scene done on a vertical superhighway that far surpasses anything in this summer's `Spiderman' or `Attack of the Clones' for sheer breathtaking ingenuity and excitement.  In fact, on the visual/special effects level alone, `Minority Report' makes those other two films look like first-year film school pikers.  It's also impossible to convey just how extraordinarily brilliant cinematographer Janusz Kaminski's work is on this film.  With his muted color scheme and emphasis on glowing whites, Kaminski brings a true otherworldly quality to Spielberg's vision.<br/><br/>Like all great Spielberg films (and there are so many we can't even count them anymore), `Minority Report' packs a wallop both in the overwhelming intensity of its action sequences and in the quiet moments of subtle reflection where the filmmaker affords us glimpses into the workings of the human heart.  The director is helped immeasurably in the first case by the brilliant editing of Michael Kahn, and in the second by the outstanding performance of Tom Cruise in the lead role.  Cruise has rarely brought such dramatic intensity or such emotional depth to any character the way he does to John Anderton.  The long delayed and long anticipated collaboration between one of the world's greatest directors and one of the world's most charismatic stars has resulted in a film worthy of both of their talents and reputations.<br/><br/>In a time when filmmakers like George Lucas seem mired in the successes of their past, Spielberg continues to move ahead and to develop ever more as an artist.  Even if he were to stop making movies today, Spielberg's oeuvre would put him in the pantheon of the world's greatest film artists of all time.  But let us hope he will continue to make films for a very long time to come.  We eagerly await all those future masterpieces."

"maggie-9","5","2","4","23 June 2002"," I'm sorry - I need to believe in something in a movie - mild spoilers
","Most of those who have seen Minority report appear to like it but it did very little for me.  From the first moment I heard about the plot, I had doubts about the concept.  Infallible pre-cognition and arresting people before they commit a crime are ideas which, on close examination, have so many holes in them that more suspension of belief is needed than I can cope with.  (There have been much more interesting plots which postulated forms of pre-cognition which were much less reliable and therefore much more interesting) If you add to the problems of the main premise the physical characteristics of the world portrayed, which are inconsistent and in some cases pretty ridiculous, and it all becomes too much.  I did not believe that the pre-cogs would be able to stay alive in the environment shown or then cope out of it, I did not believe that the police would fly around in such clunky machines when they could build such aerodynamically engineered cars.  And I don't believe there is any way this can happen by 2054.  Why didn't they just make it far further into the future?<br/><br/>There were a few good things and Spielberg is always an interesting director.  But these cannot weigh against what, in essence, was a pretty weak thriller based on an unacceptable premise. <br/><br/>And then on top of it we have Cruise at his grungiest and most unappealing. I really should go with my gut instinct and not subject myself to things I strongly suspect I am not going to like but hope springs eternal."
"Cineology","10","0","0","30 June 2020"," A Spielberg modern sci-fi classic
","The mission: Find the Minority Report-a vision of a possible future crime, namely murder, from one of the three psychics, called PreCogs, that differs from the other two-and extract it from the mind of its source. Since this report casts doubt on the process, this is proof that the concept behind the 2054 experiment called PreCrime-arresting a person, or persons, before a murder is committed-is flawed and therefore not yet appropriate to be adapted as a nationwide program. This is the plot of Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report,"" based on the 1956 short story by Philip K. Dick, a vision of the future so fully realized that it takes the viewer through a fascinating story of morality, dangers of technology, and human error. It is a science-fiction film for the ages, certainly one of Spielberg's best.<br/><br/>Yet underneath its intelligent ideas, thrilling chase sequences, and eye-catching visual touches somehow both passing as modern and futuristic, it is about a man who remains in grief, in depression, due to the sudden disappearance of his young son six years ago-now presumed to be dead. We go through this compelling journey and realize that the film is about second chances-the very thing that those people arrested for pre-murder are never given, all because of the assumption that PreCogs are never wrong. That is, until this man in grief, John Anderton (Tom Cruise), who lost his identity as a father and as a husband, is deemed guilty of PreCrime-that soon he will shoot a person dead, one he hasn't even met.<br/><br/>Clearly, the picture is capable of delivering thrilling sequences of action-which is different from action sequences although it does that well, too. (The opening scene involving the cheating spouse, the ""Spyders"" on the hunt, and the mall with the balloons are expertly paced and edited.) Notice that before John goes on the run, the screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen ensures we know every relevant detail as to why the protagonist must do what he does.<br/><br/>Since we have a complete picture of what is at stake for the main character, he running for his life-his own friends and colleagues against him-is all the more suspenseful. If he gets caught, we know precisely what will happen him because we have witnessed an arrest and seen what happens to the convicts' bodies. Thus, emphasis is not on what will happen to the character from the perspective of punishment. Instead, importance is placed on the big picture: if PreCrime became a national program, imagine the numerous factors that could go awry, the number of men and women to be wrongly convicted.<br/><br/>The picture is filled with to the brim with inviting performances, from Cruise who is required to juggle being a tough leader, a desperate runaway, and a vulnerable man who lost those most important to him; Samantha Morton as the most gifted PreCog with a tragic backstory; Colin Farrell as the clever and punctilious DOJ agent whose role is to audit the PreCrime program; Max von Sydow as the father of the program and a sort of father figure to John; and last but certainly not least Lois Smith as the mother of the program but has since lived in isolation because her project turned into something that we feel deep down is morally reprehensible to her. Smith gets one scene-a key one-yet it is the most memorable of the bunch because she utilizes every pause and modulate every line of dialogue to her advantage. I craved to know more about her character, particularly her time as a geneticist and her relationship with the PreCogs.<br/><br/>Tightly-written and beautifully photographed, ""Minority Report"" is a modern classic. It clocks in at nearly two-and-a-half hours and yet it moves like a gust of wind because the filmmakers are in complete control of the storytelling machine: a traditional three story arc from Point A to Point Z in a way that is direct with a few surprises along the way.<br/><br/>One of the surprises is its sense of humor. Watch closely when we are shown people simply living in this version of a future and how they adapt to technology, for instance. Look at the advertisements. Observe the freeway scene where cars go up, down, and sideways; are they traveling on a road or on the side of buildings?-it is like a statement on what action films have become... or will become. Hopefully not the latter; the future is not set in stone."

It ends with a damm narration tying everything up in a nice bowl. You actually feel cheated cause the movie starts with no narration ur thrown in this world with no explanation unless of course you have read Philip K Dicks short story which I have.

"yellowtail_tuna","9","0","0","27 June 2020"," Dystopian film that deals with foresight of crimes
","It's common in many dystopian movies that strict surveillance over the people by the authority keeps the ostensible peace and order. What is unique to ""Minority Report"" is the use of foresight, relying on the abuse of PreCogs. How PreCrime keeps them in their chamber is very cruel and repulsive.<br/><br/>Another problem in the system is that their foresight can be a mistake, although PreCrime firmly denies it. John Anderton himself is a confident advocate of the system's infallibility. So when he himself is convicted as a future murderer, fighting back against his former colleagues and the system is partly his redemption.<br/><br/>Set in half a century future from the release, the technology design is interesting to watch. Above all, this is a world filled with displays, many of them are see-through type, from interfaces in PreCrime headquarters to the street ads that call you by your name. We see the futuristic cars and a home voice assistant system too. It's also realistic that the life style of poor people are not so advanced.<br/><br/>Maybe John is among the most serious roles for Tom Cruise. We hardly see him give a smile throughout the film. It is also the thinnest Tom as far as I can remember. He plays the man who keeps desparetely escaping from one place to the next, but he is also approaching to the truth. In this way, his acting is powerful.<br/><br/>The theme may involve the philosophical problem of free will. Treating a person as if they will act by the predetermined fate is an insult to humanity, isn't it?"

","When I rented this movie; when it first came out, it just screamed sex offender registry to me. I am and have been very outspoken on the internet against the sex offender registry and mass incarceration since 2001 online; so this movie really touched me. It is a lonely job; like Chief John Anderton in his quest to disprove Precrime. Lets face it when our government wastes millions of tax payer money on the sex offender registry; they are saying these people will re-offend. Like Minority Report predicts people committing crime; the sex offender registry does the same thing. Instead of freezing them in prison; they allow posting their photos and personal information all over the planet. Even more wasted tax payer money is spent through; police wasting there time constantly investigating them, verses protecting people from real crimes. I always say I would rather have a sex offence committed against me than getting shot in the leg. The amount of people shot and not killed in our country is staggering; look it up. Director Lamar Burgess seems to me to be a great example of a politician fear mongering to gain votes and power at other people's expense. He looks exactly like the character in the sex offender comic I drew and posted on the internet; in the comic Joe Dork. The end gave me chills with lines like this: ""...you know your own future...which means you can change it if you want to."" and this: ""You still have a choice, Lamar."". Of course we can change our future, of course we have a choice; that is what life is all about; even insects and animals display this inherent trait. When I wrote this; I left out the main reason I think this movie is about sex offenders. When a person is put on the sex offender registry they are assigned a risk level. A risk level is just another way of our perverted justice system to say; this person will commit a sex crime."

","This movie is great and I would've given it and 8 but there's to many plot holes and I can't give it more than 7. I would say the misdirection they did with Danny Witwer and how it seems that he set John up was great and I didn't see it coming.(or maybe there wasn't a misdirection at all and I'm just dumb for thinking that)
In the beginning I thought they were gonna show that maybe knowing the future is what causes that future and therefore the Precogs are not always right but they didn't go that way and I don't think it is a flaw for the movie but just my assumption that maybe the movie is gonna go in that direction but my assumptions doesn't make sense now that I watched the whole movie.
And again the movie would've been better if it didn't have all these plot holes.
I was gonna say the biggest plot hole was that the cops didn't show up for the Crow death but my stupid ass remembered that they couldn't find the building cuz there are a lot of them. They still had 36H to find it OR they could've just sent some drones in air to scan the buildings through windows for John as they clearly could, you can't tell me that they just let it go and waited to hear about the murder then go after it! They use robot spiders that can scan a whole building full of people in it but they can't send drones scan some windows?<br/><br/>So for the most obvious plot hole I would say that John is on the run but he still manages to enter the facility and use HIS OWN EYE to get verified and enter and no one's gonna notice? If your officer is accused and is on the run wouldn't the first thing you do(well after chasing him) be revoking his security access? They can find him wherever his eyes get scanned and there's a lot of those scanners out there but they can't know when his eyes get scanned in their own building?<br/><br/>The next plot hole you're not gonna believe what it is. Yes, at the end of the movie John gets captured and they put him on those things and his wife is again able to use HIS EYE to get inside? wtf? where's the logic in that? First of all why is there no guards for the prison? Not one? What about security camera in there to see who goes in who gets out? No? Ok!
So this guy that you know he used his clearance to get inside and snatch the most precious Precog, and now he is in that prison STILL has access to your facility? How dumb are these cops? And the movie proudly explains that she used his eye to get in there! Seriously?<br/><br/>John's left eye is scanned by the Spiders. This is 6 hours after surgery. He was told multiple times not to open his eyes for 12 hours or he would go blind. They never address that for the rest of the movie at all!(though the eye does look damaged).<br/><br/>The whole idea of Precogs being able to see the future is confusing and in the beginning they say that Precogs can only see murders but later in a scene where Agatha and John are running from the cops she somehow can see the everything that's gonna happen? You could say that maybe they just see murders when they are dreaming and she can see all the future because she's awake and she's the most powerful Precog, but it's just a theory cuz they never explain it.<br/><br/>They say that the brown balls are for when the crime is premeditated and the guy planned for it but John didn't even know who Crow at that point. And yes maybe Burgess set up some leads in John's house for him to find out about Crow but still, he doesn't know him and the ball should be... blue maybe? Idk"

","Based on the Philip K.

Indeed, the most memorable character in the film is Agatha, the brightest of the pods, as played by Samantha Morton. Colin Farrell is good as the cocky investigator.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly by-the-numbers with a predictable villain and loads of sentiment. The fast-paced action scenes are over-the-top with special effects. The film is more successful with the quiet moments, especially the touching relationship of John and his estranged wife Lara, both of whom are grieving over the loss of their son.<br/><br/>A troubling aspect of the film was how the three precogs were being exploited in the name of science.

","Minority Report is a film by a man at the top of his game. This is an amazing sci-fi action adventure philosophical film which will whet anyone's appetite. This is the magic of cinema. In the wake of the disappointment of A.I., Minority Report arrives in theaters representing a much-needed tonic for Spielberg. However, this is not just a ""rebound"" picture; it's an achievement - arguably the best escapist entertainment the director has produced in two decades. Minority Report rivals some of Spielberg's top adventure/science fiction epics, such as Close Encounters and Raiders of the Lost Ark. What's more, it affirms that, even in the 2000s, movies do not have to be brain-dead to be exciting. When the season is over, Minority Report will more than likely stand out as the best picture to grace multiplex screens during the Summer of 2002."

","After years of passing it over, I am almost finished Minority Report on Netflix.. and what a ride! Cruise is excellent in this futuristic look at crime prevention in the year 2054, wherein teams of officers use the 'visions' of human 'pre-cogs' to anticipate & halt muderous actions. The time frame seems tight at the outset, meaning the team may not make it in time, which of course, adds to the suspense. We learn that the murder rate in Washington DC has dropped to zero since inception, but a law enforcement group led by Colin Farrel (under the direction of a highly-placed official) are opposed to the continuation and expansion of the so-called 'pre-cog' tool.<br/><br/>Ethical issues are raised, e.g. how can you arrest someone who has the intent to commit a crime, but gets stopped before the actual felony? Can the 'pre-cogs' get it wrong? Cruise, our man in charge, feels the system is just, and foolproof, but soon finds himself 'accused', and fleeing apprehension. Later in his flight, he manages to secure a pre-cog for assistance, who directs his escape with specific instructions, I.e. buy an umbrella, stop here, etc. To a shocked lady passing by, she whispers, He knows-don't go home. This reminds me of the early flight of Neo in the Matrix, when the 'agents' come to arrest him, but he is hearing a narrative-escape plan from Laurence Fishburn, as he runs.<br/><br/>Terrific PG (mostly) entry in a sci-fi flick directed by Spielberg way back in 2002, perhaps perilously close to being forgotten in the wake of the high octane Mission Impossible series. Well worth watching."

","Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) would have done well not to make my summary statement listed above to John Anderton (Tom Cruise). With all that futuristic technology at his disposal, he should have known it would come back to haunt him. <br/><br/>I thought this was a well constructed sc-fi mystery thriller based on a Philip K. Dick short story. Since the picture was made all the way back in 2002, I'm kind of surprised we don't have the kind of targeted advertising shown in the film smacking us in the face yet. Just as well, pop-ups on one's computer screen are annoying enough as it is. At the heart of the story is an idea that I believe will be the downfall of a lot of visionary technology that scientists and corporations expect for the future, that being the fallibility of the human factor. As just one example, driver-less cars. Sounds great on paper but they're already killing people.<br/><br/>There's just one problem in the script that marred an almost perfect screenplay. Once John Anderton was identified as a red ball murderer, his retina scan clearance should have been automatically removed from the Precrime database. But it wasn't, and if you think about it, that lends credence to the argument I just mentioned in the preceding paragraph. Since that clearance wasn't removed automatically (why not?), then some human in charge screwed up.<br/><br/>But with that minor nit-pick aside, I thought this was a well paced thriller, and the final confrontation between Anderton and Lamar had all the classic elements of a Star Trek style conundrum. In other words, if Lamar doesn't kill John, then the precogs are wrong, in which case Precrime gets dismantled. But if Lamar does kill John, the precogs are proven right, but he gets arrested and put away in prison. So the next best alternative....."

This script was eventually tossed out - the only original element remaining in the final film is the sequence in the car factory, an idea that Spielberg loved. In the original short story, ""The Minority Report"" (1956) the protagonist John Anderton is short, fat, and balding, yet here we get action man Cruise, up against the young Federal agent Farrell, who later appeared in another Dick adaptation of Total Recall (2012)."
"MaccyXpert","9","0","0","23 November 2017"," One of Tom Cruise's best
","Tom Cruise stars as John Anderton in this somewhat lengthy but still really cool sci-fi crime film. I'd say this is one of his best movies, with a mix of awesome visuals and a good story with a solid performance from the lead. This movie reminds me a lot of The Fugitive from 9 years ago, with the constant chasing and mysteries being unravelled as the movie progresses. Spielberg mixes the futuristic time with raw emotion here.<br/><br/>The futuristic designs looked pretty noice for a 2002 film and a bit unique, especially with the hover-car designs on those huge highways. Cruise's what- looks-like-a-stylised-Bugatti car was sleek and looked like something you'd think we'd have today but no. The sci-fi nature coincides with Spielberg's previous stuff (Spielberg is an automatic bonus in most cases) and I noticed someone from Band of Brothers (done by Spielberg too) in the movie too as one of Anderton's friends. They did spend a lot (and made a hefty profit), but did not rely on the effects to entertain - the dialogue was paid attention to, thankfully. There's also a hint of politics in the film.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell (the mean guy from Fantastic Beasts) performed well as a cocky and young new agent almost trying to bring down the PreCrime unit, later leading the chase for Anderton. The interactions between him and Anderton showed a sort-of rivalry and pursuing Anderton gave Farrell's character (Danny Witwer) a sort of satisfaction (he tries to look for flaws and finds a human one). <br/><br/>You almost kinda feel sorry for Anderton, when you see what he has to do, how low he has to go and how he was manipulated. His son is a key point in the movie and he's almost used like a toy for Anderton to grab at. Agatha was, at times, cryptic and annoying, but nonetheless helpful to Anderton in his search for the truth (couldn't think of a less cheesy way to put it). The situation that Anderton creates for the villain (who shall remain unnamed) is crafty, combining genius with passion. <br/><br/>The ending was unfortunately a bit out of place, not really following the rest of the film, seeming rushed and understandably a main point of criticism."

"sam_smithreview","9","0","0","24 April 2016"," one of the most complex films that is still enjoyable as a blockbuster
","Steven Spielberg Directs another classical film after his A.I fails to deliver the high expectation set by his previous body of work. Minority Report is like a reminder film that he is still one of the best directors of all time.<br/><br/>Spielberg sets Minority Report in the near future of 2054, in which the technology is advanced, but not far-fetched. Cars can drive themselves (which is pretty much what they can do today. Google car) and ride up elevators, computers come with holograms as a user interface, and stores recognize you from your eyeball scan. As all science fiction fans know, however, the genre is not about technology but about ideas. The big idea for Minority Report is based on a short story by the venerable Philip K. Dick. In this future, there is a ""pre-crime"" unit in the police force, which revolves around three psychics who are able to see violent crimes before they occur. These visions are projected in a flat screen panel and manipulated by detectives with the grace of a symphony conductor. Equipped with futuristic stun guns, jet packs, and search robots, these cops then arrest and intern the criminals before the crimes are committed.<br/><br/>Spielberg, with Janusz Kaminski, his cinematographer for many films, have crafted a visually stunning movie. The special effects are seamlessly incorporated of the world they created.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does a fantastic job of playing the lead. He is becoming one of the best sci-fi stars around, nearly all of his futuristic films are not only box office successful but also are extremely enjoyable and fan loved.<br/><br/>The film is just delight to watch, and has enormous play back value. It is definitely one of the films to own on either DVD, Blu ray or Digital copy"
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","0","26 March 2016"," A little annoying, but really interesting story and theme.
","I'm a little surprised that this doesn't get more criticism because of the plot holes, but I guess that proves how good of a social commentary it is. Preventing crimes before they happen is protective beyond measure, but it infringes on some concepts of freedom and destiny. Also, and I don't think this was ever stated explicitly, it presupposes that the perpetrator is doing the wrong thing, whereas their crime might be something they feel morally obligated to do. In the opening scene for instance, the guy who is arrested doesn't murder his wife and her lover, but he also isn't given the justice of confronting his wife. Coupled with this is the fact that the system does nothing from about the guy's wife cheating on him.<br/><br/>I thought the script was really well paced, especially in how efficiently it showed us how pre-crime worked and exactly what was implied by the subsequent accusation of John Anderton. Also, every action scene had a legitimate purpose and was fully called for, which definitely cannot be said for every action film. However, I had a lot of problems with how the characters were written. Anderton had pretty much no personality, which isn't surprising given that Spielberg is directing. The supporting roles like Lara, Danny Witwer, Fletcher, Agatha, and Lamar were decent all around, but the minor characters showed some issues. All of them were distinct, but they were all annoying too. In some cases this wouldn't be an issue, but since there were a lot of minor characters, it was a detractor.<br/><br/>The story shows how the system could be corrupted, and I think the theme was really consistent with that in all of the different pre crime scenarios. It can be a little hard to follow some of the technical rules of the system and how they relate to the theme, but it's worth it to go back and find out. The plot is really good in an antagonist sense, because your loyalties change around a lot throughout, though you're never meant to be against John Anderton. It also plays around a lot with fate vs. free will since the crimes will apparently happen if pre crime doesn't stop them. It seems odd, almost to the point of being a plot hole, that the pre cogs do not see the police preventing crimes. Also, the perpetrators seem unaware that their actions will be prevented, which is some decent food for thought.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty flat from everyone, and Spielberg does a standard job directing. I know people rave about him, but I honestly don't think he's that great. John William's score feels like it was carbon copied from some of his other work from the seventies. The action choreography is okay, but not at all spectacular. Fortunately the movie doesn't have to hinge on good action, so this is not really a problem.<br/><br/>If you want a good theme and an interesting story, this will deliver. It might not be outstanding in entertainment, and has some potentially annoying comic relief. I would set aside a couple of nights to watch it since it's fairly long. It might be good to watch it with someone else to bounce questions and thoughts off of since you might not fully grasp everything. If you're renting it, I would recommend getting it electronically, because I rented it on DVD and I think there were a couple things I missed in the scratched sections. Overall Rating: 7.8/10."

It's a credible future, especially with the surveillance aspect, not to mention the personalized advertising (played for chuckles here, but prescient nonetheless). But it's the police state ramifications of Pre-Crime that really make this scary. That said, it's all packaged in an entertaining Tom Cruise actioner with skilled direction.

Also, the tone is kind of all over the place. It is a serious film most of the time, but it has a LOT of comedic moments that honestly just feel out of place. Scenes such as the weird eye doctor mesh a little better, but the comedy in the jet pack cops chase just feels like some kind of Buster Keaton skit in the middle of a drama. It's really odd and just didn't work most of the time.<br/><br/>The visual style of the film is kind of all over the place too. Sometimes it feels way too blue, as if it was color corrected wrong, where other times it's just the right amount of futuristic blue tinting. There's also a lot of bright lighting that causes a bloom effect and it just sometimes felt over done and as if the image was blown out.<br/><br/>Honestly, I'm kinda conflicted with this film. I enjoyed it in one way, but I also noticed a lot of flaws. I guess that just makes it an okay movie. I wouldn't say you need to go out and find a copy of this to watch, but if it's on TV one night, check it out."

","The Minority Report is a film released in 2002, directed by Steven Spielberg, adapted from the screenplay written by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen and written by Phillip K. Dick. The film is set in a futuristic model where the government has the ability to preview crimes prior to their commitment. Based on this information the assailants are taken into custody and prejudged and sentenced.<br/><br/>Our main character John Anderson is a futuristic police officer whose complex issues regarding the loss of his own child sets the scenes and themes which is what leads him to being chased by his own team for crime he has not yet committed. The underlying theme relates to human will and whether free will has any determination in the committing of a crime. Another plot less visible is that of government control. Our main character is played by Tom Cruise who is being pursued by Danny Witwer played by Colin Farrell. Our supporting characters whose relevance is seen throughout the film include Agatha, played by Samantha Morton, Director Lamar Burgess, played by Max Von Sydow, and Fletcher, played by Neal McDonough.<br/><br/>The film is set around John Anderson attempting to find a minority report which would clear him from the future murder he is to commit. These murders are seen by clairvoyant and visionary Agatha whose special skills allows her to see into the future. Danny Witwer and Fletcher are seen throughout the film attempting to apprehend John Anderson. The film eventually concludes with its main plot revealed which encompasses the greed and control by Director Lamar Burgess.<br/><br/>The scenes and settings are similar to another film ""Total Recall"". Total recall is another film set in the future and surrounds the basic theme of government control. Our main characters in both films are guided by a principal which is set into motion by past experiences.<br/><br/>The director in this film utilizes a variety of film angles and lighting to assist the viewer in capturing all the elements of the film. Many of the scenes are shot during the day and encompass several scenes with well lit, sharp and crisp images depicting a wholesome future. In one scene we see our main character John Anderson walking through the well-lit, busy mall while shopping for Agatha. In another scene where John Anderson is meeting with the underbelly of society, the lighting is transformed into darker images giving the viewer a sense of wrongdoings been committed. Steven Spielberg had chosen a third person's point of view when filming. The viewer feels as if they were directly involved in the action, and become personally involved as our character move throughout the film.<br/><br/>Though the original theme of free will and government control is seen within the film, the subplots allow for the formulation of our characters. John Anderson struggles with the loss of his child, while Agatha struggles with the loss of her mother. Danny Witwer struggles with the ideology of religion and free will. Dir. Lamar Burgess struggles with letting go of the empire he built and realizing the faults that were associated with the building of his company. Even with these many subplots, the viewer is constantly reminded that the intent of our main character John Anderson is to find the minority report which will eventually cleared him of any wrongdoings."

This film reminds me of Blade Runner a bit but the man that wrote the short story that blade runner is based off of is written by the same author that wrote the short story that this film is based off of so it is no surprise that they feel like they are in the same universe. I recommend this to sci-fi fans or fans of people that enjoy watching films with great special effects and a good story line. when i put this film on my expectations were low because it didn't seem that interesting to me but i gave it a try and it surprised me because it turned out to be a great film that was very interesting and kept you on the edge of your seat.

The movie Minority Report is a very important film - one everyone should watch.<br/><br/>Could we actually stop a crime before it is committed? Is a wo/man guilty when they have not actually committed a crime? Is thinking about harming someone an act of crime when they are only thinking about it? What if a person was planning on committing a crime but changes their mind - are they still guilty? (More questions come to my mind but I will spare you from them.) <br/><br/>The idea of a crime-free society has been around for who knows how many centuries... and the movie Minority Report is about the very subject! <br/><br/>Chose your side: 1) A crime-free society where everyone's private thoughts (including your own) are known to the police - all your thoughts! <br/><br/>OR <br/><br/>2)A society where there is crime but you and everyone else will keep all of your thoughts private unless you choose to tell someone or act upon them.<br/><br/>This is a must not miss film!!

They use three Pre-cogs to predict future crimes and arrest the criminals before any crime actually happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) investigates the precrimes. However one day, the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton will murder and the system is now coming after him. He kidnaps the most powerful pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton) and discovers a flaw in the system.

Tom Cruise is the perfect protagonist for this movie. He has a touch of that boy scout with a dark edge. He matches the intensity of the material. There is a good mystery, compelling performances, and expertly made all growing out of a great story. It does wrap up a little too neatly. I'm not sure a Spielberg movie could have gone that dark."

","As Roger Ebert attested, this film is a production from someone at the peak of their powers. Spielberg really delivers; visually exquisite and with a tight script that has no discernible filler. Key scenes, such as where Anderton (Cruise) is cornered in an alley by the future crime cops is a lesson in how to make an action sequence. VFX are top notch, even though many of the techniques used are superseded now.<br/><br/>I saw this movie again just now after a gap of close to ten years, and it's lost nothing. Cruise shows why, even after a PR pummeling, he'll always be in work because he's a such a good actor.

","Minority Report is brilliant movie with a very well developed storyline and a terrific cast. It's a very exciting film that combines elements of sci-fi, action and thriller to deliver a high octane drama that will keep you at the edge of your seat throughout, it seems like a complicated story but once you keep your head with it you will find yourself glued to the screen and following it perfectly, and it's only Stephen Spielberg that can make all these elements work it one movie, though I was not aware he directed it until the closing credits, it made perfect sense to me. The only major flaw I think this movie had is that it stretches out for much too long, it's 2 and half hours and for the last twenty minutes I really felt like it was dragging itself out and it should be over, there were certainly some unnecessary pieces of information that simply overcomplicated the story. The performances are great, the characters are all very flawed and unique and seemed challenging for any actor, thankfully the casting was superb and they all did a great job, particularly Tom Cruise, who plays a man who is strange and suspicious from the beginning, and because of his acting, all we want to do is learn more about him, and that's certainly an important aspect to what made this movie so exciting. Action packed and very intense, I would recommend Minority Report to anyone looking for a good action, thriller or sci-fi film. <br/><br/>A police force that has three psychics that convicts people before they commit the murder discover that the main chief will murder within 36 hours. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Tom Cruise Worst Performance: Jessica Capshaw"

","Minority Report is evidence that Spielberg kouldn't quite kick the Kubrickian phase after making Artificial Intelligence. But this time, he's traded in the cute little robot for suspense, jet packs and braintwister plot twists. In the future, crime can be predicted, projected and detected thanks to a handful of strong silent types who have arguably the hardest job of anyone in the world. They have to sit in a bathtup all day. These pruney ""precogs"" are the reason why Tom Cruise can kick so much ass before that ass even has a chance to kill. It's true you might be scratching your head a little. You might be wondering if these precog pool people have a right to leave their bathtub. You might be wondering why are they in a bathtub. You might also wonder why there are still old fashioned garbage shoots in a future that's so high- tech, we can see the swirly thoughts of precogs on a video screen. But don't worry! The action and suspense in this film are as plentiful as product placements. Let's see... there's Pepsi, Aquafina, Reebok, Nokia, Gap. There may even be a subliminal ad for hemroid cream. Minority Report isn't just a moody, neo-noir thriller either. There's a bit of slapstick to be enjoyed too. Witness a blindfolded Tom eating a moldy sandwich after having an eyeball transplant. The yucks continue as a computer Reports Cruise's eyes as those of a Minority when they are identified as a Japanese man's. Cruise turns in an emotive performance here as we see him break down and crack up more than once or twice. When he's not jumping around or hitching a ride on a jetpacker, he's shedding a tear or two. And man, does Tom know how to finger a computer screen!"

","Americans can be put in prison for something they haven't done, on the accusation that they will do something – but enough about the administrations of Bush and Obama. Set in 2054, this has DC's police force(with a vote coming up to make it national) be a PreCrime division - people are arrested before committing murder. How? Via the visions of the future of the three PreCogs, Agatha(Morton, doing an incredible performance, a lot of it without words, using the expressiveness of her face, particularly her eyes), Arthur and Dashiell. They were the children of drug addicts, and thus gained this ability. Chief of the department, Anderton(Cruise, his intensity aiding tremendously, pulling us in), hunts down the perps-to-be, only one day, the prediction points to him - and says he will murder a man he's never even heard of. He goes on the run, determined to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>What of the ethical questions involved in this Orwellian thought-crime justice system? Read the short story of Philip K. Dick for that(in general, pursue his body of work), because any such exploration is barely present here. If one cannot adapt this story and keep that intact, one should have the self-awareness to admit that someone else should helm it. Focus is shifted to where you can't recognize it(the entire issue of powerful post-war military has downright disappeared... I wonder why the US, with its bloated ""defense"" budget, would remove such a compelling, historical issue - and yes, I opened this whole thing with a crack about the current situation(not even getting into drones), and yes, it has gotten a lot worse since this came out... however, this did come out after 9/11, with the Patriot Act signed in, and yet, this did not comment much on the idea of a totalitarian government).<br/><br/>The core of what's going on in this(I won't spoil it) didn't even need to be in this, and it's so unoriginal and out of place that it hurts - you'll note the writing contortions applied to even fit it in to the whole(yeah, don't expect overall in-universe consistency, even for all they don't explain - sometimes things that need to happen, just... do). Mystery? Convoluted. This is overlong, with a running time of 2 hours and 12 minutes sans credits(7 more with). While plenty happens, it feels like steps could have been skipped, and the excitement of the opening 20 minutes(a last-minute rescue attempt of potential victims) are inversely proportional to that of the last 20, the wrap-up.<br/><br/>Before I am accused of hating on Spielberg(such as for how he includes far too much of his typical sappy sentimentality), I will go into all the positives. This is a good film. Hollywood? Certainly. But as I say of James Cameron and Peter Jackson, it's the right kind - they'll entertain the masses, not sending them out to buy some brand and then forget how crappy the flick was(I'm glaring at you, Bay), rather, they stay in the audience's mind, they resonate emotionally and they make you think(well, in this case, not about the most important thing). Steven asked Janusz Kaminski, his regular cinematographer, to make ""the ugliest and dirtiest movie"" either of them had ever made, and, he did exactly that.<br/><br/>Some call this overly bleak, and I can understand why - who knew the dork who created E.T. even had a dark side? He also put serious effort into making the tech realistically futuristic, assembling a team of 16 future experts. It is quite credible, and the world feels organic. FX hold up these 11 years later, and CGI isn't overused - it always ""feels"" real, and is never there ""just because we can"". Eye candy? Sure, and like I said, it's not the stupid, pointless kind. The humor is great, keeping it from getting too dark, without being frequent enough to mess with the unflinching tension. Yes, at points this nears Hitchcockian levels.<br/><br/>There is some bloody, disturbing content(most of it seen in quick flashes), a bit of moderate to strong language and a little sexuality in this. I recommend this to fans of the people behind it, and of sci-fi blockbusters. 7/10"

","Minority Report is a movie loosely based on the story ""A Minority Report"" by Philip K. Dick. (I say loosely based because the original story was a short story.)Steven Spielberg directed it, and this movie is excellently executed. The story is about a chief law enforcer who's able to stop crimes before they happen, so there hasn't been a single murder in five years. He thinks everything about the system is perfect, until he's predicted to kill a person he never knew. Dodging law enforcement and danger, he takes a PreCog to help him get to the bottom of the crime, but he becomes convinced that the would be victim took his son from him years ago and he just might die for that. The plot of this movie was very interesting and it had a great plot twist. However, the story gets a little confusing at some parts and the very ending of it dosen't fit very well.<br/><br/>The movie has great special effects and action sequences, and none of scenes just go into the ""the special effects are so cool that we don't need to tell the story right."" The title really isn't a very good title for the movie, but that's all I'm going to say about it.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a great movie and I recommend that you watch it."

","This is one of Spielberg's better films. It's a highly competent, Blade-Runneresque vision of the future that was highly influential in its depictions of gesture computing, personal transport, advertising, and people tracking. There are scenes here directly influenced by David Cronenberg and Ridley Scott. The atmosphere is tense and pace is handled very well throughout. The story is interesting in its treatment of precognition as a scientific crime-fighting tool. Spielberg does well to set up a convincing future world with a bizarre mystery at the center of the story.<br/><br/>Where things unravel is towards the end of the film. What begins as a clever, twisty tale with a very interesting and unusual concept, ends with a bog-standard and very tried trope which does not do the rest of the film justice. The final twist and reveal are extremely weak, not even to the level of a weekly TV detective story. It's a disappointing flaw in an otherwise exciting and thought provoking SciFi thriller."

Set 50 years into the future, this classic is about a future where the criminals are arrested before they commit the crime.<br/><br/>The story itself was written by Philip K. Dick and it was supposed to be a sequel to the 1990 Dick adaptation of the movie Total Recall, which starred Arnold Schwarzenegger. When the sequel was not forth coming, novelist Jon Cohen was hired in 1997 to adapt the story for a potential film version. Cruise got a hold of the script and passed it on to Spielberg, with the hope that they will make a movie together from it. Spielberg liked the script but decided it need to be improved upon and so Cohen did another draft and Cruise and Spielberg decided to go in together to make the movie, both deciding not to take any money upfront but to share a percentage of the gross profit.<br/><br/>Boasting of high tech graphics and CGI, this futuristic film looked certain, like if God willing we are all here in the next 50 years that movie looked like what it will be.<br/><br/>The movie plot centers on the Lead Character John Anderton.

","This is another one of those movies based upon Phillip K Dick's rather unusual science-fiction short stories. In relation to this movie and also to Dick, I have had people simply promote both to no end, Dick as a visionary, and this movie as demonstrating the idea of human sin and redemption. Look, in our Western society, the narrative of sin and salvation has been passed down for the last two thousand years, the the idea is not so much that we sin, but that others sin against us and that we desire to go to no end to protect ourselves from that sin.<br/><br/>This is where this film comes in. America is a very violent nation, with a huge murder rate, even today. However, three unusual people were discovered that could predict a murder before it happened, and a special unit was established to use this information to prevent murders. As such there has been no murder in Washington DC for at least six years, but the question really does come down to what is the cost, and also whether such premonitions can be actually used to convict somebody of a crime.<br/><br/>The idea of an attempt is always a grey legal area where there is no clear cut answer. A man walking into a shop with a gun, pointing it at the clerk, and demanding money but not getting any for whatever reason, is an attempt that is pretty clear cut. However a group of stoned teenagers joking about robbing a bank, and even coming up with a plan, but not putting it into execution, is a completely different story. This is where the grey area of this film comes in, because too much faith is based upon the accuracy of these pre-cogs. The main character, days before actually committing the murder, is put on a wanted list, despite the fact that the whole murder is a set up. In fact, the culprit, our hero, does not even realise at the time that he is going to commit a murder, yet he is still guilty based upon such evidence.<br/><br/>This is something that even now our society is struggling with since terrorists have become more brazen in their attempts to wreck havoc. We want to be protected from sin, but we are not willing to give up our freedom for that protection. In many cities today we cannot walk around without being on film, and in a way that is said to protect us from possible terrorists, but in another way it is a means of keeping track of people who might be considered a danger to society, and even then, who is the one who determines what is dangerous and what is not dangerous.<br/><br/>In the film we have a future where everybody is identified through their eye scans, however these eye scans are also used as a means to advertise directly to us, yet because of this, nobody can hide. The computer knows exactly where you are at every time of the day. As is seen at the beginning of the film, the only way to free yourself from this is to actually remove your eyes, which is what the drug dealer does. However, at what cost does this come? Even then, despite the fact that we have our eyes, in many cases we are blind to the reality that is around us. We are blind to the fact that even our thoughts can convict us, and the mere setting up of a process that will ultimately lead to a murder, despite the murder never being committed, will result in you going to hell."

The discs, the computer screens, eye scanners, helicopters, cars, etc everything was very interesting and believable. The concept of the movie is very original and thought provoking. The way Anderton does his job is amazing. The first part of the movie is an introduction for us about how pre-crime works. <br/><br/>Slowly the story takes a roller coaster ride and keeps the audience glued to their seats. The story is very intriguing. Direction is fantastic. The part where Agatha leads Anderton to escape the cops is very very interesting. And there are many other interesting sequences throughout the movie including some twists. The concept of ""echo"" and ""minority report"" is very thought provoking. And the concept of seeing the future and having a choice to make a wise decision is very interestingly showcased.<br/><br/>Overall this is a no-nonsense movie. Very high on intellectual and technical level. But the problems I personally have with this movie are that it sometimes looks dull because of the background texture, Tom Cruise was like a puppet in the hands of Spielberg throughout the movie, it was difficult to connect with him because he dint show any expressions on his face, even in the action sequences. Agatha had performed well but was very irritating at times. Background score could have been better to add to the intensity of the drama. So the presentation of the movie was not good enough.

She looks a lot different in this film. Max Von Sydow too did his part great. Colin Farrell too stuck with his standard. Kathryn Morris looked a lot better when compared to her role Mindhunters. All the fans of Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg will love the film. It will definitely keep you at the edge of your seat. But one may have to see this movie more than once in order to fully understand the plot. It is better not to know the plot at all before you see the film. 8/10"

","So I watched ""Minority Report"" recently, and it left me a little cold. It had been described as the best SciFi movie since BladeRunner -- but it certainly isn't. In fact, it's actually no more than an above average movie. Bad points - it's unoriginal (you'll find yourself identifying bits from other movies), it's silly in parts (lots of plot holes), it's too long (2½ hours). Good points - it keeps your attention (most of the time), some futuristic ideas are interesting, and... well that's it actually. Tom Cruise is great when he plays ""himself"" (a woman-hating egomaniac in Magnolia; a rich brat is Vanilla Sky; Action Man in Mission Impossible) but he's hopeless ""out of character"".<br/><br/>This movie - like AI - is way better than the standard movie fare (especially a summer release) but - like AI - it will be quickly forgotten. Spielberg continues to turn interesting ideas into ordinary movies. Now if Ridley Scott had directed this movie... 7/10"

","No one knows what the future is going to be like. We know the past and the present. But we will never know what the future will bring.<br/><br/>To bring the future to us,we have to go deep in our heads and search. ""Minority Report"" is a film that does that.Steven Spielberg,who amazed me last year with ""A.I.:Artificial Intelligence"" does it again with this film about a pre-crime unit that prevents a crime from happening before it happens using three psychics.This has to be one of the most involving,exciting films I have seen in years.Tom Cruise is the head of the pre-crime unit who is framed for a crime he is supposedly about to commit. Everything about this film is full of energy and great CGI visual effects which I think is very appropriate. Steven Spielberg is one of the most imaginative filmmakers in film history. Watching ""Minority Report"",I felt like I was hypnotized and sent to another world. ""Minority Report"" is a film that provides plenty of fun.Steven Spielberg has made a lot of great films and this film will be added to my list as one of them."

","I remember when Minority Report first came out and it improved with a second viewing of the future.<br/><br/>The future is an interesting place; your advertising becomes personalized when you get eye scans upon walking into a store. Advertising is really expansive. And cars are automatic affairs running on rolling roads, reminiscent of Robert Heinlein's vision of ""The Roads Must Roll"" story.<br/><br/>Anyway, Phillip K. Dick (Blade Runner) came up with a short story adapted to film about a six year experiment called the Pre Crime Unit -- clairvoyants floating in a tank who together come up with an agreed-upon vision of the future -- a future where they can predict murders.<br/><br/>The pre crime cops jump on the murderers as they're about to commit a crime, after all the trio psychics are never wrong. Or are they? There are people who greatly depend on this system and when John Anderton and a government agent stumble onto some anomalies in the system, they become targeted by these special interests.<br/><br/>Spielberg spends a lot of time building up the Anderton character -- a man on drugs and greatly depressed on the disappearance of his son. And divorced from a woman who could not stand the reminder of her son whenever she looked in Anderton's eyes. Pretty sad.<br/><br/>Lots of chases and lots of fighting with the occasional peak at the future make for some interesting science fiction entertainment -- but at two hours, wow! Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell both play their characters well though I would have liked to have seen more character development in Colin's character.<br/><br/>Rental recommended!"

Otherwise I mostly agree with the critics, especially on the fact that the f/x have been masterfully used yet not overdone so as to keep everything realistic. Very realistic is also the overall depiction of the future in fifty years. I really think it is really going to be very similar to what is portrayed, and yes, it does remind me a little of Blade Runner, probably because the author of the original story is the same.

","This film is an intelligent sci-fi murder mystery with a twist... we know who the victim is, we know who the killer is but neither we nor the killer have the faintest idea why the killing will take place. Set in a future where the future can be seen by three ""pre-cogs"" murder is a thing of the past as the would be killers are arrested before they can commit their crimes. One day the head of this police department has terrifying shock when the pre-cogs tell him there is going to be a murder and he will be the killer.<br/><br/>From then on the hunter becomes the hunted as Chief John Anderton must run from his own officers to determine why he is destined to kill a stranger before they can incarcerate him. He is never fully sure who he can and can't trust and only has thirty six hours to find out if his destiny is truly written.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good with Tom Cruise being believable as the fugitive police officer, however the best performance comes from Samantha Morton in the role of Agatha; the pre-cog who Anderton turns to for help and who in turn seeks his help in solving an old case. Steven Spielberg did a fin job directing this. Using just the right amount of special effects he never lets the story be overshadowed by explosions and excessive CGI. When I first watched it I wasn't too sure about the washed out colours used in every scene apart from the few flashbacks it the more of the film I saw the more I thought they suited the tone of the film. If you are a fan of slightly dystopian science fiction I'd certainly recommend this."

There are sly bits of comedy that'll make you smile-and the fight scene in the car factory is phenomenal.

Spielberg is one of the few ""big"" directors from the ""Golden Age"" of the 70s who is still improving (the only one?). Maybe because, since he owns the studio, I assume he has absolute control. It seems pretty clear that commercial success is not good for many artists. Maybe that's why Welles' creativity didn't diminish. Maybe it's not success but getting old. But even Welles and Spielberg got old. Some of Spielberg's stamina may be attributable to technical advances, since special effects have played such a big part in filling his film art gallery."

Admit it, after Max Von Sydow first appears (or you read the cast list), didn't you immediately guess the end of the movie? <br/><br/>After seeing the movie several times, the impact of the visuals gradually diminish - they're no Blade Runner - while the storyline falls limper than ever.

There is nothing original in the plot, and worse, in the special effects which actually seemed to be done on the cheap. Didn't I see the same gravity cars in Star Wars? The concept is provocative, but nothing is done with it. It very quickly turns into Witness meets The Fugitive meets Blade Runner. You know who the bad guys are; we've seen it all done so many times before. One gets the feeling that Spielberg sees himself as the successor to Kubrick, as he attempts to play with the lighting in a vain attempt to dazzle you with image. He can't pull it off, and really shouldn't try to. A.I. redeemed itself with the final half hour of footage. This film had no such redemption in fact the resolution is the most overdone clichéd part of it all.

Stevey Spielberg has not wasted his years in cinema. He has evolved in ways I'm unsure of how I can express. As a film student I find Spielberg amazingly fresh, a rare trait in a director let alone one as legend as himself. Spielberg surely still has it. <br/><br/>The film itself has a feel like Blade Runner being futuristic with a man on the run. However Tom Cruise really brings a new element to it. His voice overs and serious tone work well for this movie. His acting is something other actors can rarely achieve, I truly doubt anyone can dislike him as an actor (cept for perhaps the extremely jealous). <br/><br/>The film brings up several issues about the way we've conducted ourselves in the past and where we're going as a race in this 'jetson'-like future we're creating for ourselves. Spielberg seems to be interested in the future taking Kubrick's AI and now this, however his new obsession is not one which takes away from his films. <br/><br/>I give it a 9 out of 10. Amazing film. Worth watching several times!"

What a disappointment.  First, we already had to make the leap to believe that the pre-cogs saw the ""premeditated"" murder by Cruise while premeditated would imply Cruise should have been thinking about killing this guy already.  Cruise would never have gotten to that guy without first seeing the vision and then taking Agatha out.  But he would never have taken Agatha out without having seen the vision first which really makes no sense if you thought about it.  Plus, if the pre-cogs only see the future as it will happen instead of let's say, people's thoughts and intentions, there's no reason why they can't see crime of passions as early as they could see premeditated murders.<br/><br/>But I digress.

","Based on a 1956 short story by sci-fi guru Phillip K. Dick, Minority Report is the first collaboration between two of Hollywood's most powerful figures, Tom Cruise and director Steven Spielberg. Best described as cerebral science fiction, the movie is a feast for the mind as well as the eyes. The script tackles complicated moral issues while astounding us with spectacular action sequences. Spielberg has created a dazzling future world of hard glass and talking billboards (conveniently allowing for shameless product placement in the movie), but doesn't get lost in the special effects and forget to tell the story. Tom Cruise plays police chief John Anderton, head of the Pre-Crime Unit. His specialty is using a series of high tech computers and three human precogs' to determine when crimes will happen, and stop them before they happen. Then one day he is accused of a committing a murder in the future, goes on the lam, and is hunted by the same people he once worked with. It's not really a `who-dunnit,' as much as it is a `will-he-do-it.' Cruise does a nice job of carrying the action, but it is Max Von Sydow as his friend and mentor Director Burgess who adds depth. Once again, after being nominated for an Oscar as the mute Hattie in Sweet and Lowdown, English actress Samantha Morton proves that she can outperform most of the actresses in Hollywood, and barely say a word on screen. Minority Report is smart, action packed and thrilling fun. Not only one of the best films of that summer, but one of the best of 2002."

He knows it will take place in 36 hours. Does he (a) lock himself in a room for the next 37 hours, hence ensuring the murder does not take place and solving the entire problem? Or (b) Run off on a ludicrous two-hour chase sequence, whose sole purpose is to place himself in the murder location with a loaded gun?<br/><br/>Take your time.<br/><br/>And the feelgood ending? One man pays the price for a crime, though that crime saved the lives of thousands of innocents, and though his paying the price can't bring back the victim.

","***MILD SPOILERS*** There are some good things to this movie. It is probably the most realistic SF movie ever made, with a lot of effort put in the design and functionality of future everyday items. Also the acting is convincing, the cinematography is kept in a surrealistic colourless grey, most likely to resemble the film noir it is supposed to be.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, all this could have been made for just any SF movie and does not have to do anything with the short story by Philip K. Dick. As so often, the screen adaptation throws away a nice, conclusive plot, and comes up with a stupid and ridiculous replacement.<br/><br/>The film has almost nothing to do with the original story, except for two main characters (Anderton and Witwer) and the pre-crime department with the three precogs. The only character remotely true to the story is Witwer, whilst the Anderton of the story has nothing to do with the guy played by Tom Cruise. He is more like the charcter of Burgess, played by Max von Sydow, an aged founder of precrime, close to retirement, whose only intention is to keep the system going.<br/><br/>*spoiler ahead* I could accept all this, ignore the Philip K Dick title, and watch the movie as a sort of film noir in the future. But there is such a major flaw in the plot, which makes it impossible for me to enjoy it. It is the framing of Anderton by his mentor and friend Burgess. This set-up is the main plot of the movie and neither the motive (stopping Anderton from digging up some dirt in Burgess past) nor the whole set-up has anything to do with Philip K Dick. Frankly, Dick would never have come up with such a inconclusive and implausible idea.<br/><br/>How can you frame somebody in the future? Unless of course you can travel through time or you are god. The whole set-up is a closed loop, which can never be started in the presence. But let us not talk about this any more. Let us instead have a lock at what Dick actually wanted to tell in his story:<br/><br/>There is one crucial thing, which lacks in the movie despite the catchy title. In the book there is actually a minority report (even three to be precise). The point of Dicks story is that your knowledge of the future might allow you to change it (the same way as the police change the future by arresting the criminal before he commits the crime). The future is not set but under constant flow and subject to alterations and changes.<br/><br/>Dick's Anderton is also accused by the precogs of killing a man within the next week. He has never heard of the man before. The point here is, that with this knowledge at his hand, Anderton tries to avoid killing him. This changes the future, and is correctly predicted by the second precog as a minority report, who included into his prediction the prior knowledge of Anderton of the accusation. But during the whole affair, Anderton learns that the man he is supposed to kill and who he does not want to kill is in fact trying to bring down the whole precrime system by publishing the minority report. The only way to save his life's work is to actually kill him anyway, so that the majority report is proven correct. So he has to sacrifice himself for the system he created. He kills the man and accepts his punishment, but precrime survives.<br/><br/>The clue at the end: His final action was predicted by the third precog, who had also an alternate vision of the future, but this vision included prior knowledge of the minority report by Anderton. So all three precoqs saw a different future of Anderton, based on increasing amount of information available to Anderton to act. Since two of the precogs predicted murder (one and three, but under totally different circumstances), the murder (not the way how it is supposed to happen!) was the majority report released to Anderton at the beginning.<br/><br/>Dick points out that this situation is pretty unique and could only happen to the head of precrime (the first reader of the future), not to the `common criminal'.  In the book this disagreement of the precogs is in their three minority reports is downplayed and the justification of the precrime as a correct prediction is maintained.<br/><br/>So what has this to do with the Spielberg movie? Nothing of course, except the title."

","In 2054 Washington, the cop in charge of a pilot programme using human precognitives to detect crime before it is committed is himself accused of an upcoming murder and goes on the run to prove his innocence.<br/><br/>Minority Report is a frustrating piece of future-noir; a classic example of a good film which could have been great but for the infuriating compromises of mainstream Hollywood.<br/><br/>So much about this film is excellent; the thoughtfully imaged future, taking modern concepts of computer technology, architecture, consumerism and urban living to believable representations of where they are likely to be in 50 years time. Social concepts of disfunctionality, drug abuse, abandonment and invasion of privacy are equally well observed, and done so with impressively little moral comment.<br/><br/>The photography is suitably grainy, harsh and washed out, the casting excellent and the premise, very much influenced by American detective fiction, agreeably stuffed with plot twists and memorable characters.<br/><br/>There are basically only two things wrong with Minority Report, but they are both serious misconceptions which damage the films integrity and originality. The first involves the action sequences, which jar from the otherwise sombre and realistic tone and put the characters straight into over-the-top superhero territory. Cruise leaps across skyscraper-climbing cars like Spiderman. With the aid of a jet-pack he goes flying across buildings, through ceilings and plummeting down alleyways like Superman. He emerges from frantic fist-fights on automobile production lines without a hair out of place like James Bond.<br/><br/>It doesn't need to be like this. Minority Report is an action thriller crying out for realism and suspense delivered by believable human characters with proper physical limitations, not the gratuitous pyrotechnics of comic books. Spielberg shows a loss of nerve here, like he wants to remind us that he can still compete with the Wachowski brothers in the OTT action-showman stakes and never mind how out of place it all looks with the rest of his film.<br/><br/>The second mistake is even more grave. Without giving too much away, there is a point about three-quarters of the way through the film when the plot comes to a shocking, downbeat, but entirely appropriate end. It completely makes sense in context of the plot and in terms of the film's, bleak dystopian viewpoint. Popcorn-munchers and action junkies might moan, while still finding it acceptable; finding it true. Instead the Hollywood bean-counters, the marketeers and worst of all Spielberg and Cruise themselves can't bring themselves to go along with it. Faced with the choice between an artistically correct conclusion or a cynical, audience-friendly, uplifting and utterly jarring curtain they pump for the latter. By this stage of their careers both of these Hollywood powerhouses should have the guts to go for what's right rather than what's blandly thought to be commercially acceptable; but neither, it would appear, have quite enough conviction. The dollar wins out in the short term while the film's reputation, which could have been gigantic, loses out almost immediately.<br/><br/>The difference between a great Hollywood movie and a merely good one is often simply a matter of courage and integrity in the script, in the cutting room or in the board room. Spielberg and Cruise had another Blade Runner right in the palm of their hands here, and let it slip."

The picture (actually two pictures) this film paints of the future are well-done.

","I often wondered what Alfred Hitchcock could have produced, had he the 21st century digital technology of today. <br/><br/>Clearly, Steven Spielberg has filled and exceeded that gap, and is creating a new standard, by combining special effect, emotional tension, a surreal soundtrack, and an unbelievable sequence of digitally mastered scenes that will cause you to surrender all concept of reality, let the action take you on a whirl wind tour of your imagination and rivet your attention with a jigsaw puzzle story that will rock your psyche. <br/><br/>The message here is obvious.

","Since I love sci-fi, I knew from the start that I would like this one. And yes, it was sci-fi. The vision of the future is very interesting and the whole Pre-crime thing sounds ok, I guess... If humans are ever able to predict the future.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie I noticed alot of references to other sci-fi flicks. Johnny Mnemonic, for example. The way the Pre-Crimes were using their hands to move and focus on information on their screens made me think of Keanu Reeves surfing the internet in the year 2021, waving his hand around. Then there was Timecop. Only in that movie, the police went back in time. And not really too stop murders from happening. Then I was reminded of Strange Days when Tom Cruise visited his hacker-friend in that Virtual Reality place. Very similiar to the devices used in Strange Days. I liked all of these movies (even if I can admit that Johnny Mnemonic is bad, and so is Timecop.), and I did like this movie.<br/><br/>Its about a futuristic police agency called Pre-Crime, where they use strange human beings to predict the future. The Pre-Crimes can see when a murder is about to take place, then they go there and stop the murder from happening! That's something I'd like to see in the future. Anyway, the leader of this agency (John Anderton) is seen killing a person on their ""future-vision"" screen, and finds himself chased by his own partners and friends. He knows he is innocent... will be innocent... ach! You get the idea, and tries to prove it. To do so he must get a number of diffrent pieces of the puzzle together, and the one responsible for the mess ends up being who John least thought it would be.<br/><br/>As I said, very interesting movie. But its a bit slow. Not something I would really want to watch again, in awhile. Nice future, nice story, nice characters, nice actors, nice directing. But its slow. And that's really the worst thing a movie can be. But in the end, its a good movie. Something you should keep your eyes open for. And if you like it, buy it.

"suffer-smart-magnet","Null","0","0","18 March 2003"," One Thousand Cuts, But Not Dead Yet... (Spoilers)
","If I have many complaints about Minority Report, it is because in many ways the movie came close to being very good. Unfortunately, it ended up falling short too many times for it to earn a place among first-rate movies.<br/><br/>Story: To the movie's benefit, there are many strong story points. Three precognitives (precogs) predict murders so that murder can be prevented. Anderton (Tom Cruise) leads a team faced with the challenge of preventing the murder once the prediction has been made. The idea that the precognitives sometimes disagree on their predictions leads to many questions about Anderton's choice and free will when he is faced with a prediction of him committing murder. Is Anderton's future locked, unable to be changed, or is there room for choice? And what about the possibility for error on the part of the precognitives?<br/><br/>Minority Report also contains many errors. Notice how Anderton's retina ID somehow remains on the Dept. of Precrime's authorized list long after he becomes a fugitive. This allows people to get in several times undetected. In one instance, Evanna (Jessica Capshaw) is allowed to walk into the Department Of Containment with a gun by using Anderton's retina ID, and this is after Anderton's previous unauthorized visit to Precrime. Even if the police had at first forgotten to close this loophole, Anderton's all-too-public appearance inside Precrime's 'temple' would certainly have changed that before Evanna visit. Another problem is when Agatha guides Anderton around a mall using her precognitive skills. With pinpoint precision, she predicts how they can hide behind balloons and give a bum money so as to escape their pursuers. While murder is easy for the precogs to predict, it is explained that the precogs can't predict things like rape because of the lesser nature of the act. We are stuck with the paradox of Agatha not being able to see rape, but being able to predict the positions of balloons and bums on a whim.<br/><br/>In another part, Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) kills Anne Lively (Jessica Harper). Knowing the possibility the precogs will see him, Burgess waits until after he meets with Lively to put on his disguise. This makes for a dramatic visual of Burgess's preparing to murder Lively, but it doesn't make any sense. Burgess's whole intent here is to not be recognized. A Precrime technician would have been looking at the live feed and would have recognized Burgess, pinning him with murder. It makes more sense that Burgess would have put on his disguise before he showed up so as to eliminate any possibility for a slip-up.<br/><br/>The story also wanders. Anderton's eye replacement takes too much screen time with no real benefit. We learn that Anderton once arrested his black market eye surgeon, but the surgeon doesn't hold a grudge against Anderton. After the surgery the surgeon disappears from the story, rendering the involved scenes that build up his character into useless fodder. Such asides don't justify the lengthy 2 hr. 25 min. running time.<br/><br/>
Action: The way the action was shot revealed important details only after the action happened, if at all. An example of this happens at the end, when Burgess holds Anderton at gunpoint on a balcony. A close-up showing just their heads and some anxious dialog leads up to a dramatic climax. A gunshot rings out and Burgess falls. Only afterwards are we allowed to see that Burgess had somehow inconspicuously reversed the angle of his gun in order to commit suicide. This ends up being a cheap substitute for real creativity. It would have been simpler and more effective to see Burgess decide to give up and turn the gun on himself.<br/><br/>Other things happened too conveniently. Anderton ends up in a car factory and zooms off of the end of the assembly line in a new model (apparently, they come complete with a full tank of gas). Or how about his escape from Precrime that involves the all-too-convenient use of a lever that opens the drain for the tank he is standing in: 'WHOOOSH!'. Conveniently, the drain is big enough for a person to fit through, and Anderton makes his escape. Unfortunately, it works so well, I expected to see a cameo by the Tidy Bowl Man, only to get flushed away with Anderton. Maybe in the future they could just place a big red button labeled 'Escape' on a nearby wall for Anderton to press at the appointed time.<br/><br/>
Character Shifts: Characters, having established certain values within themselves, later shifted in order to fit within plot requirements. In establishing his character, Burgess comes off as old, tired, and world-weary. He seems on the brink of retirement, and while he feels outdated and unneeded, he's not fighting it. ""What can an old man do..."" says Burgess about his inevitable displacement from power. Later, Burgess becomes divisive and control-driven. Burgess is revealed as the mastermind behind setting up Anderton for murder, a plot designed to keep him in a position of power at Anderton's expense. Another character, Witwer, portrays himself as competing for Anderton's position. After Anderton becomes a fugitive, Witwer goes so far as to take over Anderton's office to the objection of Anderton's former coworkers. Later, Witwer spearheads the fight to clear Anderton's name, proclaiming Anderton's innocence. Witwer takes it upon himself to reveal to Anderton's boss (Burgess) how Anderton might be innocent. Unfortunately, we are left to fill in the gap as to why Witwer suddenly changes his view.<br/><br/>
Acting: What is it about Tom Cruise that doesn't seem to fit into most any movie he's been in? To the detriment of his characters, a distasteful attitude seems to surround his acting. That said, Anderton is one of Cruise's best performances to date. His performance feels thin at times. During more dramatic moments, Cruise can't find the line between being completely detached and over-dramatic, often shifting around. This doesn't make the movie unwatchable by any means, though it is noticeable. Another distraction is how Cruise's character remains in the spotlight just a little too long for comfort. He's the only one who can use a data glove (Jad, Anderton's coworker, uses the same computer display, but without the benefit of fancy gloves). Somehow, in a divisive move, Cruise's only male competition (Witwer, who is a go-getter and around the same age/looks as Anderton) gets killed about 2/3 through.<br/><br/>
Overdramatic Visuals: Mostly, the effects/visuals were good to excellent. I liked the personalized, full-motion advertisements that address people by their first name after recognizing their retina ID. However, there are many effects/visuals that under mild scrutiny don't pass a 'reality check'. When Anderton visits the Department Of Containment to view a prisoner, all of the prisoners are put on display, as opposed to just the one Anderton needs to see. Apparently, computers are smart enough to deal with 3D imaging and retinal ID's, but can't differentiate between prisoners. This is all for the benefit of showing off a great visual, without having a reason to show it to us. In another scene on the highway, Anderton jumps to safety off of a car moving straight down. Last time I checked, jumping off of a vehicle traveling at greater than 30 MPH heading directly downwards and landing on concrete results in death. Anderton shrugs this off by learning a new yoga position.<br/><br/>Conclusion: After viewing a movie with so many flaws, I was surprised to see many reviews giving this movie top marks. This is not a 4 out of 4 stars must-see movie by any stretch. Despite Minority Report's many weaknesses, from Cruise's acting to the overdramatic visual effects, I generally liked this film and would watch it again. I would, however, search for a slightly better option first."

","In MINORITY REPORT, the ""PreCrime"" division of crime prevention has come to pass. Through a group of ""floating"" clairvoyants, a murder can be seen before it happens. John Anderton (Tom Cruise), the top dog over at PreCrime, has found himself in the center of one of these ""visions"". He now has thirty-six hours not to commit the crime he is being hunted for; this he does, and at the same time, trying to figure out who framed him and solve another murder. All the while unsure whether this predetermined fate can be altered or not. Sound confusing? It's not really and the film-makers handle the material well.<br/><br/>However, the one thing this movie is is uneven. Spielberg here tries to capture the same tone he did in the INDIANA JONES films, but does not quite manage it. What we end up with is over-the-top humorous moments: the chase in the factory (which is essentially a high-tech update of Charlie Chaplin going through the gears of that large machine); the whole sequence with the ""eye doctor"" (Peter Stormare) is all one-liners and physical comedy. Juxtaposed against these scenes are ones of uninspired drama: the rest of the movie. Spielberg fails to find that fine-line that he has walked in so many past projects (though I'm not sure what he was trying to do in his other recent sci-fi film, A.I.). This is not helped along by John William's score (film music fans will accuse me of blasphemy here), which is oppressive and terse.<br/><br/>All that said, MINORITY REPORT is still a very entertaining, well made film.<br/><br/>The story of MINORITY REPORT is based on a short work by Philp K. Dick. Dick has sown fertile ground in Hollywood (TOTAL RECALL, BLADE RUNNER), and some not so fertile (SCREAMERS, IMPOSTER). He is a writer of great wit, humor and vision. Dick has published dozens of books and volumes of short stories, which will make him attractive to sci-fi film-makers for years to come. I think Spielberg has come closer to capturing the tongue-in-cheek feel of Dick's work than any other film adaptation. It still remains to be seen if someone can make an epic and silly science fiction masterpiece in his name. 7/10"
"Pavel-8","9","0","0","11 March 2003"," What sci-fi should be.
","**Warning! Spoilers Ahead!**<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg does science-fiction, and the result is exactly what I hoped it would be. Not only does he provide a visual buffet of special-effects, but also gives us a solid story that is part action film, part introspective drama. Tom Cruise, perfectly cast as the falsely (?) accused John Anderton, gives the film a somewhat nebulous moral and emotional center. But the best part of the film is the world in which it is set.<br/><br/>Spielberg uses special effects as they should be used, so that you never think that they are effects.  My favorite, the search-and-destroy spiders, which seem more like models or remote controlled mechanisms, highlight a film peppered with futuristic technology, all of which seems reasonably possible in the not too distant future.<br/><br/>The plot twist preceding the third act is solid. While I knew something off-the-wall had to be coming, I hadn't thought of that.

","Minority Report didn't fully satisfy me. It left me with a bit of a bitter tongue when it ended, although some aspects were not of my taste during projection as well. I'd say this movie is very ambitious but fails to take off as it should. The frame is more important than the painting in this case. Cruise once more (Impossible Mission I, II, Vanilla Sky...) acts in one hi-tech environment having the most advanced (sometime not so practical-to-use and a bit hard to believe) structures and computers available for doing his job. Some good visual inventions don't just make up for the sometime leaking characterizations. The dialogs themselves seem not to be wonderful either (the greenhouse, the mall) but fair enough generally. The action sequences are as spectacular as you would expect with special care for the fight in the cars factory (I think courtesy of Kawasaky) and the plot captures you from the beginning showing a great potential. Unfortunately not completely fulfilled. It's still a good movie which might have been even better with some adjustments. Despite some flaws, it's recommended. A note: some people can speak Swedish, dear Mr. Spielberg! Would you mind telling me the reason of one traditional Swedish song for children (små grodorna) in the middle of the movie ? :) It was fun though..."
"csm23","Null","0","0","7 March 2003"," Free Will and Preforeordestination, as Huck Finn used to say: a real corker
","Steven Spielberg excels at directing thrill rides like Jaws and Close Encounters.  Lately, though, it seems he's been trying to fluff up his directorial resume with more substantive productions.  More often than not, he seems to be in over his head.  Minority Report, while visually entertaining  chock full of technical eye candy  is a curious mixture of the inimitable Spielberg style with a substantive issue.  This time, he set his target on the problem of human `free will.'  <br/><br/>The issue of `free will' is one hell of a good theme.  There's a prismatic array of perspectives on the idea, a topic of serious argument for centuries.  Erasmus and Luther, for example, had a rollicking good fight over it.  But when they angrily smashed their hammers on the anvil of the subject, the sparks that flew up produced both the `Diatribes' and `Bondage of the Will,' works of lasting importance.  And people like Emerson, rebelling against the Calvinist belief in free will as the puppet strings of God, claimed god-like autonomy when he boldly declared to the world, `I make my own circumstances.'  And then behaviorists like Skinner and Watson sneered at `free will' as a childish fantasy similar to the ignorant Russian peasant's belief that the steam engine had an animating `spirit.'  And this isn't even the tip of the iceberg.  <br/><br/>But Spielberg  well, he likes to simplify things to the point of being just plain goofy.  The `pre-cogs' in this story are brain-damaged people who can see future murders.  Their precognition is a `gift,' a natural compensation for their other mental deficiencies.  OK, I can buy that.  But here's the rub:  they are never wrong, but occasionally they `disagree.'  Errrr, uuuuh, like, What??  Either they're never wrong, or they're occasionally wrong, but not both.  And this absurdity is the mental linchpin of the entire movie.  I mean, How could anyone miss it?  It's not even presented as a paradox, like the `liar's paradox' that logicians think is so clever.  Discrepancies like this run through the entire length of the movie, and eventually make one's head hurt.  But, if you like action, it ain't bad."

But somehow, Minority Report managed to become on of my favourite films, and the first DVD I owned as of Christmas '02 (I'm not quite rich).<br/><br/>The premise of Minority Report is creative, although simple and mainstream-friendly: police predict murders (JUST murders, oddly enough) and stop them before they happen, in a nutshell. But the story somehow becomes better than your average movie, twisting and turning and possibly losing you if you don't pay attention. Spielberg couldn't of directed this film any better. It has a gritty, dull-blue look, which, in addition to great direction, gave the movie a film-noir feel to it.<br/><br/>POSSIBLE SPOILER: One of very few flaws I noticed was how Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) seems to make an abrupt attitude change when he figures out John was framed. His character goes from bad guy to concerned good guy a little quickly. I think this change should have either been more gradual- seeing hints of his humanity earlier on; or he should have been made out to be a little nicer throughout the whole film- give him the good ol' ""Just following orders"" motive.<br/><br/>This is one of those movies you'll watch again to see if you can catch the little hints it drops (ala The Sixth Sense).

","This Tom Cruise sci-fi/ action/ mystery is chock full of what you would expect from a Spielberg film: perfect lighting; tight rhythm; and deep storytelling. We are treated to a realistic (at last) glimpse of the future. Tom Cruise portrays Captain John Anderton of the Washington D.C. Pre-Crime Division of the Police Department.<br/><br/>His unit is nearing the end of a six-year experiment that is designed to prevent murders before they happen. Anderton's unit is succeeding at nearly 100% because of the abilities of three humans who possess the unique ability to see future murders. Their ability is the reult of being born to addicts of a new drug called ""neuroin"" which was actually designed for other purposes, but ends up as a street drug similar to heroin.<br/><br/>This is a must see so I won't divulge ANY plot details, suffice to say that Anderton becomes a projected murderer and has less than 36 hours to find out what is happening.<br/><br/>The film portrays a future world of electric cars and a fully intergrated world wide web that is comercially used to its maximum potential. However the world is not perfect: precrime was devised to reverse a skyrocketing murder trend in the United States. Anderton himself is addicted to neuroin, and we see other examples of urban squallor and decay that demonstrate we will not have all the answers in 50 years. Also notable in the film is the performance of Colin Farrell as Anderton's adversary, who later begins to suspect that Anderton's crime was arranged by someone else. Max von Sydow also is excellent as Anderton's benevolent (and later malevolent) boss.<br/><br/>

Minority Report basically tears the basic idea and the main character's name out of the short story by Philip K. Dick, and doesn't use much else. At least when they did this to ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"" ""We Can Remember It For You Wholesale"" and ""Second Variety"" they had the decency to change the titles.<br/><br/>That being said, the story that has been crafted is better than your average summer movie, although the effects are definitely top-tier. This is by no means a small movie, nor it is a small story.<br/><br/>I like Minority Report. It has good direction, good acting, good production design. However, I would be remiss if I said it was great. I couldn't ever give this more than a 7. It suffers from plot holes, lack of memorable dialogue, and personally, I think it focuses too much on Anderton's sentimentality rather than the ethics of pre-crime.<br/><br/>In the short story, there are hard questions, and the answers aren't exactly what we'd like them to be. In the short story, we see a man who is so committed to an idea and a cause, that he is willing to do something that most people wouldn't. In the movie, however, the same ideas are taken and put on different terms. Perhaps some people find the change more compelling. I don't. I think its the same kind of thing Hollywood and Spielberg do a lot. Add sentimentality where its not needed. Even worse, add it when it detracts from the main issue.<br/><br/>

","(Spoilers might follow) I think Steven Spielberg is one of the most overrated directors in film history, and Tom Cruise is a star (I hesitate to call him an actor) I can't stand, but as a Philip K. Dick fan of many years, I approached this movie with an open mind, hoping it was going to be THE great PKD adaptation. It isn't.  While there are some dazzling special effects on screen (something to be expected for a $100 million + budget!) it very quickly becomes your standard man-on-the-run action movie, just like 'Total Recall' and 'Impostor'. The script is pretty pedestrian, and is only loosely based on the original Dick short story 'The Minority Report'. A few basics are the same - a cop in charge of the Precrime division which works on information supplied by ""precogs"" with apparent powers to foresee the future finds out he is going to kill a total stranger - but that's about it. In the story the Cruise character is an old man, there is no von Sydow character, the Precrime section can predict all kinds of crime, not just murder, the man Anderton is supposed to kill is completely different and for different reasons, the precogs themselves are idiots and Anderton doesn't kidnap one of them, and the whole idea of ""minority reports"" is completely different. While the original story was far from Philip K. Dick's best work it was much more interesting and thought provoking (and much less predictable) than this movie. One has to wonder why Hollywood continually buys stories and then rewrites them into something almost unrecognisable, and invariably inferior. I also must wonder why they choose Philip K. Dick, one of the most cerebral and eccentric of science fiction writers, to adapt into ACTION MOVIES, instead of say, Robert Heinlein or Larry Niven or somebody more suitable.  Anyway, who knows. 'Minority Report' is yet another overblown disappointing science fiction movie where more thought has been put into the special effects than the script. Don't expect much and you might find it passable. Personally I would have thought it would have been better to have made it for a tenth or the budget and with someone like Lance Henriksen or even Jean Claude Van Damme as the stars and sent it straight to video."

","Not since the disaster of Kubrick's 2001: A Space Odyssey, has there been a more-overrated disaster of a science-fiction adaptation. 'Minority Report' the Speilberg film, has little in common with it's original incarnation of a Phillip K. Dick Short-Story. Why is it that Hollywood, feels the need to rape this particular author's master-works, with such hidious films as 'Total Recall' and 'Screamers' and now 'Minority Report' which bear little, or no resemblace to their original forms. Blade Runner withstanding, no one has done a decent adaptation of a Phillip K. Dick book/story.<br/><br/>Sure, Blade Runner threw the book out the window, but what it did accomplish was a believable vision of the future, without going all heart-gushingly-gooshy as Spielberg has a tendancy to do. Let me put it simple, Spielberg's future vision, is too damn squeaky clean, to be convincing. Sure, with the advent of ""Pre-crime"", murder is done for, at least in the D.C. area, but everyone seems so damned ""perfect""...""made-up""...even the so-called ""scumbags"" of the ""Sprawl""(a term not so creatively STOLEN from visionary William Gibson).<br/><br/>It was the same in Speilberg's garbage 'A.I.' which could have been brilliantly done, had it not been for Speilberg's disguisting attempt to BLATENTLY GRAB TEARS from the damned audience of sheep. 'Minority Report' is not only guilty of this also, considering the short-story's Anderton(as far as we know) is not even married(nor ever has been). But he completely disgraces Dick's original plotline about conspiracies, giving this a ""happy"" ending, adding the ""tearworthy"" spouse/child thing, and a load of completely UNNECESSARY, and unlikely humorous moments, like the ""Eyeball"" sequence, which have no bearing whatsoever on the main plot of the film, and make it seem like the work of someone attempting to please(everyone,which he is).<br/><br/>The original 'Minority Report' was not family friendly, nor should this version be. It was grim, depressing, and in touch with true human nature. This was not. Spielberg is a no-talent hack. His films are cliche', unoriginal, and a discredit to their original works. His screenwriter even saw fit to rip other famous Cyberpunkish writers, because he was so uncreative.<br/><br/>Take the ""Sprawl"" sequence for example. This was a blatent rip of a William Gibson term, including the idea of a ""Black-Market Surgeon"" who specialized in Body Modification(reference: Chiba). This, along with everyone who calls this pathetic excuse for a film ""art"" just turn my stomach. Speilberg is NOT a visionary. He's just looking not to offend anyone."

","***SPOILERS WITHIN REVIEW***<br/><br/>A small achievement in the sci-fi genre, Steven Spielberg's adaptation of Phillip K. Dick's short story, Minority Report is a good chase 'em thriller. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, head of the pre-crime unit, a special branch of the police force that uses technology to 'tag' and arrest 'criminals' before they actually commit a murder. These prophecies are the work of three pre-cogs (short for pre-cognitives), a young woman and two twin brothers who were the pregnant results of drug addicts. All goes wrong for Anderton's world when the female pre-cog, Agatha, points him out as a future murderer. Anderton hits the road running from Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) and his old police crew, unearthing long lost secrets and conspiracies.<br/><br/>
The pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), Dashiell and Arthur (named for Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Arthur Conan Doyle) are mysterious, almost angelic creatures - until Agatha is liberated by Anderton for her help, we don't really see them as humans - and the scenes with Agatha giving Anderton prophetic help have an other-worldly quality. Like previous Phillip K. Dick adaptations Blade Runner and Total Recall, Minority Report's special effects team (ILM) have created some very impressive effects, among the metal three legged Spyders; robotic spies employed by the pre-crime that scan people's eyes for identification, and futuristic cars and motorways, as well as other ultramodern creations. The pre-crime advertisements in the film (à la Starship Troopers) are effective in their designs and give us added insight into the goings-on of the pre-crime unit.<br/><br/>
The performances are all solid, with Tom Cruise giving a good turn as the on-the-run police chief and Colin Farrell great as a smarmy competitor for Anderton's position who realises too late the truth of the investigation. Max von Sydow, playing the elderly head of the pre-crime facility, Lamar Burgess, is a kind of surrogate father to Anderton. Continuing the oft-used theme of paternal abandonment in his films, Minority Report's abandoned son is Cruise, with the scheming von Sydow betraying his 'son' in order to save his own hide. Of course, redemption is reached at the end, giving the viewer a happy ending. Janusz Kaminski's photography is impressively cold, effectively matching the overall mood of the film (the script, music, etc.) and enhancing the film noir sensibilities Spielberg and co. were aiming for. Interestingly, Spielberg notes that Minority Report is not a `warm adventure like A.I'. He's right in that regard, as this film doesn't share as much of the sentimentality that almost sank that picture. I liked the film a lot (all the more so because 'sci-fi' isn't ordinarily my favoured genre), but there were flaws that held back my enjoyment of the finished product. That said, I can't pinpoint any particularly grating imperfections, although I do know that it won't hold up to repeated viewings in my DVD player. An effective sci-fi thriller from a very talented director...the film taps into our need to know what the future holds for us.<br/><br/>8/10"

There are many wild previews of life in the mid-21st century , from how computers will look to how we'll drive to how big business will invade our privacy. The cinematography is also noteworthy, an effective washed-out look with a lot of blues and greens. The story is fascinating, centering around an interesting philosophical point - what if technology can predict crimes that haven't happened yet. Is it just for the soon-to-be criminals to be arrested and punished? On the less cerebral side, there are some jaw-dropping action scenes that are highly inventive and dizzyingly paced. Tom Cruise plays his usual role - short man making $20 million per movie - but turns in a solid performance.

","*** Contains Spoilers ***<br/><br/>*sigh*  Philip K Dick was one of the finest, maybe even the finest SF writer of the second half of the 20th century. The science fiction movie of the 90's has just caught up with what Dick was doing in the 50's and 60's. Films like The Matrix, The Truman Show, Dark City, Pleasantville, and The Thirteenth Floor are so obviously and totally inspired by PKD and his endless interrogation of the nature of reality that I really think if he were alive, Dick could probably just file suit against Hollywood in general. NONE of these movies credit Dick in any way, and they're ALL good. So why, oh why, whenever someone gets hold of an actual PKD story and film it, do they make such a mess of it? (Bladerunner excepted, but Dick was still alive for that one).<br/><br/>Minority report has one great thing going for it: the central idea of citizens being arrested and punished for crimes they HAVEN'T YET COMMITTED, on evidence provided by gifted precognitives. Unfortunately it's the only really good thing about Minority Report the movie, and Steven Spielberg had nothing to do with it.<br/><br/>Most of my criticisms have been covered below. Inconsistent, uninteresting future world, bad pacing, lapses into sentimentality (and stupid gags), irritating, overexposed cinematography (I've watched films in sepia before, but this is the first one I've watched in chrome), and some really bad plot holes.<br/><br/>Oh, BTW, before I get on to the big spoiler - I realised something while watching this movie. I'm sick of CGI. I really am. This movie is like the last Star Wars. Every outdoor scene is crammed with billions of things whizzing all over the damn place, and what's more they somehow just don't look real. I don't find this exciting anymore; I just find it tiring. Compare this maelstrom of whizzing whatnots with the sparse, ominous sets in Kubrick's 2001.<br/><br/>Ok.... QUITE A MAJOR SPOILER COMING<br/><br/>I admit that if I have read PKD's original story Minority Report, it must have been 20 years ago, and I don't recall it. I mostly read his novels. But I am willing to guess that Dick would have gone some way to explaining this scenario, if indeed it existed in his story:<br/><br/>Tom Cruise's character has been accused of a murder he is yet to commit. The supposed victim is someone he doesn't even know, and he rightly rationalises that it's unlikely he would be going to commit this murder. It's due to happen in about 20 hours, and meanwhile he has escaped and is on the run. He has managed to elude capture so far.<br/><br/>Can someone tell me why his response to this situation is to have his eyes gouged out by some sadistic backstreet doctor (who used to set his patients on fire and make movies of it), disfigure his face, and then sneak into the pre-crime center, which is the place he is most likely to get caught (somehow the security scanner still recognises his retinal scan from the eyeballs he's carrying, despite his being wanted for murder. In fact they still work when his wife uses them, after he's imprisoned), and then abduct a pre-cog and rush off with her, with the whole Washington police force in tow, en route to the supposed future murder scene?<br/><br/>Why doesn't he just sit somewhere safe for 20 hours and wait until the murder doesn't happen, proving his innocence by simply doing nothing?<br/><br/>This is two bad SF movies in a row for Spielberg. Elsewhere I have given one of his movies 10 out of 10. Minority Report scores a 5.<br/><br/>Oh, and could someone make a movie of one of PKD's NOVELS? What is it with this short story thing? It's the same curse that seems to have befallen H.P.Lovecraft. Let's see UBIK, or The Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch, or A Scanner Darkly. Only please find someone else to direct it."

"Alex-506","9","0","0","6 January 2003"," A masterpiece...one of Spielberg's very best.
","Other than the incomparable Schindler's List (which is my second favourite film of all-time) and perhaps the wonderful entertainment Raiders of the Lost Ark, I think that this is Steven Spielberg's greatest film.  And that's saying something.<br/><br/>To be sure, it is the best film I have seen in 2002.  As a movie lover, I love films that almost get me drunk on the pure excitement of watching it. This is such a film.  I saw it in theaters and bought it on DVD because everytime I watch it, I can look at it through a new angle.<br/><br/>If you watch it simply to be dazzled by the vision of the future, it's a masterpiece.  If you watch it to be enveloped in a Hitchcockian murder mystery, it's a masterpiece.  And as a combination of the two, it forges it's own special genre...like Blade Runner meets North by Northwest.<br/><br/>Also, there is an element of strong social commentary about the direction that America (and other countries, to be fair) is heading in with its ""protection"" of national interests.  We may still be alive, but will we be free?  There is an undeniable horror to two images in the movie: the one in which the halo is about to be put on the man's head at the beginning of the film (the guy who was about to kill his wife) and the one in which Anderton sees himself committing a crime.  How could you talk your way out of it? ""But...I haven't done anything!"".  ""Yes, but you will...""<br/><br/>There are so many memorable images and moments: I haven't even mentioned the first great chase sequence, the Spyder sequence (which ranks with some of cinema's finest moments) or the oddly romantic ""Moon River"" chase sequence in the mall.  These are all moments that transcend any genre and get at the heart of why we go to the movies in the first place.<br/><br/>The performances would seem to be irrelevant in a sci-fi movie, but it is typical of Spielberg that they are first-rate.  Tom Cruise really made me care about his character, even the corny missing son bit seemed genuine rather than forced on to forge his character.  And the supporting performances are unforgettable: Samantha Morton as a chilling Pre-Cog, Colin Farrell as the oily Witwer, Max von Sydow as the seemingly paternal head of Pre-Crime.  And the characters Anderton meets along the way: the always creepy Peter Stormare, Lois Smith and Tim Blake Nelson add colour and humour to the story.<br/><br/>I think this is a great film...what more needs to be said?  When I first saw the film, I thought it was a masterpiece, although I thought the ending was flawed.  Now, even the ending works for me.  It's still a little bit overexpository (the genius of the crime is better revealed slyly and subtly...but I guess Spielberg wanted to make sure the audience wasn't confused).  However, the ending contains genuine drama and many different shots that would have made Hitchcock proud.  So even though it's the worst part of the film, it's still not bad.<br/><br/>But yes, as I said, this is a masterpiece.  If you haven't seen it, it's too bad you missed it in theaters (it really is a great moviegoing experience) but get it on DVD or VHS.  You won't be disappointed."

I could barely stand still in line opening weeknd when I was at the theater. And before I knew it, the movie was over and i was throughly satisfied. So of course, my next move was to promptly add it to my Christmas lis for this year, unable to wait to see it again. So i opened it up christmas morning and, wasting no time, watched it again. And although I was annoied at the time that I had to wait so long, retrospectivly it allowed me to watch it for the first time again. And that was when plot holes started to jump out and hit me in the face. The inconsistant abilities of the ""precogs"" is bothering. Why could he pull the bandages off his eyes after only 6 hours and not go blind? Why did that man he put in jail bother to help him at all? How are the two murders of Anne Lively so similar that no one noticed? How are the ""precogs"" unaware of people when one grabs Anderton and speeks to him? And the biggest one: Why did Burgess set him up in the first place? But despite my uncertanties and some inaccuracies, the movie is fun to watch and his decent cinematography.<br/><br/>The chase through the assembly factory is spectacular and I think the the concept for that ""pulse gun"" is great. The sequence with Anderton jumping from car to car is also great. Some of the shooting is also nice. At one point Anderton and Agatha embrace while speaking to eachother and the heads face opposite directions and it's very dynamic. And the shot when Burgess shoots Danny in the head is also quite artful. As for the acting: not terrible, but nothing to write home about. Collin Farrel is a little weak at times, but what can you expect for some one up against a heavy weight like Tom Cruise?<br/><br/>Over all, I think I gave it six or seven or something like that becasue of major holes yet still quite entertaining."

Okay, tell me, how is such negligence possible? The whole police are looking for him, nonetheless, they didn't even deny his very access to their station.

","A futuristic action/suspense tale that plays out like a sprawling, souped-up, special effects-laden Twilight Zone episode with a cheesy murder mystery tacked on at the end.  It's hard to remember Steven Spielberg directed because it feels like every other futuristic action/suspense tale that's come down the block for the last 15 years.  The only real 'Spielberg' touches are his clever homage to his own first directorial job -the Night Gallery episode with a blind Joan Crawford- and a slight nod to the Chuck Jones-Warner Brothers cartoons -the timing in the scene where Cruise submerges himself underwater from the creepy-crawly mechanical spiders only to have one slow single drop from the tub's spout almost give him away evokes the best Road Runner & Coyote skit- and (of course) the all's-well-that-ends-well finale.<br/><br/> Tom Cruise is a smart man and has taken the Burt Lancaster route: both were good looking men with average talents but they both worked hard and took risks and grew into phenomenal actors.  Cruise has now knocked 4 or 5 roles out of the ballpark (Jerry McGuire, Magnolia, Vanilla Sky, Minority Report) and proves once and for all that he's a great actor and a great movie star. He's become completely fearless in front of a camera and he takes the typical shlock detective-haunted-by-the-past part and invests John Anderton with dignity, compassion, and a powerfully emotional reserve that only he could bring.  It's a great performance.<br/><br/>The wonderful Samantha Morton, Max Von Sydow, and Belushi-eyebrowed newcomer Jason Antoon supply their great talents and do fine work as the supporting players but Colin Farrell  -a sexy guy in a flavor-of-the-month way- doesn't really register here: he just fades into the background.<br/><br/>Minority Report is worth seeing but it's hardly the deep, dark, mind-blowing social commentary people make it out to be."

"HyperPup","10","0","0","27 December 2002"," Not just a movie, but a yardstick!
","God bless Spielburg and crew for this movie. Having seen it during its summer premiere, I now am the proud owner of this soon to be classic piece of scifi cinema.<br/><br/>There was so much in this movie that impressed me, the cinematography, the effects, the acting and the overall sense of the story. Not to be outdone, the spirit of PKD's classic story of sacrifice for the betterment of society gone wrong resonates with a vibrant life as prescient now as it was when he first wrote the short story.<br/><br/>The entire technological structure of 2054 is well thought out, and though visually striking, is not as garish and showy as what we see in a typical Star Wars or Star Trek film. You can sense that technology as being a outgrowth of the future and not some obscene or frivolus paen to it with the only exception being the personalized and ubiquitous advertising, greeting each and every person that has been retina scanned. Though most of the technological progress of the movie push us easily through the story, this is more of a shove, but not one that would be lost on this viewer, no sir. Spielburg is proving he is as sage as his precog characters by predicting a future in which the last gasp of advertising is this ""blitz"" of information we all will be exposed to....by name no less. A concept that probably left huge drafts wafting over many a viewers heads, their indignant rebukes against the gross commercialism proof of the failure to understand. That is alright, I hear Men In Black 2 is out on DVD now as well.<br/><br/>The characters were very perfunctory to merely glance at them, but as the story carries us along we see the dimensionality of Anderton, Burgess, Witwer and the Precogs become richer, more colorful and less static. Anderton, not only determined to ""save"" society by maintaining the Precrime system that will effectivley make murder extinct in all of North America should Witwer, find no proof of the system as being fallible. This sudden rivalry by PreCrime versus Dept. Of Justice sets the stage for the exposure of Precrime's top cop Anderton as being an effective and idealistic leader. A true believer in the system he works for but when at home alone, he is drug addicted, slovenly and in a constant state of mourning for his abducted and presumed dead child Sean, a loss so deep it not only drives his quest to end murder's grip on D.C. but splits him off from a wife he also still cares for. These are not hollow characters, floating in and out of the story like ghosts out of the ether, they interact in an intelligent discourse of, discovery, agony, hope and danger weaving an intricate story that is part crime-drama, part science fiction, another part detective story and a small part a fantasy. The melange becomes not just a clever scifi film but a hybrid yardstick that other scifi films will and should be forced to stand against if they truly believe they are ""serious scifi"". Gone are the pulp trappings of action/scifi and effects driven sentimentality. Spielburg has given us a movie that not only tells the story but sells the story in a fashion that you can almost feel its need to be told.<br/><br/>Though there have been many adaptations of PKD stories throughout the years Minority Report is the only one in my opinion that gives us the story like Dick would have if he could have written a screenplay for it. At no time did I feel that they pimped or profaned the original concept or verse of the original story even right down to the ending which in relation to the short story would have been outlandish to force upon the audience but still a departure from the ""perceived"" PKD norm.

","Just saw the DVD and really enjoyed it. I had a few questions afterward (what's with the one-eyed scan in the pre-crime station? And why didn't it set off alarms when he used his severed eyeball to get into the nerve centre??) but I certainly wasn't as offended as other IMDB reviewers about the plotholes. Most movies with a fast-moving plot have them too, and some of them become huge fan favorites (Spiderman) or even Oscar winners (Titanic). In Minority Report I found a beautifully filmed thriller with a hint of film noir. The set designs are stunning, and the bleached look gives MR an Orwellian kind of a look. Even better, we meet a host of interesting characters along the way, each who steals the scene in which they're in. Those were the lasting impressions I have from MR. All in all, it ain't perfect, but it's a helluvalot better than most of the pap at the local cineplex.<br/><br/>8/10"

","I'm not gonna tell ya about the story, just read some of the other comments or preferably, watch the movie....<br/><br/>i just wanted to say Minority Report deserves all the praise in the world. The acting and directing is magnificent and the SFX are believable. <br/><br/>
although, after watching it a few times, which, sadly, i'm inclined to do, there are some problems with the story you tend not to notice because the movie is always going forward.  <br/><br/>I am disapointed however, that the real criminal is exposed so early.  This movie had the makings of a great Mystery and in one scene, it is all taken away and some of the fun is taken away with it.  <br/><br/>But that put aside, this movie is the futuristic joyride that The Star Wars prequels are supposed to be.

","Tom Cruise gives a sensational performance as a man fleeing from the precrime unit to prove his innocence in ""Minority Report"". He plays John Andertson, a precrime cop who works for the precrime station in Washington D.C. Over the years, humans were able to develop a system in which murder can be seen before it actually happens. Thanks to that system, Washington D.C. is the safest place to live since it has been murder free for quite some time. Tom Cruise is one of the officers for this system, and when he is accused of a murder he has not yet commited, he flees to prove his innocence. A very clever movie, with twists and turns along the way to keep you into it. This is Cruise's best performance ever in my opinion. The special effects are great and the stunts are amazing.

Homeland security? Do the math. This movie came out right on time. The subject is definitely in play.<br/><br/>The world of 2054 as portrayed here by our pal Steve Speilberg is not at all implausible. The computers, in particular, look like the next big thing. Ever seen anybody playing a theremin? No? Then how about how they turned Andy Serkes into Gollum for ""Lord Of The Rings""... And the product placement and digital advertising in ""M.R.""? Just remember, kids. You heard it here first. I saw the World's Fair in 64-65. I know how this works. The future is NOW. Speilberg's just showing us how we'll be driving our cars and using our P.C.'s before Chevrolet and Apple get their own ads in gear. The scene with Cruise's character in the mall is coming soon, and I don't mean to a theater near you, either. <br/><br/>The film is story-driven and the acting is secondary to the special effects, which are spectacular, but Peter Stormare is a hoot is his cameo and Samantha Morton and Cruise do a creditable job considering the parameters. For you cinematography buffs out there, I believe that I counted 659 different shades of the color blue during the course of the movie. See if you can find them all.

I saw it again tonight and was totally swept away again.  This film is impressive in its blending of action, film noir, true science fiction, and suspense.  And yet it is still full of whimsy, satire, and comedy.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the way the film meandered from genre to genre - early on concentrating on science fiction, then blending into action, which blended into suspense, all the while mixed with a touch of film noir.  You get a lot of movie for your money here.<br/><br/>Perhaps the thing I most cherish, though, is the style of this film.  The great visuals are a big part, but there's also a very strong layer of grit and perversity here.

","I've never struggled as hard through a movie as Spielberg's ""AI"", but ""Minority Report"" is so far out, I wonder if Spielberg has had a nervous breakdown or is off his Paxil.  Used to, when a person didn't understand a movie, the consensus was that it must be brilliant.  One had to read something deep into it or find the inner truth. In my opinion, just as ""AI"", the truth is this movie is boring. The supporting cast of Colin Farrell and Steve Davis is about the only good thing in the film. With all the special effects presented this year...a la ""Lord of the Rings"", ""Star Wars II"", ""Harry Potter"", etc. was ""arm-waving"" the only convention Spielberg could come up with to create Cruise's imagery of the future? It looked ridiculous. <br/><br/>Cruise makes a fortune choosing bad scripts, substituting action and screaming scenes for acting. He's no actor...he's a screamer who likes to play anger, as does Denzel Washington and Dylan McDermott.<br/><br/>I'm certain that Cruise never saw a TV episode of ""Mission Impossible"" where a lot of characters with specific talents teamed together to form a team...BUT NOT! Cruise has to be the whole team with NO help!! Let's see...""Mission Impossible"" One and Two...""Eyes Wide Shut"", ""Magnolia"", and now this piece of schlock...""Minority Report"".

I, for one, applaud Tom Cruise's choice to move into a more thought provoking, mature type of role. He's an excellent actor that has, in the past, chosen some pretty lame projects.

","When watching a sci-fi or a fantastic movie can we claim that there are plot holes? Can someone say Superman movies does not make sense because man can't fly? In my opinion what one should look for in a sci-fi/fantastic movie is the logic within that movie itself. Every sci-fi movie creates a world and logic of its own and I prefer to judge each movie by its own logic. And I think this is fair. I just watched 'Minority Report'. I really liked the story. The twist about 'setup/not-a-setup' was one of the greatest twist I have ever seen but...<br/><br/>-Everybody's eyes are scanned everywhere but you can do whatever you like within a police building with one(not two:)) eye ball of the wanted guy? Give me a break. -Get away from the very same building by flushing off the pool with the most important thing in that building? Give me another break.<br/><br/>-'Hey we caught your murderer Anne Lively, now stay here and wait your real murderer. He should be here in a couple of minutes' pleeeeeeeeeease...<br/><br/>-The logic of the movie depends on the fact that precogs can only foresee murders but Agatha can foresee everything when leading Anderton out of the mall.<br/><br/>-'I am taking you to a safe place. My wife's house. They would never look for a fugitive in his wife's house. I am not stupid agatha you are stupid:))'<br/><br/>I think a good sci-fi movie has every right to have its own logic/world provided that it stays consistent with that logic and does not have really stupid heroes/villain.

","Steven Spielberg directing. Tom Cruise starring. And a Philip K.<br/><br/>Dick short story as the backbone. You'd think ""Minority Report""<br/><br/>would be fantastic. Although the movie is an enjoyable thriller, the<br/><br/>plot's so creaky that by the time it reaches the conclusion, you feel<br/><br/>compelled to cut off a couple of points.<br/><br/>(Since I'm coming to this late, I'll assume everyone knows the<br/><br/>basics of the plot and avoid a recap.)<br/><br/>The greatest sin of the movie is the number of subplots thrown at<br/><br/>the viewer which are then discarded like used tissues. For<br/><br/>example, Cruise is being bird-dogged by an FBI agent who seems<br/><br/>committed to bringing down the whole ""precrime"" enterprise. The<br/><br/>agent wants to get inside the ""temple"" where Precrime keeps the<br/><br/>""precogs."" Can't do that, Cruise insists. It would contaminate the<br/><br/>blah blah blah (some technobabble better left forgotten).<br/><br/>The agent says he's got a warrant and he'll enter anyway. (I guess<br/><br/>by 2054, cops don't need probable cause of a crime to get a<br/><br/>warrant.) Any further word about this contamination ruining the<br/><br/>precogs' work? Nope.<br/><br/>Then there's a meeting midway through the movie between Cruise<br/><br/>and a back-alley plastic surgeon. The surgeon and Cruise have<br/><br/>some history ... which ultimately has nothing to do with the plot.<br/><br/>And the surgeon floats a don't-do-that-or-you'll-go-blind plot<br/><br/>element that gets ignored for the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>The climax involves a scene with Cruise and the antagonist. It<br/><br/>seems to revolve around the central issue of the movie: Must we<br/><br/>carry forward a prescripted destiny or do we have control over our<br/><br/>own fates? A deep, deep issue. Unfortunately for the climax, it was<br/><br/>answered 30 minutes earlier in the movie.<br/><br/>All this wouldn't be so annoying if Steven Spielberg weren't the<br/><br/>director. Did he do this movie just to get someone to stop<br/><br/>bothering him? Maybe all his movies have a hundred nits to pick,<br/><br/>but these plot holes seemed the most glaring -- and detracted<br/><br/>from what was otherwise a fun thriller."

","After ""AI"", I was quite reluctant to believe the hype surrounding the Cruise/Spielberg collaboration for ""Minority Report.""  ""AI"" was such a convoluted, though beautifully filmed, piece of film.  ""Minority Report"", on the other hand, is not only well-filmed, but it appears to showcase Spielberg in some of his best work to date!  Elegant, thrilling, poignant, and masterful, ""Minority Report"" delves deep into the moral quagmire that represents the government controlling ""psychics"" and ostensibly putting them to use for their own betterment.  We all know that whenever the government gets involved in any form, something horrid will happen.  Such is the case in ""M.R.""--a good man, Cruise, is taken down like an expendable pawn in a egoistic game of ""show me the money"" by his ultimate superiors.

","Being someone who has always had a strong interest in the future... particularly where our society and civilization is headed, what advancements we will make from the sociological to the technological to the spiritual... I have always enjoyed believable futuristic settings and scenarios in not only science fiction, but in all speculative fiction. So when I first saw the trailers for Minority Report I was immediately interested by the story, but I was looking at Tom Cruise in a Steven Spielberg action film which seemed very well polished and Hollywood. Naturally, I had my doubts. I waited until it appeared at the dollar theater and then procrastinated once again. Just recently, however, my roommates rented the DVD and I got my chance to check it out. Overall, I cannot confidently state anything negative about it without becoming more analytical than I care to. The setting was mostly believable, allowing a stretch or two for the precognition that the story is structured around. The characters were given a few touches here and there of depth, notably the way Tom Cruise's character had dealt with his loss of a loved one and how the side-effects of that were still affecting his life. The story was moderately complex, which was more than I expected, and actually surprised me more than once. In closing, I would most likely watch this film again, but I doubt that I'll ever end up buying a copy."

","The visual image of the future that we get from Spielberg in Minority Report is awe inspiringly jaw dropping. Yeah. It's that good. But the best part about it is that the eye candy is only there to play along with the story, not to dominate it. Recently it seems as though special effects have been the basis for entire movies where as Spielberg understands that the movie should be the basis for the use of special effects. There are some great action sequences in the beginning of the movie including a jet pack sequence and a ""pulse gun"" scene; either of which would have been well worth the price of admission. Other details include robotic spiders that can confirm the identity of people in a building in a matter of minutes, cars that glide vertically and horizontally on magnetic strips, mammoth skyscrapers mixed with present day buildings in Washinton D.C., and so many others.<br/><br/>Nothing can compare to the computer interface used by pre-crime to find out the details of the killer. The computer takes the visual images from the Pre-Cogs and plays them with a Precrime officer at the controls. The images can be manipulated by the officer with movements almost like a symphony conductor. It's like an enormous even cooler looking iPhone. Except this was about five years before our world was blessed (cursed?) with the device. Aside from that the overall look of the world is near flawless. The gray world makes the CGI animators job easier and allows the world to remain real and tangible for the audience.<br/><br/>The story is about Precrime's star cop John Anderton - Tom Cruise in perhaps his finest performance ever. Anderton is a man with many flaws, especially since losing his son in a freak poolside disappearance years ago. He does drugs to make the present bearable all while tracking down (alleged) future murderers. It's all fine and dandy until Anderton is the next suspect the Precogs see killing a random man. He goes on the run to try to clear his name, all while DC's finest try to hunt him down in the futuristic world where it's nearly impossible to hide.<br/><br/>Spending hours talking about just the images would be easy, but what really carries this movie is the engrossing story. There are numerous twists and turns, and there are small holes in logic at a few points, but those holes depend on personal opinions and philosophy. It has always been a dilemma to answer the question: ""If you stop something from happening that was supposed to happen, doesn't that mean that it really wasn't supposed to happen anyways?"" My biggest problem was this: John's supposed future murder was predicted early which meant it was premeditated, but it actually was not, it happened in the heat of the moment, so how could the Pre-Cogs have predicted it so early?<br/><br/>We forget about everything that could be wrong because Tom Cruise is so exciting to watch on screen that nothing else matters sometimes. He is the best action star alive today, but he is also one of the few action stars with highly respectable dramatic talent as well. His turns in Rain Man, Born on the Fourth of July, Magnolia, and Jerry Maguire have all been top notch. He is the perfect choice for John Anderton and his collaboration with Spielberg allows him to get back into the high quality of work that we are used to seeing him in.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is extraordinary with standout performances from Max von Sydow - the old and optimistic director of Precrime - Colin Farrell - complex and pessimistic investigator Danny Witwer - and Samantha Morton - Agatha, the most talented Pre-Cog. One of the most memorable lines in the movie comes when Agatha mutters, ""Is this now?"" It makes us realize that Agatha seeing the present is just as amazing for her as any one of us seeing the future.<br/><br/>There are hundreds of other details, big and small, that make this movie an instant classic. This may sound tacky, but Minority Report shoots for nothing less than perfection, and it succeeds on almost every level."

","Directing Minority Report Stephen Spielberg has surely done a very neat job although this film won't be counted among the best films of the decade for its lack in deepness and its faults in the story. Minority Report is highly enjoyable film. It is a rush with the right pace featured by impressive pictures due to sophisticated special effects and talented acting. But it leaves you off with the thought that, given this topic, somebody could have worked out a much more powerful story.<br/><br/> Tom Cruise does a wonderful job in giving live to the character of Detective John Anderton. He's never overdoing his role trying to add depth and emotion at any scene where it is not justified. He rarely shows a lot of mimic except for a little smile when he speaks to the projection of his son projected by a futuristic beamer. Mostly he's just doing - not acting. Due to the story Tom Cruise doesn't have to show an inner struggle in his character. There's no scene that gives a lot of insight. This is pretty much typical for the films Tom Cruise does.<br/><br/> Samatha Morton in the role of Agatha has a much more complicated task to fulfil. An absent minded girl that can see murders in the future is a lot harder to get on the screen than a determined hero only facing the threats from the outside. But she succeeds even better than Tom Cruise. All in all the acting has been wonderful.<br/><br/> Thanks to Spielberg the actors have been set in the right place and the right light which adds a lot of power to their scenes. Spielberg has also done a very good job showing the dream like predictions of Agatha as some short blurred and distorted film scenes. It's wonderful to watch the actors trying to complete the puzzle given only a short amount of time.<br/><br/> As I haven't had insight to the screenplay I can only guess which sections are probably made up by Scott Frank and the author of the short story Phillip K. Dick. The most brilliant scene, in my opinion, is right at the beginning when Tom Cruise directs the concert of dreamlike visions coming from the Agatha and the twins. The screenwriter might have used an ordinary Pc Screen and a mouse or just a big LCD Screen. But he decided to have big transparent, futuristic screen. Thus not only giving us a sense in which time the story is set and leaving the receiver somehow puzzled, but also showing Detective Anderton as director of destiny. He has total control over the pictures and vision on any murder that has not yet been commited. The way the input device for the screen is designed forces him to do very visual gestures that otherwise would have seemed exaggerated, although the fit in.<br/><br/> Another sequence worth mentioning is the replacement of his eyes. At that point Stephen Spielberg had the chance to present the opposite, the negative vision of the future. The doctor is a criminal and his nurse is no better. But in this scene Spielberg fails to set the miserable mood that would have been appropriate for that scene. The scenes where Detective Anderton drinks radioactive water, eats a rotten sandwich and almost swallows outdated milk seems more like slapstick. These actions are presented so fast that they turn the disgust experienced by the viewer in the scene before (when the eyes are prepared to be removed) in a relief in laughter. If intended that way the film fails here miserably to create any vision of the future. There's no mood or atmosphere to be experienced like you could do in Blade Runner. It's just another sacrifice to the rush.<br/><br/> Instead of talking about every single special effect and kind of choices in framing and presentation of scene I want to point out the overall pace of the story. Right from the beginning the receiver is set in a rollercoaster. Sound effects and visual effects, the lack of time for action is driving the story forward all the time.<br/><br/> There are hardly any scenes to develop traits in characters. The only thing we learn about the protagonist is that he is suffering from the lost of his son. Furthermore we are informed about the relationship to his ex-wife and the reason why she left him - but that's not a real character trait. So the loss of his son and family is pretty much it. Not a lot. Other characters are only used in their typical function. The protagonist's ex-wife has nothing more to do than to state that she loves her ex-husband and that she only separated from him because he reminds her of her late son. Director Lamar Burgess only serves the function as a mentor until he is used as a new antagonist. Danny Witwer, the primarily antagonist, has not much to do or to say. As there is no colorful protagonist, the antagonist can't give him much contrast. But you might also say it the other way round.<br/><br/>Basically the film finds his appeal in its pace and rhythmic timing. I believe that is why the story gets weak when present catches up with the prediction. From that point the story is dull. The overall purpose of the rush is fulfilled. The pre-crime system is proved wrong. Freedom of choice has prevailed. Somehow the rest of the story is like the clearing work after a party. The system must be destroyed and somebody must die at the final climax and Anderton has to reunite with is ex-wife to have the western family model again. At the end the film loses his beauty of rush and turns out to be a predictable standard North American film with flat characters. Even the special effects can't save the film from going down now.<br/><br/> When the story turns, it is the first time the receiver has the time to think. He may has not yet noticed that he followed the standard narrative pattern with Hollywood accuracy. But then he is left alone without any overwhelming pictures and without speed. He's left without any intellectual thought about the topic of pre-crime justice. There is so much provocative in this topic, even spoiling up some basic beliefs in the American Constitution. There is so much controversy in it. None of those opportunities has been explored by the film. The topic rather has been misused to market a weak story in a high-quality Hollywood production."

","Janusz Kaminski is perhaps the greatest cinematographer in the world today, and he is Spielberg's most important crew member. Minority Report is just as beautiful to look at as A.I. Spielberg has created a darker film than he usually does, but he could not resist including another sappy father-son plot point. This is exciting as hell, but Spielberg loses touch in a somewhat dull and too-resolving ending. The film would also be better without some comical elements which interrupt the dark style.<br/><br/>

"omarhussaini","Null","0","0","26 November 2002"," Not for the Idiots
","Minority Report is a sci-fi whodunnit that reaffirms Stanley Kubrick's paradoxical belief that the cinema can both provoke and entertain.  Set 50 years into the future, the film is about John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a detective who works for an organization called Pre-Crime which identifies and captures people just before they commit a murder.  It does so through the use of Pre-Cogs, basically three psychics in a forever trance-like state, that have premonitions of the act before it actually occurs.  The system was created by Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) and Iris Hineman (Lois Smith), and in the six years that it's been in place, there hasn't been a single murder.  So far so good. But  enter Danny Witwer (Colin Farell), an official of the Justice Department, who has some concerns of the legality and morality of the setup.  Anderton completely believes in it but Witwer doesn't feel it's right to punish the people if they haven't committed the murder yet.  Witwer also tells him that since the system was designed by humans, it's not perfect.  There's always one flaw and it's always human. Now if you thought that Steven Spielberg was finished after Saving Private Ryan, well then you clearly haven't seen this film - or you might just be an idiot.  He's taken Phillip K. Dick's short story and expanded it into a 2 hour 20 minute mind-bending race-against-the-clock thriller, complete with all the thrills, chills, and the required surprise twist that we expect from something of this scale.  His direction propels the film while still giving us a multi-layered plot without slowing down the action.  You need to pay attention to all the details because it's not an easy one to (completely) get in one viewing.  If you're the type of person who likes to leave his brain at home before heading to the theater, then I suggest Attack of the Clones or maybe Goldmember is more to your liking.  Acting-wise, Cruise, Farell, and Sydow are all good in their roles, yet it's Samantha Morton as the Pre-Cog Agatha who outshines them all.  Her chilling performance provides the movie with some of its most memorable scenes and much of the sympathy that's supposed to go to Cruise's character ends up going to her. An Oscar nomination would be well-deserved, although it's doubtful she'll get one because of the limited screen time and since Dreamworks will probably push the disappointing Road To Perdition for the awards over this film.  Technically the picture is flawless and should be a nomination sweeper with directing and picture nods going to Spielberg.  A near-masterpiece, the movie is an easy 4 out of 5.  Why not 5 stars you may ask ?  Well it's because Spielberg, as usual, puts too much of his family/love theme into the plot.  That's what ruined AI and it's also the one false note in this movie which, otherwise, is sci-fi film noir at its finest."
"brandon_dye","9","0","0","22 November 2002"," One of the best films of 2002
","This film, without a doubt, is one of the best science fiction films I have seen.  Once again, Steven Spielberg proves he the the best director of films in the world.  This film has everything: action, crime, science fiction, and drama.  Spielberg ties all of those elements and turns it into a great movie.  Plus Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances I have ever seen. I also have to give credit for great acting to the supporting players, especially Colin Farrell.  Hopefully this will be the film that propels him in to superstardom.  Back to the film:  The one thing that makes this film so great are the elements of the environment and the story.  The story is quite original and is something that has never been done before (or if it has, not much of it has been done before).  The film does have its dull moments and rough edges but I usually forgot them throughout.  Also, the film has this texture that not only makes the setting realistic, but frightening.  This film makes the futuristic world creepy and eerie which was true masterpiece.  I am disappointed in the people who did not like this picture and has given it bad rap because it really is a great film.  This is by far one of the best films of 2002.  9/10"

","Minority Report<br/><br/>
The year is 2054, and in Washington is in work the experimental criminal system where the police know in advance who will comit the crime.Chief John Anderton(Tom Cruise)believes that the system is perfect until he is acussed of a murder of a man who he doesn't even know. His only chance is to run and to prove that the system isn't perfect. I can say that the film is very good, it has good acting and directing and a very good SF story of the author of legendary Blade Runner Philip K. Dick.The film is defenately one of the best of this year and could be nominated for at least 4 oscars.For directing, special efects and for actors Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton both for supporting role.For Colin Farrell this isn't a suprise even he is a relative unknown actor, who has shown all he's talent in film Tigerland.But is very dificult that he could win the oscar because Paul Newman has made a fantastic job in Sam Mendes film Road to Perdition. The big suprise is Samantha Morton a unknown actress that has made a fantastic role and is one of the bigest candidate for the oscar.Of the rest of the actors there is Max von Sydow most known from the film The Exzorcist and Tom Cruise.Cruise who has been nominated for 2 oscars for the films Jerry Maguire and Magnolia and who made also very good roles in films like Risky Business, The Color of Money, Top Gun, Rain Man and Born on the fourt of July is the leading actor in this film.He has done an ok job but not excelent so i dont belive he will be nominated for any major award.This film has also very good special efects. The director of the film is Steven Spielberg who has won 2 oscars for films Schindler's list and Saving Private Ryan and this could be the third.This film is one of Spielbergs best after Jaws,Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's list, and if I think Spilberg hasn't done any bad movie in his whole career. So what to say in the end maybe that the film was a big hit of this year and has made a profit of 135 000 000 only in USA, and that is one of the best SF film of all times togeather with also fantastic SF films like Blade Runner, The Matrix and Twelve Monkeys."

","Year 2054. Washington. John Anderton is a policeman who discovers the most terrible truth he can imagine. He, guardian of life and public order, is accused of killing somebody he doesn't know. This is the initial plot of the futuristic movie Minority Report, by Steven Spielberg. The film combines quite well the adventures of John Anderton with a more interesting undertone. It tells us about important questions like freedom, civil rights and the possible guilt of people who have committed no crime. Minority Report is based on a essential idea: in the future a police group with capacity to know crimes before they happen will exist. And guilty people will be accused before committing a punishable action. Spielberg criticizes and studies in depth our western society - The terrors, fears and vengeful feelings. He shows us the most immoral part of that vigilance system and proposes a discussion about security and civil rights. The movie is developed from one premise: A pre-crime system works very well. But it really only works in 90% of the cases. For that reason, a discussion is created because it allows errors against innocent people. actually, this is an argument very common now and more important after the birth of the new psychosis of panic due to global terrorism. On the other hand, another theme is publicity and the invasion of our private lives. In the movie, advertising posters read people's irises and they can talk to that consumer particularly. This film attacks this consumer world. Minority Report has also got a good dose of action and adventures which star the brilliant Tom Cruise. The persecution with propellants or the main character's escape with a `pre-cog' are two lessons for every film fan."

","Honestly, I want my money back. The full 15. Yes, I made the mistake of taking my date to this... film. The premise is old. Really old. A cop who lost his family and who is being framed. Been there, done that.<br/><br/>Some parts of the movie are so illogical they make your brain hurt (see SPOILERS). The whole oracle thing is a poor idea (probably inspired by AKIRA). The Pre-cogs are living, thinking human beings kept in nutrient solution (why?), drugged all day (and this is not a human rights problem)?? And they can predict the future... wait, only murders. And seemingly they can forsee only murders to be committed in Washington DC (this is where the experiment is being conducted). Why the heck? Then again, apparently there is no other crime but murder- at least we see no normal police during the whole movie.<br/><br/>The Precrime Police imprison people for crimes not yet comitted. This is really the best part (sarcasm alert): The would-be-criminals (read: still innocent people) are stored in some sort of stasis- indefinitely. And there is no chance of rehabilitation. Demolition Man, anyone?<br/><br/>Somehow this movie feels like being based upon a cheap 1950s scifi short story written by a hack with the usual Hollywood-ending added later on. Reminds me of the Hollywood-ending which was added to Bladerunner...<br/><br/>Final Verdict: Don't waste your money on it like I did.<br/><br/>

John Anderton does not kill Leo Crow, Crow basically kills himself. So why do the Pre-cogs predict it?<br/><br/>Lamar Burgess does not kill John Anderton.

","Say what you will about the soft ending, but this is one of the finest sci-fi films we've gotten in quite a while! Even from Steven Spielberg, you really couldn't have expected much more. Let's examine some of the plot:<br/><br/>Well, it takes place in 2057 in Washington D.C., and it explores a new system of crime-stopping in which crimes are predicted before they are committed, giving the police, or whatever they're called in 2057, enough time to arrest the would-be criminal before they commit their crime. Cool, eh? Well anyway, if you haven't already heard the next part: Tom Cruise is one of the head workers there, and not too far into the movie, HE is accused of committing a future crime. And as it turns out, he is accused of killing someone whom he's never heard of. And the plot certainly takes off from there, in which he tries to prove an error in the pre-crime system to clear his name. But to reveal any more would be ridiculous.<br/><br/>The bottom line with ""Minority Report"" is that it is another total triumph for master director Steven Spielberg, who takes advantage of numerous special effects AND a wonderful story.

Those were good news, because the audience was a bit disappointed with ""A.I."" and wanted Spielberg to erase the flaws his last production had.<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" is about a ""real future world"". And I say real because Spielberg has tried to create a 2054 world that seemed real, not sci-fi future. He did lots of documentation to recreate a society that, in my opinion, gets quite close to how will it be in 50 years. The police department has reached a level of accuracy that a new division has been created: the Department of Precrime. Using the Precogs, they are able to arrest murderers before they commit the crime.<br/><br/>Everything is perfect until the precogs predicts a murder done by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), detective leading the Precrime department.

","What will life in the next generation be like? Or in two generations? ""Minority Report"" answers that question, at least through the mind of Phillip K. Dick via Steven Spielberg. ""Minority Report"" is a murder mystery set in the Washington, DC of 2054. But murder ain't what it used to be, or at least homicide detectives aren't what they used to be. In 2054, thanks to genetic engineering gone sour, three humans have precognitive powers, allowing them to predict murders before they happen with 100% accuracy. Well, not always 100%, sometimes its only 66.66%, when one of the PreCogs disagrees and files a 'minority report'. Tom Cruise plays Detective Anderton, head of the Pre-Crime Unit that oversees this operation, until that fateful day when the PreCogs finger him as a future murderer. So, he runs for it. <br/><br/>Minority Report is at its heart a whodunit. The science fiction, outside of the PreCogs, is just a part of the scenery. Passive retinal scans constantly monitor citizen movements and are used to tailor a deluge of personal advertising. Highways have gone vertical. Police use personal jet packs. Spielberg's vision of the future is not as dark as ""Blade Runner"", but it's still not very appealing.<br/><br/>But the movie is great stuff.

","After reading all those positive, nay, ecstatic reviews from top critics all over the world about this movie, being a big Spielberg fan (if not as big a Tom Cruise fan) I had to see what all the fuss was about. OK, although this movie isn't anywhere near bad, it wasn't nearly as original or as brilliant as many critics claimed. At certain times I felt really uneasy and depressed watching this movie, especially during the scenes with Peter Stormare, whose character is neither funny, nor scary, nor cynical, just plain unlikable in every way. Also the scene with the old woman explaining every detail of the plot in the middle of the movie was blatant exposition and it went on forever. The look of the movie is also extremely ugly at times. Why did it all have to look either blue or grey, why couldn't there be some life and color? I hate Spielberg's new cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, the only movies he shot well were Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan, and A.I. It baffles me how some people praise the shooting style of the film, and it's even more infuriating to realise that desaturating the color actually demanded a special process, and therefore money. With Private Ryan it worked well, but why the hell was it needed in this film? Sometimes I could barely tell what I was seeing. <br/><br/>Now, I'll admit that was one of the few things that bothered me about the movie. The script is at times unpredictable and clever. The performances are all solid. The Cruiser isn't nearly as arrogant and annoying as usual, like he was in Vanilla Sky (awful movie). The effects are quite imaginative at times, although the ugly cinematography never really allows you to appreciate them (completely unlike in A.I.). Some of the direction is inspired, like when the spiders are searching the building, although mostly Spielberg's touch seems absent from the picture. You can tell by the film that there was nothing personal for him in the script; often the direction is flat and obvious. I think the best decision Spielberg could make now is to fire his cinematographer. I can't tell you how irritated I was by the lighting in certain scenes. Just get Dean Cundey back or something! It is truly, extremely ugly at times; it's almost like Kaminski was experimenting on how bad an effects-laden, expensive movie like this could possibly look, and I think he succeeded. I think he tried to do the same with The Lost World, but only with this film he succeeds in making it look ugly all the way through.<br/><br/>Now, of course there is a lot to admire as well about the film. The most enjoyable scenes come near the end when we discover just how everything worked, who the real bad guy is, why Cruise was set up. It's handled with admirable clarity and cleverness. Also, at those rare times when the movie intends to be humorous, it succeeds. And of course, it's a lot of fun to see all those surprisingly realistic future gimmicks on the screen.<br/><br/>
All in all, MR is better than 90% of this year's movies and it's Cruise's best performance since Magnolia. The story is original and complex but never incomprehensible. It's just that it doesn't compare to classic sci-fi movies like The Matrix, Terminator 2, or even Star Wars Episode 2 (although that opinion really is a minority report :-)). Some critics are saying it's better than those films, but trust me that's not true. Among Spielberg's movies I would say it ranks about in the same league as A.I. and Saving Private Ryan (both of which were good but not great movies in my opinion)."

","The year is 2054. Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, who works in the ""pre-crime"" division of the Washington, D.C. police force, and is a key figure in a successful experimental program to arrest murderers before they commit the murder, based on the visions of three ""pre-cogs"" floating in a tank. The film opens with a ""red ball"" case, in which there is little warning and therefore time is of the essence. The pre-cogs provide visions and (inexplicably) the full names of the future murderer and the victim(s), but nothing else, so John is left to try to narrow down the location based on that limited data.<br/><br/>He goes to work in front of a futuristic wall sized display, using special gloves that recognize his movements and gestures as commands to zoom, discard, and so on. Classical music plays on the soundtrack, conveying the impression that he is as skilled as a concert musician at working his way through the data. Eventually he has enough clues to leap into action with the rest of the SWAT-like team, flying across town in a futuristic blade-less helicopter-like vehicle, trying to reach the murder scene before the murder occurs. The pre-cogs' determination of the time of the murder is down to the second, so they always know exactly how much time they have left.<br/><br/>Soon after they return, the pre-crime unit is visited by Detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), who has been sent from the Justice Department to looks for flaws in the system before an imminent critical vote on whether or not pre-crime should go nationwide. We also meet Anderton's boss (Max von Sydow) and learn more about Anderton's past.<br/><br/>If you've seen the previews, the next revelation will be no surprise, but you might want to stop reading now if you want to minimize your knowledge of the plot... John Anderton's name shows up in the system as a future murderer. It is predicted that he will murder someone who he has never met in less than 36 hours. He runs, and the movie takes off running with him.<br/><br/>I think what makes the film work so well is the story. It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, whose short stories are also behind ""Blade Runner"" and ""Total Recall."" One of the two screenwriters wrote the screenplays for both ""Get Shorty"" and ""Out of Sight."" It's simply a first-rate whodunit with lots of twists and turns that feel real, with great humanity mixed in.<br/><br/>The film also presents a fully fleshed out view of the future. There are sensors in public places that can identify and track people by their retinal patterns, and in a memorable scene, mechanical spiders that fan out throughout an apartment building to scan all the occupants (the spiders are excellent computer animations, while the building itself was apparently a real set). There are newspapers that change to show the latest news, and advertising posters on the walls that customize themselves and talk directly to the specific people as they walk by (a particularly objectionable part of this future if you ask me).<br/><br/>The acting is solid if not spectacular, with the possible exception of Samantha Morton, who is very good as one of the pre-cogs. I also think Tim Blake Nelson is good in a small role.<br/><br/>The cinematography is consistently a little hazy looking and almost monochromatic. This is obviously an intentional effect, but it was a little distracting to me.<br/><br/>I just realized that I haven't mentioned that this film was directed by Steven Spielberg. This film is far from the cold detachment of ""Artificial Intelligence: AI"" and probably closer to some of his earlier work. Think of it as ""Close Encounters of the Third Kind"" with way more action, or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" with less but a more thought-provoking story.<br/><br/>This film is one of the few films that has gotten a wide release that I can recommend without reservation. This summer, this film and ""Road to Perdition"" are the best bets among the event films.<br/><br/>Seen on 8/11/2002."

","This film, set in 2054, has at it's base nothing more than an ordinary crime situation sort of speak. A cop is supposed to be a murderer. But what really makes this film interesting is that he has not committed it yet. Because of three persons, called Precogs, the police is able to see into the future and prevent murders before they are even committed. The chief of the unit that prevents the murders, Anderton (Tom Cruise) finds himself in a predicament one day, as he sees himself kill another man in the future. Not believing he would be able to do such a thing, he thinks it is a conspiracy and flees from the law to solve his own case. From here on Philip K.Dick (the mentioned king of sci fi) takes us (together with Spielberg and the screenwriter) on an incredible journey which is never predictable (except for the very end of the crime). The series of events are sometimes so surprising, that it reminded me of another film based on Philip K.Dick material: Total Recall. But back to this film. Overall, I felt that the second half of the film was much better than the first, which really was not too special at all. It seems to me, that there are not too many films that can hold and grasp your total being and keep it excited for two and a half hours. Is this film good? Is it bad? It is neither, but it is definetely a step up for Spielberg after A.I. Not a must see, but if you're into science fiction and well crafted stories, give this one a try.<br/><br/>

","Science Fiction! When a movie has Steven Spielberg in the director's chair you can expect more than this. This is Spielberg's second golden era in his career. He began his first period with Jaws, Close Encounters of the Third Kind, Raiders of the Lost Ark and E.T.  Spielberg`s previous film, the misunderstood masterpiece A.I. was his coldest and most cerebral film. Most people couldn't figure out the reasoning behind its virulent expression of a heartless race, but the beauty of the movie lied in telling its fable of an android that had a greater capacity for love and feeling than any human of flesh and bone.<br/><br/>Now it's time for Spielberg's another great accomplishment, Minority Report. This is stuff of great film noir, except its positive final scene. And the most fervid of movie fans will admire the sterile,  grey tint of the picture that suggests technology over freedom and autonomy in this future society. The visual effects seamlessly blend into the composition of the film to create a perfectly credible. The look of the picture, and characters all create a film noir with a look that is both future and retro. The story crashes into inevitable consequences, where the hero has to choose the ultimate moral dilemma whether to save himself or to remain truthful to destiny and future  Minority Report is a futuristic cinematic landmark that deserves to be ranked with Blade Runner, Se7en and Brazil as one of the best of the genre."

"swisswuff","Null","0","0","5 October 2002"," Builds on ""insights"" (attn: contains possible spoilers)
","Minority Report builds on some apparent ""insights"", that, once you know those, will unravel the movie even before 10 minutes are over. Two important dice have already been rolled beforehand, and you will recognise them so quickly it makes your seat hurt. Dice one. "" good hunter of murderers, deep down, must be a murderer himself"". This ""wisdom"" walks the earth with many faces: social workers, that have vast experience as prisoners themselves; pediatricians that once were repeatedly children patients and know the ins and outs of hospitals themselves; and of course the ""hunted turned into hunter"". This leads - with the flick of one eye - to the person behind the whole thing, the murderer who covers everything up. It also underlies Tom Cruise's character's motivation, that makes the movie goer believe that subliminal revenge is a good means as motivation to become a police officer. Dice two. ""Release the underdogs"". In Spielberg movies, one particularly important and prevailing element of portraying ""goodness"" comes about by ""releasing the underdogs"". That element prevails in many of his movies in various forms (including Jurassic Park, but also many others), and adds to everybody ""feeling good about"" the movie when walking out. Which is why, of course and surely, you will guess the fate of the pre-cogs to begin with. In combining the two elements above, one will immediately realise that a third principle emerges: the victim of a child murder can never be ""bad"" in such a movie. That's why it is so blantantly obvious that Tom Cruise's character as well as that character's wife end up on the ""good"" side in the end of the movie. This, again, leaves only one interesting suspect. In other words: the basic assumptions, the world view, this movie builds upon, are gridlocked against each other in a way that the script itself can compile only to one possible solution: the one we get to see. While the basic counter argument to this pre-crime-scheme apparently is the killer sentence ""You still have a choice"", the movie itself does not follow that form. The script of this movie is gridlocked by basic assumptions that leave the viewer with nothing to hope or worry about after learning the basic setup of the story. The one thing that varies with Spielberg movies, that use a very limited and small set of ""assumptions"" that - logically - will lead every viewer to the right conclusion very early in any of his movies - is maybe the core target audience. In Minority Report, the target audience is probably everybody who works in hierarchies whose members may have hidden agendas. Have you been set up by your boss? What is your motivation for your job? etc. This is another one of a whole sequence of ""movies according to the world of Spielberg"", and there is nothing wrong with it. As such, it is not possible to compare this movie to anything else - because Spielberg movies simply don't compete. One may add that the effects of this movie are nice."

(SPOILERS are possible). Many people think it is quite stereotyped one, with unnecessary extension and unsuitable happy-end. In my opinion, the story is not that simple. There is a minority report on 'Minority Report'.<br/><br/>The plot has many unexpected turns in the first part of the movie. That part could have been a quite good film by itself. (And it could have had two alternative emotionally strong endings). The scene of jailing does not disrupt the continuity of the plot. Yet, as the story develops, one can feel something is different. Obstacles are overcome easier. The psychological aspects of the events are not analysed in such depth as before. Finally, one can see that the end is not simply good  it is illogically good. But was not all done this way intentionally? It is very easy to see a typical thing if one expects to see it. But if one tried and recalled the scene from which everything went to that end, one could hear a short phrase allowing completely different interpretation. Do we need a character to walk through a looking glass or to disappear after putting on some queer ring to understand that story switches from one reality to another? There could easily have been such a turn in 'Minority Report', but the evidence is not absolutely compelling. There is a bifurcation point with two equally probable paths leading from it. That is exactly the thing I like about this movie best. It analyses problems, but it does not provide made-up answers. It leaves one in the state of indeterminacy  the wisest way to end a story questioning the significance of fate and free will."

To John, the system is perfect, until the next killer is him. Completely unpredictable and surprising until the very end, this is a high quality movie that fortunately doesn't rely on the designs or its renowned two stars - actor and director - to be successful.

The result is nothing short of spectacular - exciting, visionary and gripping, this is Steven Spielberg at its best, which proves that age isn't affecting his talent a bit.

It has all the elements of a usual thriller : The suspicious looking guy whom the audience suspects from the first frame, the harmless man turning out to be not so harmless, exciting special effects and some futuristic gadgets including eye scanners and back pack jets. The movie could have been a great sci-fi if it did not suddenly become a framed-hero-on-the-run movie. Tom Cruise still looks like the Mission Impossible agent. I would give it not more than a 5/10."

","Entertaining and full of fascinating special effects, but what does it leave you with in the end? Not much. It goes down like a glass of water.<br/><br/>I've read a couple of Dick's novels, and I couldn't say they were thrillers. Science-fiction novels with thought-provoking implications, which made them interesting. In this film, this side is completely neglected, drowned in an orgy of special effects.<br/><br/>Ridley Scott took one of Dick's novels and created a masterpiece: tense, visionary, fascinating, full of interesting, multi-faceted characters. Spielberg's is just a classic Hollywood movie: lots of effects, lots of adrenaline, lots of action, but characters are extremely dull, and almost every turn of the plot can be easily anticipated.<br/><br/>Spielberg isn't very good at exploring characters and implications of a story, and Cruise is the right actor for a movie like this: a good professional, but also good for shallow characters only.

","This action/sci-fi/thriller/mystery etc. movie does very well in some of its genre, but not too great as other. It is an excellent futuristic fantasy, describing the life we may have when as senior citizens. The action and special visual affects are also terrific. The pace is just right. But, the main problem here is the story. The thriller/mystery part of this film is very weak, and too much can be anticipated well in advance. There are a couple of huge holes in the plot, not to be mentioned, since I don't want to be a spoiler. The ending is a real let down. The paranoia twist is also played in this film. It is a successful twist in this movie, but maybe someone should tell those people in Hollywood that it is getting very worn. Or maybe I am just missing what the public really want to see. My last comment on this film may sound a little bit ""where are our family/moral values"", but that is not my point. I will try to prevent spoiling, but if you haven't seen the film, and want to play it on the safe side, stop reading here. Throughout the film, and of course through the trailers to it, it tries to be a suspense/action film. It is not a ""gruesome serial killer on the loose, psychotic maniac being chased down by detectives"" movie. Many people hate such films and avoid them. But, at one point in this film, for an unexplained reason, which does not serve the plot in any way, Tom Cruise confronts a killer, who starts describing in too much graphic detail, how he murdered a young boy. From this point on, my girlfriend couldn't stop thinking about it, and this ruined the film for her. She ended up hating it. I can't understand why this scene was included in an otherwise relatively clean film."

","As with several of Steven Spielberg's more recent films, I find myself frustrated by Minority Report. There are many brilliant ideas, images and sequences within the first two hours, but much of that is thrown away by having the climax dissolve into thriller ending Type B.<br/><br/>Plot-wise Minority Report could be best described as a paranoid science fiction cross between The Fugitive and Mission Impossible. Set in the Washington of 2054, murders have been eradicated by the experimental Precrime division. Detective John Anderton (an excellent Tom Cruise) heads this taskforce, catching would-be murderers from evidence provided by the Precogs - they see the crimes before they happen. The system is perfect. But what happens when Anderton is charged with murdering someone he doesn't even know, in 36 hours time? As the poster tag-lines say: everybody runs. Hunted by the ambitious Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell), Anderton can only rely on his mentor (Max Von Sydow) for help, as he desperately tries to prove that the infallible Precrime system can be wrong.<br/><br/>Until the present catches up with the future, the film is extremely engaging. Spielberg once again proves that he is the master of both set-up and set pieces. He creates a believably neurotic future where technology has advanced in a natural way. Anderton's plight is convincingly constructed, whilst his flight is almost unbearably tense. The ""jetpack"", ""eye"" and ""spider"" sequences are excellent examples of this and, in terms of suspense, are comparable with anything on offer at the moment.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, after the pivotal scene where Anderton meets his predicted victim, the film falls apart. In place of startling originality we have a stultifyingly predictable ending that has been lifted directly from other films. The villain's unveiling is almost identical to that of LA Confidential's, and two climactic scenes are disturbingly similar to those of The Fugitive and Mission Impossible. Whilst it's sad that most of the few scenes that don't involve special effects are the film's weakest, this revelation might not be entirely surprising. Essentially Minority Report is the kind of chase movie that we've seen over and over again. Indeed, if it weren't for the climax, this wouldn't be a criticism - most stories are evolutions of all that's gone before. With the starkly blue look, draining colour from the screen, and an effective new spin on an old story, the disguise almost works.<br/><br/>Do not doubt that Minority Report is very enjoyable. As a suspense thriller, it may well be the best of the year. But as dark science fiction, in the vein of Blade Runner, it misses the mark."

","There is probably no busier filmmaker this year than Steven Spielberg.  With ""Minority Report"", the upcoming ""Catch Me If You Can"", and all of his responsibilities at Dreamworks, I'd be surprised if he gets any sleep.  He is also one of the filmmakers I have worried about most.  He has created some of Hollywood's most beloved films, but recently he has started to go on a downward slope.  His trademark Spielberg Shmaltz has been around forever, but these days it has started to take over his films.  In his shaky failure ""A.I""., many mistook his sappiness for emotional complexity; maybe they were just hungry for something resembling a real science fiction film.  His latest film, ""Minority Report"", has just brought this disappointing streak to a screeching halt.  It catapults Steven Spielberg back to the forefront of the multi-million dollar blockbuster directors.<br/><br/>Based on Phillip K. Dick's famous short story, ""Minority Report"" tells the story of Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise).  He is part of a special police force (""Precrime"") that is able to stop murders before they happen. They do this by looking into the psychic visions of three genetically deformed beings nicknamed ""Precogs"", the strongest of which being the only female, Agatha (Samantha Morton).  While an FBI agent (Danny Witwer, played by Colin Farrell) is investigating Pre-Crime, which director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) has great plans for, Anderton notices something stunning. The Precogs have just determined that he would commit murder.<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" is Spielberg's most assuredly entertaining film since his ""Indiana Jones"" series.  Obviously, something Spielberg has not forgotten is to make the most of the chase.  When other filmmakers seem to have seen too many Road Runner cartoons, Spielberg always comes up with a way to mix it up a bit.  In this film, he has devised one of the most exhilarating chase sequences since... well, ever.  The stakes are never quite high enough for Spielberg without adding one little twist; I'm sure the only reason there was a boulder in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" was so that Harrison Ford could run away from it, and it's very likely that the only reason cars climb buildings in ""Minority Report""'s future is so Tom Cruise can leap between them.  The whole thing blends together so seamlessly, and the camera (lead by cinematographer Janusz Kaminski) puts us so exuberantly into the middle of it all that we don't care what Spielberg throws in there just for fun. <br/><br/>
That isn't all ""Minority Report"" has to offer (if it was, would it really deserve such high praise?)  ""Minority Report"" does more than offer its ideas, it dives head on into them.  The way John Anderton gets to where he does, by way of a prevision from the Precogs, sets up a predicament not unlike that in Shakespeare's ""Macbeth"".  It creates a Mobius strip worth poring over.  Numerous questions come to mind, such as how much was needed to get that chain of events to spark; how much does it take to drive someone to an extreme?<br/><br/>Possibly the most intriguing of all the questions ""Minority Report"" brings up is that which philosophers have been debating about and tearing their hair out over for decades: does anyone have free will, or are all events predestined to happen?  This film offers fuel for both sides of the argument, but always counterbalances one piece of evidence with the next. It is this ambiguity that made ""Memento"" so much fun, after seeing this film you will have much to debate about with those you have seen it with.<br/><br/>If one could label ""Minority Report"" as something of a tragedy, that element would be found in the female Precog, Agatha.  Yes, there is a brief conversation over what ethics there are in idealizing three people so much, but that is not the issue that matters.  Its chilling to see that no one who works within the Precrime system realizes the absolute unethical, whoring nature of keeping the Precogs confined as they are.  Once the film starts to view the situation through Agatha's eyes, the film changes in its entirety. Samantha Morton plays Agatha so brilliantly that we can completely understand her position.  We see what happens when everything is taken away from someone who is then forced to take it back.  We see what is really wrong with the Precrime system and the cruelty that lay within it.<br/><br/>Not to be put aside is the look of the film.  Spielberg's main mistake with ""A.I."" was making that future much too pretty.  Instead of being able to see where we were headed, the film felt distant, as if we were watching a fantasy instead of a science fiction.  With ""Minority Report"", Spielberg gathered a group of ""futurists"" to brainstorm just what Washington, D.C. might look like sometime in the not-so-distant future, and the result is incredibly believable.  I shall most likely live until 2054, and when that time comes, I would like to revisit this film and see just how accurate it was.<br/><br/>If you really need me to categorize, I would say that ""Minority Report"" is Steven Spielberg's best film since ""Schindler's List"".  I would also say that this film is the best blockbuster of the summer, and may well end up being one of the very best films of the entire year.  Right now, however, I will just say this: see the damn film, it'll be worth even the ridiculous amount one has to pay for movie tickets these days."

","Steven Spielberg has once again crafted a masterpiece (with the exception of A.I. - let us just put that behind us). Tom Cruise has stunned viewers by acting in such movies as `Jerry Maguire' and `A Few Good Men', and `Minority Report' has certainly been added to that extensive list. Cruise plays a detective named John Anderton who works in the Pre-Crimes Division in the year 2054. With the combined use of astounding technology and 3 precogs (aptly named people who have been gifted with precognitive abilities), the government is able to predict murders in advance, and stop them from taking place. Cruise plays the chief of the Pre-Crimes Division based in Washington D.C. when he becomes targeted for a murder he has not committed.yet. The movie continues and at first I thought it would be one of those cliched movies where an innocent man runs from the law - but as the film progressed, I began to see that nothing was at it seems. The acting by the main characters was commendable, but the extras did not add to the veracity of the situation. The technology was plausible for half a century in the future (except for maybe the use of cars that drive up the sides of buildings) and the advertising (although very annoying at times) added to the reality. All round a great movie that is not predictable and very suspenseful."

","This derivative, clichÃ©d and by-the-numbers film is one of Spielberg's worst and does Cruise no favors either. It's a messy, trite conglomeration of other films like ""Logan's Run"", ""Total Recall"" and ""Twelve Monkeys"" all spiced up with flashy camera work and expensive effects. The film gets off to a ripsnorting and arresting start and then goes completely down hill from there. An interesting premise is gobbled up by terrible scripting and self-congratulating visual ideas. Cruise is unintentionally hilarious when he's flicking and flinging his hands around at the viewscreen. That was a terrible, campy touch that will no doubt delight young boys in the audience as it so supposedly ""cool"". There is zero.......ZERO suspense about who the villain will be.....none. Cruise is so-so. His character is often rather stupid, but he does manage to infuse some feeling into the part. Almost every member of the supporting cast overacts and hams it up to the point of hilarity or annoyance or both. The prison monitor is the worst, but others are nearly as bad. Smith, a fine actress, tries to inject irony and class to her role, but it's hopeless. The most annoying thing about this film which is jam-packed with annoyances is the fact that all the men chew gum incessantly. It's obnoxious and distracting. Farrell is really the only one who comes out of it unscathed and Morton is also very intense in a difficult role. She does a good job, but is not exactly a treat to watch. Cruise's wife is an okay actress, but doesn't pair well with him at all. One of the set pieces, an ""invasion"" of a tenement house by mechanical ""spiders"" has some interest and tension, but is partially spoiled by all the ham acting of the extras and the over the top situations. One is on the toilet, two are screwing, two are violently arguing......doesn't anyone watch TV in their apartment or just cook or read??? Everything was overdone and unrealistic. A few clever moments and some gripping visuals, but a lousy script, bad direction and campy performances sink it."
"Matthew Chong","8","0","0","6 September 2002"," Movie Magic Masterclass
","The movie is a masterclass of how stupid improbable ideas can be designed to look great and realistic (`pre-crime' psychic-palm reader bollix, retina-activated ads wasting ad budgets on a passing guy instead of the crowd around him, updatable newspapers that have to be held up with both hands like old newspapers taking up two seatwidths, doing tiring aerobics/music conducting just to open an Email, telling everyone in the room your password just to utilise voice-activation tech, `skyway-hiways' driving skyscraper residents mad, etc) - give me a break. sexy looking though.  Unlike most sci-fi movies, this one has been hyped for its tapping of the ideas of futurists and product designers, who unfortunately are usually more concerned with how fantastic their own visions in their own fields are than whether these are possible in the greater future reality. Hence, one has to take issue with this aspect for MR more than the out-and-out fantasies that are Star Wars, Superman or Pretty Woman.<br/><br/>Unlike the beautiful snooze-fest A.I. (.also my exclamation after enduring to the end of that film), MR is a proper effects masterpiece with the classiness no George Lucas directed show can come close to.  Cruise is a De Niro of action stars, his very presence in a scene oozing charisma, be it as a part of an emsemble, an action sequence or a wordless close up.  SS is der ubermann of Movie Magic.

","Again, Steven Spielberg proves that he is one of the most important directors that work these days. This time he enters, again, to the futuristic field of the science fiction. In this film, he deals with the problematic subject of invading and terminating a person's life, based only on the prophecy of 3 pre-cogs (as they are called in the film) who, ironically named after 3 famous writers of detective stories. These pre-cogs can see a murder before it is commited. So that means, based on probability. But the main story of this film is the guilt that motivates and tears apart the hero, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) commander of the special pre-crime unit, that lost his only boy when they were spending time at the swimming pool. This desperation motivates him, when one day the prophecy shows that he himself is going to commit a murder.<br/><br/>The film is rich with amazing special effects, that make you wish you are John Anderton, controlling the image film with the movements of your hands only.<br/><br/>I love the work of Steven Spielberg.

In other words, the SciFi Channel may be as instructive as the History Channel!<br/><br/>Is 'Minority Report' a good movie? I think the answer is yes, but it is not a great one. I think Spielberg is probably the greatest director alive, but I did not like AI. 'Minority Report' is better, it deals with big universal subjects - the right to privacy, and the fact one is innocent before it's proved he is guilty. The fluency of action is back, but so is the mixed choice of actors. I personally do not like Tom Cruise, but Max von Sydow was fascinating! Some of the futuristic gags are nice, but we have seen too many 21st century dark cities already to be really impressed.<br/><br/>I think that what happened with other films of Spielberg will happen with this one also.

","Spielberg's sci-fi film noir about a police officer (Tom Cruise) in the pre-crime division, a division of law enforcement that predicts who's going to commit a murder, is entertaining and thought provoking.  While it has the darkness and plot twists of a 1940s film-noir, it also falls into many of the genre's cliches, not to mention the fact that a happy ending manages to destroy much of the power of being a film-noir.  Still, the movie excels despite these limitations, and while short of being a masterpiece, it is a solid effort."
"taikman","7","0","0","2 September 2002"," Does not live up to its potential to be a great movie, but still very good.
","'Minority Report' should have been one of the year's best movies. It is directed by Steven Spielberg who, despite his gooey moments, is a great director. It stars Tom Cruise, who, regardless of what you think of him as a person, is a charismatic and talented actor (if you doubt me, go and see 'Magnolia'). It is based on a short story by Philip K. Dick, the warped and brilliant mind responsible for the ideas behind 'Total Recall' and 'Blade Runner'. And the photography and special effects are superb.<br/><br/>
It is the year 2054 and murder has been wiped out in Washington D.C., due to the Department of Pre-Crime, which uses the psychic powers of three pre-cognitives (Agatha, Dashiell and Arthur, presumably named after the famous mystery writers Agatha Christie, Dashiell Hammett and Arthur Conan Doyle, which is a nice touch) to prevent slayings before they happen. Cruise plays the leader of the Pre-Crime unit, a skilled cop who lost his son 6 years earlier and now uses drugs to try and dull the grief. One day he is monitoring the visions the pre-cogs have when he sees himself commit murder and is forced to go on the run from his own unit. As he tries to discover who set him up, he realises that what he needs is in the mind of Agatha, who may have had a conflicting vision of the murder.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is excellent, with several tense and exhilarating action scenes and a some creepy moments, particularly involving a genetically-engineered garden and eyeballs. What is most impressive though is the technology of Spielberg's future world. Like most good science fiction movies, the technology seems both amazing and believable. I particularly liked the transparent viewing screens which Cruise could manipulate with cybernetic gloves, the chamber of cryogenically frozen criminals and the spiderlike, retina-scanning robots. The cast is solid, with a quietly haunting performance by Samantha Morton as Agatha.<br/><br/>
However in the second half the movie goes a bit flat, becoming too like a routine murder-mystery. I was not moved by the way the relationship between Cruise and his son was shown and the villain did not impress me. Besides the obvious mind-bending paradoxes about changing the future, there are also number of questions that the movie asked but did not answer. Why are there no ethical storms about the way the pre-cogs are used? If the surgeon hated Cruise, why wasn't he less helpful? Shouldn't clothing fashions be different after 50 years? What exactly happened to Cruise's son? They are not large things, but together they add up. 'Minority Report' is very good, but it does not become the great movie it promises to be.<br/><br/>

","So, the third of the four must-sees this summer movie season is out (Spider-Man, Attack of the Clones, this, Men In Black II) and I saw it last night.  With all the buzz about this flick being Steven Speilberg's best movie since Raiders of the Lost Ark, I felt as if I should've been standing in line on opening night.  I mean, that's pretty tall talk to be better than Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List.  Truth be told, I was almost willing to pay the $7.50 just to see the Daredevil and Red Dragon trailers. As for the main feature, the verdict is good.  Yes, I said `good.'  Well, I'll even go so far as to say `pretty darn good,' but certainly not `Speilberg's best since 'Raiders'.'  Just `pretty darn good.'<br/><br/>
The premise is by now well known: Washington, D.C. in the year 2054 has an experimental program in which murders are foreseen by mutated precognitives and potential perpetrators are arrested before their crime can be committed. The constitutional arguments are also pretty well known by now, but I don't have any intention of getting into a monologue about that, as the issue is covered in the movie and it's the movie I'm here to discuss.  Tom Cruise's policeman John Anderton is the chief of the `Precrime' department of the D.C. Police, and has a zeal for the program stemming from the disappearance of his 6-year old son in the days before the Precrime program.  When a representative of the Justice Dept. arrives to try to poke holes in the program's premise before the it's instituted nationally, Anderton is told by his boss, played by Max Von Sydow, to accommodate him.  The next thing we know, the `precogs' foresee Anderton committing a murder in less then three days' time, and the chase is on . . .<br/><br/>Cruise once again displays his mastery of the `cold' acting method.  As he did to perfection in `Jerry Maguire' and `Born on the Fourth of July' (but for some strange reason abandoned in `Vanilla Sky'), he relates his character's anguish, anxiety, terror, etc., through subtle stares, sparse dialogue and body language.  No ranting and raving, no overly preachy stretches of dialogue; just a look in the right place here and a sentence under the breath there, and the audience gets the idea.  Staring at and speaking in unison with home-movie holograms and hobbling about his home strung out on inhaled illegal drugs, Anderton displays to us his personal misery, then returns to dedicated professionalism at the station-house the next day.  He does a fine job of carrying this movie.  Colin Farrell (who will play Bullseye in Daredevil next year) does a great job as the Justice Dept. errand-boy, playing him with just the right amount of swarminess (is that a word?) and intelligence.  Von Sydow's performance is terrific as well, and his role here continues the summer's theme of taking `senior' movie veterans and making wonderful use of them (Cliff Robertson in Spider-Man, Christopher Lee in Attack of the Clones).<br/><br/>The visuals here are terrific.  The vision of Washington, D.C. 52 years from now is more believable than Blade Runner's prediction for Los Angeles of 2016.  The architecture and technology are not so omnipresent in the Capitol that we don't see life as we might would lead it.  With the exception of the superhighways, the technology depicted in the movie is a garnish to life at that time.  The bluish tint that Spielberg gives the film casts an almost sterile hue to the world we see there, such that blood, when spilled, is all the more garish to see.  I thought it was an interesting touch.  The sick-sticks and retina-scanning spider-robot bloodhounds used by law enforcement of the day were absolutely creepy.  The personalized advertisements and greetings depicted here instantly made me think of the crap accumulating in my e-mail box every day (lasmoak, give your lover a larger . . . or lasmoak, mortgage rates are now . . .), and this hitting-me-close-to-home gave a lot of other things in the movie credibility.  This movie shows us a world where fantasies can be lived out in a chamber is a lot closer than the holodecks of Star Trek.<br/><br/>Okay, the story.  It's good.  Yes, I even said it was pretty good.  This film isn't a big-budget, slam-bang modern American Action Movie, and with good reason:  It isn't supposed to be.  It is big-budget, don't get me wrong, and it's all on the screen.  The visuals and the effects are terrific, and they enhance, not overpower, the plot.  This movie is a lot more cerebral than I expected, and that's always a welcome surprise in today's movies.  I confess that I wasn't prepared for the film-noir pace of the movie, as hearing all this comparison to `Raiders' had me set for a trill-a-minute-type spectacle.  Well, it ain't that, but it's good nonetheless.  Yes, the movie's 2 hours and 20 minutes, but I promise you that it doesn't feel like it.  Speilberg once again tells us a marvelous story, this one being expanded from a short story by Philip K. Dick, the author behind the works inspiring Blade Runner and Total Recall.  The clues unfold, the suspects sometimes surprise us and the confrontation at the end is not one easily predicted, despite it having been foreseen by the precogs (figure that one out for yourself).<br/><br/>This is one to see, and while it ain't Raiders, it sure as heck beats Scooby-Doo."

","My expectation level was high before this one - but all I can say is what on earth was all the fuss about?  It's okay - has some interesting scenes/ ideas.  But yet again it was let down by a poor script and some gigantic logic flaws that I just can't suspend my disbelief for.<br/><br/>It's funny how Ill glibly accept that it is possible to see into the future, but - as a for instance - when Cruise returns to the police HQ and walses in through a back entrance one door away from the Precogs and use his 'old eyes' to fool the 'security' system - I nearly choked on my popcorn.   Since Cruise has already been marked as a pre-murderer at that stage, are we being asked to imagine that his 'access' records haven't been removed from the system?  Come on ?!!!  Are we idiots ?<br/><br/>And as a final straw we realise at the end of the movie (and yes SPOILER ALERT) that the baddy (who is guessable from reel minus several thousand....) could have simply lured his victim to somewhere outside the Precogs 'range' rather than rig up an extremely complicated scene just to fool them.  Unfortunately the entire motivation of the plot is based around this act/ stupidity so it is very hard not to get extremely browned off with this film.<br/><br/>As a final comment I thought that the movie lacked humanity.  THe treatment of the Precogs was hideous and immoral - but no one passed comment or even cared.  Even their attendant was clearly abusing them.  I found this very distasteful and completely unexplained.<br/><br/>Of course going Nationwide with just 3 precogs was always going to be interesting.  How exactly would they cope with the additional workload of the entire country ?  They were a one off experiment remember....<br/><br/>I will ask again.  Does anyone ever sit down and QA the logic in movies?  If anyone in the industry is listening - you guys need some major league help on the old plot logic thing.  I happily offer my services."

","Spielberg's latest opus is a tremendously energetic science fiction/suspense thriller set in the year 2053 that is extremely timely now given the current climate of fear and paranoia in our country.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is the head cop of a unique Washington D.C. law enforcement agency known as Pre-Crime.  The agency's purpose is to stop crimes before they have a chance to be committed, and there are three Pre-Cogs (pre-cognitive beings) that can see these crimes of the future.  Max von Sydow is the CEO of Pre-Crime who is anxious to take his creation to a national level, given that it has reduced the D.C. murder rate down to zero. But an ambitious assistant attorney general (Colin Farrell) has put a flaw into the system, and the Pre-Cogs envision a murder to be committed by Cruise himself.  Soon, Cruise is on the run, trying to prove his innocence but also needing to know how things are going to turn out.<br/><br/>Based on a 1956 short story by Phillip K. Dick, whose writings provided the basis for TOTAL RECALL and BLADE RUNNER, MINORITY REPORT, even at 135 minutes, is energetic, fast-paced, and hugely suspenseful.  Under Spielberg's usual top-notch direction, Cruise gives another fine performance as the hero of the piece; and Samantha Morton is equally fine as the Pre-Cog named Agatha, who assists him.  The visual effects work of Industrial Light & Magic is quite incredible, the look of the film is stunning, and John Williams contributes another innovative score of the same stripe he gave to A.I., Spielberg's previous and  unjustly maligned movie.<br/><br/>Combining the obvious science fiction futurism with elements of the crime and psychological thriller genres, MINORITY REPORT is a film that must be seen more than once for the viewer to absorb every little nuance, because there are many such nuances throughout this film.  The result is the finest film of the year 2002."

","What could you expect from Steven Spielberg besides an intelligent well-done film? ""Minoriy Report"" is just that. Plus, it has the intensity of Tom Cruise's performance. If you ask me, it's a good mix.<br/><br/>The story is not that convincing though. Crimes being stopped before they happen. Hmmm. I was not so fond to the idea of humans being able to predict when and how a murder was going to happen. When I heard of the movie I thought it was gonna be like an enormous organic computer to calculate probabilities, give results and never miss. Anyway, the point is: police has now a window for peeking into the future.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the top cop of this department who has unlimited faith in this system; he dedicates his whole life to it since he lost his son and wife. But his faith is torn apart when the system turns against him. And the running starts...<br/><br/>I think what I liked the most of ""Minority Report"" was Spielberg's vision of the future. It almost makes perfect sense (then again, except for the infamous pre-cogs): personalized advertising, eye scanners, 3D home videos, etc. Now THIS I call science fiction. I don't think I could have bared to see it under Paul Verhoeven's eye (originally, he was to direct the movie).<br/><br/>The whole look of the movie is fantastic. Unlike his 'compadre' George Lucas, Spielberg does not show off with visual effects in every frame of the movie. They are there alright, but he manages to blend the SFX with the background so nicely, your eyes take them as a whole. There's also that blurry look we saw in ""A.I."" that makes it feel like you're dreaming of it.<br/><br/>There's this one other thing: the ending. Is it just me or this ending is just as bad as ""A.I.""'s? I mean, in ""A.I."" they could just have put ""THE END"" when David finally reaches his Blue Fairy and close a very good movie. I feel the same happens here, but go see for yourself. Maybe it IS just me."

","Philip K Dick was one of the most thought provoking SF authors ever and films made from his stories have a good record, Bladerunner being an obvious example.<br/><br/>This is a slick film with huge product placement (did they realise how sinister the future they were to be placed in was?) and great production values.<br/><br/>However, it is also a great film with a twisted and enjoyable plotline about predestination and the nature of choice. Tom Cruise does a great job of mixing self doubt and some action sequences to show off his muscles. The special effects are great and in the background and you end the film wanting to watch it again.

","Reportedly, at some stage of its life, ""Minority Report"", based on a Philip K. Dick short story of the same name, was being developed by Paul Verhoeven as ""Total Recall 2"", which would connect the pre-cogs of ""Report"" with the psychic Martian mutants of ""Recall"".  Spielberg's is a better movie than that one would have been, but still fails to be quite as good as its potential.<br/><br/>It's 2054, and the notoriously lawless District of Columbia has become a tranquil place, largely through the efforts of the Precrime Division of the D.C. Metropolitan Police (which, to judge from the sleek Precrime HQ, got a major funding increase at some point).  The cops of Precrime, led by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise),  intervene in murders before they happen. They can do this courtesy of the pre-cogs, a trio of clairvoyant savants who spend their days sedated in a pool of nutri-muck, receiving images of future violent deaths, along with the names of the victims and perpetrators (the pre-cogs are named, in a cute but obvious touch, Arthur, Dashiell, and Agatha).  The cops analyze the images to determine where the killing will happen, then zip to the scene in a hovercraft that looks like a cross between Boba Fett's Slave-1 and a malevolent seashell, nabbing the killer before the victim's blood is shed.  The offender is then locked up (there's no trial; after all, the pre-cogs are never wrong) in a suspended-animation prison.<br/><br/>Precrime has been such a success that there is interest in expanding it nationwide (how they will do this with only three pre-cogs is never clear), and Anderton and his mentor (Max Von Sydow) are visited by an unctuous federal agent (a creepy but charismatic Colin Farrell) who is examining the Precrime program for flaws that might compromise public trust.  And soon, Anderton has serious problems of his own: the pre-cogs finger him, for the murder of a man he has never met.  He makes a run for it, trying to dodge his colleagues and find out what's going on.  Someone has set him up and he doesn't know why, but it may have to do with an old Precrime case that keeps turning up like a bad penny.<br/><br/>Visually, the movie is stunning. Spielberg fills his future world with fascinating stuff, alternately awe-inspiring and unsettling: roads are choked with aerodynamic cars that drive up the sides of buildings. Passive retinal scanners in public places identify you as you walk by, generating slick commercials that call out to you by name (public ID checkers and their effects on fugitives also cropped up in last spring's ""Impostor"", itself based on a Dick story), while a shopping center's walls teem with ghostly animated ads.  In another memorable sequence, the residents of a government housing block stop whatever they are doing to submit to the attentions of ""spiders"", tiny self-guiding retinal scanners on spindly legs, which almost become characters in their own right (one, for instance, seems to be a bit smarter than the others).<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Spielberg is unable to contain his puckishness, and the action scenes are staged with a liberal dose of slapstick humor.  It's nice that Spielberg doesn't take himself too seriously (there was a whiff of that in ""A.I."") but it doesn't fit with the solemn tone of the proceedings. It's as if Tom Hanks had, in the midst of ""Saving Private Ryan"", pulled out a bullwhip and hitched a ride on a Wehrmacht truck.  ""Minority Report"" raises a lot of heavy Orwellian questions, but it's far more eager to play than think.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is probably the only Hollywood leading man to get this far in his career without ever playing a cop.  It's sort of strange: with his clean-cut, chiseled features and clipped line deliveries, he's a natural for it.  He plays Anderton with believable, brisk competence, and he looks appropriately like the Brave Man of the Shiny New Future, but we don't really get from Cruise the inner turmoil that others describe in Anderton. When he has a moment of unhinged emotion, we sort of wonder where it came from.  It would have been interesting to see what someone like Ed Harris would have done with this role.<br/><br/>Anderton grabs a pre-cog (the female, natch) to help him find the truth. Samantha Morton's Agatha is a haunting and delicate presence as that sci-fi staple, the innocent with great power (the religious overtones of the pre-cogs are hinted at repeatedly, especially in the funny reaction of a sleazy virtual-memory dealer upon meeting Agatha).  When Morton gives voice to her visions, and pleads fruitlessly not to see them fulfilled, we have the sense of someone with an awesome and terrible gift.  Still, I think it's safe to say that Sinead O'Connor has pretty much killed the buzz-cut look for women.<br/><br/>Other bright spots in the cast: Tim Blake Nelson has a quirky turn as Gideon, the warden and sole staff member of the coma-prison (itself an oddly beautiful Kubrickian creation).  And the always welcome Lois Smith scores as the reclusive doctor responsible for the pre-cogs, though her scene degenerates into pointless weirdness.<br/><br/>The story is well-paced and interestingly twisty, but it sacrifices more and more credibility as it goes.  ""Minority Report"" is almost, but not quite, good enough to coast smoothly over its logical potholes.  It's smart, but not quite as smart as it pretends.  Philosophically, it sets up an extreme position and then argues against it.  Sure, locking people up without trial for things they haven't actually done (yet) is a Bad Thing, but the movie inadvertently sabotages its point with a montage of living, breathing victims who would otherwise have been raped, shot, and slaughtered.  It's shown in passing, but it sticks with you.<br/><br/>The movie's good, but it's good when it could have been phenomenal, and that's bad."

","""Minority Report"" is acclaimed director Steven Spielberg's first foray into the thriller genre, although he has tackled many of the themes and characters of ""Minority Report"" in other films.  ""Minority Report"", largely due to its nihilistically futuristic setting, does not feel like a Spielberg movie and it seems to have the influence of other distinguished film-makers, as diverse as Ridley Scott and Alfred Hitchcock.<br/><br/>The premise alone is enough to sell the movie:  What if crime could be predicted and stopped before it happened?  <br/><br/>The plot, set around 50 years into the future, focusses on Pre-Crime detective John Anderton, a hard-working policeman whose job it is to stop criminals, specifically murderers, before they commit crime.  He does this through the aid of the Pre-Cogs, zombie-like prophets whose only function lies in the detecting and predicting of crime.<br/><br/>But Anderton is thrown into a perilous situation when the Pre-Cogs reveal HE will commit a murder in the near future, prompting him to go the run from the corrupt establishment he serves.<br/><br/>The plot serves up more than its fair share of surprises (characters whom the audience believe to be villains turn not to be so bad after all, and vice versa), also allowing for some background depth and development to its characters.  The finale is perfect, yet totally unexpected.<br/><br/>Cruise handles the chief role with grace and style, carefully etching his characters frequently frantic emotional states.  So often dismissed by some as a Hollywood pretty boy, under Spielberg's direction he gives one of the best performances of his career.<br/><br/>He is given excellent support by Max Von Sydow as his untrustworthy boss, British actress Samantha Morton shines as liberated Pre-Cog Agatha and character actor Peter Stormare is on good form as a dangerous, creepy eye-surgeon.<br/><br/>Action has always been Spielberg speciality and here he forgoes the disturbing realism of ""Saving Private Ryan"" in favour of some exciting, funny and brilliantly preposterous fantasy action scenes.  He is given some good support in this with some fine camerawork and special effects.  These are put to their most effective use when they show how advertising has become more intrusive as adverts frequently recognise and address people by name, with some interesting consequences.<br/><br/>Spielberg keeps the tension cranked up admirably, but also allows for some softer moments, such as when Agatha explains to John and his wife what their late son's life would have been like had he lived and the quiet, sentimental ending, the only reminder that the film is a Spielberg movie.<br/><br/>Another splendid masterpiece from a master film-maker, who has again come up with another great story that demonstrates both the humanity and horror in the human spirit."

","First, I must say I disagree with the previous posting. Minority Report should have been one of the year's best films. As I was watching it I thought it was one of the best Scifi movies I had seen in a while and then Spielberg lost his touch. I agree that the movie rises some deep moral questions, as most of Phillip Dick's stories, that is one of the wonderful things in this gender and a point dutiful achieved by Spielberg in A.I. But Minority Report is not only a SciFi film but also a thriller, and it is as that that the film runs into faults that go beyond celuloid redemption (if I am allowed the such metaphor). SPOILER ALERT ---the following points will give away important points of the story, beware readers that haven't seen it. As I was saying, the film is a thriller and it suddenly runs into big holes: 1. Why does the PRECRIME police arrest Tom Cruise's character after he allegedly murdered the FBI guy? Wouldn't that be a job for the regular police? 2. Spielberg uses the worst cliche resource to solve the mistery. The killer gives himself away with the old loudmouth trick: he says too much to the wrong person. Its been seen in a thousand movies before (many of them TV of the week flicks) and it's a cheap scene in the context of the movie. 3. Afther it the old recorder in the pocket trick is much worst. 4. The ending also is not consistent. If the precogs predicted the crime it should have happened: they never missed until then. 5. This future society must have been advanced in advertising, prepolice, marketing and traffic design. But they lacked the most simple police techniques. In the murder of the FBI agent the killer uses a gun (Tom Cruise's) that was in the Police's custody since the first guy is shot by Cruise. It would be impossible for the Cruise character to use that same gun to kill somebody else. Summing up, there are many other little missed points in the film. I don't know what was a genius like Spielberg thinking in this ending. It felt as some of those alternate endings you find in DVD-extras gladly because you know they were left on the editing-room floor."

","Well I gave in to seeing this movie in the theater. I ignored the umpteen billion trailers I saw for it, and definately ignored the hype of it being a Cruise/Speilberg collaberation. Why would I want to avoid Tom Cruise in an action film? Three words: Mission Impossible 2.<br/><br/>But after the movie came out, and I saw all the good critical reviews of the picture, I went to see it to cure my summer boredom, and I am glad I saw it in the theater. <br/><br/>The story is entertaining enough, in an exaggerated near future, a unit of people called Precrime have used psychics to predict and eliminate all crime in Washington D.C. (which already makes it fiction, nothing short of nuclear war could clean up D.C.). Cruise, of course is the head and star of the operation (just once couldn't he be a janitor in the big goverment operation?) until one of the ""Precogs"" (the psychics) envisions him murdering a person. The wild goose chase ensues.<br/><br/>All of the action was very entertaining, the gadgets and gizmos were fun to watch and the world that unfolded was visually pleasing. My complaint is the fight between Cruise and Colin Ferrell. There were too many camera changes, so many that I could hardly tell what was going on in the fight. Of course this is to be expected, no American director can direct a fight scene well (watch some Jackie Chan films Speilberg, it's really not that hard). The acting was very convincing I especially liked Samantha Morton's character. For some reason it reminded me of Milla Jovovich's role in The Fifth Element.<br/><br/>All in all I really recommend this film. I will say that it should have been rated R, especially for all the stuff with the detached eyeballs (you'll have to see it to get that). This is a very good film by Speilberg, I hope he continues to make films as good as this."

","Last night I went and saw Minority Report. Usually in Steven Speilberg films, Nazi storm troopers are the villains and are practically stick figures. Minority Report was a relief from Speilbergs tendency to over glamorize WWII. I find it unbelievable that I rank Minority Report equal to Truman Story and the In the Company of Men. Two of which are the greatest flicks out of America in the 1990's. Minority Report reminded me of the Restoration of Touch of Evil and a film noir update of The Fugitive. Minority Report harkens back to Hitchcock and even Tom Sellecks 1980's futuresque flick Run. When Tom Cruise was communicating with his late son via new technology, I saw fabric of Charlten Heston's Omega Man. Seeing technology become ubiquitious and human kind become subservient gives us a peek into Brave New World. If Minority Report was book written 50 years ago, it would rank as a classic.  I cringe everytime I see Hollywood promoting a WWII movie. What we need to do now is see more movies where new technology is the avenue for multinationals bringing in a dictatorship. We need to warn this generation that if you forget your past, you repeat it. Literature is a visual. Movies like Minority Report are the visual that will act as an admonishment against complacency and narcism that ensconses the western world. We need more movies like Minority Report to galvanize us and make us aware what politicians and multinationals are doing now. Good job, Steven!"

","This film addresses many profound issues on many different levels; more than just your average summer blockbuster film.<br/><br/>I found it to be very interesting in that it portrays the prophetic (""pre-cogs"" or pre-cognitives in the film) in their ability to dream reality being very much like what it is like unto in real life.  I personally believe that we already know what is going to happen; that the time essence forecast is in our DNA.  Just the mentally ill are more able to tap into that than others because of some faulty wiring that brings the ""visions"" to the forefront--often in their dreams.  It is no mystery that we only use 10% of our brains actively, at best.  If we were able to actively use the other 90%, predicting the future (which we currently measure with a measurement we call time, but is a measurement nonetheless for something we try to grasp) would be easy since we could bring this information to the forefront of our consciousness. Now the question is: if we could do this, would we still have free will/choice/agency?  That is a big question that the film tries and succeeds in answering (IMO).<br/><br/>Something interesting about this film:  Set in Washington DC, the murder capital of the world, with approx. 180 murders per 100,000 people, due mostly to the reason that gun ownership there is illegal (except, paradoxically, for politicians, celebrities, cops, the gov't, military, etc., ones who champion gun control the most and also control the public most).  This sets the stage for invoking a crime-prevention idea of stopping the crime before it happens, thus stopping the crime [!]<br/><br/>The most powerful message that runs through to the core of the film is that the harder you try to control something, the less you will be able to do just that. (There are many other smaller threads that run through also, but this is definitely the most potent one, and the many issues covered could probably fill a volume.)<br/><br/>Lastly, this film has tons of special effects and action.  It really is something to watch.  Kind of like a cross between Tron and The Fifth Element.  But this film is very violent, so leave the kids at home, it will probably give them nightmares.  Five years ago this film would be rated R (just for its adult content alone), not PG-13.  Not to say that it is bad, just very violent.  I would give this movie 10 stars instead of 9 out of 10 normally, except I don't think it has much of a resolution.  Or maybe that is what makes it good--that it leaves you uneasy with no real answers, and definitely makes you think."

","Which is a better film, ""Minority Report"" or ""Blade Runner?""  I believe that ""Minority Report,""is  why, because of the plot. ""Blade Runner"" focused more on 3D effects than on the human story. What I love about ""Blade Runner"" is the vision of the future and the settings that were both dark and somber. ""Minority Report"" is also a dark and yet beautiful film. But I have to give credit to ""Metropolis""(1925), the first and best SCI-FI film ever.<br/><br/>""Blade Runner,"" ""Dark City,"" and ""The Fifth Element"" would have never been created without the inspiration of Fritz Lang's ""Metropolis.""<br/><br/>THE PLOT<br/><br/>In The Year 2054, a so-called ""pre-crime division"" is working busily around Washington, DC. It's purpose is to use the precog(native) potential of three genetically altered humans to prevent murders. Author, Dashielle, and Agatha (Samantha Morton), whose power is the strongest of the three. When the three precogs, who only work together, floating in what the police call the Temple, have a vision the names of the victim and the perpetrator as well as video imagery of the crime and the exact time  that it will happen, are given out to these special police who then try to prevent the crime from happening.<br/><br/>
Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, ""Minority Report"" is about a cop name John Anderton (Tom Cruise). John has the tables turned on him when he is accused of a future  murder, and he must investigate the circumstances of this murder and prevent it before it is too late.<br/><br/>*****SPOILERS AHEAD*****<br/><br/>The film examines the political and ethical  dilemma of arresting a person before the  crime is committed.  The project of pre-crime prevention is having it's first trial run, and the citizens of the city will vote on it in the next election. If  the people vote it in as law  the crime rate will drop drastically, but it is unknown whether innocent people might be imprisoned.<br/><br/>
When John's son was murdered he joined the precog division and worked tirelessly to catch and imprison all murderers. One day, his name arrives in the ""perpetrator"" chute. The precogs predict that he will kill a man he never knew in less than 36 hours. John flees the division, his own colleagues after him, to solve this situation as his trust in the system diminishes rapidly.  John follows a very small clue  that might hold the key to his innocence, a strange unsolved yet predicted murder and a so-called ""minority report"",  which is a documentation of one of the rare events when on of the  precogs sees something different than the other two.<br/><br/>THE DIRECTING<br/><br/>There's a scene that most directors call a two-face-shot but Samantha Morton and Tom Cruise are facing the opposite direction. The two actors chins lay on each other's shoulders, as if almost hugging each other. Then Spielberg takes the camera and places it on the right side of Tom body and captures the two face shot. Tom's face and Samantha's eye's and mouth portray  a very powerful scene. Another shot that I call the ""Taxi Driver"" shot is when Spielberg trails the camera on the roof of the peoples apartment, showing the spiders identifying the people. These days that scene would be digital but Spielberg never uses 3D unless he has too. Spielberg directs his films in a new yet classical way.<br/><br/>THE ACTORS<br/><br/>Samantha Morton's face conveys total fear and total authority. She received an Oscar nomination for her role as the mute girlfriend in Woody Allen's ""Sweet and Lowdown."" Tom Cruise didn't get nominated for his breakthrough performance in ""Vanilla Sky,"" shame on the Academy. Tom did receive a Golden Globe for ""Magnolia"" and 3 Academy Award nominations for the following films, ""Born on The Forth of July"", ""Jerry Maguire"" and ""Magnolia."" Collin Farrell delivers his best performance in this movie to date.<br/><br/>There is a mental love story portrayed  between Agatha and John. They've both been scarred deeply in the past and fate brings them together at this crucial time in John's life to solve this mystery. The film ends with Agatha sitting in a chair thinking about both her mother and John.<br/><br/>FAVORITE SCENE<br/><br/>My favorite scene is when Agatha helps John get away from the cops in the mall. This scene is like a puzzle coming together right before your eyes. She tells him to pick up an umbrella, then they pass a woman who recognizes him from police alerts and Agatha tells him that a man is carrying a briefcase  that has a magazine in it about him.<br/><br/>Finally she tell him to stop and wait for the man who is selling balloons in the mall and when he does, the balloons block them both from being seen by the police. When they exit the mall the reason she asked for an umbrella becomes clear. It is raining and when they raise their umbrella they are indistinguishable in a crowd of hundreds of people with umbrellas.<br/><br/>BEST ACTION SEQUENCE<br/><br/>The best action sequence is when John takes the police on a rollercoaster ride of evasion in the neighborhood.<br/><br/>SCENE WITH A MESSAGE The scene where John almost lost his eyes is a message that he is blind to his emotions and does not see the big picture. The scene is really funny and sick but it does convey this message.<br/><br/>In the end I find that Spielberg is still in his Kubrick stage. Spielberg ends the film with a happy ending, but the film is still very dark. I quote Steven from an interview  ""I have to tap into my dark side to truly create a dark film."" Believe me he has. I love this movie. Ridley Scott eat your heart out.<br/><br/>I haven't found any mistakes in this film and  I definitely recommend this film to movie goers everywhere. I give ""Minority Report"" a 15 out of 10.<br/><br/>NOTE: Some of my plot paragraph quotes were from the IMDB site."
"felix_ling","7","0","0","5 August 2002"," Visually stunning, but too predictable *** SPOILERS ***
","I'm not someone who spots plot twists very well, but I figured out who the culprit was a third of the way through the movie.<br/><br/>The effects are marvelous and blend pretty seamlessly with the rest of the film. And the film sports marvelous attention to detail in the creation of this future world. More importantly, the somewhat low-key way (well, compared to other sci-fi films anyway) in which they are presented make the futuristic details seem convincingly ordinary to its inhabitants to further the believability. The interface Anderton uses to manipulate the images is rather clunky (having to use sweeping arm motions for what today would simply be a short mouse movement), but makes for more dramatic visuals than a more realistic interface that simply needs, say, eye movements. Spielberg always opts for the more dramatic visual, as a movie director probably ought to in most situations.<br/><br/>As expected from Spielberg, it's well-paced and well-shot (I particularly liked how he shot the halo framing its intended target, which seemed rather Hitchcockian). The fighting sequences, while not up to ""Matrix"" or ""Crouching Tiger"" standards, are competently choregraphed and effectively shot. It stretched some credibility to have police officers taking huge telegraphed swings at each other, but I suppose it made for more dramatic visuals, as Spielberg is obviously fond of. Still, all the action sequences were incredible yet believable and exciting, and most importantly, clear (i.e. you can tell who is hitting whom), which is all I really ask for.<br/><br/>The acting all around is solid but unspectacular, taking second fiddle to the futuristic world Spielberg has painstakingly created. There are effective surprising and suspenseful moments earlier in the film, but as it settles into typical Hollywood formula, later moments are hardly surprising nor effective, including the ""climax.""<br/><br/>*** SPOILERS BELOW ***<br/><br/>(including SPOILERS for ""Brazil"" and ""L.A. Confidential"", somewhat) Okay, you've been warned!<br/><br/>Now as for the plot, it doesn't nearly live up to its early promise nor the potential. I won't even bother going into all the thorny issues that could have been explored but were completely glossed over. But the whole twist about Lamar Burgess and Danny Witwer felt lifted completely intact from the far superior ""L.A. Confidential."" And I think both sections of the the final climax has been done so many times in b-grade works that I wouldn't know where to start. It effectively destroys any suspense in the final scenes. I mean, does anybody actually expect Lamar to shoot Anderton at the end? The place for the dark ending would have been to leave Anderton incarcerated or do a twist at the very end, as I'll go into below. Given that he's rescued, and in fact has Lamar beaten regardless of whether he shoots or not (and indeed points this out for the audience as well), really then, what's the point of having Lamar even bother pointing a gun at him? There was no suspense in that scene whatsoever.<br/><br/>Of course, the ending is so ridiculously syrupy and implausibly sunny that I was seriously expecting a wicked Brazil-like twist at the end. After all, wouldn't it have made a much better film if it turns out all the happy developments after Cruise is incarcerated (his wife figuring out Lamar after his ridiculously sloppy giveaway, breaking him out, the precog transmission, etc.) turn out to be a dream he's experiencing from that halo device, while Lamar in the real world continues to take Pre-Crime national? If this is truly supposed to be a story warning us of the dangers of this, then it would actually be the much more fitting ending. As it is, it feels almost as tacked-on as the ""Blade Runner"" sunshine ending and doubly implausible.<br/><br/>So on the whole, an entertaining movie with too many predictable elements to break it from the pack of average thrillers. The only thing remarkable about it are the effects."

In SF, differently from space opera, special effects aren't strictly<br/><br/>needed, that's why Hollywood prefers space opera. In ""Minority Report"",<br/><br/>however, Spielberg took one ""hard"" SF story and rendered it to film.<br/><br/>The result was stunning. For about 2 hours, I completely forgot about<br/><br/>anything else. It's the kind of film that one would like to invite the<br/><br/>writer to discuss things over. The intrincacy of the whole story is<br/><br/>resumed at one pont where one character pushes a ball over a table and<br/><br/>another catches it. Anderton: ""Why did you catch it?"".

","Philip K. Dick's short story comes to a remarkable life in this extraordinary epic that Steven Spielberg just happened to direct. Being his second futuristic, sci-fi thriller in less than a year, `Minority Report' shattered most everyone's opinions, unlike last year's `A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.' Going places he couldn't go with `A.I.,' Spielberg really gives `Minority Report' it's own perfect setting, believably set in the year 2054. Everything seems to be more open, and useful, as in `A.I.' where it seemed most of the outside settings where bright lights when indoors.<br/><br/>`Minority Report,' as mentioned above, is set in an amazingly realistic Washington, D.C., fifty odd years in the future. One of the highest-ranked and well respected cops in the new Pre-Crime Police Force, John Anderton (Tom Cruise), gets a wakeup call when the pre-cogs, three select people who can see future murders, accuse Anderton of murder.<br/><br/>Running from authority, which seems to be the movie's main premise, Anderton runs into a collage of outlandish characters and places, including a mysterious man who removes peoples' eyes so they cannot be identified, and a loner caretaker in charge of all the current pre-crime prisoners. Without a doubt, the action scenes in the film are top-notch, never outdoing their selves in pride or length. Two of the scenes that stick out in my mind would have to be Anderton's pursuit among the highway, where he must jump from vehicle-to-vehicle to escape his capture and a scene in an apartment complex where a group of Police-controlled electronic spiders are sent to identify all living persons inside.<br/><br/>Professionalism aside (heh), this movie just kicks some major ass. From the moment you see him, you know Anderton is a hard-ass, and won't quit being one the whole movie. That's Tom for you, folks. Another actor who really caught my eye was Colin Farrell (Hart's War), who played an FBI rookie to inspect the whole Pre-Crime process. I've never seen anybody transform their voice as much as him, starting with a deep Irish accent smoothly going into a perfect American one.<br/><br/>The actors, the settings, the plot. Everything seems to be intact. And it is. `Minority Report' succeeds in keeping the audience thrilled, yet intrigued with the plot at the same time. Twist and turns seem to be two of the biggest ingredients in this thrill ride's list, enough to make the ending unpredictable to even the most intelligent of moviegoers. Even if you manage to see one or two bad reviews of `Minority Report,' don't let them fool you. Those people are probably still aching over their oddly terrible `A.I.' experiences."

","Steven Spielberg has been responsible for many masterpieces, and Minority Report is the latest. Tom Cruise gives one of his best performances as policeman John Anderton, a guy who has suffered great pain in life and works at the ""Precrime"" department, where future murders are predicted, causing the policemen led by Tom to hunt the soon-to-be criminal. But then he starts to have some problems. The system doesn't seem to work so well after all. Spielberg has created an amazing and very believable view of the future. The images are just incredible (cinematography is by Janusz Kaminsky, who worked with Spielberg on ""Saving Private Ryan""), special effects are perfect and fit perfectly in the story, and the cast is simply outstanding. As always, John Williams has made an excellent score, although this one is not as melodious as most of his music. The music accompanies the images perfectly, though. That's another characteristic of movies by Spielberg. It's hard to find another director that knows so well how to accomplish the perfect counterpoint between image and sound. Right in the beginning, there's a brilliant scene involving Tom Cruise working in the office, investigating a crime which is about to be committed as he listens to Schubert's ""Unfinished"" symphony. The combination of image and sound are perfect in this scene, and the effect is undescribable. You have to see it for yourself in order to understand what I mean.

","If we could see ourselves coming out from watching films like this, would we ever go to watch them in the first place? And what would happen to the film industry then?<br/><br/>There are interesting philosophical and moral paradoxes arising from using a prediction of the future to change that future, but given the average audience's intelligence and attention span, it was probably wise (if disappointing for some of us) of Spielberg to steer clear of them and instead present yet another rather tedious variation on the theme of ""the system's not the problem, the people running it are"". (Hollywood loves to do this comfort-food-for-the-soul stuff: if things aren't going your way, it's not tough, it's not because that's the way things are, it's because somebody out there doesn't like you and there *is* something you can do about it. (Well, usually; sometimes it tries its luck with ""the system is the problem, try to smash the system, oh dear you can't, that's tough"", as for example in ""Falling Down"" which worked so well you wonder why it doesn't try it more often.))<br/><br/>So once again we are led down the familiar twisty-turny route where the good guy is the bad guy only he's not really because he's trying to find the real bad guy and the bad guy isn't really bad he's just doing what the other bad guy told him to and the guy in the middle is just your average Joe with good and bad bits but then I suppose that's true too of the good guy and the bad guy... in the end your head spins at the casual unpredictability of just about anyone with any independence left in them. (Well, any *man*: the Madonna Syndrome is positively *flourishing* here. (No, not *that* Madonna!))<br/><br/>Fighting to keep on the path of Controlled Narrative Unravelment is that Everyman-wannabe Tom Cruise. Since we're in Philip K. Dick territory, the inevitable comparison with Harrison Ford in ""Blade Runner"" only serves to show how implausible Cruise is as the flawed cop fighting to solve the mystery of the apparently equally flawed system. He has neither the gravitas to carry the righteousness nor the rough edges to carry the imperfections (even with those slightly crooked teeth, which even as I write he's having straightened - more's the pity), whereas Ford had both in bucketloads. Cruise in ten years' time? That could be a different story.<br/><br/>So, an unoriginal plot (and one with more holes in than a pair of fishnet stockings) and a poorly chosen central cast member. Any redeeming features? The special effects are certainly impressive (and so they should be judging by the credits: screenful after screenful of hard-pressed behind-the-scenes mouse wranglers, with the not inconsiderable list of actors tacked on at the end): if you're fond of spiders, you'll love the sleek cuties here; if not, you may never feel safe in the bath again! As for messy organ transplants... yuk, 'nuff said. Meanwhile the prosthetics people had fun with a face mask that could have been a recycled reject from ""The Elephant Man"". Did they really mean to make Cruise turn briefly into a cross between Leonard Nimoy and Leonard Rossiter? I don't think so, but it gave me and my companion some light relief.<br/><br/>Neither as thought-provoking as ""A.I."" nor as much fun as ""Mission: Impossible"". I have seen the future, and it doesn't involve my watching this film again. 5/10."

Cruise was pretty good in Vanilla Sky where he tolerated a total facial destruction as a key part of the plot. Once again, in MR, he's not a afraid to look bad -- emotionally or physically. It's hard to believe this one time smirking ""pretty boy"" can be so gritty and he does it convincingly.<br/><br/>Spielberg laid an egg with AI, but here he does a good job of convincing you that you are in the year 2054, moreso than more future set movies.<br/><br/>The movie has some interesting homage subtleties -- throwback to Kubrick movies and style, for example. And except for a couple of really dumb plot holes, it's pretty tight and unpredictable, even when it's being predictable (which itself should be predictable in a movie about predictions!).<br/><br/>I'm usually the first to make the ""too long"" complaint, but the movie is trying to say a lot about its characters in the small scale, and also about the social reaction to crime on a larger scale.<br/><br/>How far are we willing to go for security? I think that we're constantly trying to balance freedom and security. We often get it wrong -- the WW II imprisonment of Japanese-Americans, overzealous police, unconstitutional detainment of ""persons of interest"" regarding terrorism.

It's not a horrible film but just simply an unpleasant viewing experience, due to its infatuation with repulsive scenes of Ziploc-bagged eyeballs, futuristic whorehouses and blatant product placement, all brought to us by the man who once thought of Haley Joel Osment as the ideal Harry Potter.  3/10"

","I read the short story in an hour or two, then saw the film in 2 and a half. I must say, it's interesting and disappointing to see the dramatic differences- 90% different stories.  I thought the book was really about the Minority Report, it's importance and the main character's priority conflict over the future of the Precrime Deptartment and his own life.<br/><br/>I wont go into details: suffice it to say that the book was not only far more entertaining and thought-provoking, but it actually took less time. <br/><br/>
Last comment- many of my fans out there that enjoyed my other reviews might remember my scathing comments about Spielberg from A.I.; well, much of my criticism applies here too.  The man is a master of cinematography- his 'in-your-face' directing style is as much a charater in any one of his movies as the Cruises, Dreyfuses and H.Ford's... but he is, without a doubt, one of the most unchallenging, corporate-pleasing, predictable story-tellers I've ever seen in motion pictures.  Always the inappropriately cheap laughs and gut-sucking sentimentality in every film, always characters bawling their eyes out, etc.  He leaves his stamp in pretty much every picture he makes, no matter what.  I guess the money, the box-office numbers and other corporate Hollywood priorities are hard to ignore.<br/><br/>To sum up- the film is a 3/10.  Some good effects and visually exciting stuff.  But to take an excellent short story and pad it into a predictable special effects extravaganza is further proof that Hollywood is past it's prime."

","Acting-wise, at least in most of his films (Interview With The Vampire, Vanilla Sky, A Few Good Men, and Magnolia are exceptions) he has just been pretending to act like he's in a school play. Vanilla Sky changed my mind about him, not because of the confusing storyline, but because of his amazing acting ability in that. I guess that was just a fluke considering I have seen nothing, acting-wise, to top that performance (Cruise-wise).<br/><br/>But on to the actual movie. This movie's first hour I imagine was to establish premise and characterization. But it doesn't do a good job at either.

","Minority Report is one of the best movies to come out of Hollywood for a long time. It has an interesting plot with plenty of twists. The action is extremely well done and it also leaves you with questions as you leave the cinema. While the movie does have some minor problems, most criticisms you will see are from those who don't understand it properly.<br/><br/>
*** Spoilers begin ***<br/><br/>Really, the only plot hole big enough to worry me was the bit where Anderton (Cruise) gains access to the precrime facility using his removed eyes. Surely they would have withdrawn his access rights to the facility. A better way to deal with this would have been for Anderton to somehow hack into the computers to gain entry or he could have been let in by someone on the inside that he knew (maybe the guy looking after the precogs).<br/><br/>As for the ending, yes I agree with most people here that it was too happy for the style of this movie. I think a good way to end it would have been to get rid of the voice over and finish it just after Burgess shoots himself. This would provide a semi-happy ending, but get rid of the happily ever after bit.<br/><br/>*** Spoilers end ***<br/><br/>Overall I still give it 10/10. While it does have some flaws, they are very minor and don't detract from the enjoyability of this movie. Minority Report deserves its place in the imdb top 250!"

","A simplest advice that I want to share, do not miss the smallest dialog of the film. It probably has the best script since The Matrix for an action/triller film. In my opinion it is not a total si-fi. It may have a futuristic look, but it is a mixture of human drama, excellent action sequences and a superb plot. Tom Cruise was better in this movie. Nothing to say about direction, it was proved long before that Spielberg is one of the greatest director of all time; 'The Minority Report' is just another great creation. I particularly liked the escape sequence of Cruise and Morton.<br/><br/>The casting was excellent.

Tom Cruise is actually capable of quite a range of screen-depiction of character.  His fame, unfortunately, precedes him and will forever cast him negatively.<br/><br/>Anyway, this film is longer than you might expect and the trailers won't ruin it at all.  The special effects are amazing and mostly the futurism is believable.<br/><br/>Most of all, what will get you is that just when you think the film is about to end (and not at a bad point at that) it shoots off in another direction and surprises you.<br/><br/>I have to say that Agatha's actress is extremely powerful at just the right moment and will reach right into you, with a simple word.<br/><br/>My one and only (minor) gripe, is that where the film should have ended it doesn't, and plays to the heart more than it should (as with A.I. - Steven, please stop doing that).<br/><br/>Go see it."

","An unusual film, it started so-so, had a horrible downhill period, and then, when all of the modern chase nonsense was out of the way, it became very good. But boy, did they bottle out of the ending! There was a perfectly set up distopian ending beautifully engineered ... and they blew it!<br/><br/>Once it gets going, this is a spelendidly manipulative film, most perspectives are wrong, most character evaluations are wrong, I think all of my assumptions were wrong (there might have been something minor I got right, I just can't remember it) ... if they'd had the nerve to stick to the genuinely unsettling tenor of the middle to later part of the film this could have been great. <br/><br/>A few lacunae (these aren't spoilers, since they don't make sense outside the context of the film and don't have any bearing on the outcome or plot) - how did Cruise not get hit with the car seat? why wasn't he taken off the access database? why was there a plug in the bathtub and why didn't anyone know where it went (they could have asked Neo ...)? How come the pre-cogs ability was limited to DC? Why didn't any of the police hit Cruise with their non-lethal weapons? Why did the police always have to come through the window when the front door was open (but then they do that in real life, don't they)? <br/><br/>I haven't read Dick's original, but I understand that the protagonist is an overweight slob druggy type; I think if Spielberg had kept that in mind we wouldn't have had the unconvincing chase near the beginning which didn't lend anything to the story, and made Cruise seem like some kind of proto-Batman... unnecessary and distracting and irrelevant, maybe it was there for some putative teen audience who don't think its a movie without someone hanging by his fingernails from some high place.<br/><br/>

","I'm not really a fan of Spielberg or Tom Cruise but is the first time that I'm totally sure that they deserved a 10 for the movie. This is not a typical Spielberg movie who in the past years decided to work with dinousaurs and the hollocast (I haven't seen yet AI). This movie from the same mind of totally recall and blade runner is the best picture I've seen in years. The plot is interesting, and the script is excellent, but the main attraction is the work of the director of Photography Janus Kaminsky, who recreate a very futuristic but realistic world, with lot of numbers and a grey and blue tone. The cast work well. This is a role from Tom Cruise who give his best performance. Cruise isn't a great actor, but in the few past year he grew a lot as an actor (compare his peromance in MI1 and MI2, and makes his performance credible and John Anderson the drogadictic police chief, who is involve in a future crime. However his co-star Colin Farrell, isn't good enough as the Javert of the 21 century Danny Witwear.  He start well but later he collaps. Much more better are Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton. Both gave the best performance of the movie. Von Sydow is one of the best actors of all the time, and he did not dissapointed here. He makes his ambiguos chararcter natural and credible, and finally Mrs Morton, is a beautiful lady that look horrible as the tiny co gorb Agatha (except the last scene), but gave a great performance, specially at the end where she steal the show as the mysterious woman that had the minority report. She will be the next Redgrave and Glenda Jackson (the three in one). The rest of the cast, from the police, to the doctors and scientific and unkown actress that portrays Cruise wife are excellent. Finally congratulation to Mr Spielberg that gave us an imaginative story with lot of suspense and confirm him as the best North American director alive. Steaven reafirms here as a storyteller. IT was a pity that M Report wasn't the biggest blockbuster summer movie of 2002, because is a masterpiece."

"gortx","Null","0","0","29 July 2002"," The Best SF film in a while, despite a lack of nerve at the end
","I know some of you may not have seen it yet, so I'll try to be vague on some specifics. --Thought this film would have been TWICE as effective if you chop off the last 10 Minutes or so (i.e. When it appears as though Cruise's fate is ""sealed""). A great film where it seemed like they lost their nerve at the end and felt they ""had"" to cross every 'T' & dot every ""I"" and put a big PERIOD on at the end. Too bad, could have been a classic. --Second Thought. Does anybody else think that if Tom Cruise & Max Von Sydow had switched which characters they were playing, that the final scene would have been re-written so that their character's fates would have been reversed? Again, Spielberg & Cruise seem to have let the box office dictate the plot mechanics.<br/><br/>Still think this overall the best SF film in quite a while. Very well done (Kaminski's photography & Williams' music were standouts). Only quibble I had was with the Production Design. While most of the SFX were superb (except for the Merlin the magician look of the operators of the video screens in the lab - all they needed was a wand and a pointy hat), I thought some of the Set Decoration got lazy. I.E. you have all these high tech advances like vertical magnetic field highways, yet the Train looks like the ""T"" and the Gap store is just a Gap store with a fancy electronic screen."

","Once again we see the proof that God loves us and wants good things for his children, for another Phillip K. Dick story has been ordained to be shown on the Great Silver Screen.  Mr. Dick is the man whose sacred writings were the basis for the films Blade Runner and Total Recall, amongst a few others. Not only can we celebrate the visualization of another Dick short, but we can also give thanks that  it has been crafted in the blessed hands of Steven Spielberg and filmed by the extremely gifted Janusz Kaminski.  This is the movie equivalent of Sir George Solti and the Chicago Symphony Orchestra performing Beethoven --it just doesn't get much better than this.<br/><br/>
In the not-to-distant future, human beings with special ""precognitive"" abilities (whatever the hell ""precognitive"" means...)  will be able to see a murder before it happens.  Through the use of some really nifty technology, the police will be able to see the visions of these murders displayed on a screen, hopefully giving them enough clues to find the murderer and the scene of the crime before it even takes place.  How successful is this system?  In six years, not a single murder has actually been committed in the city where it has been initially deployed, Washington D.C. (Fortunately,  they must have installed some sort of filter to keep the ""pre-cogs"" from seeing the into the inner workings of the federal government, whose crimes would certainly overwhelm the system.)<br/><br/>But of course the questions must arise: just how ""perfect"" is this system? Is there any way in which somebody with a bit of moxie might be able to take advantage of the system, and commit murders that look as if they were committed by someone else?   Is there a way to bait someone into murdering who otherwise would not have dreamt doing such a thing?   Well, officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) -- a ""true believer"" when it comes to the pre-crime system, now finds himself asking these very questions when he sees HIMSELF on the big screen, blowing holes in a guy he doesn't even know with his police service pistol.  So the race is on for him to prove his innocence, and show that the system he once put his faith in isn't so fool-proof after all.<br/><br/>I'm no longer a big fan of Tom Cruise (MI:2 anyone?) and go out of my way -not- to see his films.  However, the Spielburg/Kaminski/Dick trifecta had me hooked, so I ignored my trusty ""Cruise Control"" and went to see the film. To sum up, I might become a Cruise fan once again, for he certainly played the role of Officer Anderton with great intelligence and feeling.  He is surprisingly reserved, using emotion and feeling in a realistic and convincing manner.  There were even times when I forgot it was Tom Cruise on the screen, and one can't pay a higher compliment than that.<br/><br/>The Spielburg/Kaminski team scores many points throughout the course of movie-- artsy camera angles, tremendous detail, excellent pacing and fine story telling.  It seems as if the Dynamic Duo of motion pictures is continuing with a trend that was brought forth in their previous film ""AI."" In Minority Report, we see the continued evolution of these ideas into even more fantastic organisms and creatures.  But best of all, Spielberg understands that CGI is a prop, not a movie enhancement mechanism, and uses CGI in a very intelligent fashion to help tell the story, rather than hitting us over the head with over-done digital potpourri, 'ala Attack of the Clones.<br/><br/>Unlike many of the directors of the last 30 years, Spielburg is getting much better with age.  Riddley Scott is the only other I can say that about. (Lucas, & Coppola are most definitely in their descendancy, Scorsese has gotten neither better nor worst...)  It certainly seems like he is becoming the second incarnation of Stanley Kubrick, going after more cerebral and philosophic works.  With ""Minority Report,"" Spielburg has a story that makes excellent use of his talents.  It is now my favorite Phillip Dick inspired film, even beating out BladeRunner.<br/><br/>The icing on the Minority Report cake is the wonderful presence of the greatest actor who's ever walked the earth: Max von Sydow.  It's very clear that Max is back!  He gives a powerful, controlled performance as Lamar Burgess, the co-founder of the pre-crime unit. Every second von Sydow is on screen is like manna from heaven, and I found myself greedily eating up every bit of it.   Whoever made this casting choice deserves a gold star.<br/><br/>But it would not be fair to praise only Cruise and von Sydow, for every actor in this film does an outstanding job.  There may be flaws in Minority Report, but performances is not one of them.  A special treat is Lois Smith as Dr. Iris Hineman, the person responsible for the initial development of the pre-crime system.  If nothing else, go see this film and watch Iris wrap Tom Cruise around her little finger.<br/><br/>This may be billed as a sci-fi film, but it's really just plain old film noir set in the year 2054.  But it's one of the best noirs since ""L.A. Confidential.""  And like most noir, it has plot holes that Orson Welles could waltz through and convenient plot twists which the bad guys must always fall into --it just wouldn't be noir without it.   But much credit goes to Phillip Dick, Scott Frank and Jon Cohen for writing solid dialogue and creating ideas that help bridge those gaping chasms.<br/><br/>Overall, I sat in my seat eating up every minute of celluloid and ignoring my popcorn.   A stunning visual treat for the eyes, a good nutritional feast for the brain, and an exhausting workout for one's emotions.   But most importantly, Minority Report is a liturgy of fun, excellence and intrigue that will send your spirit soaring in adoration to the Almighty for blessing us with the incarnation of St. Spielburg.  May the Lord be with you."

Thats how I felt when I watched Minority Report. The only thing I didn't see coming was Tom Cruise' bald shaven head (somebody get that boy some Rogain).<br/><br/>Dispite all the similarities with other films, I have to give this film its proper credit. The special effect are so good in this film, that I wouldn't be the least surprised if it beats out Star Wars:Episode 2 at the oscars for best special effects.The Special effects in this film are that GOOD. I've seen many other Not-so-distant future films have similar effects and similar digital-computurized futuristic landscapes.(examples: Tek War, Demolition Man, A.I., Gattaca, the list goes on)but never have I seen it done on the same size and scale as Minority Report.(the geneticaly altered plants - I thought that was a bit silly). This film is amazing to watch. The chase scene on a futuristic super-highway is one of the best chase scenes ever!<br/><br/>Although there are aspects of this film that are both groundbreaking and original, you still get the feeling that you've been here before in other films. In many ways this film Paralells ""The Fugitive-1993"" with the theme of an innocent man on the run. However, on many levels it also paralells those ""Tek War"" made for TV  movies that the Fox network produced during the mid-1990's, with the theme of a good cop addctied to substance abuse,framed by greedy politcians,so he can be made into a public example,to win public support so they can get legislation passed. (Tek War-starring William Shatner and Greg Evigan, was also set in the future, and featured many similar graphics and themes as Minority Report).<br/><br/>I also thought the ending of this film was too anti-climactic I give this film 7 out of 10 stars"

It's a film you need to take your brain along for, and much as I enjoy a mindless film occasionally, was getting tired of there not being much else around.<br/><br/>This is the first film I've ever watched where I've noticed and loved a car! Aside from that the film presents a lot of things to think about. Not only is there the central question of 'how just is a system which punishes people who haven't committed a crime?' but also about privacy invasion - all persons are not only identified and registered globally by retinal scan, but are continually and publicly identified by scanners set all over the place. The future of truly targeted advertising is far more frightening in some ways than the idea of having your windows kicked in by rapidly descending men in black.<br/><br/>A great film, a trifle sentimental in places but doesn't over do it, I think.

","When you have Schindler's List, Jaws, Color Purple, and SPR on your C.V., anything you do creates great expectations. To that extent, Minority Report was a tad disappointing because I was hoping to be blown out of my seat. When I look at it in its own right, it is great entertainment, but not in Spielberg's top 5.<br/><br/>The plot is simple and complex all at once, and is the most intriguing part of the film. The Department of Pre-crime is run by Tom Cruise in the city of Washington DC. With the aid of three psychic ""pre-cogs"", murders are anticipated  and prevented, but the would be perpetrators are still arrested and imprisoned. Out of nowhere, the pre-cogs predict that Cruise will murder a man he does not know. Now it seems that the system which for six years has been perfect, has a flaw. Or does it?<br/><br/>That description does not do the plot or the themes in this film any justice. What may be most entertaining about this film is the extraordinary emotion, conversation and debate it generates. Can you punish someone for an intended crime? Can that person not control his fate? Is the pre-cog a willing participant in all this? How can such a system be beat? Moral, technical, and legal issues abound around this film, while it carries on as a great action movie. Extremely complex.<br/><br/>We could debate all day about possible tiny plot holes dealing with the visions of the pre-cogs, Tom Cruise's eyes, his run from the law and other points of the film. But when you watch this film, remember that exposing flaws of pre-crime is a goal of many of the characters. Perhaps that is simply what it being done.<br/><br/>As with every Speilbergian outing, you have a stunning technical achievement in this film. Janusz Kaminsky can see a film like no other person on Earth, and the special effects serve the plot, not the other way around. The scene with the spiders is worth the price of admission alone. Special mention to Samantha Morton is wonderful supporting role as Agatha, one of the pre-cogs.<br/><br/>I give a strong recommendation to this film, but don't go in looking for a future classic. ***1/2 out of ****"

Good acting, the product placement is not a problem (come on people, it's the way it's done nowadays), and it's got more twists than a can of spaghetti. The story is great and highly original and Spielberg shows why he's one of the best directors around. Forget about that James Cameron feller, he's a flash in the pan. No one could have made this film apart from Spielberg, and hey, even Tom Cruise was pretty good. But obviously it wasn't the acting that really made it, or even the amazing special effects. Solid story, and solid story telling from one of the masters, still at the top of his game."

","I've read several PKD novels, and let me tell you, they are an excellent challenge.  Insightful, dark, ambiguous (amTRIguous?)and ultimately humane.  Sometimes his work seems deliberately unclear, but it is never short of compelling.<br/><br/>With Minority Report, Mount Spielberg has created a film of consummate craftsmanship.  Noir bathed in light and white all over.  Wow!  Sort of the negative print of Blade Runner.  Nothing escaped Spielberg's attention, not the minutest detail, nor texture nor athmospheric.  A very convincing representation of the Police State that the United States could become (remember how everybody got face-scanned at the last Super Bowl?).  The choreography and pacing of action sequences are, yet again, masterful and fresh;  credit must be given to Spielberg for consistently pulling this off, year in and year out.  <br/><br/>Which reminds me:  What a travesty it was to integrate the Schwarzenegger Element to another PKD project:  Total Recall. The plot reflects PKD's forte:  the permutation of ideas both visionary and unexpected.  However, the wishy-washy ending torpedoes everything that the rest of the film stands for.  What could have been a great film becomes merely a good one, because of the saccharine aftertaste.<br/><br/>The factor that makes Blade Runner great is its conviction to bring forth the true spirit of PKD to the very end, to its logical lack of conclusion.  Many people remember that Blade Runner hit the screen in 1982 with an infamous watered-down ending, patched in at the prompting of studio executives, a sort of commercial bowdlerization, and a woeful mistake long since corrected.<br/><br/>Now, Mount Spielberg has here shown yet again that he cannot help but to bowdlerize himself.  Could somebody please tell this man to stop pushing the same blatant sentimentality buttons that served him (and us) well once upon a time, once or twice?  And that goes double for Mr. Cruise.<br/><br/>""It's too bad she won't live, but then again who does?"""

"Lumpenprole","7","0","0","26 July 2002"," The first two-thirds are excellent
","Spoilers here,<br/><br/>Spielberg movies tend to rehash really conservative plots - the mad scientist overreaching, the swashbuckler on a quest, the buddy movie and so on.  Spielberg's inspired moments are what he brings to these old plots. Minority Report is the cop-on-the-run plot.  A semi-likable cop is on to something, is framed, runs from the police to a world unfamiliar to him, and then vindicates himself in some big public scene where the guilty party eats crow.  It's like Peter Weir's Witness and any number of other movies.<br/><br/>Peter Weir used the cop-on-the-run plot to show his cop trying to move through a world where his violence and way of living were completely rejected.  In the best parts of Minority Report Spielberg shows his cop on the run from a world where civil liberties and free will no longer exist. Throughout the film there is the ominous presence of a diseased nanny state that probes into the homes and bodies of its citizens.  At the beginning of the movie's action, the state has finally probed into the mind, into the very intent to commit an act.  Spielberg brings this awesomely dark vision of society home with the metaphorical `family.'  Von Sydow's Burgess character and Smith's Dr. Hineman characters make several references to themselves as the parents of the `precogs.'  There is much discussion of their status as wards of Burgess and the eerie history of their abilities - born with nightmarish visions of impending murders as a result of the drug abuse of their parents.  Instead of curing them of this horrific condition, Hineman and Burgess keep them in a big tub of drugs to harvest their nightmares.  Without a doubt, it's the most ghoulish vision Spielberg has conjured up.<br/><br/>And this theme continues when Cruise's Anderton character is taken on a tour of the people he's had incarcerated.  Once under the complete control of the state, they suffer a fate very similar to the precogs - suspended in a tank with the brain still running.  The implication of the subplot (of Pre-Crime going national) is that this is where we will all be, as people surrender to the encroaching state.  For the first two thirds of the film, it seem that machines are constantly crawling into people's eyes and into their brains.<br/><br/>There was a lot in the film that I liked. The special effects in Minority Report were excellent, imaginative and made the world of the movie seem bigger.  The breathtaking DC commute and entry to Anderton's condo looked like they came from one, consistent world (Where Attack of the Clones invariably looked like a bunch of people wandering around a green stage clearly smaller than the jumbled action).<br/><br/>The action sequences were exciting and really brought home the idea that Anderton may be a pre-crime cop as much for the thrill of the chase as stopping the crimes that took his son.<br/><br/>The casting was great and the writing had a couple of gems in it.<br/><br/>The only problem with Minority Report is that, like AI, the last third sucked.  There is a line about how all your dreams come true once you've been incarcerated in the tube, but that's not really enough.  It's Spielberg trying to have it both ways - a dark movie and a longer conventional one. As I mentioned at the beginning, the plot is the most standard thing about Minority Report.  The last half hour relies almost completely on a plot that is really really worn out.  I think it's safe to say that we all knew that Burgess was behind the setup.  I think we all knew that Burgess would be unmasked in front of everyone (I felt like I was watching The Fugitive again, which is the same plot with a hunter-and-hunted plot thrown in). Watching it get played out was boring.  The development of the eye theme, the free will convolutions, and all the wonderful fx just stopped for the last half hour in order to make room for a perfunctory happy ending."

","Don't be fooled. This is definitely not up in Blade Runner's class.  It<br/><br/>has potential to be one but unfortunately there are too many plot<br/><br/>holes to make the film truly succesful.  For example, I found it<br/><br/>ridiculous that the entire pre-crime unit would fully support a<br/><br/>system that actually only relies on ONE pre-cogs to determine a<br/><br/>future killer.  So much so that if she's taken away it's enough to<br/><br/>shut the entire system down as proven in the film.  Why would<br/><br/>anyone with a brain let them get away with this?  And it's not like<br/><br/>this is one of the 'secrets' that Max Von Sydow's character hides<br/><br/>from everyone in the pre-crime dept.  If that had been the case, it<br/><br/>would have been acceptable.  But the fact is, even the drug<br/><br/>administrator person who takes care the pre-cogs know that only<br/><br/>the female one is the key to everything.<br/><br/>To top this off, the idea of using pre-cogs to see future crime itself<br/><br/>is a bit stupid.  The older woman in the film mentioned how<br/><br/>pre-cogs are originally children who has this 'gift' of being able to<br/><br/>see future crimes.  Now, surely there aren't that many pre-cogs<br/><br/>even in this futuristic world, unless they are an entirely different<br/><br/>race to human.  But they are just human with 'future-vision' ability. <br/><br/>The problem is, what would happen if the female pre-cogs and her<br/><br/>two other counterpart dies?  If they are human, surely sooner or<br/><br/>later they'll face the same fate as the rest of other humans: death. <br/><br/>What will happen once they are dead?  Obviously they can't be as<br/><br/>easily replaced as pencil because otherwise they would have had<br/><br/>a substitute when John kidnapped Agatha (the female pre-cogs). <br/><br/>So the entire idea of pre-crime and precogs is already shaky from<br/><br/>the start.<br/><br/>Acting wise, Colin Farrell shows that he really is indeed, worth all<br/><br/>the 'upcoming star' hype.  The guy's got talent and I found his<br/><br/>gumshoe-like detective is reminiscent of old film noir detective.  It's<br/><br/>a shame that he's not the main character in this film because it<br/><br/>seems that Farrell's character, Ed Witwer is the sharpest, more<br/><br/>interesting one in comparison to Cruise's character, John<br/><br/>Anderton.  Speaking of Cruise, he does his usual patented 'tough<br/><br/>guy' action here role.  Nothing outstanding but decent enough,<br/><br/>especially compared to the acting skills displayed on recent films<br/><br/>like Star Wars episode 2.  The problem with Cruise, however, is<br/><br/>that he is not the sort of guy that audience can easily identify with.  <br/><br/>I think something is wrong when you want the main character to<br/><br/>indeed, commit the crime that he's been accused of.  It also<br/><br/>doesn't help that Anderton isn't exactly the sharpest knife around in<br/><br/>the film.  He doesn't even figure out who the real problem maker<br/><br/>behind his problem is until his ex-wife set him free from the<br/><br/>lifetime imprisonment that he was facing due to the crime<br/><br/>accusation.   Samantha Morton and Max Von Sydow do very well<br/><br/>especially with the limited amount of screen time that their<br/><br/>characters get on the film.<br/><br/>Action and CGI-wise, the film is mixed bags.  There are some<br/><br/>impressive moments (ie. the spider tracker sequence) and some<br/><br/>dull or jarring moments.  I understand that Spielberg wants to<br/><br/>emphasise the fact that in the future, the distinction between the<br/><br/>rich and the poor is even wider.  But the special effects used to<br/><br/>show the 'richer area' is so jarring that I originally thought that the<br/><br/>pre-crime is actually a futuristic police department that can go back<br/><br/>in time to save other people.  This is due to the fact that the world<br/><br/>of the 'rich' (exemplify by hi-tech expensive apartment) such as the<br/><br/>pre-crime detectives' like Anderton and the world of the 'poor' (who<br/><br/>live in your normal-looking house) are so different that when the<br/><br/>film switch from one area to the next, it feels like I was watching<br/><br/>two different film in two different time frame."

","""Minority Report"" is probably one of the most brilliantly crafted films in a long time.  It is slick, cohesive, well directed, and unfolds at steady pace that neither rushes or drags.  The action and visual effects are masterfully realized, but are not the intended centerpiece of the film.  But, by no means is it perfect.  I will say this, however;  It is Steven Spielberg's best movie in nearly two decades.<br/><br/>The cast does a fantastic job, from main characters to peripheral ones. Yes, Tom Cruise did a good job, but he is surrounded by a plethora of other fine performances that it really would be unfair to single him out.  The ""pre cog"" Agatha is so convincing that you can simply feel her exhaustion and frustration.  Max von Sydow is, as always, fantastic.  His motivations are just a single example of the complexity and crafting of the script, brought to life by a solid effort from a seasoned and talented actor. <br/><br/>
One thing that is striking about the film is how clear it unfolds.  It is a science fiction plot, as well as a mystery that grips and compels the characters into action, and resolve itself logically.  However, I had a problem with the choice of the way the film ends, which I will discuss later. I was afraid that the story would come under the hammer of pretensious direction, but Spielberg manages to avoid the un-eveness of A. I., allowing for the strengths of all the talent involved to come through.<br/><br/>The best feature of ""Minority Report"" is the action.  It does not overwhelm the film, and reminded me why I used to like Spielberg so much.  It was beautifully staged, edited, and was engaging and exciting.  I found myself feeling the same enthusiasm that was generated by the action in Raiders of the Lost Ark, which in many respects has some of the greatest action sequences of all time.  I was thinking ""Aw Cool"" while also concerned about what will happen next.  This, in union with the impressive visual effects, made for a perfect marriage of visual and narrative elements.  These scenes have their place in the story, and do not feel unnatural or disjointed.<br/><br/>While I liked the film, I did have a few problems with it.  The most glaring problem for me was the tidy ""wrap-up.""  It just felt out of place, and seemed to bury the darker elements of the film with a sugary resolution. The world goes from a Steel-blue, sterile environment to a Golden paradise, where all the problems of the past 145 minutes are made 'OK' within the span of under two minutes.  I am not averse to happy endings, but this was just silly.  I expected nothing less from Spielberg, but I was almost impressed that he managed to avoid slipping into sap that when it happens, I could not help but feel disappointment.<br/><br/>In the end, I was impressed with ""Minority Report.""  It has little of the critic-pandering ambiguity of A. I. (not to be confused with ambitious film making, which A. I. most certainly was not!), and manages to be something that is so rare; a good science fiction movie.  This one can be classed with ""Blade Runner"", ""Planet of the Apes"", and ""The Matrix"" as what Science Fiction has the potential to be.  Entertaining, smart, and beautiful."

","This movie scares the heck out of me to think that there could be a futuristic judicial system that detects murderers before the crimes are committed!  Would I really trust psychic technology that could backfire against its assumed purpose?  Yep, watching this film does keep my mind ticking with questions, from beginning to the end. It even makes me wonder how the clairvoyant trio, in this movie, is not interested in criminals, such as robbers, rapists, and corporate cheater.  Yep, this is a wonderful, mind-boggling film that sucks me into interaction with characters and events -- keeping me attentive, contemplative, and edgy!  Oh yes, it's a whodunit' tale in noir style! And it's done with such superb beauty and flair almost as if Spielberg is once again paying homage to Stanley Kubrik's style of filmmaking -- crafting scenes that the viewer finds unsettling (example: Clockwork Orange & Eyes Wide Shut).  The blue cinematic effects are truly surreal stirring up memories of scenes in A.I. too. The scenes with the Precog trio floating in a tank of water and with Anderton submerged in a water-filled bathtub seem rather austere, yet amazingly beautiful!<br/><br/>Two thumbs up for the wonderful performances of the total cast it's their combined performances that truly keep the story rolling. Tom Cruise's performance is solid and outstanding. I find myself literally flung into his John Anderton's shoes, plunging myself into one hell of an adventure, in my attempt to stay focused on theories of conspiracy, power and corruption to solve the `crime.'  I have had a fun time trying to figure out the Precrime System and at playing detective! Yep, this is a movie that will suck the viewers into one event after another, providing them little opportunity to tear away from Anderton's doom.<br/><br/>Two Precogs in agreement to create a potentially trustworthy result and considered a majority report to warrant an arrest, while a dissenting view of the third, the minority report, is filed away as unreliable?  Surely the so-called basic tenants of the rule of law are indeed confusing to follow. I keep reminding myself that this absurd ruling doesn't help me shed light on the mystery.  However, the story is done with such awesome flow and pace and succeeds in allowing the viewers to collect their clues in a very intense and exciting fashion. I feel as if I'm trapped in the schizophrenic atmosphere, searching for breathing space while everything and everyone seem to plunge me into constant doubts, hope and disbelief.   Yep, this movie definitely thrills!  It's Spielberg's futuristic world, where Washington DC's famous old-styled monuments still exist, but where the System denies us our privacy, and where creepy, crawly electronic spiders can easily track down our presence.  Phenomenal, but hardly pleasant imagination that's being projected on the screen!<br/><br/>There's a very dark tone underlying the whole film. Even John Williams' music score is downright haunting. Despite the non-stop action, excitement and suspense, the characters will sink the viewers into waves of creepy, hopeless and helpless feelings throughout the plot and sub-plots.  Gosh, this film takes me on a long ride - thrilling and rough. It has been easy for me to figure out the good from the bad dudes. Nope, there's no telling when the puzzles are going to fit together nicely. Yep, I'm drained out of my total energy watching this movie even as I try to keep up with the flash-forward scenes of the Precogs' minds!  And I welcome the moments that bring out my unintentional giggles as if I find them most necessary to take me away from my overlapping and disturbing mental state and intensity.<br/><br/>This movie is truly terrific and does also absorb a distinctive matrix-type feel.  The psychic chase, the high-tech futuristic-looking gizmos, the process of identity-scanning eyes, and even the old homeless man stooping to pick up the scattered coins are incredible to see.  And being able to spot Cameron Crowe (reading a copy of the USA Today newspaper) and Cameron Diaz in their cameo roles is rather cool.  Hey, can I be imagining that Peter Storemare's doc' character does speak in a strange dialect?  Oh yes, this movie has a lot to offer to the movie buffs. I even enjoy being shoved against the wall in helpless tension, as I thrust all my effort in trying to make sense out of Anderton's misfortune.<br/><br/>This film definitely has all the rich filmmaking ingredients that will give it a deserving A+ rating. I will definitely see it again!"

Spielberg should be embarrassed if not ashamed). It falls far short as thriller and certainly in no way can it pretend to be a thought provoking piece..... well, it pretends..... there just isn't any there there. Spielberg has had a long splendid career. At the beginning he was pooh-pooed by the critics. Since Schindler's list he's regarded as walking on water. I think he's a splendid director in a checkered sort of way. I don't think ""Minority Report"" will be remembered as one of his better movies.

Plus, performance-wise, the<br/><br/>supporting cast is better then excellent, with Samantha Morton as Agatha the<br/><br/>Precog being the stand out performance throughout. Just her saying ""Murder""<br/><br/>will send chills down your spine, no doubt. <br/><br/>One thing I will say is that this film is not for everyone. The intense nature of it may be hard for fans of Spielberg's more lighthearted fare to swallow. But, for those looking for a new Spielberg, the change is a welcome one. The cold dark future that is portrayed is one that is very, very possible, and sometimes<br/><br/>freightning to realize. Spielberg did a bang up job showing how technology's<br/><br/>advances will only increase our lack of privacy. Amazing, and very truthful<br/><br/>realization.<br/><br/>Plot holes aside (they are few, and far between, and most people wouldn't catch them), this film's plot moves so fast, that sometimes its hard to catch up. Each moment of it will keep you guessing, which keeps the audience always on their toes. You will never know what it coming, and that adds the the intrigue of this very film-noir-esque film.<br/><br/>One aspect of the film I found the most interesting had nothing to do with the actual film... It was the ad campaign that is seen on TV and in the Trailers. I applaud Spielberg for, how shall I say, diverting audiences attention. I won't say any more, but you may be pleasently surprised to find out that even before you even see the film, you really have no idea what its about. That's great<br/><br/>advertising, in my opinion.<br/><br/>My only problem with the film is that in the end, the plot is very familiar. You won't recognize it while watching it, but its there. I won't say what film this one almost parallels, but if you've seen this other film, you may recognize it after viewing Minority Report. But, there are enough differences  between the two<br/><br/>films to not make it a real issue. It won't bother the average film viewer, but it kind of bothered me, but nothing to change my opinion of the film.<br/><br/>To sum it all up, this is not a film to be missed. If you saw A.I. and hated it, this one should redeem Spielberg for you. If you loved A.I., you should love Minority Report even more. I hope this film stands out as a breath of fresh air in the usually dull summer fare, and that it will be the surprise hit of the summer. 9.5/10"

","...because if you get suckered in by the hype or think too long about the movie, you won't like it.<br/><br/>MINORITY REPORT is visually one of the most interesting movies I've seen in a long time.  The FX are good, the washed out overbright coloration of the shots are perfect for a harsh spotlight turned on the future, and many of the scenes are brilliantly staged.  And on first glance, the story is quite engaging.  John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Washington, DC's Precrime Unit, an experimental police force using the psychic talents of three ""Pre-Cogs"" to predict murders before they happen, thus dropping the DC homicide rate to zero.  But on the eve of the Precrime unit going nationwide, Anderton finds himself in one of the Pre-Cogs' visions, and now has to escape a future that has already been predicted.  Are the Pre-Cogs always right?  If you know the future, can you change it?  How does free choice and free will mesh with a crime unit based on prediction of your future, and how do they know you didn't change your mind before you went through with your crime?  And what does all this do to the presumption of innocence, the cornerstone of the American justice system?<br/><br/>Then you stop and think about it for a minute, and the story falls apart.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW...CLICK AWAY NOW IF YOU DON'T WANT TO READ THEM...<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>
The ways in which this plot falls apart are many and varied.  Some examples:<br/><br/>-- If the chief of precrime is suspected of a crime, why don't they remove his retinal-coded security access?  And even after he's locked up and put in jail, they still don't remove it.  Sloppy, sloppy writing.<br/><br/>-- Why bring in the notion of a ""minority report"" (a Pre-Cog vision that differs from the ""official"" version, erased from the official records but stored in the lead Pre-Cog's memories) if you don't intend to use it?  We never see one, and it plays no part in the film's outcome.<br/><br/>-- If you're paying attention, you'll figure out who the real villain is the first time they have an extended scene with him.  You'll even figure out his motive and a few other things about him.  At least, I did.  Really, it was that easy.<br/><br/>-- Why does the Pre-Cog pool have an emergency drain?  It serves no useful purpose except to provide Anderton with a convenient escape route.<br/><br/>-- These Pre-Cogs are a fluke, an accident, a genetic experiment gone awry according to their creator, and yet they plan to take this program nationwide?  How?  Create more?  Make the ones they've got see more?  Which leads directly to the next problem...<br/><br/>-- Can the Pre-Cogs see beyond DC?  If so, why don't they?  We're told from the start this is a one-city unit--what, does someone erect a psychic border around the nation's capitol?  What about the Maryland and Virginia suburbs--what, no one who commits a murder in DC lives in the burbs or vice versa?<br/><br/>-- It's all too convenient that the Pre-Cogs can only work as a unit, particularly when you've already introduced the notion of a ""minority report"" (one seeing different things than the others, implying at least two different trains of thought are possible).  When the unit gets broken up and suddenly no more murders can be predicted, the film takes its biggest leap of logic, and I immediately found myself going ""Huh?""<br/><br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Still, though, there are worse ways to spend $8.  If you like your films visually interesting and you're willing to completely suspend logic for 2.5 hrs., go see it.  Just don't buy into the hype that this is the movie of the year or any other such nonsense."

","My plan is to say as little as possible about the actual content of this film. I'm sure others have (or will) do so here. Also, I think you should go see it and I don't want to do anything to spoil it for you.<br/><br/>
""Minority Report"" is a really, REALLY good film. Really.<br/><br/>
That said, I feel the need to state what this movie is *not*. ""Minority Report"" is *not* the best Science Fiction film ever made. It may wind up in the top fifty, but only time will tell. Nor is it the best of the films made from Philip K. Dick stories. For my money, ""Bladerunner"" still has that distinction. Furthermore, ""Minority Report"" is not, _strictly speaking_, great science fiction.<br/><br/>What ""Minority Report"" is, is a really good -- maybe great -- piece of movie making and a hell of a good mystery. The ""who"" and ""why"" were pretty clear, but the ""how"" really had me going. The Scott Frank and Jon Cohen script was *mostly* great and the technology was acceptable, given the setting of the story. I especially liked the holographic computer user interfaces, a bit reminiscent of Tek Wars.<br/><br/>Something I found especially appealing was that for the first time (as far as I know) the title of Dick's original story was used as the title of the film. That title is, without a doubt, what the story is all about. It's important, and it needs to be there.<br/><br/>I enjoyed this movie a lot. In fact, the only thing that jumped out of the screen and hit me right in the head was the really bad security at the DC cop house and sleep prison (more Tek Wars?). I am referring to the failure of the security people to remove the hero's retinal authorization from their computers, permitting him to come and go pretty much at will! I mean, when a cop goes over the hill, you invalidate his access to sensitive areas and information right NOW! I bring it up here only because it is an embarrassing mis-cue, made by a writer who *thought* he needed to do it that way to make the story work. I find this surprising because the rest of the script was so well done. It's also sad, because it wasn't necessary. If you're getting confused, I'm sorry. I just don't want to write a spoiler. Go see the film and you'll see what I mean. Then, think about it and you'll see how to fix it.<br/><br/>I re-read Dick's short story before going to see this film, and am pleased to report that I did *not* find myself sitting in the chair muttering to myself all about how ""they took a good story and screwed it up."" As a matter of fact, reading the story didn't do me one bit of good when it came to solving the core mystery. I did figure it out -- about 2 seconds before if flashed across the screen.<br/><br/>As someone who has been a hard-core science fiction book and movie fan for over forty-five years, as well as someone who loves a mystery, I can recommend ""Minority Report"" highly.<br/><br/>I'll be seeing this one again *and* buying the DVD!"

","Last summer, I went to see Steven Spielberg's previous movie A.I. Artificial Intellegence and I thought that it was an excellent motion picture. But also, last summer I heard that Steven Spielberg was planning to direct a movie called Minority Report about a group of futuristic police officers who catch serial killers before the crimes are even commited. I absolutley couldn't wait to see how this movie would turn out. So now, one year later, I went to the opening night of it and I must say that this was one hell of a movie. It was so cool the way that the future technology was developed, the way the special effects were created, and the best of all: Steven Spielberg did such a brilliant job directing the film. Movies like Minority Report only come once a year which is not enough considering that this is the kind of movie that people want to see. Things to enjoy throughout the movie are: the score by John Williams, the beautiful cinematography, the awsome screenplay, and the screen presence of a lot of the actors including Tom Cruise, Colin Farrel, Jessica Capshaw, Max Von Sydow. Minority Report will be one of the best experiences of your life.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, I heard, is working on another movie called Catch Me If You Can starring Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio which is slated to hit theatres over Christmas of this year. Hopefully I will get to see that along with the sequal to Lord of the Rings."

Someone says they can't believe anyone would contemplate commiting a murder within 200 miles - I took that to mean the pre-cogs would key in on anything within that radius.  !!POTENTIAL MINOR SPOILER ALERT!!  As for the final shot, well, it suggests that to get away from their visions they need to be far from civilization and other people, far enough away so as not to be troubled by their visions of future murders. !!END SPOILER!!</li></ul><br/><br/>In the original story the Dept. of Pre-Crime is already a national program.<br/><br/>""it has been expected as part of the project that it would be expanded to a national project - yet the selection of the Pre-Cogs was shown to be a singular, non-recurrent event.""<br/><br/><ul><li>Is it singular and non-recurrent?  Presumably you could have more pre-cogs born due to that drug being abused, and then train them.

If he's addicted, then no doubt others are, too.</li></ul><br/><br/>""Wouldn't the recruitment of more Pre-Cogs be needed?

Keep some women addicted to that drug, artificially inseminate them then raise and train the kids over the years. You'd need a large pool of ""talent"" because the process is so dangerous so that's a lot of women being kept to breed these kids.  (or maybe just paid off).  Even if you don't extrapolate this out so far, the whole notion that the project requires children born from mothers who are addicted to an illegal drug give it a very ""Phil K. Dickian"" moral taint.  The notion of presumably benevelont institutions secretly addicting innocent people to drugs to further their own ends actually happens in at least one of Dick's novels, ""A Scanner Darkly.""</li></ul><br/><br/>""Another key scene in the movie is Anderton returning to the Pre-Crime Laboratory in order to extract Agatha's hidden Minority Report - this after having been revealed as the perpetrator of a future murder and on the run from the Pre-Crime unit.

Still, why was he not locked out of the system?  In the original short story, when he goes back to examine the Minority Report, he is let in through security by one of his loyal former employees.  There were hints, but not nearly overt enough, that some of his former employees might have given some help (that one particular black woman who clearly didn't believe his guilt).  I get the feeling a scene may have been cut that helped better explain this.<br/><br/>""(fortunately there is no such thing as decomposition [of his eyes] in the future).""<br/><br/>The eyes were out of his head for less then a day by that point and had been kept on ice for much of that time, you might recall.  They wouldn't have decomposed much, if at all.  Actually, it wasn't a retinal scan but an iris scan the computers were doing, if I recall.  So long as the pattern of irises are intact the scan would work.<br/><br/>""Didn't it occur to him to just STAY THE HELL AWAY from Les Crow??? He is even told to do so several times in the movie yet for reasons unexplained continues to pursue this person - HUH???????""<br/><br/>If he DOESN'T face Les Crow he's totally screwed.  If he doesn't find Crow, his only link to possibly finding out who is framing him, he'll never prove his innocence.  It's implicit that the future CAN be changed - they stop murders from happening all the time as it is, that's their job.  What it doesn't change is his assumed guilt before the fact - the potential murderers they stop are still convicted as if they were guilty of murder. His only way to prove he will not commit this murder is to go to the scene of the future crime, at the appointed time, and then not commit said crime."

","From the advance viewing I saw yesterday, I would say this movie will be the summer blockbuster, not Spider Man. Spielberg's new movie Minority Report delivers the action, suspense and thrills with aplomb.<br/><br/> I laughed at the end when the credits rolled, starting with ""Based on a short story by Philip K Dick"". This is not a short movie. At two and a half hours, it is pushing into Private Ryan territory, and while it dips slightly in a few places, these lulls are a needed antidote to the astonishing set-pieces.<br/><br/> Short or not, however, the story is terrific. A man heads up a team of hi-tech cops who use three 'pre-cogs' who can determine when a murder will be committed. He pieces together the scraps of information from the brain-scan and works out where the killing will take place.<br/><br/> Great! Unfortunately, it backfires. Cruise is fingered for a murder he has yet to commit, against a man he has never met. The next two hours and twenty minutes see him rushing about trying to prove his innocence.<br/><br/> The slickness with which Spielberg directs this age-old tale of an innocent man on the run is breathtaking. The details are beautifully realised. The acting is low-key and compelling and the script is intelligent for an action film. Minority Report is an exciting, smart thriller with a hefty double twist at the end.<br/><br/> Spend your holiday dollar on this, not Spider Man. You will be rewarded with an intriguing, thought provoking 145 minutes, delivered by the absolute master of adventure movies."

","52 years hence, life on earth is still recognizable and different.  The storyboards required to convert Philip Dick's story to film had to cover every wall in the Spielberg household.   He impresses as the kind of director obsessed with perfection whether at home, at work or wherever he is breathing air.  Were it not so long, this film would be flawless.<br/><br/>It's rife with clever Spiebergian inventions.  The 2054 products, foods, institutions and the toys he preserves are all favorites of mine ... evolved for the changing times.  Butcher-run, ghettoized `eyeball swap' shops have replaced back-alley abortion clinics, in this case, one operated by Peter Stormare (Fargo!) who is truly in his element here.  The dialog is smart, economical and funny.  It syncs with the likable, highly plausible Cruise, Van Sydow and Morton (et al) characters.  Scientific advances have drained the supply of miracles people need; hope is on the wane.  And yet the common cold persists uncured.  The story weaves 100 such elements of life on planet earth as an entertaining backdrop.  Watch closely to 95% of them.  Five viewings may be necessary to catch them all.<br/><br/>The plot deals with 3 people gifted with pre-cognition (seeing things before they occur), with a focus on murder.  The Wash DC cops have a pre-crime division to act on their visions.  Wash DC thus now has the lowest murder rate in the country.  The PreCogs ability to see murder but not a non-murder crime is plausibly explained (a death tears the fabric of life, whereas another crime creates but a ripple in the cloth). The plot, the characters  they all work . . . I even liked the music (classic John Williams). <br/><br/>
Cruise is at his best since Eyes Wide Shut and Risky Business.<br/><br/>So first see Bourne Identity which earned a 10 from me; then see Minority Report on the big screen (9) because it'll lose impact on DVD."

Are they still being held against their will in retirement?

You have got to be kidding. This is from a Philip K. Dick story and the plot is so complex and twisted that I couldn't spoil it for you if I tried.

","Think Tron and Blade Runner meet Minority Report.  Steven Spielberg creates a Science Fiction film noir a la Blade Runner and Tron.  Unfortunately, as always, Steven Spielberg has to trivialize and Hollywoodize the movie, leaching and bleaching the life, substance, and darkness out of it.  This film is in the style of AI Artificial Intelligence, but better; unfortunately not good enough for me to recommend it.  As always in a Spielberg movie, when he has the chance to add lowbrow humor to a scene, he does.  After a while the cumulative effect of these cheap laughs and snickers (yes, the full movie house snickered to the visual gags), is to destroy the dramatic integrity of the movie.  He should review Blade Runner, Dark City, and PI to see how a futuristic film noir can be made.  As he has demonstrated in AI, and this movie, he does not know how to do it. <br/><br/>So much is wrong with this movie: the cinematography is bleached out so it looks like a comic book printed on cheap paper, the music score is derivative (he even used Beethoven!) and detracts from the movie, the acting is one dimensional with comic book style characters, and worst of all he tacks on a glowing pretty Hollywood happy ending at the last couple minutes of the movie.  Sad, hard to believe he is considered one of the great film directors.

The twists and turns in the movie were great.  I will also mirror what Roger Ebert said in his review because it is correct.  Spielberg is one of the few sci-fi directors who uses the special effects as a tool.  Instead of making the CGI effects the who point of the movie, he makes the story the most important part, and uses the special effects to serve the story.

","I'm astonished no one has mentioned the numerous flaws in logic in this film.  I haven't read the Philip Dick novel, so cannot say whether he is to be blamed for them; however, that isn't really necessary.  I'll take a second again to warn the dear reader that SPOILERS ARE AHEAD.<br/><br/>First of all, the foundation of the movie lies on the issue of the Pre-Crime department operating solely within the District of Columbia - the project is only a test and not nationwide, and certainly not worldwide.  Well, riddle me this, Batman - how is it the Pre-Cogs ONLY have information about future murders only in DC?  That seems, even in a movie that begs the intellect and imagination, rather fanciful and absurd - even childishly obtuse.  You, the viewer, are expected to utterly disregard such a fundamental question.<br/><br/>Going a step beyond, it has been expected as part of the project that it would be expanded to a national project - yet the selection of the Pre-Cogs was shown to be a singular, non-recurrent event.  Wouldn't the recruitment of more Pre-Cogs be needed?  But the movie makes it clear that would be impossible.  Spielberg is asking the viewer yet again to put his or her intellect and logic aside in order to make a simple plot point.<br/><br/>Another key scene in the movie is Anderton returning to the Pre-Crime Laboratory in order to extract Agatha's hidden Minority Report - this after having been revealed as the perpetrator of a future murder and on the run from the Pre-Crime unit.  Admission to the Pre-Crime unit is secured by, among other things, a retinal scan of the person's eyes, so Cruise remembers to bring his previously extracted eyeballs with him (fortunately there is no such thing as decomposition in the future).  Well now...beside giving Spielberg the chance to include a cheap stunt scene (Cruise chasing his escaped eyeballs as they roll down a ramp), this allows Cruise entry into the facility.  Let's see...Cruise is on the run from the Pre-Crime Police, they are chasing him from a future murder....and DON'T TAKE HIM OFF THE ACCESS LIST FOR THE FACILITY???  HUH???????????  Why hasn't anyone mentioned such a childishly obvious problem in the logic and plausibility of this essential part of the plot?<br/><br/>I'll address one more gaping flaw in the film's logical structure.  The movie rests on the idea that Cruise is an essentially good man framed in a future murder of someone who he does not know.  Cruise is intelligent, and savvy, and the plot draws inexorably toward him chasing the person to prove his innocence.  Didn't it occur to him to just STAY THE HELL AWAY from Les Crow???  He is even told to do so several times in the movie yet for reasons unexplained continues to pursue this person - HUH???????  Does Spielberg expect all of us to have been born on the same planet of mindlessness on which he was apparently born?  Well, I for one wasn't.  I'm surprised not to have read anyone offer these ridiculous holes in the movie's structure and premise.  I guess people just refuse to watch movies that Spielberg directs critically any more.<br/><br/>And yes, the trademark sappy, over the top and absurd Spielberg happy ending is in full bloom in Minority Report."

As impressive and disturbingly wondrous this film is, somehow when the end was nearing i felt like the movie was not all in one piece.  it was as if the movie was doing so many things at one time, trying to give you insight, action, mixing in future technology, it was hard to keep track of because you are lost in the glamour of the future. one minute you are thinking about the moral of ""what keeps you safe, keeps you free"", and next you are on an enthralling jet-pack chase. like a reviewer said ""This is a film that gives us a lot to chew on, but not all of it has been properly digested."""

","Minority Report is great entertainment, as it should be, and a vast improvement on A.I. (although I still believe that would have been good had it ended 30 minutes earlier in the script). Spielberg's latest does not suffer from its length (a few minutes shy of 2 1/2 hours) and seems to fly by.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is surprisingly good and fans will be pleased do know he still gets to do his trademark 'running-in-the-rain' scene. Max von Sydow is solid as usual and Lois Smith provides some relaxing humour and mischief.<br/><br/>Best of all is the always good, but not always in good films, Colin Farrell who is far and away the most impressive actor on display here. I can't imagine a world in which Farrell will not become a huge star and this is just the sort of brilliantly understated performance (far less showy than his splendid turn in Tigerland) that will boost his career into the stratosphere.<br/><br/>Also good is Kathryn Morris. Morris is an impressive actress with a dynamite smile that clearly grabbed Spielberg's attention when she appeared as an FBI agent in DreamWorks 2000 release The Contender. Also leaping from The Contender to Report is Mike Binder in a small role which he makes the most of.<br/><br/>The biggest negative I can see to this film is that fun as it is it relies too heavily on plot twists you'll see a mile off. One important one is practically highlighted by Spielberg, in a surprising piece of ham-fisted direction from the legendary director, a good hour before the big ""reveal"". This is a shame because what was an interesting idea for a film suffers from cliche and over simplicity. Perhaps after the criticism that came A.I.'s way about over-complication Spielberg has gone too much the other way.<br/><br/>Hopefully Christmas' release of Catch Me If You Can, starring Tom Hanks, will find the balance. Trust in Spielberg, he will return to his great form as shown in Schindler's List, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Last Crusade, Jaws, Close Encounters etc., unfortunately Minority Report isn't it. It's good but not great. Go see it, but don't expect too much and you should enjoy."

With a excellent woven plot, breathtaking visual effect...by ILM of course, and a good cast with good acting...like Roger Ebert said, ""This is why we go to movies."" My mouth dropped at the visual effects, the grisliness of some of the violent sequences, and finding out who actually framed Tom Cruise's character.  I won't give anything away...but I was actually surprised! <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is my hero...and always has been.  After the ridiculiously underrated A.I. Artificial Intelligence, he goes back to the helm for Minority Report.  <br/><br/>I wouldn't mind living in this vision of America 2054, but I don't know about the Precrime part.  The only thing good about it is that it solved the murder problem in the D.C. area...which is obviously good.<br/><br/>Anyway...if you haven't seen this film, you are missing a very wonderful treat.  Roger Ebert, Leonard Maltin, Joel Siegiel, USA TODAY, and many other national newspapers agree that this is the film to see!"
"stevetseitz","8","0","0","22 June 2002"," Spielberg said it: ""Gourmet Popcorn""
","SPOILERS! He was correct. <br/><br/>Positives:This futuristic Hitchcockian mystery is entertaining for almost it's entire length. Cruise is grave and intense and not allowed to mug here. There is excellent acting by even the bit players, many of whom have served adequately in other Spielberg franchises such as the ""Jurassic Park"" series. The integration of design, concepts and human interface with technology is superb throughout the film. Repeat for emphasis: The integration of design, concepts and human interface with technology is superb through the film. Some of the action sequences were fantastic and lacked the cliches of many modern action films. Spielberg showed he is back to his old form as a master of the medium. The future world is neither Blade Runner Hell nor Star Trek Federation Utopia, but it appears reasonable, believable and real. {Side note: With Episode II being watchable and this film it appears Lucas and Spielberg have something left in the tank.} <br/><br/>Nitpicks: The filmmakers included a few moments such as an extended exposition by the old woman (who invented the ""Pre-Cogs"")to bring the slow members of the audience up to speed. Personally, I felt that it was unecessary. I felt that the inclusion of Cruise's wife as a member of the good guys didn't quite ring true. The epilogue message from Cruise that ""Pre-Crime"" was shut down was not needed. In fact, this is the issue that was almost completely ignored. Of COURSE it was shut down!!! You can't hold people, even talented individuals, sedated in a tank of warm milk against their will! The people using the ""Pre-Cogs"" in this film were no different from the computers in ""The Matrix"" . The end does NOT justify the means.<br/><br/>
The first climax of the film was Cruise's character ""Anderton"" defying the ""precognition"" and choosing a new future thus confirming his free will. This should have been the end, in my opinion. After this, the audience is spent, we are emotionally invested in the Anderton (Cruise) character. We don't need a formulaic ""conspiracy uncovered"" sub-plot but we get it anyway.  By the way, if the writers can understand such an important and vital concept as free will why would they need to explain that the ""Pre-Crime"" unit is shut down? How could it continue? Also if the pre-cogs saw the man's wife and her lover killed by the angry husband why not just remove the ""other"" man?  One last nit pick: What was with the Verhoeven-esque commercial for Pre-Crime? It was beneath Spielberg."

","What's to say?<br/><br/>Well, I don't believe that I've seen Spielberg use such experimental camera work before. In fact, I've never seen him do something like THIS before. A.I. doesn't count, folks.<br/><br/>As a man trying to prevent crimes via future-tellers known as ""Pre-Cogs"" (sp), Tom Cruise works hard to clear himself of a crime that he's going to commit in the next two days. <br/><br/>The script works; the camera work, works; the acting works; the ending...was there. However, I didn't feel quite fulfilled by a movie that felt like it had dragged on way too long, but made some sense in the end. I'm glad I payed decent cash to see this flick, because it simply entertained my futuristically-creative self (a-la Robert Zemeckis BACK TO THE FUTURE). People should have fun watching this, but should also make concentrate on the detail that looks so unobvious. <br/><br/>Spielberg intentionally starts the movie with a pre-crime to help describe how the system works to the audience. A good idea, indeed. I credit him for taking an extra step in descriptive film-making. He also managed to fit in some comedy into this Sci-Fi flick of sorts. I've never seem Spielberg do such a thing, but hell, I liked it. <br/><br/>Overall, I was continuously watching. For a movie that's 144 minutes long, it can sure tell a crazy story about how any crime that is committed isn't a crime, until it has actually been committed. <br/><br/>Justice still has a place in democracy."

","Minority Report is a high energy, suspenseful, visual tour-de-force. As with every film that Spielberg directs, this one is no different as far as offering wonderful entertainment and even more wonderful eye candy. Once again, Spielberg proves himself to be a visual stylist of epic proportions--reason enough to see the film.<br/><br/>The story, taken from a short story from Philip K. Dick, is a provocative vision of what crime fighting could be like in the not too distant future. The movie unravels at lightning speed, with plenty of twists, brilliantly directed action sequences and special effects that aren't overblown, but are technically dazzling and always appropriate to the plot.<br/><br/>While the entertainment level is high, one does have to suspend a considerable amount of disbelief to take the film seriously, yet as a pure sci-fi movie, it is credible and convincing.<br/><br/>No E.T. or Close Encounters, but a memorable film nonetheless."

","Steven Spielberg's Minority Report is an incredible movie, though it has one flaw: there's way too much to soak up in just one viewing. I'm going to have to see this one again, and again, and again...<br/><br/>It'a a really great detective thriller with twists and turns all over the place. Funny, shocking, terrifying and thought-provoking all at once, this is one movie that lives up to the hype.<br/><br/>Spielberg is truly a visually gifted director, and he once again works brilliantly with photographic genius Janusz Kaminski...you'll be amazed by how this film can appear simultaneously beautiful and disturbing, which is also due in large part to VFX wizards Industrial Light and Magic.<br/><br/>Editor Michael Kahn does his usual sterling work as well...I walked out of the theatre, looked at my watch, and said ""that movie was two-and-a-half hours long?  It didn't feel anywhere NEAR that long.""  I think that's pretty much the highest compliment I could pay him.<br/><br/>Cruise is always believable as Detective John Anderton, who is being hunted by former colleagues of his from the Washington, D.C. Pre-Crime Unit of the Police. Add in great performances by Colin Farrell as the bad guy, Max von Sydow as the aging Pre-Crime Director Lamar Burgess and especially Samantha Morton as Agatha, the most gifted of the three ""Pre-Cogs"" who anticipate murders and communicate them to Anderton's crew so they can be stopped before they happen.<br/><br/>Also memorable is Lois Smith in a small but important role.  She steals the scene from Cruise, which is saying something given Cruise's incredible screen presence.  Peter Stormare impresses similarly in another scene.<br/><br/>So far, this is THE best movie of 2002.  Smart, funny, thoughtful, and most of all exciting, Minority Report succeeds in all the places that most summer blockbusters fail.<br/><br/>Minority Report is the future of movies. 10/10"
"The_Wood","10","0","0","21 June 2002"," Welcome to hell....I mean the future. 10/10
","Words can not explain how shocked I am at the sheer brilliance and subtlety of Steven Spielberg's newest masterpiece, Minority Report.  If one was to judge the trailers for the film, they would assume that it was just your average run-of-the-mill summer blockbuster that is overrun with dazzling special f/x.  This is not the case with Minority Report; a dark film noir that is bound to become a classic.  If you go expecting action scenes that rival the Mission Impossible films, you're going to be gravely disappointed.  Minority Report is something new and fresh that will reward patient and smart audience members, and  frustrate those who don't know the difference between film' and movie.'  With Minority Report, I'm with the majority who are giving it nothing but praise. The must see film of the summer."

","Everything i expected and more, this movie was intelligently crafted and made with a lot of thinking. The plot was extremely good without the consequences of having any problems such as an unknown ending or an unfinished story.<br/><br/>This movie gave one of my best times in a cinema. This movie is as action is as action packed as any movie like Black Hawk Down, Star Wars: Episodes I,II,IV,V and VI. I must say it was as intelligent as  Spy game and involves some comedy point such as the grossing people off in MIB and MIB 2 ex. the eyeball scene and like the parts where he makes comments, jokes or maybe just a hilarious scene.<br/><br/>They also conclude of many cool weapons like the sonic blaster( of I think it is) and the newly advanced technology of Lost in Space and sometimes it gave me the fantasy feeling of lord of the rings. And yet there are still many thrillers, actions and intelligent movies awaiting to beat the greatness of minority report, I dont think it can in 2002.<br/><br/>
Hopefully all the movies like terminator 3,lord of the rings; the two towers and James Bond: Die another day and a lot more movies are likely to be in 2003 and I think minority report, would still kick ass."
"Baldach","7","0","0","22 July 2002"," Choices of Endings-- Spoilers
","Spoiler included.   Okay I will direct, I enjoy everything but the last 10 minutes of the film. As the the very last scene where the Director has a choice of whether or not to shot John Anderson, I disagreed with the choice the author made. The 3 choices were the Director of the Pre-cogs had was . 1. shoot John, get arrested for two  murders, save the system.  2. not shoot John, get arrested for only one murder, have the system scraped.  Or choice 3 which not get arrested because of suicide.  Even when choice 3 is taken, I disagree with the consequences.  I do not think that the Government would have abandoned the pre-cog system just because of some unintentional deaths.  I can think of several millitary and government projects ( for example: the building of the Hoover Dam) where a person's death is considered ""an acceptable risk"", and the project continues"
"mattyboy1717","8","0","0","22 July 2002"," Good but a bit long
","Steven Spielberg returns to our screens, and I have to say that despite the hype, this movie was well worth watching. Philip K Dick is an extraordinary writer - his best stuff came while he was stressed out and on drink or drugs - and Minority Report is as good a concept as We Can Remember It For You Wholesale (Total Recall) and Do Androids Dream Of Electric Sheep? (Blade Runner) Cruise, who I will admit is not my favourite actor by any stretch of the imagination, is bearable and the opening sequence where he takes on case 1108 is quite exceptional. The cityscapes are phenomenal (I know CGI is much of a muchness nowadays, but even so!) and the execution of cinematography is spot on.<br/><br/>My only gripe would be that at 2hrs 30mins it is a bit long for this type of film. I started looking at my watch in the final segments (not a good sign) and I feel it could have been pared down by about 45 minutes and still had the same impact. Plus, the denouement becomes a little bit too Mission: Impossible for my liking, with too many twists and turns to be genuinely interesting. You end up wondering who has betrayed who, and then even further wondering if you even care. and it has a pat, happily ever after ending.<br/><br/>But it was still, overall, an enjoyable experience, and I would give it a healthy 8 out of 10."
"rich-fnafilms","7","0","0","21 July 2002"," Bergy's Back on form!!!
","Finally Spielberg returns to form with a thought provoking and gritty drama while doing what he does best, eye popping visual effects.<br/><br/>
Although it is sad to see CG effects overused once again when practical and miniature effects could be enhanced instead of replaced, the boffins at ILM manage to drop a lot of their ""gee whiz"" factor from the effects shots, allowing the audience to become immersed in an ""almost"" believable future world.<br/><br/>Effects aside the story is compelling with some ingenious twists and turns and a more adult theme then Spielberg's recent efforts, this being down to Phillip K Dick's original short story. They also touch briefly on the fundemental paradox that is ""if you prevent the crime before it is committed, has a crime actually taken place?""<br/><br/>Tom Cruise as Anderton is actually rather good, the posturing and floppy hair are gone and replaced by a nicely portrayed character that allows you to forgive the travesty of Ethan Hunt in M:I. However it is the supporting cast that really shines, Sydow is once more on form as the director of the precrime department who takes up the father figure role to Anderton, and Colin Farrell is outstanding as the department of justice overseer. Young brit Samantha Morton is not really used to her full potential as the precog Agatha, but no doubt having worked previously with the likes of Woody Allen this will merely be a role that will dump her squarely in the Hollywood limelight.<br/><br/>The main drawback with the story is the schmaltzy Hollywood ending, if only the movie could have finished 7 mins sooner I would have had very little plot wise to grumble about, but this being a blockbuster summer movie straight from Hollywood's desk, I really should have been prepared.<br/><br/>
On the whole a slightly edgier summer blockbuster."

","I would have to say that this is one my favorite movies this year, i absolutely loved it. I have a few complaints but the positive stuff definately outweighs the negative. I think that the reason i love it so much is because unlike other science fiction movie, the future is a pretty realistic vision, theres no flying cars, cities in the sky and not everybody walks around in a silver jump suit with anti gravity boots on. The acting is amazing, Tom Cruise is at his best as John Anderton, and even though i have never been a huge fan of Steven Spielberg, this was a very well directed movie by someone showing us he is more than just a grown up kid. The plot is one of the best ideas ever, what if we could catch criminals before they commit crimes, is it right to arrest someone for something they haven't done yet, definately a moral dilemma. My only disappointment is the last 15 minutes of the movie, with the 'every ends up working out for the best' ending, i think it could have been done a lot better. Overall, great film, great performances, 9/10"

","Spielberg has made many fabulous movies:  Schindler's List, the Indiana Jones series, AI, Jurassic Park, Amistad, etc.  Minority Report without a doubt goes onto his list of great achievements.  All of the actors/actresses are great, the special effects (of course) are wonderful, and the story, while somewhat basic, has subplots and twists.  The action is wonderful and it is also a thrilling movie, there is never a dull moment. Yes, there are some glitches in it, but the general greatness of the film wipes out all of these glitches.  The story is simple to understand, yet incredible.  Note: The introduction to the movie is GREAT!!!!!!  To prove that this is a great movie, I can say that when the movie ended, a few people began to applaud. See this movie; you will have no regrets."

","I enjoyed this film.  Tom Cruise does a credible job as John Anderton of the ""PreCrime"" bureau, sort of like the ""Thought Police"" of 1984.  Colin Farrell is somewhat wasted as his nemesis from the FBI but he does a good job, as well as the elegant Max Von Sydow as the head of the PreCrime bureau.  And the special effects are interesting if not particularly spectacular (I especially liked the vertical highway shots, which doesn't make a whole lot of sense but is entertaining nonetheless).  That brings me to some of the other plot failures (*** WARNING SPOILERS COMING NOW):<br/><br/>       1.  Why in the future is it easy to see precrime but so hard to find an address? 2.  When John Anderton is on the run, why aren't his credentials revoked at his own bureau? 3.  Why does the doctor who he put away actually still help Anderton? 4.  Why doesn't the spider ruin Anderton's vision in one eye when it is not ready for another 6 hours or so?  BTW, the special effects spiders are still cool, though. 5.  How does a human eyeball stay ""fresh"" in someone's pocket?  Plus how does it open doors when not attached to a human body? Technology exists today to detect that already.  <br/><br/>But, flaws aside, an interesting and entertaining film. 7.5/10"

","'Minority Report' belongs to the same genre of films as 'Blade Runner,' known as 'future noir.' These movies share the characteristics with regular film noir (melancholy ambience, stark shadows, creative use of camera angles) and conventional sci-fi, but they are generally much more intellectually stimulating and imaginative than other sci-fi dramas. But unlike 'Blade Runner,' whose sets consist of run-down, Draconian-style tenements and filthy streets, everything in 'Minority Report' is very clean and sterile, complete with ultra-modern architecture. The colors are very subdued, but seem to have a bluish bias to them. The cinematography in 'Minority Report' is very simple and straightforward, and, while not as well-done as 'The Matrix,' is quite beautiful. The plot itself is interesting, (I don't do plot summaries. I do commentaries) a mixture of action, sci-fi, and mystery. While there are several holes in it, it nonetheless manages to stand up on its own and hold your attention. All in all, an excellent film. 4.5 out of 5"

","This is movie looked so cool in the trailers and it didint disappoint. i made sure i didnt know anything bout the story (apart from the premise) when i went into the cinema and i think that i benefited from that as it may have spoiled the movie. there are a lot of twists and turns in the story that it made me think... which is kinda different for a summer movie nowadays. but then again, its not a typical summer movie, or a typical spielberg or cruise movie either.<br/><br/>this film seems a step forward in both the director's and actor's careers. cruise plays a very flawed character which is refreshing to see, and spielberg has completely turned away from his kiddie-friendly event movies of the past. this movie is closer to his 'Schindler's list' than 'indiana jones'. this movie is stylish and really dark, with some jet black humour (like the bit cruise chasing his eyes)which seems to have evolved from 'A:I'. spielberg is clearly moving away from his past direction and stepping into a more dark and adult territory. i doubt we'll see another summer event movie in the vien of 'jurassic park' in the future.<br/><br/>the movie flows well, and it was impossible to guess when it would end cos there were so many climaxes in the third act. there are a few unanswered questioned at the end of the movie but i think that lends itself to the mysterious and dark atmosphere of this film.<br/><br/>there are very few special effects in this compared to other summer films which helps to make this more believable and real and does not swamp the quality of the cast. the effects usea are mainly classy adverts on the sides of walls and city-scapes that soon you get used to them and forget that they are effects. oh, and i must mention the lexus car - which looks so bloody good in this movie. there seems to have been a lot of development on what the future would look like - its not too advanced and therefore seems more believeable to me.<br/><br/>the acting in this movie is great and just what you would expect from spielberg and co. cruise is brilliant and very likeable -  i cant believe he and spielberg have never worked together before. the twists and turns in this movie make you feel uneasy at times and there are some great shocks throughout the movie that would fit perfectly into horror movies.<br/><br/>
this is a different type of work from the two big names who both seem to be moving on in their careers and this film can act as a springboard. but as a movie it is hugely satisfying and works well. kudos for the crew for crafting such a movie during such a pop-movie orientated time."
"mcquestion","Null","0","0","18 July 2002"," Adult oriented Science Fiction
","Greetings all,<br/><br/>Last night I was quite simply bored as hell and decided to take in a movie. You guessed it, I chose the Tom Cruise/Steven Speilberg (AKA Senior Speilbrgo of Simpsons Fame) blockbuster Minority Report.<br/><br/>WARNING This review may contain slight spoilers<br/><br/>The first thing I should mention is my feelings on Tom Cruise the actor. I was yakking with a buddy a few days ago in IM about movies, specifically about the ex Mr. Nicole Kidman, and I'll share those thoughts here.<br/><br/>Most of the time when I see Tom Cruise in an action/adventure type of film, I never get the feeling that Cruise's characters are in any type of real peril in this type of film. I've rarely seen his non-adventure type films (i.e. Vanilla Sky), but I have seen Jerry McGuire, so I'm discounting that as it's a different type of genre entirely), and there seems to be that ""invulnerable Tom Cruise"" going through his attempts at this genre. Witness Mission Impossible II. Nowhere in the entire film do I get any sense that Cruise AKA Ethan Hunt is ever in any danger, despite the incredible fights he goes to, and that bone crushing motorcycle chase and fight at the end. What is the worst that happens to Cruise? He gets a cut on his face. I think Cruise's agent is off screen saying ""don't mess him up too much, it'd be bad for his image"". When it comes to action films, Cruise is no Harrison Ford,<br/><br/>who always makes me wonder if he's going to make it out alive (witness all the Indiana Jones films and The Fugitive for example). So it's rare that I enjoy Tom Cruise in an action film, simply because I always know, with complete certainty, that it'll work out for Cruise and he never makes the effort to make me doubt that. If you watch Cruise jumping from car to car as they descend a huge wall (yes, cars do that in this era), you'll see what I mean. He never really seems scared by what he's doing or the heights he's at, which any rational person would be.<br/><br/>So, did I get that impression in Minority Report? Yes. Did I enjoy the film anyway? Yes. What Cruise lacked in believablilty, Speilberg made up for, but it wasn't a film I'm dying to see again. This film brought up some actual issues that someone can discuss on the drive home from the theater, which is what good Sci-Fi does. For instance, the use of the three ""pre-cogs"", three actual people kept seriously doped up and in a pool of water so that they can predict crimes. ""They're just pre-cogs"" Cruise tells Colin Farrell's character Danny Witwer. How can they justify using these three people as property? Sure, they have a keeper that treats them well but they are basically prisoners, with no lives of their own, robbed of existence so that they might save the lives of normal people. Did anyone ask them what they wanted to do? No. In fact, a major part of the plot revolves around the parent of one of the pre-cogs. Also, stopping a crime before it happens mean that the crime never took place. It's an interesting theory but how do we know it was going to take place? In an attempt to illustrate his point, Tom Cruise rolls a ball across a table and Farrell catches it.<br/><br/>""Why did you catch that?"" Cruise asks. ""Because it was going to fall."" Farrel replies. ""How do you know it was going to fall?""<br/><br/>Cruise's point is that if he hadn't of caught it, can he believe that the ball might not have fallen to the floor? It's supposed to be the same here. Just because they stop the murder before it happens, the fact that it was going to happen is inevitable. Right there I saw the flaw in this thinking. In the case of the ball rolling to the floor, we're talking laws of physics, but in murder and crimes of passion we're talking human nature, which is in no way measurable. Thus, the flaw in the sytem, and it's exploited throughout the film.<br/><br/>Cruise's character in this film was, at least, more interesting than Ethan Hunt of Mission Impossible fame. He has a drug problem, and his son was kidnapped and (supposedly) killed before the pre-crime unit was formed.<br/><br/>The main part of the plot revolves around the fact that the pre-crime unit, supplied information by the ""pre-cogs"", is never wrong. There hasn't been a murder in Washington D.C. in 5 or 6 years. But what happens when the pre cogs suddenly predict that Tom Cruise's character John Anderton, is about to kill a man he has never heard of in a little over 30 hours. Suddenly, Cruise is on the run, determined to prove his own innocence and to get back at the man he believes set him up, Colin Farrell (the future Bullseye in the upcoming Daredevil film).<br/><br/>Much of the middle part of the film is taken up by Cruise on the run from Farrell, and there are some really exciting chases, including a Speilberg classic involving cars. Speilberg loves putting cars and people in odd situations, witness Jurassic Park and the escape of Dr. Grant and Tim as the jeep chases them ""down"" the tree they were marooned in after the attack of the first dinosaur. Again, Cruise and Farrell are fighting in a car that is being assembled by robot arms. There are some tense moments here, but as you can imagine, Cruise comes out of it with barely a scratch.<br/><br/>Eventually Cruise finds the creator of the pre-cogs, and she tells him of the Minority Report. This refers to the fact that while the pre-cogs are never wrong, they don't always agree on what they see. In the strongest pre-cog exists the minority report, which means that for some visions they get, there is an alternate vision of the future that may also take place, and they are stored in her. Cruise knows that there must be a minority report for him because he never heard of this person he is supposed to kill in his life, and there must be a conflicting vision that can prove his innocence. Not to mention it completely destroys the idea that the pre cogs are always right and innocent people may have gone to jail (Cruise didn't know about the existence of the minority report before this, and is outraged that he wasn't told. He believed the system was perfect.)<br/><br/>Speaking of Cruise coming through his action films without any major damage, the worst thing that is done to Cruise is self-inflicted, when he has to remove his eyes and have them replaced with new ones (with the help of a down and out doctor) to escape the eye-scans that are now used everywhere to identify people and tell you exactly where they are in the city. There are some ""ewwwwwwwwww"" moments here and a few people had to look away. This is another 1984-ish element of the story, and it made me think. With post 9/11 security beefing up, this may be more fact than fiction in the coming decade.<br/><br/>The special effects were, as expected, pretty fantastic. It's not nearly as breathtaking as the fantasy world of Attack of The Clones, but that's a good thing, as it's more grounded in what we have in this world and we can relate to it a bit more. The music by John Williams was pretty good, but largely forgettable.<br/><br/>There were some good things about this film that I really enjoyed, and helps it rise above the average Tom Cruise outing. First and foremost, the fact that, as the time for Cruise to murder the man as foretold by the pre cogs arrived, I thought the movie was over. In fact, it was no where near over. That really surprised me and I liked that a lot. You were led to believe that this was the final act of the film, but it isn't. There is a lot more to be revealed and quite a few more tense moments, including Cruise's potential failure as he is incarcerated for killing the man exactly as the pre-cogs foretold. It takes Cruise's ex-wife to rescue him and help put things right in the final act of the film. Another thing I liked was how dark and wierd it was. Usually Speilberg gives us a few kids to come along on the trip forthat ""awwww"" factorn when he does this type of film, but that's not the case here. This movie is definitely adult oriented and the kid sidekicks a la Jurassic Park are thankfully absent here. It's nice to see him breaking the formula.<br/><br/>The bottom line is, this film was enjoyable, more for Steven Spielberg's output than Tom Cruise's IMHO, but that's just my tastes. I liked it for the breaking of the Speilberg formula, for the deeper than usual philosophic questions the film brought up, and for the fact that Cruise wasn't completely invulnerable as he was in MI: 2, though he was pretty close. As I said, the most pain that was inflicted on Cruise was by himself. He routinely takes on an entire team of pre-crime cops and escapes from them with barely a scratch. Still, if you're looking for something to do on a hot summer night, and you'd like some decidely adult oriented science fiction (a rare thing in cinema these days), I'd recommend Minority Report.<br/><br/>Just try and overlook the classic happy ending which kind of made me want to gag."

","I see there are almost 40 reviews on the board already and i wouldn't want to repeat what many people have said. In short, the movie is very well made and well acted but the story is floating in plot holes...<br/><br/>
Like someone said on the board before, the story makes sense while you sit in the theater, but the moment you leave, you'll start to see each plot hole appear and at the end, the whole story sinks in one. Just to list a few: (spoilers!!!) The eye id system is not updated when someone is wanted by the police, so security doors still open. There is a secret tunnel leading to the Temple? The precogs can get someone's name and image but not their location? The whole set-up within a set-up is great for dramatic purposes but way too complicated: it would have been simpler to send the guy on a mission out of D.C. and have him shot there... Why is there a huge emergency drain in the precogs'pool? <br/><br/>Something funny. (more spoilers) The movie has two endings... I nearly left the theater after the prison scene, which would have made a perfect, yet depressing, end. The second end is 100% Spielberg, any more sugar and my glucose meter would have exploded.<br/><br/>My only real beef with the movie: Product placement. Is Dreamworks so strapped for cash that half the scenes must contain product placement? Lexus, Pepsi, Gap, Ben and Jerry's, Bulgari, one hotel chain, more Lexus, and on and on... One good point, I learned that in the future, Lexus cars will be made in America: One more victory for the United Auto Workers Union! This whole product placement thing made me feel ripped off.. Why am i paying the full ticket price if the movie is so sponsored? Next time, let's skip the subtleties and have Tom Cruise turn to the camera, hold up his watch and say ""Good golly, i can show up on time for my appointment because I use this great Bulgari watch!"""

Why did they devote a great deal of time in the beginning to the sprinkler on the lawn, yet Cruise needs to delay for effect by asking about a door being ajar? The story needed the twist of the crime for the Von Sydow's character, but why was murder the only option? Why is the female pre-cog able to visualize and relate to Cruise  in real time all the potentials during a mall jaunt, but needs hi-tech brain wave contacts to get information she's been echoing all movie? Did anyone think that Cruise was going to shoot the guy? I am a sci-fi fan and am able to suspend disbelief for excellent movies like Blade Runner or Forbidden Planet, but I'm sorry, this misses the mark. Good acting, great action, beautiful direction and pictures, but a movie starts with a story, and not just a concept that's cool, but a fleshed out tightly written story that transfers into a screenplay that leaves very little for the audience to ask, ""Why?""<br/><br/>Paul the Redlief"

","#Tons of SPOILERS - but come back after you've seen it#<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>Worked as a pretty solid, clever-ish sci-fi flick.  Nice special effects, and some interesting but still credible future set-design and innovations. Really good lead actors.  Good pacing.<br/><br/>I especially liked the TV/cereal packet, the escape from the car factory, and the realistic (and rubbish quality) holo-projection TV - as opposed to the far-fetched ""perfect 3-D"" nonsense you usually see.<br/><br/>
The gun they used in the car factory was very cool (especially the Winchester-style (Terminator 2) spinning & re-cocking before the next shot) - Tom should definitely have used it throughout the film, it would have been more iconic and given the hero a stylistic focus.<br/><br/>
The Bad: too much humour.  Would Blade Runner work with comedy? NO.<br/><br/>The entirely wooden (and B-list) police team. Tom's equally dull wife (her hologram had much more charisma). The 'kerazy loner' beach-bum scientist working in the Temple. The redneck prison guard (still doing his ""O'Brother"" hillbilly act). The first-murderer-guy from Ellen (miscast, poor acting). The (for no particular reason) deranged woman who designed the system and now (equally for no good reason) tends/creates ridiculous attack plants which belong in a Jim Henson movie. The backstreet doctor (and his unnecessary, OTT assistant), who has every reason to butcher Tom, but decides it's enough to be annoying. Tom's precrime-room assistant - obviously couldn't get Forest Whitaker, and so didn't bother with the character either.<br/><br/>And -<br/><br/>The Pre-Cogs - sorry, really bored with the sci-fi idea that psychics/visionaries are crazy/drugged/mental-patient-types.  I know they explained away the history as having drug-addict parents, growing up in medical institutions, experimented on blah blah blah - but I'm bored of that concept itself, and of watching someone with a shaven head and wide eyed stare pretending to walk funny while managing to avoid a supposedly crack-team of police/agents.  Also - not one passerby stared at the bizarre couple as they stumbled around! Not so much a criticism about the Pre-Cog role in the movie, as about the lack of originality.  Ditto the 'stylish but nightmarish' visions.<br/><br/>The Spiders - what the f..? Did Spielberg have some leftover CGI that didn't get used in A.I.?  If they'd been more mindless and relentless drones it could have been quite freaky (like in that old Tom Selleck film), but the apartment search was stupidly comical.  I expected the spiderbots to stop and do a subtitled gag to camera.  Very nearly ruined the film for me.<br/><br/>The drugs - not a crucial part of the story, but come on! Looked like a cross between a whistle and a kazoo, and - judging by Tom's acting -about as effective (and sinister) as a boiled sweet.  Oooh, let's make him take drugs to deal with the loss of his son, to prove he's a flawed hero!  And while we're on this - that face paralyser did make him look ugly, but that lab technician must have been blind and deaf not to see instantly that it was still him.<br/><br/>The society - with technology so obsessed with scanning your eyes all over the place, and supposedly so hard to hide in, I didn't get that feeling. The Fugitive, Enemy Of The State (and probably several other films) gave a much better impression of hunted, agoraphobic paranoia and 'Big Brother' surveillance.<br/><br/>The elite pre-crime response unit - let's see: jetpacks that make the users so clumsy they couldn't 'take out' an agile five-year-old.. squad tactics that barely avoid shooting each other.. Thunderbirds-style wall-lifts into the flying-vehicles (which George Lucas could surely sue them over), and the comically clumsy wire/chair deployment as if they're all middle-management accountants on an abseiling course.  The jet-pack fight, although amusing, showed up all these criticisms.<br/><br/>The epilogue - Precrime is shut down.  Big deal.  Where's the narration that ""the crime and murder rate gradually increased back up to pre-Precrime levels"", or some reference to his son's unsolved abduction, which would at least give the ending some bite.<br/><br/>=> Before going to see it, I was curious (and optimistic) about the high IMDB score.  Now I see it as overrated.  I just can't understand Spielberg - we know he can 'do serious' amazingly well (Saving Private Ryan & Schindler's List), but just lately Evolution, A.I., Jurassic Park 3 and MIIB2 (all on his Producer credits) have sucked in one way or another because they're just too dumb.  If that seems an odd thing to say about A.I. - well, I didn't enjoy the film, and although not actually dumb, I did think it pandered too much to a very simplistic viewpoint.  You could read more into it if you were so inclined (one person I know saw it as a huge allegory to the Catholic church!) but it's a film goddammit - it could have been much more multi-layered and thought-provoking up there on screen!<br/><br/>Anyway, that would be (some) of my personal DVD commentary.  Having said that, in a nutshell - Minority Report is not bad.  Just flawed."

(SPOILERS) Why do we have to see Tom Cruise back with his wife and she's pregnant.  So, precrime doesn't exist any more, and everything is right with the world again. It is like another fairytale ending that didn't need to be there.  It would have been better if this film was more darker.(END OF SPOILERS)<br/><br/>
The first part of the movie has some slow points and the plot does get kind of convoluted.  And Colin Farrell, who is the best part about the movie, should have been in it more.  And I really hated all the add placements. I mean, I'm sure they put those in there because companies paid a lot of money, but it just makes Spielberg look like a sell out. Are we supposed to believe that new stores haven't come about 50 years in the future. And we are supposed to believe Cops is still on FOX. The Cops show was the dumbest of them all.<br/><br/>
FINAL VERDICT: This doesn't even compare to the greatness of another sci-fi film, the Matrix.  It's worth seeing at some matinee, but just don't go in expecting greatness because you won't get it.  It's more of a murder mystery with just futuristic special effects thrown in."

","I'm going to have to see this a second time before I declare it to be better than 2001.  But I can't remember ever being so eager to go back and see a movie again.<br/><br/>Why is this movie so great?  Because it accomplishes two different extraordinary things that, I believe, no other sf movie ever has -- things that were trademarks of Philip K. Dick.<br/><br/>First, it is an edge-of-your-seat thriller, with action, suspense, and numerous unexpected plot turns -- but it is simultaneously hugely thought-provoking, the way only the most fully thought-out sf is.  Phil Dick's novels have the power to keep you turning pages obsessively while striking you as profoundly insightful.  This is the first movie I've ever seen that pulls off this trick.<br/><br/>Second, it's the first movie ever to capture PKD's unique combination of horror and humor.  This is a future that makes you wince and grimly laugh, simultaneously.  And that tone is sustained throught the whole movie.<br/><br/>Needless to say, it looks fabulous.  And there is even, as you would expect from Spielberg, some sentiment, but it is well-earned (primarily by Cruise, a hugely underrated actor) and had me choked up good.<br/><br/>Then 10 star system just doesn't do justice to a movie this great.<br/><br/>

If Phil Dick could have seen the scene where Cruise chases his own eyeballs, or the scene where he esacpes pursuit by inadvertently having a brand-new Lexus assembled around him, he would have stood up and cheered.  Those are the sorts of amazingly ironic, deeply evocative images that populate his work.  I'm just flabbergasted that the writers were able to come up with a screenplay that's so faithful to his vision."

Three psychics suspended in a watery solution regularly predict murders before they are committed.  Tom Cruise is haunted by the kidnapping of his six year old son seven years before.

"c_price","10","0","0","20 July 2002"," Minority Report and Max von Sydow (SPOILERS)
","Right, I make no secret of being a huge Max von Sydow fan. He is, quite simply, the greatest actor on the planet. From Minority Report's first appearance in his filmography I have checked this and other sites nearly daily to monitor its production. I instantly went out and got Philip K Dick's book and quickly identified the character of Leopold Kaplan in it as the one Max would be playing in the movie. In a sense I was right. The equivalent in the film is Lamar Burgess. But let's get this straight; the film differs substantially from the book, giving a completely different emphasis to von Sydow's character especially.<br/><br/>Firstly, any von Sydow fan worth their salt would be doing summersaults that Max has this BIG a role in this BIG a movie. Hoorah! But some people misunderstand his performance. Just because he doesn't take part in high-speed chases or engage in lengthy emotional dialogues doesn't mean he turns in a 'dull' or over-familiar' performance, as one reviewer put it. Max always gives of his best and here is no exception. Notice that Burgess has relatively little plot-relevant dialogue as Spielberg is obviously far more interested in the face of this great actor, often allowing the camera to rest on Burgess' silent emotions. One great movie writer said that `if there is such a thing as a thinking face, the Max von Sydow has that,' and Steven Spielberg uses it brilliantly.<br/><br/>Undoubtedly Max's best spoken lines are when he shoots Witwer (Colin Farrell), which he delivers with ice-cold precision: `Shhh. Listen. Do you know what I hear?' Having seen the movie several times, this is one of the times the audience REALLY jumps from its seat. But it comes as no surprise to a true fan of von Sydow  we have seen shades of this bad character in Needful Things' (1993)  where Max plays the Devil and in Three Days of the Condor' (1975) where he plays a suave assassin wonderfully. This need not, however, mean we expect him to be a baddie the minute he's on screen, as I've heard some suggest.<br/><br/>Burgess is initially established as a good character, a father-figure to John (Cruise)  strongly reminiscent of Max's bit-part in Judge Dredd', as Sly's mentor. The audience might be led to believe that Max has a fleeting cameo  as the majority of necessarily spoiler free reviews suggest  so it is a shock to discover his significance in the plot.<br/><br/>In short, even as a huge fan of the man, I believe Max von Sydow was brilliantly cast in this brilliant film. Everyone was fantastic; Cruise has finally won my respect, I'll be watching out for whatever Morton and Farrell do next and I'll definitely be exploring the back catalogue of Lois Smith who was exquisite as Dr Iris Hindeman. <br/><br/>Max won't get his overdue Oscar for Minority Report', but I hope Spielberg has shown that he loses none of his magic in a bigger role in a big film than in the smaller American parts he has filled of late. I especially hope this film makes his Swedish countrymen-directors realise what a magnificent commodity they have, so that he can be offered the parts he so richly deserves, there too.<br/><br/>Sydow and Spielberg: 10/10"

I would also defer some of my review to another review that appears on this IMDB for this film, specifically the review by Shark-43, who got it right.  This movie is slick as snot with regard to production, effects, and cinematography (you know, the superficial stuff that is really only important if the movie is ultimately honest).  And, yes it does dabble in some of the darker arenas that plague men's souls.  But the slickness of Spielberg's mega-production ability and the star power of Cruise are not enough to win the day when, ultimately, this movie delivers one of the most Disneyland-like contrived, naive, phony, and pretentious endings I have ever encountered in a so-called movie of substance and intelligence."

","""What d'you think?"" - The common question asked to me after watching a movie. ""I don't know!"" - The second time this has been my answer. The Last Time? A.I. It is now a full six hours since my Minority Report experience and my view is now ""Impressive!"" (Ditto AI, six hours past). For years Spielberg has entertained families and individuals with his storytelling classics but the Hook, ET and Jurassic Park years kept this moviegoer away from from the cinema apart from Schindlers and Private Ryan. Now though, Spielberg has proven himself to be of the class of the great Film-makers a la Kubrick and Hitchcock, wit his two thought provoking Future Dystopia movies. Spielberg himself says he is now making movies for himself. And let me tell you his selfishness is most satisfying!!!!!!!! Cruise is excellent as the flawed hero, Farrel is even better as the cocky, chewing gum munching Federal Agent, but Samantha Morton is most impressive as the troubled pre-cog Agatha, despite the fact that she barely has a line other than ""Murder"" for te first hour. But the real hero here is the script. Some great trading between Cruise and Farrel sets up an instant contest and the quality writing keeps the extremely convoluted plot easy to follow. As for Spielberg: This is two and a half hours of the expert storyteller cum film-maker showing off. This is his Citizen Kane. With obvious nods to Kubrick, mostly Clocwork Orange, it is obvious where his influences are. Excellent stuff Steve. You are now a must watch Director as far as I am concerned!!!!!"
"stuch","8","0","0","17 July 2002"," Good Sci-fi and a pretty good film
","This is a film about seeing things coming. Ironicly, for the last hour or so, I didn't see half of it coming. These twists, however, were not just put in for no reason, when you learned of them, they actually made sense (for once).<br/><br/>Also, for the first time since....maybe Bladerunner, a future world has been shown to me that is pretty much believable. Nothing (except maybe the spiders) seemed to be too far-fetched or out of place. This realistic, futuristic world was only to by (sorry melinda-3) by the advertisements by real companies of the here and now.<br/><br/>The plot, though complicated, is not so complicated as to pull you out of this second world to make you think too much. It is about (as you probably already now) preventing murders before they happen. Based on a short-story by Philip K. Dick (same guy who wrote the book Bladerunner was based on).<br/><br/>The camera work is good, especially when the spiders are searching the floor for John Anderton (Cruise), and camera sweeps across the floor with a top down view, revealing the different people in this futuristic metropolis. Tom Cruise gives his best performance in recent memory and probably ever. The direction is also very good, but we've come to expect that of one of the most famous directors in the past 50 years.<br/><br/>The SFX blew me away. It was not like Star Wars, where pretty much everything that wasn't alive or human was CG. They mixed with real objects, which, also (I'm sorry to go on) added to the overall world that you are being sucked into.<br/><br/>The action scenes were very good, better than Spiderman and on par with that of Star Wars (but of course in a different style).<br/><br/>All in all, an all round decent film, not as good as some sci-fi.

","Yes, I admit it, I hated ""AI"".  So did you.  So did everybody, really.  I mean, deep down, in your heart and in your wallet, everybody hated ""AI"". Here was a film that stole your money and your time and in return it gave you a colossal pain in the neck.  I had, therefore, very low hopes indeed for the titanic pairing of Spielberg and Cruise in a summer blockbuster set in the future.  Surely this movie would suck.  It had to suck.  And yet, it does not suck.  It does the opposite of sucking, which I suppose means it blows.  But that doesn't sound quite right.  Anyway, what I think I am trying to say is, this movie is a million times better than anyone had any right to expect. When Spielberg is on form, as he most certainly is here, there is no one who can touch him.  And the thing with him is that as soon as one film is finished, he's off making another one.  New Spielberg film a bit crap?  No problem, there'll be another one along in a minute.  ""Minority Report"" banishes all memories of the hideous ""AI"", the dismal ""Saving Private Ryan"", the inane ""Amistad"", the ludicrous ""Lost World"", and takes us back to a golden age when Spielberg movies, for all their flaws, were wonders to behold. You want me to tell you the plot?  You already know it, I think: Pre-crime. Cop.  Frame-up.  Mystery.  Double-cross.  Future.  Robot spiders.  Eye transplants.  It really is that simple. While there's nothing in this film to rival the delirious body-warping of ""Total Recall"" or the magnificence of ""Blade Runner"" (how odd that with all the ""advances"" in special effects, ""BR"" still looks fresh and believable while some of the cgi motorways in ""MR"" look like out-takes from the Capital Radio ad) it's still a rip-roaring entertainment, with enough thrills and tension to satisfy all but those sad cretins who sit there, stroking their chins and nodding wisely, noting down all the ""holes"" in the plot.<br/><br/>Some of the action sequences in this movie are up there with the best of them - notably the jet-pack fight and the robotic spider retina scan nightmare, which takes gleeful delight in cranking up the tension to an almost unbearable level.  I could have done without the assembly plant shoot-out (though the guns are awesome (!)) which seems to add nothing to the movie, and in fact just slows it down.  Likewise, the final twenty minutes or so seem much more sedate than what went before.  There is, perhaps, a reason for this, which will be discussed below... But, as well as the great action, there is also time taken to establish characters and make us care about them.  Spielberg, unlike his pal, Lucas, knows that the best movies have great scripts, finely-tuned until they seem almost effortless.  Here, massive amounts of information and potentially confusing details are subtly introduced and woven into the film's fabric. Eye-candy is never the film's only raison d'être.  The film is provocative in its subtle way, raising questions of identity and freedom: the cops are imprisoning people who have done nothing wrong, but don't worry, because the crime rate has plummeted. Immense pleasure is to be had in the details - talking adverts, over-aggressive plants, animated cartoons on boxes of cereal - and the supporting cast (Spielberg has always been adventurous when it comes to casting: remember Samuel L Jackson in ""Jurassic Park""?). There are some great jokes along the way, with Cruise happily allowing his persona to be mocked and ridiculed (the old lady kisses him, the nurse squeezes his ass) and his face to be masked and distorted.<br/><br/>I can't wait to see it again, and no doubt when I do certain things will seem unnecessary (like the aforementioned assembly line and the gags (!) with the rotten food in the fridge) and certain plot points will seem a little too convenient (wouldn't they make sure that Anderton's eyes would not be allowed to open the ever-so-handy back door to the high-security room, once he was a fugitive from justice?) but what the heck.  Criticising this movie for little things like that is like asking why Arnie needed that slightly over-elaborate mask in ""Total Recall""?  It misses the point.  The point being that movies like ""Minority Report"" don't come along all that often, so when they do they should be embraced and enthused over and endlessly discussed.  Compared to the rest of this year's big movies ""Minority Report"" looks more and more like a masterpiece.  Along with the disgracefully under-rated ""Vanilla Sky"" it is a classic of mind-bending cinema, which, coincidentally (?) stars Mister T. Cruise.  What is it with this guy?  Yes, he's made some awful movies.  But the last few years have seen ""Magnolia"", ""Vanilla Sky"" and now this.  Not bad, for someone who so many still regard as a brain-dead bozo.  And, Mister Spielberg, what the hell happened to you?  I could have sworn your best days were behind you. I was wrong.  I'm big enough to admit that.  If you ever come to my house again I'll apologise in person.  Heck, send me the dry-cleaning bill for your suit after all.  I'll happily pay it.  Just call off the lawyers. Okay?  Please? Finally, my theory.  You can call it the phiggins theory, if you like, even though I'm sure others will have thought the same thing (like various people working out gravity or relativity simultaneously in different parts of the world).  Cruise gets caught and is put in prison.  The mad prison guy says something about Cruise's vivid dreams and how they always come true, or words to that effect.  We next see his wife's point-of-view of Max Von Sydow, and, well, you know the rest.  Perhaps this final section is only taking place in Cruise's fevered imagination?  I like this theory.  I hope you like it, too."

The effects were were almost ""natural"" or should I say well integrated into the movie or better yet, incidental to the story-line. I can credit that on a plot that centered my attention on Tom Cruise's character and one mind-blowing assumption about crime prevention gone wrong to his detriment. I give some credit to Cruise not over acting yet maintaining the tension and helping me care for the character. The Oscar however goes to Mr.Spielberg's direction who had the action moving at such a nice clip that the CGI was just part of the story not something that caused me to stop and think, ""how did they do that?""

","First off, Minority Report won't change how you view the world or anything like that. It's simply a well tailored mystery with eye-popping effects, much like Spielberg's A.I. The action sequences struck me as similar to those in Star Wars: Episode II, from the scene where Cruise hangs on to flying cars to the one where he's in a factory and avoids machinery while fighting. The futuristic touches really impressed me, but the fact that in 2054 we still have The Gap and Aquafina was also funny. The comedic touches, while odd, were not so jarring that it ruined the picture. Be warned that the plot is extremely complicated. DO NOT go to the bathroom or get more popcorn if you don't want to miss something. And if you DO wet your whistle, DON'T bug the person next to you about the scene you just missed. It's annoying, okay? Again, if you see something like Men In Black II and then see Minority Report, it requires a total change of mind-set. To conclude, here are some thoughts (SPOILERS): <br/><br/>1. In one scene, Cruise injects something into his neck and his face totally changes. I did not get the point of this, since I never saw how that helped him get inside Precrime Headquarters.<br/><br/>2. Why are the victims and perpetrators of precrime written out on little wooden balls? It is the year 2054, isn't it?<br/><br/>3. The ending seemed too happy after everything that came before it. ALL of the characters end up healthy and content? I'm thinking that Spielberg didn't want to bum anyone out...<br/><br/>So if you can stand hours of techno babble and like to follow mysteries (Jinkies!), then see Minority Report. 3 out of 4 stars."

","The last Speilberg movie that saw was A.I: Artificial Intelligence, that one was all right but it just on the slow side. The this one starring Tom Cruise is much, much better than A.I.<br/><br/>Think of Minority Report a sci-fi version of The Fugitive. Cruise is John Anderton, a police officer who works for the precrime department, and for six years there hasn't been a murder. The system is perfect, that what Anderton thinks. Until something went wrong, he find that he is the next suspect. Just over 30 hours berfore the murder has tken place. But the question is why?<br/><br/>The film as good a any other movie that about someone accused of murder. Like The Fugitive I've just mentioned.<br/><br/>Based on Philp K.

"ocelota_ocelots","10","0","0","15 July 2002"," An Incredibly Well Done Film *spoiler*
","I absolutely loved this movie! Usually in thrillers such as this, I find myself sitting there saying, ""That doesn't work. He wouldn't be able to do that."" Minority Report works extremely well for a movie about seeing the future, which can often get very messed up, or end up not making sense. The only flaw I could find in this movie was John Anderton's eyes. In reality, I don' think he would have been able to use them to get back into the precrime headquarters AFTER he was wanted for murder, and certainly after he was arrested. But who knows, maybe the precrime people didn't think about that, or maybe they were too busy looking for him. Whatever the case, it was easy enough to overlook that fault with the rest of the movie being so amazing. The plot twists were truly awesome. I loved how through the whole first half of the movie John Anderton is saying, ""I'm not going to kill this man!"" but then when it finally comes down to the point when the crime is supposed to be committed, ""You're right, I *am* going to kill him."" The twists were tied into the movie very well, andd I thought it was a definite improvement from Vanilla Sky, which needed to tie its ending into the beginning of the movie a little more to make it work a little better. On a scale of one to ten, I rate this movie a 10."
"Martin Lau","Null","0","0","15 July 2002"," Mostly outstanding. Please chop off the ending!
","I am going to start this review by talking about the ending, because it is the worst part of the film, and I want to get it out of the way, and finish on a more positive note. I'm also going to compare it to A.I. quite a bit, as I think the two films go together, possibly intentionally.<br/><br/> So many Hollywood films undermine all the tension and atmosphere they create by tacking on a ""happy ending""; all loose ends must be tied, the villain must die, and the hero must be inducted into a nuclear family. The reason that I find this particularly sad in the case of Minority Report is that Steven Spielberg is one of the few directors who has the power to be able to override these by-the-numbers script decisions.<br/><br/> The only reason that I can think of for the ending being as it is is that Spielberg actually wanted it that way. I find this bizarre coming from one of the greatest American directors, but he seems to repeatedly put a fly in the ointment. I really admire the man, but I can't think of many of his films that I don't have serious reservations about. He had already said around the time of A.I. that he was done with appeasing audiences, and the proof seemed to be in the pudding; when A.I. continued past what I thought at the time of viewing to be the ""natural"" ending, I thought it was going to be one of those typical Hollywood endings, but I was delighted to find that it was instead a brave exploration beyond the ending dictated by ""good taste"", and a powerful epilogue to the story. Unfortunately, in Minority Report, the reverse was true; I thought: ""maybe it won't be so bad, after all, it worked in A.I."" But it was bad - real bad.<br/><br/> The last few scenes don't even feel like they are part of the same movie, in a visual or stylistic sense. There are still a few good moments, as Spielberg's talents come through despite himself. However, after coming out of the cinema, I was struggling to remember the main part of the film, because the ending had diluted it so much in my mind. Quite an achievement, as most of Minority Report is outstanding. So let's focus on the good stuff.<br/><br/> The look of the film reminded me of A.I. to an extent. Although the image is grainy, it has a certain cleanliness to it (as opposed to Blade Runner's murkiness). The colours are so muted that they are almost monochrome. The design work is also pretty consistent with A.I., for example the weird bobbly cars. For some reason, the visuals put me in mind of Terry Gilliam's Brazil as well, which is rather ironic if you compare the shot of the house at the end of Gilliam's film with the closing shot of Minority Report. In any case, Minority Report is a seriously good looking film, whether we are seeing two guys talking at a table, or a sprawling CGI cityscape. I am often heard griping about the use of computer generated effects in films (no more so than after seeing that modern day version of the animated sequence in Mary Poppins known as Attack Of The Clones), but here we see how effective they can be when used intelligently, and with regard for the limitations of the technology. There very few shots where I thought the CGI effects looked obvious. Mostly, basic techniques such as matching the grain of the effects to that of the film and keeping the ""camera"" moving naturally in effects shots meant that the CGI did its job and served the story.<br/><br/> Editing is not the first thing I think of in a Spielberg film. However, there are many very well thought-out scenes, with quite technically complex editing going on. If you were to see a clip of such a scene, you might be reminded of a more MTV-style film like The Matrix. Fortunately, unlike that absurdly overrated film, there is actually some substance under the style. Spielberg knows how to bake a cake before icing it.<br/><br/> The most basic ingredient in this cake, in my view, is the acting, and what a great bunch of performances we get here. We all know that the Cruiser is much more than just a pretty face, and that Max ""Fall On Your Sword"" Von Sydow is the man, but minor characters such as Peter Stormare's surgeon and Lois Smith's genetic scientist are memorably portrayed, with a good deal of depth. Samantha Morton is extremely beautiful to look at in this film, by virtue of her performance, rather than simply through being made up in the usual ""glamourous"" way. I have to give a special mention to Jessica Harper, whom I haven't seen in a film for ages. The mother in A.I. really reminded me of Harper when she was younger, so it was interesting to see the latter playing the mother of the ""special child"" here.<br/><br/> There has been some criticism of the explicitness of some of the imagery and the language in Minority Report. My view is that it is all justified, and I'm glad Spielberg did not hold back, as I felt he did to a degree in A.I. It is a sign of the times that this content is deemed suitable for quite young viewers. Whether this is a good or a bad thing (or how bad a thing it is) has little to do with the film itself.<br/><br/>To conclude, I thought this was an excellent film up until the last few scenes, at which point it just seemed to switch gear completely. Unfortunately, the ending of a film largely influences how you feel about the whole thing after watching it."

It was a little hard to follow at times and a little confusing, but the plot was good.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg, once again, creates an awsome futuristic world using innovative concepts, like the cars that move up and down the side of the buildings. I am a fan of both Tom Cruise and Colin Farrell and think they gave a great performance.  The movie was suspenseful, with twists and turns that were completely unexpected. This movie was a look into our future and it's not that farfetched. It takes fiction and turns it into reality, to see the computerized world of fantasy that is soon to be upon us.  It makes you think of what our future could possibly be like.  This is definitely worth the money at the box office.  It's more than a ""rental""."

","Minority Report gives us everything we want in a futuristic thriller: it's full of hundreds of details that keep our minds churning, twists and turns that keep us on the edge of our seat, speculations about life fifty years from now, and of course those great moral questions that leave us thinking long after the movie has ended. The film has a dark, Matrix-esque tone, but the bits of comedy are all the funnier amidst the gloom. The movie was twice as rewarding in the theater, where the whole audience gasps and jumps together. At one point I looked down my row and everyone was covering their eyes (the film gets a little gruesome). Besides giving us an intricate plot about whether we are the masters of our own future, Spielberg crams the movie with detail, giving us a glimpse of 2054 Washington, D.C. that mixes familiar, everyday icons with fascinating technological and cultural advances. Minority Report involves the viewer, keeping our minds working as we watch a masterpiece."

","Minority Report is, hands down, the best movie I've seen all year. Spielberg can pat himself on the back for this one. Tom Cruise is the precrime head, John Anderton. When he is accused of the murder of someone he doesn't know, he needs to run. Everyone runs. <br/><br/>The plot is a bit complex, but it is incredibly smart. Spielberg has created a world in 2054 and the world is richly styled and imagined. There are lots of eye candy, including cars that can travel up and down buildings, eye scans for identification, GAP stores that greet you by name. This never detracts from the main focus of the film: discovering John Anderton. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is perfect as John Anderton; in fact, this might be my favorite Tom Cruise movie ever. It's good to see a talented actor like Tom continually take challenging roles. Cruise plays a very cool precrime cop, suffering from guilt because his son was kidnapped from right under his nose. There's also a fine dose of believable, sharp, brawny action. This movie has its scary, 'boo!'parts, but is never corny; takes time to elaborate on details, but is never slow; and is really, one of the finest movies Steven Spielberg has ever made. I recommend it to anyone. <br/><br/>Absolutely perfect. 10 out of 10."
"ooss19","10","0","0","13 July 2002"," A Technical Masterpiece, perhaps one of Spielberg's greatest films, but not his absolute best.
","Steven Spielberg has always been a technical master of his motion pictures. He has always been able to capture exactly what his thoughts are on film and he does so probably better than any one in the history of cinema, but sometimes his thoughts are not so interesting, and some times his visions more interesting than others. Minority Report, originally a short story by Phillip K. Dick, is almost nothing like the short story it is based upon, but yet almost all Philip K. Dick fans claim this is the best cinematic renditions of his work. But in reality, the only ideas Spielberg keeps from the short story are that of Pre-crime, John Anderton running, and John Anderton's conspiracy theories, every thing else is different including the ending, the beginning, and pretty much every thing in between. But Spielberg took it on as his own visionary work and did so marvelously. He designed a world that any one can say holds true to what we all think the future will be like, and made it all look so real. But the real thing that makes this a classic is the fact that Spielberg managed to get a great plot into an action movie."
"wkbeason","7","0","0","13 July 2002"," Doesn't measure up to its potential
","Spoilers here, mates.<br/><br/>There are three primary narrative elements in Minority Report. The first is the action element wherein John Anderton is placed in the ironic position of discovering why the system he has dedicated his life to has predicted that he will commit murder. The second is the philosophical element which boldly postulates that all human activity is predestined to occur unless a given person gains insight into the future wherein that person gains free will and gets to make a choice about their future. The final aspect of the narrative is John Anderton's motivation for being driven by his work and for his chemical addiction  the loss of his son.<br/><br/>If this film is to be justified as truly one of the greatest ever made then that assessment must be based solidly upon the presentation of the narrative material. Starting with the most basic aspects of the presentation  the sound and cinematography  Minority Report deserves rather high marks. The soft, bleak camerawork is quite effective in communicating a bland mood of emotional numbness and experiential detachment that seems to permeate our commercialized, regimented future. I thought the sound aspects  editing, effects, music  all supported this work and help to sustain the atmosphere upon which the three narrative elements could be offered and explored.<br/><br/>It is then up the film's screenplay, directing, and acting to make the offering and to undertake exploration of the narrative elements. Here is where we run into trouble with Minority Report. The innovative cinematography and cool effects end up being mostly an empty shell.<br/><br/>First of all, the screenplay presents the philosophical narrative, but never explores its consequences or establishes any sort of context by which to relate to it through the characters. Its just there. Interesting, but just there. Philip K. Dick does a better job of handling it in the short story upon which this 144-minute summer flick is based (as is also true of the story which gave use the equally mediocre Total Recall).<br/><br/>Likewise, Anderton's loss of his son is shown to us, but we have little reason to empathize with this extraordinary condition. Oh, we see him reminisce with the 3D video stuff and we see him  all too briefly  poolside with the boy, but what exactly was his relationship with his son? How did they play? And interact? We don't have a clue. Instead, we have the standard approach of parents lose kid, parents break-up that we've seen dozens of times  and better accomplished  in other films like Accidental Tourist. There is no depth to John's relationship with his son and we need depth to get beyond rationally caring and into a level of emotionally relating to John's experience and motivations. This, unfortunately, has consequences for Tom Cruise's performance as I will mention later.<br/><br/>The central narrative  the ironic situation if Anderton having to deal with the circumstances of his future murder  is, unfortunately, so devoted to being action driven and an excuse for the special effects that the aspect that could potentially make the narrative special  the irony itself  is in the backseat. It is not as bad as the Lucas-Syndrome of special effects BECOMING the story itself, but that doesn't make it any less shallow. Again, this is an instance where Dick's short story outshines the flick.<br/><br/>The unconventional  and potentially fantastic - underpinnings of the story and the film's technical elements end up being presented in a rather predictable.  At best this is simply conservative storytelling.   At worst it is predictable.<br/><br/>When unconventional subject matter is handled in a conventional narrative expose it is usually either because the material in the screenplay was not realized on film or because the screenplay never gave enough for the actors and directors to fully explore the potential depth. The latter is the case in Minority Report. Tom Cruise gives what either can be described as a subtle performance or a flat one. In Eyes Wide Shut he was criticized as coming off flat when, in fact, he unfolded subtly to match the slow pacing and revelation of that film's content. Here, however, the flatness is justified, not necessarily because of his effort but because he simply didn't have the material to work with and because Steven Spielberg couldn't push beyond the limitations of the shooting script.<br/><br/>In sharp contrast, Max von Sydow realizes more than is there in the script. Here he reminds me of John Huston in Chinatown and does a brilliant job conveying to us motivation, lust for power, manipulation, and  most importantly - inner turmoil as a contradicted character. His performance outshines everything else in the film and, sadly, gives us a benchmark by which to measure the rest of the material and how it is (or isn't) developed.<br/><br/>Spielberg never takes the risks with this film that the material demands. Compare his directorial efforts with those of Ridley Scott in Blade Runner. The latter is a groundbreaking film, an influential effort that helped shape the modern film making style. Scott took tremendous risks in the way he successfully entwined production with substance to create a unique look and feel with enough depth to care about the relationships depicted. In Minority Report, the subject matter is packed with potential, but no one can honestly say Spielberg gave us any relationships to care about outside of the generic sense (wife and husband reunited in the end with new baby on the wayOK, but what did these people to mean each other before? What, for example is Jill's motivation for getting so deeply involved with John's circumstances in the end?). A viewing of Blade Runner involves the viewer more than a viewing of Minority Report.   Ultimately, this is not a profound or innovative film."

"nathan-abrams","Null","0","0","12 July 2002"," A Tribute to Kubrick
","Minority Report (2002)<br/><br/>I was bored during A.I. It was trite, overly sentimental and too long. What had originally been a Stanley Kubrick project had been sanitised and Spielberg-ised and any traces of the late master's hand were excised. With his new film, though, Spielberg has restored the Kubrick touch to great effect.<br/><br/>Based on a short Philip K. Dick story, Minority Report is set in the year 2054.  In the District of Columbia an experimental programme has been set up - the Department of PreCrime.  Here, based on the predictions of three pre-cogs (genetically altered humans), police officers are, supposedly, able to detect crimes before they happen and prevent them.  The (future) perpetrators are then arrested and sentenced to spend the rest of their lives in suspended animation (encased in flotation tanks that look rather similar to those that enslave the human race in The Matrix).  Tom Cruise plays Detective John Anderton, a PreCrime officer, whom the pre-cogs finger for a future crime, sparking off a train of events, in which Anderton flees his former colleagues both to escape arrest and to discover who it is he is meant to kill.<br/><br/>Don't think about the philosophical implications of the film, which are two-fold.  First, there is the notion that should someone be punished for a crime that they have not yet committed? Second, and much more complex, is the idea that the knowledge, and prevention of, crimes does not seem to change the future one iota. Where Jurassic Park touted the idea of chaos theory and that tampering with the past unalterably affects the future, Minority Report skips over the idea.  We do not see how the 'victims' of prevented crimes are affected and how this can remake the whole world anew.<br/><br/>
Philosophical quibbles aside, the film is a good, old-fashioned sci-fi flick. It moves with pace, it's visually opulent, and a damn good story. In one superb shot, we are treated to a bird's-eye-view of the various apartments in a tower block, recalling the opening sequence of Delicatessen. Cruise, reprising similar roles in Eyes Wide Shut and Vanilla Sky, is very watchable and joined by an excellent Max Von Sydow.  Like any good, modern sci-fi, its homages are numerous. The narrative structure resembles Logan's Run, even to the point of Anderton running off to discover and old-timer in an Eden-like idyll. The philosophical time-loop paradox is straight out of Terminator. The vision of the future and its skyscrapers are pure Metropolis and its copy Bladerunner, as is Anderton being both the subject and object of his investigation.  The future dress code, particularly among females, of knee-high boots and short skirts reflects the vision of the future in Starship Troopers. And finally, the references would not be complete without the fashionable drugs, which keep Anderton sane, from Brave New World.<br/><br/>
This future is also very recognisable. While the cars, high-rises, and constantly-updating newspapers may not yet be with us, the Georgian housing of Georgetown is very much of our era. As is the overabundance of product placement from Gap to Guinness.<br/><br/>The Kubrick touches come in both obvious and less obvious guises.  When Anderton has his eyeballs removed in order to circumvent the ubiquitous retina scanners, it matches the infamous scene in A Clockwork Orange, when Alex is being treated for his sociopathic behaviour.  While, the product placement recalls 2001.The less, visually, obvious Kubrick touch is the whole notion of a supposedly perfect system that can break down that drove such films as Dr. Strangelove, 2001 and Full Metal Jacket.<br/><br/>
Despite one or two sentimental moments, Minority Report is much darker than A.I. and hence a much more fitting tribute to Spielberg's former mentor."
"Jenny Ho","9","0","0","14 July 2002"," A meaty story that is gripping until the very end
","The film is set in a future where people are arrested for crime before it is committed, thanks to the information supplied to the authorities by three pre-cognitives.  Tom Cruise plays cop John Anderton who is forced to go on the run to avoid arrest for a murder that he is expected to commit in 36 hours.  Immediately, this is an intriguing prospect for a film.<br/><br/>Following, Vanilla Sky', I was interested to see whether Tom Cruise's next cinematic release would be a more mainstream one.  The promotional posters suggest fast pace action and the trailer I had seen consisted of several cool and slick looking set-pieces: Tom Cruise sorting through images generated by the Pre-Cogs with waves of gloved hands in search of clues to the location of a crime and spider robots scurrying across the floor while Cruise is submerged in the bath.  What I feared was another Mission Impossible' a film with a couple of cool set-pieces but with little substance to the plot.<br/><br/>With Minority Report, it is not non-stop action as one may expect but this is by no means a bad thing.  Instead Spielberg treats us to a meaty story with twists that is gripping until the very end where the plot springs one final surprise with the unmasking of the villain of the film.  Perhaps a less experienced director would have been less ambitious with the storyline and produced a less satisfactory film.<br/><br/>The film has a dark and sinister feel throughout which is to a large extent brought about by the play-back of disturbing and violent visions of the future combined with the pre-cognitives' bizarre appearance. <br/><br/>
A combination of mastery from Spielberg and star power of Cruise have resulted in an impressive piece of work that is both visually and mentally stimulating.  There is however, a little too much techie speak for my liking which does give the feeling later on that I had missed something crucial but that only makes the film worthy of a second viewing.<br/><br/>This could well end up being one of the best films of the year."

There were times when I would predict something ten minutes before it happened, but when it did happen, there was a twist to it that made it much different than what I expected, and took the movie in a totally different direction. What I was most impressed with was Speildberg's vision of the future. It was a clever and seamless joining of modern life, with incredible futuristic visions of a world we can't imagine today. It was nice to see a vison of the future that didn't take place in the post-apocalyptic aftermath of a nuclear holocost, or in a world where machines or a totalitarian govornment has taken power. Tom Cruise was great as a pre-crime officer framed for murder, while Spieldberg's direction only makes the film greater. I loved the contrast between the futuristic surealism of the pre-crime headquarters, and the seemingly present day suburbian style setting we see in the film's opening seen. When you combine the twisting and turning plot with the action-packed chases and the incredible settings, you get a summer movie worth seeing. See this movie before you bother seeing anything else this summer. 10/10."

","When I first heard about this film, it did not particularly appeal to me; I am not a huge of either Tom Cruise or the Sci-Fi/Action genre. However, there was something which made me go and see it, and thank god I did!! This is going to remain in my top ten films ever list!! Okay, so there were a few minor glitches in which belief had to be momentarily dispelled i.e the whole Lara getting into the department using John's eyeball thing (but hey, maybe with all of the huge attention of having the Chief of the department imprisoned, the withdrawing of the access was maybe overlooked). It was extremely suspenseful, emotive, had an incredibly well written script, excellent performances and cinematography. I thought that the use of the futuristic technology was extremely well thought out. It was futuristic enough to show that it was 2054, (and I loved the cars and motorways!!) yet familiar enough to be recognisable as this planet and Washington DC in the near future, setting the familiar landmarks of DC against a futuristic backdrop. My only criticism was the touches of humour in it...I know that Spielberg likes to mix a variety of genres into his films, but I felt that this was unneccesary, and made a bit of a mockery of those aspects. It gave those parts of the film a lighthearted feel which undermined the actual plot. But overall, a really really good film and I cannot wait to own it on DVD!!"

","I had high hopes for this movie, but left the theatre feeling pretty disappointed. A messy, disjointed script with undistinguished dialogue and a plethora of lazy high-gloss S.F. cliches made for a backside numbing couple of hours.<br/><br/>I *should* love this movie - it was certainly trying to push my buttons as a lover of Blade Runner/Clockwork Orange Brazil/Mission Impossible etc etc, but it just wasn't happening. For me the ""futurism"" was too unimaginitive for one thing. Desktop computers in the year 2054?! Cars, roads, video projectors, advertising; it all seemed too drearily familiar.<br/><br/>And the whole shebang about the pre-cogs floating in a vat of fluid comes straight out of the ""how to make a glossy SF film"" book. The one already well-read and better understood by the Matrix guys. Having a whole crime-fighting force based on the powers of essentially one woman (who is described as ""sub-human"" at one point, and then, half an hour later is walking, talking and making eyes at Tom) seems just too arbitrary and precarious a hook to hang a whole movie on. Suspended disbelief comes crashing down around our shoulders. This is not how the world works - not now, and not in 2054. It smacks of script writers' desperation, as do so many of the movie's twists and turns. It would have been smarter, perhaps, to have the precogs as a whole police department, smart-suited workers, not a trio of bleached newts.<br/><br/>It was, sadly, a waste of a great high-concept pitch, mired in a muddy, silly script and some very uncertain direction. This is the Spielberg who made the dire Lost World, not the Spielberg of Close Encounters or Schindlers List. The theatre, I'm sad to say, rang out with derisory laughter at quite a few points. If only Andrew Niccol (Gattaca, Truman Show) had written and directed this one."

Its cool to watch this film and think how far film making technology has moved on since Blade Runner 20 years ago. My only gripe...as a low budget film maker on limited funds...modern Hollywood movies (due to the heap of money that is thrown at them and CGI) have no rough edges. Everything can be enhanced and made. Am I alone in thinking this takes something away from the art of movie making? Not unlike the process of airbrushing reality that is in some ways examined in the movie.<br/><br/>One last thought. In terms of the conceptual ball park this film was in, it reminded me a little of Cronenberg's Videodrome...which was not a commercial success. The difference.....about 100 million dollars in the budget"

","Ahh, finally, a really enjoyable Tom Cruise movie.  <br/><br/>I go to see Tom Cruise because he fascinates me.  Unfortunately, I didn't really like his last 3 movies (Eyes Wide Shut, Mission Impossible II, and Vanilla Sky.)  My fascination with him has kept me going back.  It's been like a series of bad dates, where I keep going because I love the guy, even though his taste in movies really turns me off.<br/><br/>This film was different.  I did enjoy it.  <br/><br/>Tom's acting was superb.  My local critic said that all Tom did in the way of acting was ""grim determination."" These critics make me so mad.  This description was just totally false.  Tom did love, grief, humor, idealism, and drug addiction.  Tom did some positively beautiful ballet-like movements coordinated with music, when controlling the pre-cog displays.  (He really should do a dance movie.  He's got that wonderful muscle tension that would make him such a great dancer and we know from Mission Impossible II that he's got very impressive jumps and kicks.)  He even got really doe-eyed at some points, which I've never seen him do before.  <br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is obviously the right director for Tom.  It's nice that they finally found each other. <br/><br/>Kudos to Samantha Morton as well.  She was utterly convincing as an emotionally disturbed pre-cog trying to break out into humanity.<br/><br/>Spielberg's talent showed in other ways as well.  There were no slow or draggy places.   The special effects all worked very well, never looking jerky or fake.  The suspense was good and held my attention without being unbearable.  The editing was excellent.  <br/><br/>Despite the grimness, dark backgrounds, suspense, and just just general negativity of the whole thing, there were the occasional light moments as well.  I just loved all the comical ways the little mechanical spiders interrupted people's lives in the apartment building, for instance when an angry mom stood in the way of these self-important pre-crime cops and told them off for scaring her kids.  I also loved the way the silly DJ started worshipping the pre-cog and apologizing for his inner thoughts.<br/><br/>Still, you have to recognize that a Tom Cruise film is a Tom Cruise film, and he does dominate it.  For those of us who are Tom Cruise fans, this is a plus.  You get to see him in cutoffs and observe a lot of the results of his body work in close detail.  You also get to see him run, again, which is one of his greatest talents in my book.  His running is SO beautiful.  Other people look flat footed running next to him.  He looks delightfully protective when he puts his arm around Samantha Morton.  This is the kind of thing that just curls my toes with pleasure.   Of course, Tom is always generating marvelous chemistry.<br/><br/>Anyway, the movie is well worth seeing."

","Yes, Spielberg has a good imagination and always gives us surprising ""dreamworks"". He did a great job in terms of cinematography and psychology. He and Tome Cruise together give Anderton not only flesh and bones, but also thoughts and emotions, as real as they possibly can be. However, the only flaw in Spielberg's movies is the ending, or rather, the ""spirit"". Although we have a lot of twists here, every time we think it's the end but it is not, we still know that Spielberg will give us a happy ending, whether necessary or not. Tom Cruise also fails to ""lead"" the movie. Anderton is dragged by the pace of the movie instead of him controlling it. I always think that Roy in the Blade Runner is the perfect example of leading a movie. He is not the hero, but his act makes the film naturally go around him. On him you can touch the spirit of Blade Runner, fresh and whole. Tom Cruise is good enough to be the hero, but not the spirit. Minority Report is supposed to be built around the question about humanity and the meaning of future, but this theme is abated in the actual movie, and actions and visual effects take its place. Spielberg's films are good, but with this foible, not perfect. 8.5 out of 10."

It is more of a ""who done it"" thriller than a Sci-Fi action.<br/><br/>The bad part is that it doesn't make sense in parts.

","This film may appear to be Spielberg's take on a Philip K Dick theme, but underneath it is really a remake of the Harrison Ford vehicle, The Fugitive -- turning that film into a genre distinguished by (a) a protagonist who must solve the crime while him- or (theoretically) herself being hunted, (b) the grand chase scene early in the film, with the whodunit aspects toward the end [a reversal on the old cop thriller formula], (c) a betrayal by a colleague or superior. It is exceptionally well-done (save maybe for the last scene, which is every bit as mawkish and hokey as the last scenes in Saving Private Ryan and Schindler's List -- somebody should tell Spielberg to just cut the final scene of his films) and, in its rather cool machine-like approach to the elements of the narrative, even more Kubrikian in its tone than was A.I.

","************WARNING: CONTAINS ONE OR TWO SPOILERS**************<br/><br/> It is hard to describe minority report. On the one hand it touches on brilliance, the design rationale, the cinematography and special effects are all second to none. The story is compelling and, although it is a long film, the action and story drag you along with it. The ideas and concepts it touches on are thought provoking and interestingly dealt with and the concept of the pre-cogs is an interesting one (although their creation/evolution was not dealt with as thoroughly as I would have liked, but then, I am a nerd for things like that!)<br/><br/> On the other hand, however, it seems a fairly sterile affair. Tom Cruise elicits no real sympathy. The supporting characters are pretty nondescript and Agatha is a bit annoying, staggering around screaming like she just drank a bottle of scotch. And the dark nature of the film (the eye clamps, the ethical dilemma's, the fact that Cruise says the F word, even though it is rated '12' (a swearing first in a Spielberg film, I believe)  is repeatedly punctured by things like the 'comedy' spiders and the rolling eyeball jiggery pokery and there are one to many sugary sweet moments. I felt that we could have empathised with Andertons loss just as easily without as many flashbacks/holo-recreations.<br/><br/> I would have liked Spielberg to have focussed slightly more on the pre-cogs. Maybe a flashback scene to the children's home or an establishing scene of the pre-crime division, showing its teething problems and how the pre-cogs fitted into the system or 'groomed' for the task. But like I said, I am a sucker for a back story.<br/><br/> I enjoyed Minority report in spite of its flaws (although, in the broader sense of things these really were, in fact, fairly minor niggles). It is a solid, well made film and, although there is a certain lack of empathy for the main characters, I feel the story and concepts stand well on their own, driving the narrative forward and allowing the plot to evolve. I think it will stand the test of time and maintain a high position in the IMDB rankings, once the hype has died down and the true ratings emerge and wouldn't hesitate to recommend this film to anyone.<br/><br/> 4 out of five, 1 and ¾ thumbs up, ripe tomato or whatever.<br/><br/>The only thing I couldn't work out about this film (He still had access to the building because the man in charge was setting him up, dummies) was that, if all the pre-cog children died, who was going to foresee murders around the country, when pre-crime went national? Correct me if I am wrong but weren't the pre-cogs borne out of the unrefined version of the drug, which has since been purified? They couldn't use the three existing pre-cogs as they appeared to have a range on their talents (only predicting crimes within the city). And if they did manage to get more pre-cogs, what would be the chances that they would be pretty lame (like the twins) and not oracle-like (like Agatha). I'm confused."

","While I marked down Vanilla Sky for its unprecedented use of subtlety to obfuscate what was really happening, I am glad to say that Spielberg has used the technique to better effect. I always judge a good movie for its lack of cliches, and as such I didn't see the climax until it actually happened. The final dilemma in the movie was excellent and once again we're treat to an unobvious action.<br/><br/>So, what about the world of 2054? Well, it's nice that Spielberg had a bunch of eggheads brainstorm what the future might hold, but I have some trouble believing that so much will have changed in so little time. Obviously, the movie is set in the not-too-distant future so as to leave some link to the present. I do not think that Mag-Levs will be the order of the day. Indeed, Big Oil will still have a strangle-hold on central and state government.<br/><br/>As for the acting... well Mr Cruise performed well within his usual parameters... though at the top end I'm glad to say.

The very real issues of incarcerating people before they commit murder are never pursued and the story turns into a lame crime plot. By 2054, what happened to Constitutional protections? What happened to trials by jury (it is never explored how the pre-murderers are ""convicted""? What happened to search warrants (consider the spiders)? With some exceptions, murder is a local crime: On what legal basis does the Attorney General expand precrime to the rest of the nation? How do people in the world of 2054, other than the very limited cast which consists mostly of police, feel about pre-crime?

","This must be SS's apology for A.I. He seems back in his game again with Minority Report.  I found this movie very entertaining. It was fast paced and had a great cast and great special effects. But that was not the bulk of the movie. The great story is what really made this movie work. There are some great CGI scenes but they are needed to carry the story along. They are not gratuitous like in The Mummy Returns. Most of the special effects are scenes that were seen in the trailers. I especially liked how the futuristic gadgets were handled  as if they are part of everyday life: like the internet is to us today.<br/><br/>The acting here was very good. As I've said before, I am not a big Tom Cruise fan. I think that may be changing. He has been scoring points with me ever since Jerry Maguire. I think he does a really good job here under Mr. Spielberg's direction. I will ask though, if, Mr. Cruise feels like he's being typecast as the man in the mask'? If you look at his last few roles, he's been playing a face-dancer for the majority of them: Eyes Wide Shut  he's in a mask for almost a ¼ of the movie, both MI's and a third one on the way will surely have him changing face again. Vanilla Sky had him in a mask or some prosthetic make-up for half the movie or morebut I digress. Suffice to say he worked well in this role. I should also mention Colin Farrell as Detective Ed Witwer: He did a superb job as far as I'm concerned. He really made you hate that character (I think the gum chewing helped it that respect). Samantha Morton was great and Max was, as always, Max.<br/><br/>I usually don't outline the plot of movies on here and I'm still not going to, I think you get the gist by now. I will say that the plot is a little predictable in places, but the story is still very engaging. I've read a few reviews that mentioned a bleak, dark and even 'Godless'(?), soulless world that was created with MR. I say: If you've read anything at all about this movie, you should know by now that it is based on a short story by Phillip K. Dick. This is the same man who wrote the books that were the basis for Bladerunner and Total Recall. What kind of world did you expect here? If you've read or have seen either of the two afore mentioned titles then you should know he doesn't create a bright shining vision of the future. However, Mr. Spielberg seems to lighten it up a bit. There are parts where you can totally feel Mr. Spielberg's presence but surprisingly (and refreshingly) there are many instances were you totally forget that you are watching a SS movie (I can only guess that's because he didn't write it). So, perhaps some people should do a little research before seeing a movie, especially individuals who have access to the abundance of information as on this very website. Then, maybe, they wouldn't expect so much. Jeez, it is only a movie after all.<br/><br/>All in all I found this movie very enjoyable and worth every penny spent to see it.

Many years have passed in-between them both searching for the ideal project to work on jointly, and finally it's arrived. The story here is that a unit called 'Pre-Crime', which has not gone national yet, has been developed to predict murders before they occur. Using so-called 'Pre-Cogs' (3 people permanently assigned to viewing the future) the cops in the Pre-Crime unit are on stand-by should any future murders be discovered. On this eventuality they race to the scene to prevent it.<br/><br/>But the tables are turned when a routine check of a case reveals the murderer to be Tom Cruise's character, John Anderton.<br/><br/>This is a highly original story in concept, no question.

The future setting certainly provides a more interesting setting for the plot, but the plot itself, while engaging in curiosity terms, ultimately isn't that gripping.<br/><br/>Cruise is fine in his role - a part which requires a lot less charisma than perhaps he's used to portraying.

Spielbergs direction was as good as always, though the story didnt move anywhere near as fast as I had anticipated it would.

It is to a large extent a chase movie but there's also some suspense as to what the chase is all about. The storyline of the film is a genuine examination of the ethics of acting on information about the future. The `pre-cogs' who foresee future murders are kept in conditions no ethicist would accept, but, assuming such an ability exists, there is a very interesting question: Should society intervene even when a future murderer has no present intention of committing the crime? In some limited circumstances people with a strong propensity to commit certain sexual offences and people who suffer mental delusions which make them likely serious offenders are kept in preventive custody but usually they have got there because of earlier criminal acts.  In Spielberg's 2054 the only sanction for a future crime is `containment' (suspended animation) for an indefinite period. As most of the murders are not premediated, and hence not likely to carry the death penalty, it seems you might be better off to kill somebody outside the jurisdiction and then do the jail term.  <br/><br/>The larger issue, I guess, is have we free will, or are our lives pre-determined? There is an easy answer to that; if our lives are pre-determined we don't know what our future holds, so we might as well proceed on the basis that we have free will and therefore are responsible for what we do. We cannot be responsible for what we might or might not do. The Department of Future Crime works to a high order of probability (far higher that could ever be achieved in any future reality but even it can make mistakes -hence `minority reports'). Even so, why should it protect potential killers against their own impulses? Isn't that a matter for individual responsibility? As for the victims, some contribute through their conduct to their own demise eg where a battered spouse rises up against her (usually) tormentor. How do we deal with the narrow legal lines between murder, manslaughter and justifiable homicide? The justice system operates with the wisdom of hindsight and a Dept of Future Crime, in its anxiety to prevent a murder, may act without regard to all the matters which must be considered for a just result.<br/><br/>Still, a superior effort. Enjoyable, thought-provoking and a visual treat."

"CharlesVonFunhammer","10","0","0","21 June 2002"," Wonderful Movie
","Minority Report, simply put, is a wonderful movie.  It combines the talents of Tom Cruise, and Steven Speilberg, both masters of their respective craft. Cruise's performance here is very solid.  He is both physical and sentimental, not overselling anything, and keeping with his character. Although he plays the hero, and is hard not to like, he doesn't do anything stupid within the performance, and serves the story well.<br/><br/>Speilberg's direction, again, goes unmatched.  I was in awe over the technical mastery of the film.  His visuals are both breathtaking, and beautiful, but unlike some special effects thrillers, he doesn't overuse them.  All of the effects, all of the action scenes work wonderfully with one another, and do a good job to serve the story.<br/><br/>One thing was that at times, I felt that the film became too interested in the chase, and not as interested in characters as I would have liked, but honestly, it's a very minor detail.  Cruise's character was done well enough, and the supporting cast although not highly developed, was developed enough so as to support Cruise and the action.<br/><br/>My hat goes off to the production designer of the film, (as well as the visual effects design team, and conception artists), all of the set pieces were amazing.  The filmmakers created a future world that though unreal, was highly believable.  It was a lie that was easy to believe for the length of the film.  <br/><br/>Minority report is fast, fun, and funny at times.  It is dark, and obviously colored to reflect the nature of the society.  The story is engrossing, the effects are wonderful, the performances are very good, and even the cheap scares are scary (unlike a lot of films).<br/><br/>Go see this movie, it's excellent.  If you're a fan of the movies, then you're a fan of what could be.  You'll soon be a fan of this film."
"acarew-2","Null","0","0","17 June 2002"," Spielberg surprises with another outstanding out-there outing
","Spoilers By the late 90s, Steven Spielberg had reached his lowest ebb.  Not content with merely making successful, populist features, he had begun to try and bully his way into awards shows; his triumvirate of Schindler's List, Amistad, and the execrable Saving Private Ryan the absolute nadir of his grossly manipulative ways.  The director broke brilliantly from this tailspin with last year's magnificent AI: Artificial Intelligence, a paean to his dead friend Stanley Kubrick's vision of an android future; the resulting sprawl a dystopian vision of planetary decay and man's hubris topped off with the most perversely Oedipan mother/son relationship in recent film history.<br/><br/>With that tale having been based on Brian Aldiss' short-story Supertoys Last All Summer Long, so Spielberg makes this new-found fascination with bleak parables of future fiction an unexpectedly invigorating 'career' movement', as Minority Report latches onto a Philip K. Dick short story and never lets go.  Unfolding over another sprawling spell --right on two-and-a-half hours-- the film poses a simple question: can you avoid your prophesised future?  Can you change the course of events that will happen?<br/><br/>Minority Report, depicting these, literally seethes with Dick's familiar themes of overwhelming big brother.  Not merely content with setting up a state in which all constituents are inescapable to an omnipresent big-brother --and inescapable, in public locations, from the scourge of 'direct' (ie.personally-addressed) advertising-- Dick authors a scenario in which the police know of murders before they happen; the infallibility of this pre-crime system presuming that intent to murder is tantamount to committing murder.<br/><br/>Based on the seeing capabilities of three genetically-grown 'pre-cogs', children blessed/afflicted with the ability to see future murders, a pre-crime police-force with unlimited powers is in place, piecing together the visuals of the pre-cogs' visions to solve the when/where of murders; stopping them before they are perpetrated.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the crack leader of the pre-crime squad; the archetypal flawed hero whose motivations for a career in pre-crime are completely personal, haunted --as usual-- by the memories of his dead son. Everything changes, however, when Anderton sees himself committing murder, killing a victim he's never met at a point 36 hours later.  He initially flees, but believing his innocence, he returns to try and solve the conspiracy he believes is being perpetrated against him.<br/><br/>Invariably, the film climaxes with the countdown to his moment-of-murder. Aided by the most gifted of the pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), Anderton plays out future time exactly as it has been prophesised, with the wind-up to the pinnacle of the incident recalling the tragic denouement of Chris Marker's short-film La Jetée, and the feature Terry Gilliam made from it, 12 Monkeys; the concepts of time and time-paradox milked for all they're worth. An artfully-staged sequence, these scenes of Agatha leading Anderton through a maze of minutiae and happenstance have a strange, eerie, fatalist beauty about them; like you're in the hands of some unseen ideal of fate that goes beyond the machinations of film, and the motivations of the director.<br/><br/>Spielberg uses many of the same visual motifs he employed in AI here, too; paying the same attention-to-detail as he zips through sprawling a metropolis, and rendering the home of the family-unit a golden-lit enclave of love.  And like AI, Minority Report unfolds out into an extra movement well after it initially appears it will climax; Spielberg unafraid of letting the tale continue on long after the film's main character has reached the plateau of his initial destination.  It would be no surprise if, in that, Minority Report is, like AI before it, classed as 'difficult', 'weird', 'boring', 'overlong' or even 'incongruous'; but for anyone of any remote taste this surprising Spielberg renaissance should be savoured."
"shecrab","6","0","0","9 July 2002"," Finally, a satisfying Spielberg
","At last, a movie that will satisfy and thrill, that will fill you up with special effects and still manage to tickle your brain cells as well.<br/><br/>Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi films made in the last 20 years. Tom Cruise gives a multi-layered, humanistic performance as Pre-crime detective John Anderton, a man bruised to the bone by grief and driven by the necessity of his work. Anderton is compelled to be perfect at his job, ever since the death of his young son years earlier. He knows he's good, and so does everyone else, especially the young FBI agent who wants Anderton's job for himself and tries to discredit him.<br/><br/>The action is intelligent, not noisy and flashy. The special effects, most notably the car-chase scene, are just dazzling, but not so much fantasy that they strike a false note. <br/><br/>The plot is beautifully put together, weaving two stories into one, and chugging along seamlessly, without any noticeable holes or questions afterward. Rarely is a film so well constructed that it raises no questions, but this one is just such a film. All your questions are answered, and without any ""deus ex machina"" plot devices.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is excellent. Max von Sydow, as Pre-crime Director Lamar Burgess, gives a classy, well-drawn performance, as does Samantha Morton, the sensitive, fragile pre-cog, who tries to help Anderton beat the frameup which threatens to put him away forever. <br/><br/>The future in this film is a completely believable one, for a change; unlike the one in A.I., Spielberg's last attempt at a sci-fi film. There is enough of this world still left in the future world of Minority Report that we know where we are, and can relate to it. That makes this film all the more believable and realistic.<br/><br/>I heartily applaud this effort. Well worth seeing more than once, and deserving of some greater recognition than it probably will get.  A superior film."

","I'm somewhat bewildered by a few of the negative comments I've read about Minority Report. This is a superb film! To be sure, it's not Citizen Kane or Casablanca, but it stands head and shoulders above most everything else made this year. It goes without saying that Spielberg is a consummate director, and Tom Cruise is clearly a much better actor than he is often given credit for. But in Minority report it is the entire [large] cast, the spectacular production design and cinematography, and the great screenplay from a wonderful Philip K. Dick story that all come together in a perfect cinematic stew.<br/><br/>Things to look out for include Max von Sydow's stellar performance (as usual), and all the small touches that show Spielberg at the top of his form. His vision of what a real future will look like 50 years out is probably as close (or closer) to reality than most anything else I've seen or read. If you like SF, or Spielberg or Cruise, you will likely love this movie.<br/><br/>There are some passing sexual references, a fair bit of violence, and some *really* gross stuff involving eyeballs, so I would say that kids under 10 or 11 are probably a bit young for this (also the plot may go somewhat over their heads.) But if you like thoughtful action films, you'll definitely love this one. 9 or 10 out of 10."

","This movie brings my attention fully from the beginning until the end of it. You were shown how this ""pre-crime"" works in the beginning of the movie, which is good because it gives clarity of how's the new technology in the year 2054 can help to solve the high murder rate problem. The story of this movie is very innovative, which is about how cops in the future could solve the murders that happens a lot in big cities or anywhere. The ""Department of Pre-Crime"" was invented to stop murders before they happen, and uses three ""Pre-Cogs"" - three person used to tell the future because in their childhood they see or dream a lot of future happenings - I think this was an innovative idea of making a story. Overall, this movie kicks ass because it's very brilliant. I'm amazed of how the story goes in the whole movie, I was delighted by the plot because it's very intriguing.

","I really liked this film. Though it can't match Blade Runner for mixing stunning sci-fi locations and gadgetry with intellectual muscle, it at least has a good shot at being clever and thought-provoking whilst remaining accessible and exciting.<br/><br/>As you'd expect from Dick, the plot is heavily focused on the idea of personal privacy and how far the government should be allowed to intrude on people's lives.  The first half has a few scenes which contain some interesting metaphysics and good dialogue.<br/><br/>The second half loses this, which is unfortunate, and instead turns into a fairly standard and predictable but very well-made action thriller. The chase sequences are smart and exciting, the special effects range from very good to stunning, and the pacing is about right. The plot twists and turns pretty nicely, with a few moments of real unpredictability, though as I said most of it is pretty predictable. It's mostly free of the kind of vomit-inducing sentimentality that ruined AI, though Spielberg's new-found grit and dark sense of humour do waver a bit towards the end.<br/><br/>The acting's solid and the script tight and mostly believable, so all in all I'd say this is certainly worth watching and I'll probably buy the DVD."
"supertom-3","Null","0","0","9 July 2002"," Film making excellence!!
","It has been highly anticipated to say the least. Minority Report on paper should be a truly great film. Spielberg directing Tom Cruise in a story based on a Phillip K Dick story. With such a weight of expectation to live up to, I am pleased to say this is not a disappointment. This is movie making at its best, a magnificent movie that's imaginative, exciting and provoking. It simply put is a classic, it'll take a few years, I suspect, until people view it as a classic, ala Blade Runner, but this is certainly one of the best movies I have seen and is in my top ten for sure.<br/><br/>Firstly the story. The film is set in 2054 when a special pre-crime division of the police is set up in Washington. This is where three `gifted' individuals known as pre-cogs have psychic visions of crimes that are going to happen. The pre-crime unit lead by John Anderton (Cruise) are given the names of the victims, perpetrators and when it will happen, and it is down to them to analyse the visions to work out where. They then have to set out to stop the murder before it will happen. They have been successful, not one murder in six years, and now there is a chance the technologies used in Washington will go national. Anyway enter Colin Farrells as detective Ed Witter, he is investigating how they run and is put in charge. He seems to be scheming. Anyway this system is apparently perfect. John swears by it and believes in the system completely until he discovers that he has been seen by the pre-cogs murdering someone. He has 36 hours to find out who and why, whilst running from his colleagues. On ensues some great action, and your typically good twists and turns in this sort of thriller.<br/><br/>Spielbergs direction as you would expect is masterful and exemplary, definitely a lesson in how to direct for any aspiring film makers. Visually this film is amazing, great cinematography and the special effects are great. They help the film along rather than swamp the film unlike say Star Wars episode 1 and 2 where they were far too reliant on their CGI and didn't bother on the script. This gets the blend right. Top of the range effects and a brilliant script. The film is darker than his usual films and is chilling at times. People sensitive about their eyes may cringe on occasion.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is excellent. He is a great actor and on the evidence of this and the Mission Impossibles a great action star. He does his own stunts and not just that but very impressive stunts and that adds to his action scenes to more of a degree than any other Hollywood star. His performance is very good as the man on the run and also a grieving father who lost is son 6 years previously, a main reason why he joined pre-crime to stop it happening to anyone else. Also good is Max Von Sydow, as the creator of Pre- Crime and Tom Cruises boss. The rest of the cast are very good, especially Collin Farrell as Ed Witter, who is after Anderton. Finally Samantha Morton who is also superb as the Pre- Cog Agatha who is the most important of them. She is very good, and really draws the audience in.<br/><br/>Overall this film is superb, there is the odd continuity error that you expect in any film, such as how come Cruise can still use his eyes in the scanners to enter the Police building. Surely if he is wanted for murder they would ensure he can't enter their building and steal Agatha. Anyway its a minor quibble seeing as how the rest of the film is so excellent with some devilishly good twists. 10/10"

","Honestly, Dreamworks SKG and Spielberg don't really do it for me anymore. AI was an awful piece of work and I didn't know what to expect from this. Cruise is definitely a favourite of mine although the last film I saw him in was Magnolia I really wanted something to restore my faith in him, and I suppose in Spielberg too. So many great talents are making films these days that to me at least Spielberg doesn't attract me to a movie the way he used to be able to. Minority Report is another Spielberg-esque attempt at emulating Blade Runner, a true cult futuristic sci-fi thrill ride, and to a certain extent it's a success. Cruise is dependable, but the rest of the cast is flimsy. Unlike a Bruckhiemer film where 3 or 4 major Hollywood names will star, this film really tries its luck on Spielberg and Cruise as the pulling power names. And if they're your bag, then this film is for you. The plot is just deep enough to keep you entertained, although it doesn't take a rocket scientist to predict what is going to happen, so don't go in expecting a mind blowing twist at the end. Special effects were superb as we have come to expect, especially scenes involving the futuristic methods of transport (but would America really build and implement such an amazing transport system in 50 years!?!?!?!) Yeah OK it's good fun, I enjoyed it, and will probably get it on DVD when it's out. It's certainly in a different league to AI which should never have been allowed to air. Ever. Tom Cruise carries the acting side for me and special effects makes up for the quite loose plot."

It is NOT a ""surface film"" and requires the audience, at least the intelligent ones, to work WITH it. This will be howled down by the masses, but MINORITY REPORT shares much with VANILLA SKY. Aside from Tom Cruise wondering what the hell and WHY, things are happening to him for large chunks of the movie, there is the grotesque facial change once more, reliance on a third party for clarification of events and flashbacks that gradually fall into place.<br/><br/>
As an interpretation - maybe ""adaptation"" would be more appropriate,  of Philip K Dick's short story of the 50's, it is more than reasonable. That is not to say however it does not have its faults. Personally I found the fx straight-up laughable. The panoramic look of the future city with the retro-looking auto's performing their wall-climbing routines, the anti-gridlock ""continuous"" super-highways and the LOST IN SPACE Police choppers were disappointingly Z-Grade and at no stage dovetailed with the remarkably unchanged-looking suburban areas. The Cruise-escape sequence where he performs his aeriel ballet, musical car games and wall and ceiling demolition was juvenile Spiderman/superhero stuff and had no place in the movie. It simply cheapened the whole affair. What held the thing together was the performance of Cruise as the cop heading up the experimental ""Department of Pre-crime""  At this juncture I'd have to say there might just be the teeniest problem arresting and charging someone with a crime they have yet to commit simply on account of three ""pre-cogs"" belief that they WILL do it  A first year law student would have them out before they'd rung home to say they'll be late for dinner! The script was excellent, the interiors of the Pre-Crime center suitably futuristic, although the film's grayed-out look, not far off black and white for much of the time was not so much depressing as uninteresting. Product placement was just wicked, though how many of those tricked-up Lexus's would they sell if they had them? Gotta say, I loved the spider eye-scanners. They WERE good! Anyone notice the extreme similarity between Cruise on the run here and Gary Sinise faring nor much better in the other Philip K Dick story doing the movie-house rounds currently, the sadly underperforming IMPOSTER? <br/><br/>The sublime impression left to me by this film however was just how awesomely brilliant BLADE RUNNER was. That WAS the future. This is Spielberg's ""I know I'm as good as Ridley Scott"" interpretation.  He isn't!

Every movie with Spielberg or Cruise is a blockbuster because the two men are present. The same applies to Minority Report. Once again, Cruise dazzles on the big screen, playing a 'future fugitive', fighting against a foreseen future which makes him a murderer of a man he doesn't know. On the other hand, Spielberg puts in much effort to create a futuristic Washington D.C. which is heavily embellished with maglevs, transparent buildings and, of course, Department of Precrime. The two men working together make the movie a spectacular masterpiece and illuminate it bright and beautiful. As for the story, it is excellent when comparing with A.I. (it should be A.P.: Artificial Pinocchio) but weak in comparison with other Spielbergs. It contains some cliches and some hackneyed fighting scenes which have been appearing on the big screen since Bruce Lee.

The Pre-Cogs forsaw Tom Cruise killing a guy in a pre-meditated murder, giving the film 36 hours to run instead of the usual 1-2 when an emotional, spontaneous murder occurs.<br/><br/>Problem is, murders don't know what the pre-cogs see.

Therefore, without the pre-cogs making the prediction he was going to kill someone, he wouldn't have gone out and set off the chain of events leading to someone falling out of a window.

","Firstly `Minority Report' is a very decent block buster, and can hold it's head high in the release of mostly disappointing fare in 2002. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a Pre-Crime Cop. With the assistant of some genetically engineered pre-cogs him, and his fellow teams, are able to arrest people for murder before they commit the crime (through the visions of the pre-cogs). But it all goes to hell when Anderton is arrested for murder himself - for a crime he has no intention of ever committing.<br/><br/>This movie has an interesting plot. It's quite a neat little thriller with a smart premise (lifted, as such good premises are, from a short story). It's reasonably smart but, relying on the paradoxical nature of time travel stories, is also like a delicate glass structure - looks very good, but prod it a little and it all falls apart. The plot holes can thankfully here be over looked. Other elements of the story seem somewhat contrived to push the story along and, at times, the sheer obviousness of certain pieces is painful to anyone who has any familiarity with the science fiction or thriller genres. Still it's told with enough gusto that I can forgive it.<br/><br/>Cruise is. Cruise. He puts in one of his better performances here, playing the good guy with a hint of darkness (haunted by the memory of his lost son). Still there are shades of his previous roles about him - perhaps due to his acting, perhaps due to the script, or some other element. The man on Cruise's case - Colin Farrell - is more vividly drawn and steals any scene he appears from Cruise. Other roles like Samantha Morton are fairly decent, if a bit one sided in their performance. Overall though there's little to complain about in the acting stakes.<br/><br/>It's the direction and visual style of `Minority Report' that really sells it. It looks wonderful and is sure to be a contender for areas such as SFX when the Oscars come around. The amount of thought that has gone into the style of the movie is incredible - Spielberg, and his cinematographers have invested a lot of energy into creating the world of 2054. Naturally there's some passing resemblance to the bleaker future worlds of `Blade Runner', although the movie doesn't succeed in creating such a memorable atmosphere. There are tons of great inventive touches in the movie and even the much touted product placement is done in a such a manner that it's actually believable and not irritating. Spielberg shows more restraint here, without the need to glamorise every moment. The camera work is spot on, and the action pieces focused and involved. Overall it lends itself into a great cohesive thriller, with a credible sense of setting and time.<br/><br/>Is `Minority Report' superb? For several reasons it is not .The logic flaws are all too apparent at times and there are moments when the movie drags. Still this is one of Spielberg's finest efforts in years, as well as Cruises. It's a smart, gorgeous action thriller that is likely to remain among the best of the blockbuster releases this year. Definitely worth viewing. 8.3/10."

","Spielberg is a living legend. Some people may dispute his movies at times, but they can not ignore his impact on cinema. This is one of his most thoughtful and unique films, though may not be comparable to Schindler's list or A.I. or Saving Private Ryan in certain aspects (my favourite serious Spielberg's films). I'm so glad to see such a gem in the midst of a summer popcorn season. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise can be very good, and he showed it in Magnolia (another favourite of mine by another interesting director to watch, P.T. Anderson) and Jerry McGuire. In this film, he is quite compelling and he has a commanding screen presence, even when he's around so many interesting characters (terrific supporting cast). Samantha Morton is very effective. My favourite character is played by Colin Farrell though. He is the definition of cool!!!<br/><br/>
I really liked the script, which was clever in its use of language. I'm touched at a few places in the film, especially the part when ***SPOILER*** he lost his son at the swimming pool. You've got to see ***SPOILER*** Tom chasing his rolling eyeball; it was the most hilarious scene i've seen so far this summer. <br/><br/>This is a well-made film, like all of Spielberg's films. It is tighter than his last film, A.I. though i prefer the latter mainly because Haley (David in A.I.) is such, such a genius when it comes to acting (and because i wept watching that film). There was a slight disappointment i felt walking out of this film because of all the hype prior to the release of the film. I thought the tone of the film is uneven at places. Some scenes (i.e. the car chasing scene) had an unpolished look to them. Overall, a great film from a great director. 8/10."
"alastair_m","9","0","0","8 July 2002"," It's movies like this that put most other movies to shame.
","It seems that most very good movies that we see now are smaller films. The big-budget studio jobs insult our intelligence more and more but corporate ass holes keep on making them because people keep on watching. But when you think of the better movies of even just the last year, many of them (Gosford Park, Monster's Ball, Innocence, AmÃ©lie, In the Bedroom and Ghost World) are more obscure films that I can't see unless I sit on a bus for two hours. The Fast Runner hasn't even come to my local theatre, and I'm Canadian, and it seems to be one of the best Canadian projects ever. So it's refreshing when a major, major release finds a way of being complicated, involving and exciting all at the same time. Plus it shows that somebody is confident that the general public's brains are more than just mush.<br/><br/>  Minority Report is a tightly woven, emotional, thrilling story. It has action, but is more than just an action movie. Even though it takes place more than fifty years in the future, against a vivid, technically enhanced backdrop, its characters, their motives, and everything about it has a universal tone than rings true, more than many of the lame brained movies which take place at present. Plus, it's the most entertaining movie I've seen this year.<br/><br/>  Most people reading this will know that Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, a pre-crime cop who goes on the lamb with one of the murder predicting pre-cogs, Agatha (Samantha Morton), after he is identified as someone who will soon commit a murder. Anymore exposition would be unnecessary and possibly spoiling.<br/><br/>  The solid, capable cast also includes Max von Sydow and Colin Farrell, but the best performances of the movie belong to Cruise and Morton. Cruise is always real, with his added classic movie star appeal, in one of his best performances. He doesn't play up being the emotionally tortured work-alcoholic that he is, which, in a roundabout way, augments the pathos evoked for that aspect of his character. Morton takes a role that could have been totally cornball and overwrought and makes Agatha's sickliness credible; and her weird mutterings don't come off as some actor trying to be ""weird"".<br/><br/>  The only way a movie like this could get made is with a director behind it who has the studio's confidence behind him, 100%. Nobody has that more than Steven Spielberg who, with movies like E.T. and Jaws, has always found a way of perfectly blending special effects with the story instead of coming off as showy. His pacing feels natural, instead of formulaic; a trait which has proven him one of the most solid storytellers in the movies. He succeeds in Minority Report where he didn't in A.I. Adding humor where it fits in perfectly, choosing a moral dilemma we can identify with and knowing when it's time to end the thing, although I felt it waned slightly, very slightly, towards the end. Maybe I just need to see it again.<br/><br/>  If you generally like Steven Spielberg's work, wanted to like A.I., and like what movies are all about, you should definitely see Minority Report."
"TheMovieeGuy","10","0","0","8 July 2002"," Best Spielberg movie in years with Cruise's best performance! The best science fiction thriller since The Matrix!
","After seeing the Minority Report attached to Star Wars Episode II: Attack Of The Clones I knew I had to see this film. It combines the directoral expertise of the best director of all time, Steven Spielberg with super star talent of Tom Cruise. Now while I'm not the greatest fan of Cruise (His Mission Impossible films are quite silly at times) I do enjoy him in his dramatic roles such as The Firm and Magnolia, and I even liked his comedic role in Jerry Maguire. However, Eyes Wide Shut was terrible and don't even mention Vanilla Sky. Now, not only does Cruise star in an action film, but quite possibly the best film of his career. Spielberg gives audiences not only great special effects, but also great direction, a great screenplay and a cautionary tale of big brother government watching our every move.<br/><br/>The special effects are actually BETTER than those in Attack of the Clones, and the jetpack scene alone is worth the price itself. The only thing to be cautionary about is a weird eye operation scene (Obviously a nod to A Clockwork Orange) in the movie which will make some audience members squeam. Other than that, a TERRIFIC science fiction masterpiece and the best science fiction thriller since The Matrix kicked The Phantom Menace's butt back in 1999! By far the best film of 2002 so far!<br/><br/>After the BORING A.I. and the AWFUL Vanilla Sky Both Spielberg and Cruise are finally back on track! A 10 out of a 10!"

","I was surprised.  I hated AI, and I thought Spielberg was heading downhill into bad science fiction.  Not Friday-Night-Movie-Funtime bad -- just bad. But this was good science fiction, because there was more to it than just science.  Cool gismos and car-chases in space-age Lexuses don't hurt it any, but this movie really has something for everyone.  A realistic Constitutional debate, philosophical questions of determinism and free-will, symbolism that avoids complete cheesiness, great comic relief, lots of fast-paced action, good casting.  Setting it in a world that we can recognize made it almost disturbing in that it was all the more plausible. The very evident dark side of the hero gave it depth.  I'd watch this again and again -- I bet I'd keep finding new angles, new things to think about. And the special effects are great."

It's not quite as great of a movie Speilberg's Schindler's List or Saving Private Ryan, but I can say hands down this is his smartest and most thought provoking film yet. Issues of privacy among others are there and the film let's you make up your own mind. Finally this film is very entertaining.

","Spielberg is really good in reflecting human charms and nuances, and he did it remarkably well in this film.

I like those scenes, reflecting human classes, their culture, reaction to future tech. and manners towards life, those r very well made.<br/><br/>Eventhough i truly like the ending (in term of story wise, eventhough predictable but very well told), i didnt like the way it was ended, by capturing the house, moving backward, outside of house and background near the seaside. i felt empty, there is something sooooo wrong with that kind of ending! anw, a very good work from 1 of my fav director!"
"Dan-Walsall","Null","0","0","6 July 2002"," Very nearly perfection
","Well, just got back from a late night showing of Minority Report and have to say that it is a very good film. Very nearly perfect.<br/><br/>The film is visually stunning at times, the set design is flawless. Not since Bladerunner has every detail of a film been put through a microscope and given a truly believable possible working future. Visions of a utopian dystopia are magnificent, never has a future looked so beautiful yet at times look so bleak, a smart and inciteful look at how the future landscape could look like.<br/><br/>With many ideas taken from our current society and just taking them that little bit further only makes this film stand out more. Surveillance encroachment, prison sentencing (death row) and the whole free will against fate ideaology.<br/><br/>The CGI and wirework do not distract from this film at all and compliment it entirely.<br/><br/>O.K, I hear you say, these themes have been touched on before maybe, well yes they have, but a few things need to be said to reinforce this film.<br/><br/>Firstly, as I mentioned before, the whole fate versus free will issue. Are we pre-determined to take certain actions in our life, and can we ever change this?. This film does both very nicely indeed, without being clumsy or awkward, this is down to...<br/><br/>Secondly, a magnificent story based around P.K. Dicks Original Short, and a marvellous script, that is both intelligent, without crawling up its own arse, and a script that delivers on almost all pointers, it contains wit(very dark at times), resonance, anger, and a real tale to tell.<br/><br/>Thirdly, the direction of Spielberg, wow, he really has decided to stop making the schmaltzy sentiment crapolla that disengenerated him away from his very early films, this film shows that has a director Spielberg has decided to stop playing with his toys and has definately thrown them from the pram, an assured piece, that works on so many levels, and imho his best film since Schindlers List.<br/><br/>Fourthly, the Cruiser, ditto with Spielberg in many respects, Cruise seems to have realised with this film, (and prior films, Magnolia and Vanilla Sky) that he has done to death the big white smile actioner. Tom turns in a performance that is dark, sombre and magnetic. He literally tears of his old persona from past films, in some real laugh out loud moments that are fantastically welcome.<br/><br/>This bodes well for the future of both Messers Spielberg and Cruise.<br/><br/>Some comparisons with BladeRunner are inevitable, but only on a visual level really and possibly the consumerisation.<br/><br/>To sum up...<br/><br/>Minority Report is a Dark, Sombre Techno-Noir with plenty of intelligence, humour, imagery and style in spades. An outstanding Film."
"superjxiv","9","0","0","6 July 2002"," 9.5, true entertainment
","Few and fair between are films that indulge you with original visuals, a compelling storyline, strong preformances, and hardcore nudity. Minority Report lacks in that last criteria, but I'll let it go this time. It's an expertly crafted film. <br/><br/>For those living under a rock (but a rock equipped with a modem, no less) Tom Cruise, aka Penelope's Man-Bitch, leads this epic as Pre-Cop John Anderton. To those rock-dwellers who've avoided the ads and trailers and countless other reviews posted on IMDb and need the up-to-date, in this movie they can see murders before they happen, and its John's job to prevent that. <br/><br/>By ""they"" I mean a trio of ""pre-cogs"" who are so white they make Casper look like Richard Pryor. They lounge in a hot tub and are treated like kings. No, wait, no they're not. They're drugged into submission and live in a toliet (but a very nice toliet) and kept at just the right state of dreams to spew out these predictions. If there's a flaw in the system, is the treatment of the pre-cogs. One character says it verbatim: ""It helps if you don't think of them as human."" Um, hello Abolishment of Slavery, how's by you? <br/><br/>
And you read it right, there's only three of them in the entire world. After 70 years or so, the entire world will collapse into murdering hordes again. I'm breathless with anticipation<br/><br/>But I digress. When Anderton himself is seen in a prevision, he goes on the lamb. One stunt spectacle after another, he's jumping from car to car, he's jumping from Jetpack Guy to Jetpack Guy (Chill! What else am I supposed to call them?) He's even jumping from catwalk to catwalk in a car factory that someone has inexplicably stockpiled with white vats of water whose only purpose is to fall on the guys doing the chasing. I figure its safer not to ask why, just sit back and enjoy. <br/><br/>I find the most clever of the films devises is a question pretty much left unasked. Some people may consider this a SPOILER, so stop reading and go enjoy the movie before you read further. <br/><br/>SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER, there, is that enough Mr. Alaska? He's probably not even reading. <br/><br/>Anderton finds the man in the prevision because he runs, BECAUSE he saw the prevision. He never would have ended up in that room had he not seen it as future event. Isn't this a paradox? Or is it one of those infinity loops where everything always comes full circle? Or have I just gone crossed-eyed. . .<br/><br/>But speaking logically, (which I know has no grounds in a Speilberg picture; leave it all to wonder and faith and ILM) why DO they lock up the would-be killers? Isn't preventing the murder enough? Of course, if they didn't threaten something horrific like life as vegetable, there'd be no reason for Anderton to do all that impressive jumping.<br/><br/>Cheers, <br/><br/>Jon"

"scif100","6","0","0","5 July 2002"," Cinematically -- and Scientifically -- Disappointing
","Back in the 1950's, many science fiction writers were apparently fascinated with the idea that paranormal studies could someday lead to the discovery of provable, replicable, and even manageable extra sensory perception (ESP) in humans. Most of what these writers wrote was rubbish. Some of it was brilliant. The writing of Philip K. Dick generally belongs in the latter category. <br/><br/>The new movie ''Minority Report'', based on a P. K. Dick short story of the same title, concerns the harnessing of human precognition as a tool to prevent murders. As a film, it's only fair - a disappointment, considering that Steven Spielberg directed. I went to the theater hoping that Mr. Spielberg would show due respect for the Science in SF. The basic story, naturally, has considerable interest, and when written it featured state of the art scientific extrapolation; the execution of the movie, sad to say, suffers considerably from obvious appeals to the lowest common denominator. ''Minority Report'' is Dick dumbed down. <br/><br/>In terms of pure film criticism, it's easy to lament a complete lack of character development, a ridiculously stereotyped and predictable villain and gratuitously flashy action pieces, not to mention clunky fist fights and stupid cops that seem to come from a different movie altogether. But as a lifelong devotee of great science fiction, my major objection to ''Minority Report'' is its wildly uneven depiction of the future. Granted, many film-goers might not notice or care, but for me, the little details really stick out: things like cell phones and hypodermic needles that will clearly be out of date in five years, let alone fifty. <br/><br/>Of course, given today's extremely rapid - and rapidly accelerating - pace of scientific discovery and technological development, it may not be possible to present a depiction of our world fifty years hence with any credibility. Indeed, it leads one to wonder: If the 1950's SF fascination with ESP seems quaint to us today, which science fiction fads of our time will be looked upon as anachronistic by our grandchildren?<br/><br/>For my money, the closest any filmmaker has come to capturing the flavor - if not the exact look - of the potential human future was way back in 1968. Stanley Kubrick's ''2001: A Space Odyssey'', made with considerable input from Arthur C. Clarke, is still the best of them all. My advice to Mr. Spielberg, if he's listening, is to pay more attention to period detail and less to fight sequences; you may not please the trailer park crowd, but your film could have far greater impact and more lasting appeal."

"James_P","8","0","0","4 July 2002"," An artistic vision of theoretical premise
","Hardly the seminal work of either Cruise's or Spielberg's careers, Minority Report underscores the areas it does well. In many ways Spielberg's career has latched onto the vision of the late Mr. Kubrick, and the directing in this film stands out not only because of its futuristic vision, but also its method of making what the audience knows will happen suspenseful. The underlying question behind the movie rests with whether or not humans have control over events the pre-cogs say will happen. This test of free will allows the audience to question the advantages and dangers of a more advanced, yet controlled society. Personally, I wish that the movie had done a better job of explaining the system. The movie gives a laughable explanation as to how the system works (heroin somehow leads to seeing into the future apparently.). While I expected something of an action flick, I found myself enveloped in an enigma of legal principles and theoretical situations not coming from the movie, but from my own pondering inspired by the movie. There are few plot holes in the movie, none of them serious enough to complain about (with the exception of the previously mentioned, fallible system. Cruise delivers one liners with his classic wit, and seemingly captures the essence of the feature, futuristic system in one line about a rolling ball. At the same time, I find Cruise's roles to be boringly similar: he is cocky, and then suffers (to some degree through something he helped to create). This seems to be a role molded to fit Cruise's patented acting style, and he comes off as perhaps a slightly better actor than he really is. There are no real other outstanding performances in the film with the possible exceptions of Kathryn Morris and Max von Sydow. The movie allows for some comic relief (even though I never thought I would laugh at a man chasing his eyeballs), and goes overboard with the ad placement. (In fact the movie actually contains ads in it!) Gratefully the movie gives us Spielberg's view on the role of the state in people's lives, but at the same time allows the audience to question this stance. Do the rights of a few override the rights of the masses? Even as such, the ending could have improved, perhaps with a bit (more?) of a voice-over. I would give it an 8/10 because of the artistic vision, and thought provoking film making behind it, but the movie is certainly not one the audience claps for at the end. FINAL GRADE: A-"

","I sincerely liked this film! I think it might even be compared to Blade Runner, and not only because both films are based on the writings of Philip K. Dick. I got the same kick of: ""This might be the future"" (more or less) as I got out of Blade Runner. The futuristic feeling is not only spawn from the technical gadgetry but is also originating from the isolation of John Aderton (Tom Cruise) who seem to spend more time stoned with his holodeck and his past than with real people. In Blade Runner I think the cosmopolitan feeling of the many nationalities of the people in the street and of the commercials also helped made it credible as a peek of the future. The corresponding in Minority Report might be the crazy Swedish eye surgeon Dr. Solomon (Peter Stormare) and his wicked helper Greta (Caroline Lagerfelt).<br/><br/>The film is mostly a suspense action movie, but the above mentioned scene with the eye surgeon is (at least for the Swedish audience) hilarious. The film never goes into horror like Aliens or so but I must admit that the almost humanly crafty robotic spiders were a bit creepy.<br/><br/>There is great acting of Tom Cruise who seem to be enjoying himself and greater acting of Swedish legend Max von Sydow as Director Lamar Burgess.<br/><br/>I rate this film to play in the same league as The Matrix and Blade Runner so unless you really hate SF it's a must see!"

","Spielberg & Cruise, the perfect partners in crime. The depth, darkness, tone, & message of the film all beautifully balanced. The special effects, put in their place, complimenting rather than dominating and well in short, it rocks.<br/><br/>Cruise plays Anderton, the cop in charge of pre-crime. In Philip K Dick's book Anderton is 40 odd and bald, (not a Cruise look a like) but Cruise takes hold of the character and makes it his own. There is no apology for the change and frankly no need. He shows his strengths but humbly shows his weaknesses, giving his character a reality around him that we can all relate to. He's not perfect, but who is.<br/><br/>The cast are all also very comfortable, Max Von Sydow holds the weight of his character squarely on his shoulders, Iris Smith as Dr Hineman plays well off of Cruise and Colin Farrell, (the first time I've seen him) proves he is a face I'll be looking out for again. And that's just naming a few of them. The rest of the cast pulls it together, there is no feel of supporting cast but instead a fluid relationship between them all.<br/><br/>The ""think-tank"" Spielberg brought together was also money well spent. Sci-Fi flicks based this close to our time, (this is set in 2054) have always had an air of failing to them as we were never quite convinced that the future that we were watching was gonna happen. It was just too close. However Spielberg's thought of that and his future is grounded in a more realistic reality. Gadgets galore but they are not that off the wall. They're all worth a look.<br/><br/>The colour of the film adds a grainy tone, the cinematography oozes a rich look and it's another Spielberg, Micheal Kahn collaboration that can be proudly added to both C.V's<br/><br/>I did ponder the fact that it's not perfect. And to say it was would be a lie. I got a couple of steps ahead at a couple of points and I was a bit unsure of the 12 rating it got in the UK as it was slightly more than some 12 year olds I know could take. It's not perfect but what film is? I haven't found one yet. It was great sci-fi entertainment and pulling it apart to slag it off actually doesn't achieve anything. I go to the cinema to be entertained and I was.

The plot seemed too straight-forward, with few surprises.  It was well made, and not as darkly boring as most Spielberg films, and it was nice seeing Colin Ferrell and Samantha Morton doing well in a Hollywood vehicle--oh, and the weapons were cool--and the escape where Tom Cruise jumped from vehicle to vehicle as they raced down the side of a building was no more improbable than the helicopter stunt in Mission Impossible.

Minority Report is an amazing film, a culmination of Steven Spielberg's career as a director. The detail is brilliant and the concepts that ground the film are insightful.

I almost laughed through the chase scenes where Cruise went from the slideways in the future's downtown, DC, to a ghetto alley, to a futuristic car factory (there is not a factory within 30 miles of DC now and I doubt if there is one in the future), to driving a future car down a flower lined road.  <br/><br/>The scenes at Dr. Iris Hineman's Little Shop of Horrors House in the country looked like they were from a different movie and just thrown in to move the plot along. <br/><br/>The acting was fine except for Cruise who played the part like he thought that he was in  MI3. <br/><br/>A good movie but not one thing about it causes me to want to really recommend it to anyone."

"jon-88","9","0","0","7 July 2002"," Interesting idea; excellent movie
","I really enjoyed Minority Report, found it to be  excellent, even great, though not a movie like Bladerunner or the Matrix, which changed your view of what could be done or shown in a movie, or which presented  a truly unique view of what the world could become. <br/><br/>However, it seems like the movie is getting some knocks for elements which are strengths rather than weaknesses.  For example, the product placements are ironic  - they help paint a negative view of the world, where there is zero privacy;  your identity is instantly established and used to sell you pants.  The scene in The Gap did not make me want to buy Gap products; rather it showed the Gap in Hell... the personalized ads weren't even helpful - people were simply offered what they had already bought.  <br/><br/>
Spoilers follow:    <br/><br/>The plot was simple, to induce John (Tom Cruise's character) to commit murder by presenting him with his son's killer.   There is no Minority Report on this; John *will* kill this man.   However, what precogs can't deal with is the case in which the murderer is presented with the facts before committing the crime.  John holds the gun up, knowing he is to kill this man, but also knowing he still has a choice. John's choice is the center of the movie - it proves that people can alter the future by knowing the future.  This is in fact precisely what the Precrime police are doing - creating alternate futures by stopping murders. So if the police can do it, why can't the potential perpetrators do it, if fronted beforehand? <br/><br/>John proves it is possible to choose, even without a Minority Report. <br/><br/>Clumsy plot points included the Justice Dept jerky-guy figuring out where John was by seeing the random name of this random dude on John's home-made computer equipment, right in the nick of time to continue the chase.  That was really stupid and unnecessary. Also, as has been mentioned, using John's eyes to gain access to headquarters - of course his ID would have been revoked after he became a fugitive; I thought John was going to use his old eyes to create a distraction, so he could sneak in.<br/><br/>The greatest character in the film is the mother of the precog project, a geneticist who has created a world evolved beyond anything going on outside of her walls. Tom Cruise's acting was good in this, but a little too neat for me.  If he's a drug addict, it would be nice to see some evidence of that at work - his drug use seemed too contained in his home life, and didn't do any recognizable damage; we don't even get to seem him collapse in a stupor... I would have played the whole viewing-of-the-holograms much darker, maybe complete with him collapsing in his own puke.    Also, some tears would be good, or rage, or despair.   He just seemed sorta sad, which damaged the payoff in the scene showing John's Choice. However, having made that complaint, they must have done something right, because the main thing which stayed with me after the film was the feeling of loss for the missing child - it didn't help to see the wife pregnant or to see the trio hanging out (by the way, when they read, don't they already know the endings?   ... no who-done-its for them)...  I missed the kid at the end.   So any film that is capable of making you feel that deep a sense of loss for a character never viewed in the present must be doing something right. <br/><br/>Finally, what was up with the nurse and the old lady copping feels off of John?  Was that some comment from Spielberg on Cruise's popularity?"

","This is a movie that is nearly perfectly made. It is also a movie that has a brilliantly conceived idea. Very creative. I admire just about everything about it. The direction by Spielberg was typically fantastic. Amazingly enough, I could find almost no holes or contradictions despite the unbelievable risks it takes with time lines.<br/><br/>And, although 8 is a good rating - and I really probably would give it an 8.4, it still didn't quite do enough for me. I was never bored. I was satisfied with the ending. The acting was especially good. There really isn't a whole lot to criticize. In fact, even the genre is one that I have a bias for. But, there was something that kept it from being a 9 or 10.<br/><br/>I think it boils down to this. It was too long and it required too much work. I realize that 2 hours is no big deal, but the intensity and constant mental gymnastics required were just more than I felt like giving on the day I went. If I was less mentally exhausted from work and had all the time in the world, I probably would have rated it higher. Now, that's not the movie's fault, but I have to rate it based on my own experience.<br/><br/>I remember other past/future movies that I thought were great - and I had to think hard to appreciate them too. But, as I think about them as I write this, I realize I wouldn't necessarily want to see them today either. I guess the moral of the story is that any movie is subject to the particular point you are in your life. At least for now, give me something simple. Life is complicated enough."
"excalibur9","Null","0","0","4 July 2002"," Tries hard, but in all the wrong places.
","After a few hours of consideration, I don't think I like Minority Report. For starters, the plot is an almost identical re-working of The Fugitive, and that did it better. Also, the characters seem confused and perfunctory. It wants to be sci-fi, but gives up half-way through. It wants to be a (pre) murder mystery, but you care little about Anderton.<br/><br/>Sure, it looks and sounds good, but it reeks of formula and design, not intuition and ideas. I really wanted to enjoy this film but found myself putting the plot together long before the characters stopped running to think for a moment. On the other hand, it's the first film I've seen in a long while where the FX were given the chance to fall in to the background while the story took centre stage. It's taken ten years but FX seem to be maturing.<br/><br/>Spielberg might just be getting interesting again, but this film feels as if it should have had Harrison Ford in it. I had the same reactions to Minority Report as I did to Blade Runner, and any Kubrick film for that matter: admiration, indifference."
"rdarlington","Null","0","0","7 July 2002"," Majority support
","The first-time pairing of director Steven Spielberg and producer-actor Tom Cruise promises something really special, but their ambitious work only partially delivers. The premise of this sci-fi movie, based on a Philip Dick short story of 1956, is that in a Washington DC of 2054 special humans called ""pre-cogs"" (the most important played by the androgynous Samantha Morton) can forsee future murders so accurately that a Pre-Crime Unit, with Cruise as top cop, is able to intervene and arrest the potential murderer before he kills his victim. <br/><br/>If one can go with this bizarre idea, it's still hard to understand how, at the end of the day, the assailant apparently has a choice. There are other plot incredulties, such as how the Pre-Crime people neglect to withdraw Cruise's corneal security clearance once he himself is identified as a future murderer and goes on the run.<br/><br/>However, if one can overlook these plot weaknesses, a tendency to introduce unnecessary humour, and a couple of sentimental final scenes, the film has much to commend it, above all a roller-coaster action-packed ride with some sharp twists in the tale. The feel of the movie - dark, washed-out colours and hi-tech gadgetry & equipment such as a wall-screen for constructing digital evidence - and the sound of it - music from four classical composers plus John Williams - create a world reminiscent of ""Metropolis"" or ""Blade Runner"" and there are some terrific sequences such as the chase by jetpack-enabled police and a reconnaissance operation by robotic spiders.<br/><br/>
In short, ""Minority Report"" is going to have majority support, but the aforementioned ""Blade Runner"" it isn't."
"suebasko","Null","0","0","7 July 2002"," Billiard Balls Tell the Future
","Spoilers. *** What is this movie about? Three people who can tell the future hang out all day in a swimming pool wearing fancy leotards, as everyone seems to  wear in futuristic films.  What are they doing in the pool? Foretelling the future!  That's all they do, all day!  How did they get that way?  Their mothers used drugs when they were pregnant. (This is your brain. This is your brain on drugs-- hey, you can see the future!) What do they see about the future?  Just the murders.  How do they communicate that information to the people who are not in the swimming pool?  By sending vibes to a machine that makes billiard balls that say the names of the victims and killers.  Okay, are you with me so far?<br/><br/>And Tom Cruise is the guy who takes the balls and goes and catches the killers before they kill.  (He's got em by the balls)  When they catch the almost-killers, they put stereo headphones on them and put them into some kind of deep freeze.  Works like a charm, every time.  But then one day the billiard ball says Tom Cruise is the killer, and he runs away and causes a big raucous so he won't get caught.<br/><br/>There are lots of great moments in the movie.  Tom goes to get his eyeballs removed and replaced, and he ends out accidentally eating a bad sandwich. He goes on a long chase scene, with cops who are flying on little gizmos- it is a scene so much like the Harry Potter Quidditch scene!  For some unknown reason, the chase scene ends out in a car manufacturing plant- and Tom is tossed and turned and banged around, but drives off in the brand new car that was just created around him.  And of course, like in every worthy movie, he can't just drive in the car, but has the sudden need to jump from car to car on a busy vertical expressway.<br/><br/>There is so much weird stuff, dumb stuff, scary stuff, and stuff that doesn't add up in this movie.  The movie is a political allegory, turned into an action picture.  The whole theme is You have a choice.  Even if your future is supposedly predetermined, you have a choice.  That is a worthy theme, and one people should take to heart.<br/><br/>Things you will see in this movie: A dirty bathtub.  Very fancy public housing.  A man with holes in his head.  A rooftop scene reminiscent of Vanilla Sky.  A mad doctor scene reminiscent of Rocky Horror Picture Show. A federal agent who carries a rosary -- come on! A pool boy who takes his job seriously.  People who feel totally trapped by the totalitarian system in their city, but who don't just drive away to a different place.  A laugh-out-loud funny scene about The Gap.  Product placement every ten seconds.  A scene with a strange old lady with lots of plants, kind of a cross between Harold and Maude and Dr. Who.  A man about to kill his wife, where you find yourself cheering for the man, and are sad when he gets caught.  A futuristic world, where everything is all modern, except the playgrounds in the park still have equipment leftover from the 1950s.  A woman who can foretell the future, but when she's in the swimming pool, she can only see murders, not even rapes or other attacks.  But when she's out in a shopping mall, hey, she knows every move everyone is going to make, including the balloon man. That just shows the deep powers inherent in any shopping mall. <br/><br/>
What's weird?  The premise of a plot, where an official would go to complicated technical lengths to beat the crime-detection system in order to murder a woman, when he could just take the woman out of the city and kill her anywhere else in America.  What else?  The fact they want to make the pre-cog system nationwide, when the system relies on children of drug addicts.  So are they going to have to encourage women all over the nation to be drug addicts?  I guess so, so there are enough pre-cogs for all 50 states.<br/><br/>
  And do the pre-cogs ever eat?  And does their skin get all wrinkled from being in the pool all day?  And why do they have to wear matching suits? And why are the pre-cogs sending secret messages to billiard balls, instead of basketballs or ping-pong balls, or even baseball bats?  And do the cops shoot pool with the balls once they've finished catching enough killers? Maybe as the program expands to the 50 states, they could have the pre-cogs in each state send messages to make a different piece of sports equipment. New York pre-cogs could make baseballs, while Ohio pre-cogs could make volleyball nets, while Alaska pre-cogs could make squash racquets.  That way, they could supply schools all around America with enough new sports equipment, so the children could work off their frustrations, so they don't grow up to be would-be killers.  Now there's a plan!"
"giancarlorocks","Null","0","0","21 June 2002"," A sophisticated cerebral thriller...
","It is rare when Hollywood films employ analytical thinking as a prerequisite for the complete admiration of a film. Cameron Crowe's Vanilla Sky succeeded in boggling the viewer with a quasi-masterpiece of storytelling (watch for Cameron Crowe's cameo here as he returns the favor for Spielberg's cameo in Vanilla Sky), and Spielberg's last film A.I. served as a melting pot for ethical and moralistic issues. In Minority Report, Spielberg is at it again brewing up another set of moralistic dilemmas that will have many conversing after the film.       Tom Cruise headlines and adds another fantastic commercial piece to his portfolio that will be highly regarded among film fanatics. He portrays John Anderton, a Pre-Crime Officer whose responsibility is to arrest individuals before they commit a crime. Set in 2045, this experimental crime stopping division based in Washington, follows the visions of three gifted individuals known as the Pre-Cogs'. They foresee the future and cause this special unit to capture the individuals who will commit these heinous crimes, before they happen.  Before going national, this experiment needs the approval of the Federal Government and this opens the door for the film's villain (or is he?) Colin Farrell who elegantly portrays Detective Ed Witmer.      While the scenes between Anderton and Witmer are scarce, when they occur, they are explosive. This is due to Spielberg's spell-binding and intoxicating direction. He sets up the pins and knocks them down in this crafty, sophisticated and cerebral thriller. How does one know Spielberg is masterful? The answer is very simple. It has happened on several instances that Directors who set their films in the future tend to get distracted by the setting and deter the film from storytelling because they are so fixated on wowing the audience with the futuristic sets and gadgets. Spielberg has experience, he is witty and he is the Master of Modern Day Cinema.<br/><br/>     Spielberg does not allow himself to become distracted by the setting and simply uses the future as the focal point for the setting, and not the focal point for the film. Based on Phillip K. Dick's short story, Spielberg makes intelligent use of the futuristic gadgets and all the possibilities the future can offer us, but this cerebral film enables the setting to become part of the film and not the film itself.      The special effects aid in the amalgamation of story and setting as the viewer will be entranced and enchanted with the craft and expertise Spielberg has instilled within this film. The film opens with a direct explanation on how the system works and makes no secret that this supposed highly sophisticated system does indeed have setbacks. From the immediate opening, the viewer is immersed in a feeling like no other as Spielberg and company pull no punches with this cerebral cinematic experience. From the glossy silver color palette of the film, to John Williams' subtle yet conducive score, this film is a testament to the soup of talent assembled for this film resulting in a memorable summer blockbuster. Spielberg's visually stunning film is rich in aesthetic and emotion as well. The performances drive this film to a somewhat typical Hollywood sell-out ending, but the manner in which it is engineered is sheer pleasure. At times formulaic and even predictable, these are minor elements that should not take away from the film's pleasure. As aforementioned, total concentration and immersion is a prerequisite to follow the fast paced script and lively action that accompanies it. One should not mistake this film for a sci-fi actioneer. While the film does contain some clichéd and overdramatic action sequences such as an overabundance of rocket-packing cops crashing through ceilings, the film is a thriller in its' purest form set against the backdrop of a futuristic crime-free society. Instead of demoting his film to action status with overtly orchestrated action sequences and heart pounding scores, Spielberg allows the action scenes to take a back seat to his dissertation on morality and ethics.      The film raises some ethical issues and it seems as if Spielberg intentionally wants to scratch at the surface of these vast and confounding issues. It leaves one to wonder, is this technology a possibility? Would it be ethical to arrest someone based solely on the vision of  pre-cogs' ? Is there room for error? All these answers and many more arise out of this great film that sees Spielberg assembling another fantastic supporting cast. From Max Von Sydow as Director Burgess,  to Samantha Morton as one of the Pre-Cogs to even Tim Blake Nelson (O Brother, Where Art Thou?). This film makes a groundbreaking mark in conception and originality and Spielberg as the captain of this film drives the performances home. Great performances reflect a great director; suffice it to say that this film succeeds on every level of cinema due in full recognition  to the ambitious and masterful Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>Giancarlo's Rating: ***1/2"

In the year 2054, a Washington D.C. cop (Cruise) is a member of a unit that can see murders before they happen.  They arrest the people who will commit these crimes before they happen and a whole paradox of legal ramifications are to be found.  How do you prosecute someone for a crime they haven't committed after you've prevented it from happening?  That is the question.  This film shows that the technology to predict the future comes about by accident like most of history's great inventions.  There is sentiment thrown into this blistering sci-fi adventure as Cruise languishes over the death of a child and the break-up of his marriage.

","Tom Cruise will be known for his cocky, grinning characters in Mission: Impossible, A Few Good Men, and Top Gun--thus excluding him from the list of great character actors.  Steven Spielberg will be best known for his action/dramas such as Indiana Jones, Jaws, and Jurassic Park. Unfortunately, their venture together, ""MINORITY REPORT"", comes across as nothing particularly new or fresh.  It lacks both the drama of Spielberg's 80s movies and the tension of his war and horror films. Cruise is once again Ethan Hunt evading the bad guys in an story looking like a hodgepodge of Blade Runner, A Clockwork Orange, and the Matrix. The ability to sin is one of mankind's biggest question marks as to whether denying it will cause a lack of the feeling of being human. By removing it as shown in the movie, as we learned in ""Clockwork"", society loses much of its power.  But the plot of the movie becomes so complicated (and complex) that it becomes--more or less--Mission: Impossible with Indiana Jones set in 2054 with an annoying blueish hue to the film.  The story was too long and had enough material in it for two movies--but I guess Spielberg doesn't want to worry about the success of MINORITY REPORT II."

","I loved this movie; since 2002 isn't over yet; I can say weather it's the best; but I'm sure it's right up there. It's a summer blockbuster at it's best. Not since Indiana Jones and The Last Crusade has Speilberg brought us such a fun flick. There is some thinking required (others stating they left in the middle of it and that they didn't like the movie is proof of that); but if you enjoy good movies; make this one to see. SPOILERS FOLLOW.<br/><br/>It's pure Sci-Fi fun. More fun than ""Blade-Runner"" and ""Total Recall"" combined. It's also very intelligent. Many missed the line when the prison guard said that Anderton's prison time will be a dream come true. And it was, the bad guy died, Pre-Crime was shut down, he and his wife got back together, and the precogs are set free to live on their own. I'm surprised so many missed this point. We never find out what happens to Pre-Crime and the precogs; it was all in his dream.<br/><br/>Also I love how they turn a ""good guy"" in to a ""bad guy"" and a ""bad guy"" in to a ""good guy"". The little twist and turns will have you guessing well after the movie is over. If you take it from my previous mentioned POV; you still don't know exactly what happened.<br/><br/>In the end; if you go and expect an absolutely perfect film; you will leave disapointed. Speilberg; over the course of nearly 30 years, is given such a high standard by fans, that he has trouble living up to the perfection that fans demand. George Lucas has that same problem. Remember: These are just movies, don't be so picky."

","This movie is likely the most awful I've ever seen.  I did not appreciate the graphic portrayals of murder, nor did I want to be frightened repeatedly.  This movie should not be seen by children, and it should not be PG-13.  If I had realized what I was paying to see would be so gruesome, I would never have entered the theater.  I regret the time I spent watching it."

","Spielberg has been on a great film run -- creating two highly experimental yet so amazingly intelligent films in two years (""A.I"" and this such film). I must say ""Minority Report"" is definetly the one that risks more, that uses real challenging ideas and puts them to use in the best effect possible.<br/><br/>Every single shot in this film appears to be nearly flawless; and the rather confusing idea of Pre - Crime (which could be lost on the majority of viewers) is told with painstaking detail with such a fast pace that it immerses you totally into the film.<br/><br/>The acting, the cinematography, and scene after scene... it's just that everything seems to work in such a great amazing way. It's such an important film, really -- it's something that I have never really seen before. Some of the minor ideas may not be entirely original, adimittenly. But the story told is such an amazing story that it doesn't seem to matter. The direction, acting and cinematography truly make this film seem nearly entirely original.<br/><br/>One of Speilberg's best."

","I was a little disappointed at Minority Report. It had been described as the best SciFi movie since BladeRunner -- but it certainly isn't. In fact, it's actually no more than an above average movie. Bad points - it's unoriginal (you'll find yourself identifying bits from other movies), it's silly in parts (lots of plot holes), it's too long (2½ hours). Good points - it keeps your attention (most of the time), some futuristic ideas are interesting, and... well that's it actually. Tom Cruise is great when he plays ""himself"" (a woman-hating egomaniac in Magnolia; a rich brat is Vanilla Sky; Action Man in Mission Impossible) but he's hopeless ""out of character"".<br/><br/>This movie - like AI - is way better than the standard movie fare (especially a summer release) but - like AI - it will be quickly forgotten. Spielberg continues to turn interesting ideas into ordinary movies. Now if Ridley Scott had directed this movie... 7/10"

","Very interesting premise.  I thought Tom Cruise's acting to be top notch. You know, although I've never met the guy, I personally don't like him. What I read of his personal life leaves a bad taste.  But then I see him on screen and it's hard not to like him.  Oh well.<br/><br/>Overall I gave the movie a 7.  I would have scored it higher but I found it too predictable.  Movie trailers shouldn't give away so much of the movie. Since I knew what was going to happen to John Anderton, I could scrutinize the movie from the beginning - hence I figured out who the bad guy(s) would be way too soon.<br/><br/>*** Low grade spoiler ***<br/><br/>I have a question for you people out there.  In the scene where John is getting his eyes, the surgeon threatens revenge on John because John had sent him to prison.  Did he ever carry out his threat?  Send me a message."

The camera angles were nice, but some of the jokes were rather disgusting. What really made me admire this movie were the little things, like Danny (his name is Danny in the movie, not Ed!) Witwer kissing his cross before they fight at the factory and near the end.  I liked the little waves people gave each other, like John to the couple in the car that he jumps on and Danny in the car as John runs.  The acting was good and some outshone others.

"StarCastle99","Null","0","0","4 July 2002"," A Self Indulgent Film Largely Inaccessible to the Movie Goer
","First, I'm a filmmaker, but I'm not Steven Spielberg.  I recognize he holds a revered position in the Industry.  As Steven knows, not every film is going to be an ET or CE3K or Jaws.  Those films were driven by great stories punctuated with superb (for their time) special visual effects.  Don't believe me, read the writings of William Goldman, argueably one of the best screenwriters of our era.  Without a story, you don't have a movie. Phil Dick is one fine writer, but his stories don't always translate into screenplays. The same is true of Isaac Asimov. Only one of his 458 novels was ever a hit movie (The Fantastic Voyage). So Steven makes up for a twisted, swiss cheese of a plot with lots of eye candy, even virtual sets. Now, to Tom Cruise.  His recent remarks about America aside, he is probably the weakest bankable actor on the ""A"" list.  The only film, in his filmography, that has ever stretched him as an actor was ""Born on the Fourth of July"". I believe he was stretched by the material and director Oliver Stone. He is simply not on a par with Mel Gibson, Russell Crowe, or even the mature John Travolta.  His performances are rather unidimensional, and he fails to give his characters much in the way of nuance.<br/><br/>I'm as big a fan of Steven Spielberg as any, but I'm not a naif who says he loves everything he ever did.  Steven had his stinkeroo(s); we all do.  Does anybody remember ""Howard the Duck"" (George Lucas).<br/><br/>This film gets 4/10 for its visuals and audio design.  Story - no, direction (take away the Louma Crane, Wescam and Steady Cam) and it falls flat. Moreover, I think this was Steven's most self indulgent exercise in filmmaking. Come on Steven, you can do better and you don't need Mr. Cruise. Kudos to Gerald Mollen for keeping this runaway train on track."
"maria-87","Null","0","0","3 July 2002"," Fascinating collection of plot holes - great entertainment!
","************SPOILERS ALL AROUND, SKIP TO NEXT COMMENT**********<br/><br/>I thought this was great entertainment, much better than I hoped for after having seen AI and most of Tom Cruises movies. Finally both Spielberg and Cruise delivered! I expected plot holes and plenty of it, and they delivered regarding that as well. I don't mind, really, I will be very impressed when someone manage to do a sci fi-movie with no holes. As long as the movie is over all good, I can live with the faults.<br/><br/>But ... of course I have to point out the biggest holes as far as I'm concerned! =)<br/><br/>1. As many already have pointed out - why has noone erased Anderton from computer security system?<br/><br/>2. If everyone knows about the eyechangning thing, why hasn't security been improved by, say, some sort of pulse checking mecanism? If the eyes are ""dead"", the person shouldn't be able to get in.<br/><br/>3. As mentioned: Why does not the wooden balls appear when the eco is false? Or when the eco is correct for that matter?<br/><br/>4. How did Andertons wife get hold of his eye? Did it just go along with the other possessions in the boxes she picked up, even though it's basically a key to the whole place?<br/><br/>5. I have plenty of objections against Agathas ""recordings"" of the murder that Lamar committed. When her vision is shown at the Lamar party, it's not at all similar to the original one at Pre Crime. The hired killer who gets caught is never in the water in the party version, which is what originally showed that there were two versions (when the wind has changed and the waves went in the other direction). Also, how come we can see that it was Lamar that did it? In the original vision you can only see the false murderer, and therefore he is arrested. The false eco version would have been erased. Agatha shows her vision in the cyber club as well, but is interrupted just as the killer is about to show his face. By other words, it couldn't have been that one either. We see that Agatha is experiencing something at the same time that Anderton talks to Lamar, and that Andertons collegue transfers images to the party. But how can Anderton know that Agatha will show this images when he needs her to? Can he order her to show it, just like that?<br/><br/>6. A filosophical question: Shouldn't the precogs show the events leading up to a murder and then the pre-crime guys storming in to prevent it? That's what the future really is, right?<br/><br/>But I also have objections against one by others mentioned plothole: Several comments have been made regarding why Agatha functions outside the Temple, when it's the wires and the 'milk' that supposedly helps her function. No. Agatha sees visions regardless of the Temple, but no one else can see them unless she is hooked up to a computer. Remember the greenhouse lady talking of the kids screaming at night? This could also explain why she can see the balloon situation, but not tell of future rapes, robberies and so on. The computer may only pick up murders. And the balloon situation also involves herself, which could make it easier. Regarding her telling Anderton and his ex-wife about their son, I think it has to do with her being in their house and feeling the athmosphere there.<br/><br/>Oh well, a fascinating movie nevertheless and even though some plot holes are irritating, it's great fun to figure others out . =) Sappy ending, though. Show more guts next time, Spielberg!"

","*ridiculously minor spoilers*<br/><br/>Well, it's better than AI....but... ....why were there so many clichés and plot-holes?! Ack!<br/><br/>A great first half, marred by a slow and plot-hole-filled second half sum up the movie. The idea of the entire movie being solved by one clichéd line just irritated the life out of me. 'I never said she was...' - I won't finish the line so as to make this review a VERY minor spoiler. The ending was also a little too 'Hollywood' for my liking, but solid performances all round made for an enjoyable experience, if perhaps a little overlong. True, you had to suspend disbelief a few times, but then again, if you can believe that dinosaur flick, why not believe this? Surely it's only a matter of time we'll have such technology.. (pre-cogs are another matter of course!)<br/><br/>Anyway, sit back and enjoy the ride. It's a fun one. When you're done, you'll argue some issues to your friends, and find it extortionately difficult to get your point across. Then..when you're done arguing, you'll realise that Spielberg succeeded. He provoked your mind. Of course, by telling you this, you might not be provoked, or will you?"

","I read a lot about how this was Spielberg/Cruise growing up. Well, by my reckoning he's still got some way to go.<br/><br/>Spielberg can't help loving the movie magic - with the somewhat childish vision of the future (jetpacks, cars driving up buildings). Although some of it is inspired (vomit sticks, personalised ads etc.)<br/><br/>Cruise, for his part still can't help playing the archetypal action hero - all smiles, graceful moves and muscles. So he might look ugly and vulnerable for a while, but he'll be all smiles again...<br/><br/>The most glaring problem is that if the film had ended at the ""first"" revelation, about 90 mins in, it would have been a perfect solid ending. Very Philip K. Dick, very dark, very cynical. Instead, they had to tack on more and more endings before they could get to the ""happy"" ending."

","I was shocked and dismayed at this film's content, and am assuming that the filmmakers bribed the ratings section of the MPAA in order to pass the movie with a PG-13 rating....I took my mother, father, and two of my friends (I am of the age of fifteen) to see this film, and was astounded at the sheer monstrosities it contained.  Gratuitous horrific images are hurled relentlessly at the viewer, including a man's removed eyes in a plastic bag, covered in blood.  This particular gory sight is repeated several times....along with macabre scenes of sex, murder in brutal ways (this too is frequently and prevalently repeated), intense emotions (generally hatred, fear, and pain), and drug use.  Appallingly horrible, I cannot suggest this film to anyone with any sense of decency, unless you happen to be a true horror buff.

"Paul-E","8","0","0","17 June 2002"," Spielberg's return to form
","I was lucky enough to see a preview screening yesterday in Leicester Square and being a fan of both Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg I was looking forward to it. The film is based on a short story by sci-fi genius Phillip K. Dick and had, what I felt was a great premise, the police can see into the future to prevent murder happening and the police chief is told he is going to murder a person he's never heard of in 36 hours he has to go on the run to prove his innocence etc... Right from the first scene I was hooked when we saw Cruise and his team in action to prevent a 'crime of passion' in a race against time. Straight away I was delighted as this was 'vintage' Spielberg, really wracking up the tension and pace to get the palms sweating so by the conclusion of this sequence I'd realise I'd been holding my breath. From that point on the film rarely lets up and rockets along at a breakneck pace showcasing some superb action scenes, including a fight in an alleyway with police with jet packs, a terrific fight scene in a car manufacturing plant and a wonderful escape on the freeway with all the 'Tron-esque' cars. Tom Cruise gives a very good performance of the man on the run, adding more depth of character and emotions than is usual in these sort of films. His supporting cast is also fantastic including Colin Farrell as the FBI agent chasing after him, Samantha Morton as one of the 'Pre-cogs' who predict the murders and Max Von Sydow as Cruise's boss, an actor who always lends weight to whatever he does (even 'Flash Gordon'). There is a great streak of black humour that runs through the film which is a welcome relief at times from what is essentially a serious movie and thankfully the humour doesn't undermine the serious aspects, unlike in a lot of Spielberg's other films (Jurassic Park for instance). I have been disappointed with Spielberg's output for a while, to be honest I've found all of his films since 'Schindler's List' to be dissapointments, all containing good elements but overall very mediocre stuff. This film to me was a return to form, this was the Spielberg who made Jaws, Duel and Schindler's List, not the Spielberg who made Jurassic Park, Saving Private Ryan and A.I. This may be at base level a 'sci-fi thriller' but it is expertly handled, with a decent script, logical plot development, some nice twists (though some I should have seen coming in hindsight) and wonderful visuals and I came out loving it. If this is the quality of film we can expect from a Cruise/Spielberg collaboration then I can't wait for their next film together. Hello Mr Spielberg, it's good to have you back."

The writing was very good, and creative, I've never seen any movie with this kind of concept.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was basically the only actor that I knew in this movie, and it didn't need anyone else.  It was rumored that Matt Damon was supposed to take the role of that FBI guy, but I think that the movie was fine without him.  The acting was quite good, and so were  the special effects.<br/><br/>

But one thing really bugs me, and I know Speilberg has been reported to like watching late night Movie-of-the-Weeks, but that line - ""I never told you she drowned."" What an incredible cliche and total cop out on how to neatly tie up the ending. <br/><br/>I mean any person with intelligence, and I assume the bad guy was smart, he did have a position of great power. Could have simply replied - ""Yes I lied, I know about the missing file, it's a women who drowned. I didn't want to tell you. John had told me about it before he was arrested. It had something to do with what happened to him. I can't explain right now but come and see me tommorrow and I'll explain everything."" If she still wasn't convinced he could add ""We think there's a bug in the system, we can't let that get out right now, but I think I know a way we can get John released."" Instead, years of trust built up between John's wife and her husband's boss are thrown out the window because he seemed to know something he shouldn't. What a suspicious lady. It just seemed like lazy writing. Especially since, after my initial wince at the line, I thought up the above excuse before the actor even gave his next line. And if it's so easy to get people out of prison why didn't anyone else do it?<br/><br/>Anyway, far be from me to re-write movie ending, I won't go into any of my preferred endings as there could be many, but lazy writing should be exposed and not excused."

"MovieCrap","Null","0","0","3 July 2002"," The report is in ... this movie is amazing!
","Philip K. Dick's short story comes to a remarkable life in this extraordinary epic that Steven Spielberg just happened to direct. Being his second futuristic, sci-fi thriller in less than a year, `Minority Report' shattered most everyone's opinions, unlike last year's `A.I.: Artificial Intelligence.' Going places he couldn't go with `A.I.,' Spielberg really gives `Minority Report' it's own perfect setting, believably set in the year 2054. Everything seems to be more open, and useful, as in `A.I.' where it seemed most of the outside settings where bright lights when indoors. 	 `Minority Report,' as mentioned above, is set in an amazingly realistic Washington, D.C., fifty odd years in the future. One of the highest-ranked and well respected cops in the new Pre-Crime Police Force, John Anterton (Tom Cruise), gets a wakeup call when the pre-cogs, three select people who can see future murders, accuse Anderton of murder.<br/><br/>Running from authority, which seems to be the movie's main premise, Anderton runs into a collage of outlandish characters and places, including a mysterious man who removes peoples' eyes so they cannot be identified, and a loner caretaker in charge of all the current pre-crime prisoners. Without a doubt, the action scenes in the film are top-notch, never outdoing their selves in pride or length. Two of the scenes that stick out in my mind would have to be Anderton's pursuit among the highway, where he must jump from vehicle-to-vehicle to escape his capture and a scene in an apartment complex where a group of Police-controlled electronic spiders are sent to identify all living persons inside.<br/><br/>Professionalism aside (heh), this movie just kicks some major ass. From the moment you see him, you know Anderton is a hard-ass, and won't quit being one the whole movie. That's Tom for you, folks. Another actor who really caught my eye was Colin Farrell (Hart's War), who played an FBI rookie to inspect the whole Pre-Crime process. I've never seen anybody transform their voice as much as him, starting with a deep Irish accent smoothly going into a perfect American one.<br/><br/>The actors, the settings, the plot. Everything seems to be intact. And it is. `Minority Report' succeeds in keeping the audience thrilled, yet intrigued with the plot at the same moment. Twist and turns seem to be two of the biggest ingredients in this thrill ride's list, enough to make the ending unpredictable to even the most intelligent of moviegoers. Even if you manage to see one or two bad reviews of `Minority Report,' don't let them fool you. Those people are probably still aching over their oddly terrible `A.I.' experiences.<br/><br/>**** out of ****"

I will go as far as to say that it is as good or better than Total Recall, a movie I thoroughly enjoy. The special effects are, predictably, excellent. The action sequences are masterfully constructed, though obviously far-fetched at most times. They are also often laced with some comic relief which detracts a little from the overall believability, but I thought they were clever and were appreciated by the audience. The story had a few holes in it. There were a few times that the plot was furthered by some painfully unbelievable shortcomings of future technology. For a vague example, there are a couple scenes where even today's security systems at lower level institutions would have cut this story short. Oh well, it didn't ruin anything for me.

","Minority Report is a well-done attempt to mix the sci-fi, action and crime drama genres. The film begins in a future Washington DC with a very intriguing future society in which crime has practically been wiped out due to psychics who can predict crimes before they happen. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the man in charge of ""pre-crime"", a division of the police devoted to stopping criminals before they commit their crimes. Everything seems to be running smoothly until the system notifies Anderton that a murder is about to take place. Anderton is shocked to find that he, himself, is the murderer and that he's going to murder Leo Crow, a man he's never heard of, in only a few days' time. <br/><br/>What follows is an examination into the morality of the entire pre-crime setup as well as the morality of John Anderton himself as we eventually discover his relationship to Leo Crow and what it means.<br/><br/>Overall, Minority Report is a pretty slick production. It works very well, has a good script, features a fine set of actors, strong action scenes and neatly ties up all its plot points. It reaches a more or less satisfying conclusion and I rate it at 8/10.<br/><br/>That said, I can't help but think that this movie did slightly wimp out a bit in the end. I won't spoil it, but I thought it could have taken a more subversive tone near the end which could have shot made it even more memorable. Still a fine movie, though."

","Steven Spielberg needs to stop trying so hard to make a masterpiece. Minority Report was a good movie, but it felt forced, obvious and even preachy some of the time. Social commentary should never be at the forefront of a film or it<br/><br/>detracts considerably from the story. A statement should be the subtext--the<br/><br/>""read between the lines"" part of a movie. But Spielberg seems to think it's the other way around: the social statement is your film and your characters and<br/><br/>story are just coming along for the ride. It just doesn't work well when you do that, though. <br/><br/>When you overlook all that, there is something worth seeing here.

","Minority Report is a reasonably good film; great and exciting in places, and lame as a one-legged mule in others. Why have the last two movies Steven Spielberg has directed (AI and this) got intrusive and sickeningly schmaltzy scenes that really hurt the strong stuff before? The end of AI is the worst in motion picture history that I know of, and while Minority Report doesn't fall anywhere near as far, the way it shoots itself in the foot with clumsy 'emotional' scenes and overstated dialogue is distressing. Like AI, the end is overlong and drains the excitement away. If this kind of stuff was lost in the editing room, Minority Report could have been a classic. As it is, I give it a 6."

","(CAUTION: SPOILER ALERT.  DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT SEEN THE MOVIE)<br/><br/>Being an avid reader of Philip K Dick, and having seen all of the movies that were adapted from his stories and novels, I didn't know what I would think of Minority Report.  But I must say that I was absolutely enthralled with the movie.  Through solid acting, unbelievable(yet subtle) special effects, and an incredible adapted story, the words from the pages of Dick's story were brought to life.  It was nice to see a movie that expanded the short story, yet did not stray too far off-tangent from the original framework the story formed.<br/><br/>I will be the first to admit, I never really liked Tom Cruise's acting.  I always thought he seemed to stuck on himself to concentrate on what he was paid to do...act.  But he was incredible in Minority Report.  His portrayal of John Anderton as a human being, rather than a ""supercop"" that could take on hundreds of armed men with only his bare hands(like so many heroes in action films today), Cruise made his character believable.  I felt his joys and his pains.  As he was running away from his former colleagues, I found myself cheering him on, hoping that he wouldn't get caught.  While suffering with drug addiction over the loss of his son before the days of Pre-Crime, Anderton rose through the ranks to become the director of the organization in his personal struggle to make sure what happened to him wouldn't happen to anybody else.  This is Tom Cruise at his finest.<br/><br/>I was also just as impressed with Samantha Morton's role as Agatha. Although she did not have much dialogue, her facial expressions conveyed more than words ever could.  She was able to use her facial expressions to portray a sense of innocence while simultaneously commanding authority. (SPOILER!) This was particularly apparent in the scene where she helps Cruise's character escape the police in the mall scene by using the balloon vendor.<br/><br/>As I mentioned earlier, the special effects were incredible, but yet they did not draw your attention away from the real focus of the movie...the story.  Unlike this summer's other ""blockbuster"" movies, the CGI was not thrown in your face.  To borrow from Roger Ebert, director Steven Speilberg has always used the technology of special effects to weave into his movies, rather than using sfx and CGI to make movies FROM like so many directors do.<br/><br/>The entire movie was a montage of eye-candy.  Never have I seen a futuristic world look so believable and realistic.  From the billboards that call to you by name(I actually got a real kick from those) to the newspapers that updated themselves with breaking news stories, it all seems quite possible 50 years from now.  Perhaps I may live to see these in use someday.<br/><br/>
The film's story was incredible.  Although Minority Report was based on PKD's short story, the film's screenplay stood out on its own as a new idea. The basic framework was in place, but the screenwriters added so many new ideas that the two almost stand alone, as separate interpretations of the same idea.<br/><br/>Lastly, I walked out of the theater asking myself various questions of morality, which PKD excelled at making his readers ask themselves.  Is it right to try and change the inevitable(arresting criminals before they commit a crime?)  Does attempting to change the really help a person cope with a personal demon by preventing it from happening to anyone else.  From the intense action scene at the beginning of the movie to the final ""whodunnit"" conclusion at the film's second half, Minority Report is the essence of what PKD would have wanted to see in an adaptation of his story."

","*** Spoiler Warning ***<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to dislike the end to this movie.  Their main argument was everything is wrapped up a little to nice and neat.  My theory is that the reason the movie ends like this is that from the point in time in which Detective Anderton get incarcerated we are viewing his dream.  Just before the warren puts him in to a trance he states that your life flashes before your eyes and then all your dreams come true.  And from that point on they do for John.<br/><br/>His wife who has no apparent police training tricks Burgess and frees John from a high security jail.  John then exposes Burgess with the help of his former teammates (who just put him away) to the world.  Then gets Burgess to apologize to him before committing suicide.  He then hooks up with his wife again. And starts a new family.  Finally the precogs are saved and the pre crime system is shut down.  And the precogs are transported to a NON-technological utopia.<br/><br/>Totally unbelievable chain of events taken at face value.  But plausible in a dream."
"paperoven","Null","0","0","30 June 2002"," Very good but some plot holes
","I found the movie very gripping, although I'm not a big Tom Cruise fan and think another actor would have filled that role better.<br/><br/>*Possible spoilers*<br/><br/>The major plot hole in the movie in my opinion was how Anderton was set up by Burgess.  It doesn't make any sense.  All Burgess did was pay off a guy (Crow) to pretend he was the one who abducted Anderton's son.  From that simple act, how could Burgess know that the pre-cogs would predict Anderton would murder him?  Burgess didn't provide any clues to Anderton to lead him to Crow.  The other problem was that Anderton was put in the situation to murder Crow only because the pre-cogs predicted it. But why would the pre-cogs predict it in the first place.  It's a paradox.<br/><br/>Another scene that bothered me involved when the cops were after the first murderer shown in the movie.  They identified the correct housing development but were unsure which house it was out of a possible six or so. There were about eight police officers there.  Instead of standing around trying to guess the correct house, they should have split up and each enter a different house trying to find the killer.<br/><br/>I thought the action scenes could have been done a little better and a little more realistically.  I found it a little hard to follow some of the action scenes because of the MTV style filming, especially the scene in the alley.  Of course it was completely implausible that Anderton would be surrounded by eight armed cops and escape.  I would expect that from another summer action movie, but this movie was too intelligent for that.  The scene where he was jumping from car to car reminded me of an old video game."

","*Possible Minor(ity) Spoilers*<br/><br/>Let me be honest, I'm not the biggest Spielberg fan. With that said, however, Minority Report is a pretty good movie. As far as his ""special effects"" driven films, Minority Report easily surpasses Jurassic Park, E.T. and Close Encounters. Like him or not, Spielberg's a pro and he really has a lot to work with here.<br/><br/>For starters, a great cast that features Tom Cruise, Max von Sydow, and Colin Farrell (who I kept squinting at and asking ""Is that Brad Pitt?""), and the most engaging plot for a Spielberg film since Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade. I won't reveal much of it here since the movie hasn't been released in theaters yet as I write this. I would be remiss if I didn't mention that any scenes involving Cruise's eyes are damned cool, but I won't get into specifics.<br/><br/>Minority Report's not a perfect movie. There are the usual Spielbergian scenes (Cruise escaping from the police via jet pack and crashing through apartments and a scene where ""spiders"" scan people's eyes no matter what they happen to be doing at the time come to mind) where Spielberg tries to get just a little too cute. Also, there is *a ton* of blatant product placement in this movie. Some of it can be said as fitting into the plot, but do we really need to know Cruise drives a Lexus? Although, it is nice to know that Aquafina and the GAP will still be around in 2054.<br/><br/>Overall though, Minority Report remains absorbing throughout and the 150-minute run-time (no pun intended) seems to pass by in almost half that time. And, yes, if you have money to only see one sci-fi movie this summer and it comes down to this and Attack of the Clones, choose Minority Report. I'd give it a solid 7 out of 10."

It focus on John Anderton (Tom Cruise) a precrime detective that is in charge of stopping murders before they occur. Soon the technology that he has used so successfully for years, is turned against him and he soon finds himself charged and convicted of future murder, and is on the run because as Anderton himself says ""They always run"".<br/><br/>Yes it does feature special effects but they are so masterfully and wonderfully woven into the storyline that they aren't even noticeable as such.<br/><br/> I simply cannot say enough how great this movie is.

Everything that made Dick's story different and exciting were cut out, replaced by special effects. My first gripe is Tom Cruise as the lead. He does not look like a middle aged, overweight balding man to me. And I know that the whole side plot of his kid and the kidnapping were supposed to add to the ""complexity"" of the plot, but was it really necessary? For the film, yes; without the side plot a lot of the action wouldn't make sense. But in the story, Dick didn't have to rely on cliched drama to create suspense and excitement. He created a world where the hero is flawed and happy endings don't and really can't exist. Dick's fantasy world is not far from reality. Spielberg, on the other hand, creates a visually believable futuristic world, but the story is unrealistic which adds an artificiality to the film as a whole. I think the film is visually stimulating and quite entertaining (with the added bonus of the very attractive Colin Farrell), but I think that the story is bogus."

","I think with such a high tech, futuristic movie there is a tendency to really look for the flaws.  I'm not a big fan of this genre for that very reason.  I wasn't particularly impressed with the Matrix, because I found the plot so hard to believe.  This movie has the same problem.  It seems that some future advancements are actually a step backwards.   But, kind of ignoring some the `futuristic' aspects of the movie, there are a few good actions sequences, and the plot held my interest as it turned into a murder mystery with a couple of twits in it.<br/><br/>SPOILER ALERT  You can't go any where without having your eyes scanned and being recognized for who you are.  That seems reasonable enough for 50 years in the future. But, on the black market you can have new eyes put in, and now you can suddenly walk around with a completely new identity.  And the same technology the mall and subway uses to recognize you by an eye scan is apparently the same technology that the most secure installations in the world use.  I might have guessed that secure installations would have thrown in a backup thumb print scan or something But, I decided to look past those technological issues, and I found something that bothered me more about the plot.  The `pre-cogs', those beings that could see the future, were described as being perfect predictors of the future.  The visions that they see are the future.  However, we see 4 events of their pre-cognitive ability.  The opening scene, where we don't know for sure what would have happened, the murder that Tom Cruise's character commits, which we find out he doesn't commit, Tom Cruise's murder, which doesn't happen, and the murder of the pre-cogs mom, which was dismissed as an echo.  So, 4 alerted murders 2 which the killers didn't go through with it 1 which was mis-read by the tech and 1 which we don't know the disposition.   Seems like a system which had huge flaws.  How did it ever survive testing?  Seems like the system wouldn't have really survived to the point of about to go national."

","At the beginning of Minority Report, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) and his SWAT team converge on the house of a soon-to-be murderer.  They run into a problem when they discover that all the houses look alike.  Thanks to some clever observation, however, the day is saved, and the streets of a future Washington D.C. are safe once again.<br/><br/>Such is the world and the cleverness of Minority Report.  The year is 2054, and the city's ""pre-crime"" initiative, on the brink of becoming a nation-wide program, has successfully thwarted every murder attempt for the past six years.  The system works by having detectives analyze precognitive images that have been extracted from the minds of psychic people (called precogs).  When the precogs predict a murder committed by Anderton, the detective sets out on a journey to find the information, the minority report, that could prove his innocence.  His former teammates, led by a skeptical representative of the Attorney General, set out on a journey to capture him.<br/><br/>Minority Report is visually dazzling, mentally engaging, and emotionally interesting without ever being manipulative.  Action scenes are suspenseful and smart, never resorting to cliche.  And in the hands of a brilliant director (Steven Spielberg) and a gifted actor (Cruise), this screenplay (based on a short story by Philip K. Dick) never lets up.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, it does occasionally let down.  Take the opening scene, for example.  The detectives have the name of the perpetrator who is about to commit the murder in his own house.  Yes, the deduction method used to determine the house is clever, but do they not have this man's address? Could they not just look at the number on the door?<br/><br/>Such moments of ""hey, wait a minute"" distractions are few, but that makes them all the more annoying.  Minority Report is a very smart film, making the less intelligent segments that much more noticeable.<br/><br/>Another example would be the fact that after John Anderton is pegged as a murderer-to-be and flees for his life, this highly secure government facility doesn't even bother to lock down his access, allowing him the opportunity to kidnap one of the precogs in an effort to clear his name. One would think heads would roll for this oversight, but that would require the ability to believe it in the first place.<br/><br/>There's also the matter of technology that seems too advanced for fifty years hence, but that's a smaller matter since technology's advancements are not always linear or predictable.  And unlike most other sci-fi thrillers, the technology sets up some cool stunts but otherwise plays no part in the plot.  This is not a special effects movie; the plot would be as enjoyable with a budget of $50,000.  That's because, for all its idiosyncrasies, Minority Report never forgets about its characters.  John Anderton's tortured past is more than just a plot device; it's an integral part of the story, as are the histories of other major players.<br/><br/>You will need to be somewhat forgiving as you watch the film, but given its cleverness and its overall fun, only the most curmudgeon moviegoer could refuse to let the minor points slide.<br/><br/>***1/2, 9/10, A-"

Minority Report was filled with imperfections in many areas that left a conscious audience with the feeling that some of the departments rushed through their work.  John Williams' score was one of the most disappointing features. It was if he composed the score without knowing what the movie was about. Spielberg, usually a great storyteller seemed concerned with the film aspect, but did not properly tell his story (which was in many ways no more than the work of another writer who lacked hope in humanity).  Tom Cruise's acting was fine, it fulfilled it's purpose, well casted, well acted.

"Doemlling","10","0","0","28 June 2002"," The Secret Genius Of Minority Report
","WARNING: MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW<br/><br/>Upon recent viewing of Minority Report for the third time, I'd like to share with you the secret of its brilliance. First of all Max von Sydow is my favorite actor, and without any bias I can say that his performance was easily the best in the film next to Samantha Morton's. Secondly, I should tell you that I think A.I. was a terrible mess, and upon first and second viewing of Minority Report I thought the ending was too cliched and happy, not to mention too rushed and full of plot holes. However I, and others I saw it with can now say that Spielberg pulled a Kubrick on us. It is now clear and obvious to me that everything after John entered containment was nothing more than a fabrication in his mind. Think about it. First we already know that John has basically figured out that Burgess was behind the murders, seeing how Burgess was the only other to know about the Minority Reports and he helped to pioneer the interface, not only that but he is the only one with the access and the knowhow to setup the murders so brilliantly and wipe out all the minority reports that should have been stored in containment. Secondly, Gideon tells John as he is being put into containment that everyone who goes in sees their whole life flash before their eyes and its like all your dreams come true. Thirdly, everyone's acting up to this point had been very detailed and impressive, but when the fabrication begins, its almost like the acting was purposefully contrived and the tone of the film changes completely as if it were just one desperate man's hopes and dreams and speculation of how things should have gone. Also Burgess's slip of the tongue with Lara would not have happened, we have already become aware that he is too smart to start becoming so dumb near the end. And Lara using the eyeball after John's containment, John was able to use his eyes to get in earlier because he had not actually committed the murder yet, so he wasn't officially stamped convict, but afterward she obviously would not be able to use them. Burgess killing himself at the end, is completely out of character, he has already killed 2 innocents that we know of, and covered up at least a dozen more just to protect Precrime, if this situation wasn't a dream he still would have killed John. Burgess having the Minority Report on himself at the end is not in tune with the Burgess we got to know earlier. I could go on, and on about the subtle, but obviously intentional plot holes and strange acting, and strange character arcs that Spielberg puts in the end. The only reason could be that this is a dream sequence. John is only seeing what he wants to see, he is speculating about what happened and he probably has most of it right except for the part where he think that everything is all right now, nothing is all right, Burgess did get away with it, John is still imprisoned. This is a brilliant turn for Spielberg. Just like the flashing sign that said exactly that (you only see what you want to see) in the mall where Anderton and Agatha were running from the precrime officers. In retrospect, this film is so Blade-Runner esque. The reason I say that this is a Kubrickian touch, and in my opinion the true definitive homage to Kubrick, is that there is no blatant touch, or hint or explanation that this was a dream sequence, not like in Vanilla Sky, only the small intentional inconsistencies and change in tone that prove this to be true. I think that when people really start to notice this and ultimately realize that this was a dream sequence, they will see just how dark and bleak and cynical the ending really was.

","An impressive film, perhaps the most complete film Steven Spielberg has directed in quite some time. Tom Cruise (in an effective performance) stars as a pre-crime cop assigned to stopping crimes before they occur.. until he is fingered and must go on the run from his own policeforce. A fascinating and well thought out look at a possible future world realized thru impressive visual effects and solid production design.. the story keeps you involved and guessing, though the revelation of the eventual bad guy is not as much of a surprise as it could have been.. The acting is good all around, with solid supporting turns from a top notch crew of character actors.. I thought this one was quite good. GRADE: A"

","Biggest one, for me, was why Anderton was set up. Perhaps I missed something, but it seems the fix was in before he learned of the Minority Report and its repercussions for the bad guy.<br/><br/>Nice to see Spielberg continuing to stretch his considerable muscles by including dark humor, surrealism, and visual and verbal non-sequitirs. Don't think this one was quite up to ""AI,"" though (I'm a big fan of that one) - didn't have the emotional depth of the earlier flick, but then, this was more of a thriller than a think piece.<br/><br/>Best performance has to be Lois Smith as Dr. Iris Hineman. Eight, maybe ten minutes, total, but stunning and striking without being hammy. She went from eccentric to thoughtful to cunning to warm to scary, and delivered a big chunk of exposition without making it sound like a big chunk of exposition. Solid work."

","The whole premise of the film is that pre-crime is going to ""go national"" after an initial trial, and the whole tension between the characters is whether or not it is going to ""go national"".  You don't have to bother examining all the incongruencies in the film when you realize that there are only THREE precogs, and they can hardly keep up with one city's ""crimes of passion"".  As for the supposed mind bender of ""would the killer really do it?""  there's an old saying in law enforcement that goes something like this: if a person jumps off a building in a clear act of suicide -- and you pull out a gun to shoot her the second before she hits pavement -- you are guilty of murder."

","Steven Spielberg still seems to be a little on the Stanley Kubrick kick, but this time he gets it right after a little stumble with the so-so ""A.I."". The director has taken on Phillip K. Dick's (""Blade Runner"", ""Total Recall"") short story from the 50s and turned it into something futuristic, yet very foreseeable, which is what makes this story work. While not all good sci-fi is based on possible future events, the fact that some of the technology has caught up in time with what Dick had originally dreamed up is pretty frightening. <br/><br/> Tom Cruise continues his reign as the most appealing male ""movie star"" and is engaging as our drug addicted protagonist ( a la Sherlock Holmes) in what seems like a ""North By Northwest"" meets ""The Fugitive"" on the ""Blade Runner"" set. Without giving away too many of the plot details, it can be said that this is one of the more intelligent and enjoyable sci-fi flicks to come along in a long time. The plot twists are slightly predictable, but still quite intriguing nonetheless. <br/><br/> It raises a lot of questions about where we are headed as a society in many aspects. There's a balance of good and bad things that most futuristic movies don't have. It does show what we already know: people never change. While we may have advances in technology we are still going to be driven by greed, jealousy, and other flaws that have plagued man since the beginning man's existence. <br/><br/> This is definitely one to check out in the theaters. Cruise, Man Von Sydow (""Needful Things""), and Colin Farrell (""Hart's War"") are all give solid performances and Spielberg is his usual masterful self. This is just the summer blockbuster sci-fi fans have been waiting for."

Even better is the message it delivers: You can control you future,you can choose what you do with yourself.It throws aside the stupid idea of fate or forced future,and tells you to choose for yourself.

Maybe it that plot twist was not used again until 2052 it might work but as for now - it is comical.<br/><br/>Then there is the absurd items with the eyeballs - high tech world and the only security is an eye scan.

","Spielberg wants us to think he has a dark side, so he grabs onto more of the spurious writing of the eternally plagued Philip K Dick. He enlists the help of Tom Cruise, because the latter looks so good doing chase scenes in his Mission Impossible extravaganzas. He rounds up a team of future experts, at a cost only he could absorb, to delineate what the world will look like fifty years hence. He pounds us with nightmare visions of retinal scan-based demographic tracking and advertisement. And he tries unsuccessfully to emulate the cinematography of one Ridley Scott, who made Dick famous twenty years earlier.<br/><br/>But Minority Report is ultimately a run-of-the-mill detective story, not film noir. And although some may see a parallel with Sam Spade, most will instead see a very contrived, very predictable plot denouement.<br/><br/>Whatever Spielberg wanted to say about the evils of demographic tracking is not known. He does paint this future, but it's doubtful he wants to warn us about it, it's doubtful he's against it and wants to be taken seriously in this movie.<br/><br/>One need only look to Cruise's continually displayed Bulgari watch, Cruise's entrance into The GAP, and the fabulously touted Lexus future car (which looks more like a VW Golf driven backwards) to realise that anyone - and especially Spielberg as we've all along suspected - has a price.<br/><br/>Add the clumsy music by John Williams and you have a cinema visit which can be thought-provoking and interesting only if you want it to be.

","Philip K. Dick's original story brings up all kinds of interesting questions and issues about fate, the ability to choose one's future, human rights, and privacy vs. security. Spielberg develops these ideas to a certain extent throughout the film, and in some instances, he succeeds brilliantly. Unfortunately, he also gives us a lackluster mystery that is full of plot holes and just as obvious as any other clichÃ©d, popcorn movie `whodunit.' One brilliant scene featuring a treatment of Dick's ideas finds Tom Cruise's John Anderton, accused of murder, and Samantha Morton's Agatha, one of the precogs, in the apartment of the man that Anderton is supposed to kill. The acting from Cruise and Morton and the situation that their characters were in was absolutely riveting. The thoughtful source material and successful moments like the apartment scene show what potential the movie had.<br/><br/>
In a film of such potential, scenes like the one in which the precrime detention center guard asks Anderton's wife how she got in grate on my nerves.  Spielberg ignores the obvious plot hole in the situation and has Mrs. Anderton proudly display Mr. Anderton's eyes with a triumphant look on her face as if the audience will go, `wow, isn't she smart!' Spielberg obviously wanted this movie to be intelligent and appealing to one's intellect at least to some degree, yet he puts stuff like this in the movie. What does he expect us to do, turn our minds off and on depending on the moment? I just can't enjoy a movie that has such reckless treatment of theme and tone in it.  One moment we're watching a truly brilliant scene like the one with Anderton and Agatha in the apartment bedroom, and in others we're watching unnecessary, grotesquely failed attempts at humor, like Anderton getting his butt patted by a freaky nurse and drinking rotten milk or watching a man get pleasured by a virtual prostitute.<br/><br/>I'm disappointed with Minority Report because it tempted me by appealing to my intellect with interesting ideas and then turned around and insulted my intelligence. I enjoy a mindless popcorn movie as much as the next guy, but if a movie is going to attempt a degree of depth by bringing up ideas that it wants the audience to think about, then it had better be prepared to tell the story in a way that will stand up to thoughtful scrutiny."

","This movie was okay. The tech stuff at the start of the movie was really interesting but it fell back into the same stuff we've seen before. After the gadgets the story was the same as before. One of the main problems was that the issue was only a personal one not one that had any greater social significance. A simple example is that Anderton did not, to any great degree that I could tell, question the fact that what had happened to him could be happening and could have happened to others. The process of law that he was so gung ho to be leader of turned around and bit him in the ass. He never questions(looks inside of himself)the ramifications of this problem. Anyone involved in such a sweeping law of justice would have to question what he has been doing. Examples of movies that reach outside of just the individual are Matrix, Fight Club, Blade Runner. These films find the connection from the personal to the community. They also show characters questioning the 'idea' of their problem. Example, in Blade Runner, Harrison Ford's character ends up questioning the definition of what it is to be human. Film's like Minority Report are great when your young(audience and filmmaker) but the really great movies capture all ages with a deeper meaning; ie Matrix, Blade Runner."

","When you see a film based on any literature by Philip K. Dick you can rest assured it will be something worth watching. Steven Spielberg has crafted a very realistic vision of our future and the questions it may raise. He has not lost his tendency to put a positive spin on even the darkest of questions, but he manages to keep you on the edge of your seat up until the final breath. <br/><br/>The futuristic thriller/mystery is based on the concept of precognitive visions of the future, specifically murder. Three Twins have acquired the gift of seeing a murder before it happens allowing a controversial program called Precrime to emerge. Precrime is about to go national and has been placed under review to find any possible flaws in the system. Tom Cruise plays Chief Detective John Anderton, who is caught up in a conspiracy to ensure that Precrime fails, however all is not what it seems. John sees a vision supplied by the twins of himself killing a man he does not know, it is now a race against time for John to find out what is really going on before Precrime catch up with him and put him away. <br/><br/>The film is perfect in its conception, exploring futuristic law enforcement techniques, weapons, entertainment, modes of transportations and possible moral dilemmas. It puts a spin on the innocent until proven guilty principal and the criminal is arrested before they even commit the crime and even become a criminal. It asks the big question, ""Just because you believe something is going to happen and you stop it, would it of really happened?' Even better than that is the film actually answers the question and doesn't leave you hanging. <br/><br/>It is also a perfect example of how well computer technology can enhance a production. The special effects are only evident because you know technology like that does not exist; however the image itself is flawless and very real. The ""Think Tank"" behind this production must of spent a great deal of time coming up with plausible technology and realistic effects to make the production seem that much more real. Ultimately it works and the film looks and feels like a possible future.<br/><br/>Unfortunately the film has no great standout performances and Tom Cruise is his normal self (same as always), but everything is very sold and certainly makes the pass mark. There are also a number of questions about certain details in the film, like why are the prisoners held in the manner that they are? It seems in a film about moral questions, some of the details are important, but they receive nothing in the script. It does however not seem to matter in the end.<br/><br/>This film is another Spielberg masterpiece and will not fail to entertain most tastes. It would of been nice to have a darker and thought provoking ending, but the film still works. 8/10!"

Since the ends of the visions were the same, the report was made.  And the end is much more noir. ==End of Spoilers= I am definitely going to have to go see this one again and try to appreciate it on its own terms.  Perhaps the ending will work better a second time around.  The rest of the movie works quite well.  It is well acted and directed.  All of the other reviewers are dead on when they say that the mixture of old school filming and CGI work perfectly for Spielberg. <br/><br/>

If you're a Science Fiction fan and you liked 'The Fugitive' with Harrison Ford, then this flick will most likely leave you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>Spielberg rendered his movie in very contrasting colours, almost shading into black/white - which gives it a dark edge. Minority Report is a short story by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote the story for Blade Runner and I can see comparisons: the dark mood, the constant advertisment of big brand names and a hero who has to fight his own inner demons.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie and gave it a rating of 8/10 but it's not a ground-breaker like Blade Runner or The Matrix was."

","Spielberg, Cruise, Philip C. Dick-director, star, creator.  This is a heavenly group promising that the mediocre fare of this summer will be redeemed by a sci-fi thriller about an agency making arrests before crimes are committed.<br/><br/>The intriguing premise, based on precognition theory crossed with some Sybil-like prediction powers by three `Precogs' from a Dick short story, is not given its potential in at least half the film.  The setup is stylistically attractive, a hybrid of the digital inventiveness of `The Matrix,' `A.I.,' and the coldness of Dick's `Blade Runner.' Cruise coordinates data about potential crimes on a giant screen like a symphony conductor in charge of a NASA launching. Visually Spielberg has the eerie futuristic world down right, even to the Orson-Welles-like lighting and classical and pop music punctuations.<br/><br/>Then the cliches roll in like a thunderstorm, ruining the promising premise with predictable scenarios-Cruise is setup to be an object of his own Pre-Crime Division, a friend turns out to be an enemy, the bad guy is not bad, the race is on, etc. The climax and plot twist could have been seen all the way from the next solar system, and Max Von Sydow should seriously reconsider accepting parts that fulfill expectations from his previous roles.<br/><br/>In this mixed bag of tricks are a couple of scenes truly worthy of Spielberg's brilliance, one when Cruise visits the elderly creator of precognition crime detection (Lois Smith of `The Pledge' and `Five Easy Pieces').  The strange garden she has created with its almost human plants well reflects the strange and dangerous world her creation has engendered.<br/><br/>Cruise had a much more complex character in `Vanilla Sky,' demanding you pay close attention to details if you wished to make sense out of his troubled character's search for identity. In `Minority Report' plot and special effects rule. If star and director wish to cash in on this film, they ought to look with dread at other summer films like `Bourne Identity' and `Sum of All Fears,'  which are not likely to generate enough cash for future more artful films.<br/><br/>Hey, it's summer-lighten up and enjoy what's good about a dark formula sci-fi film with an impressive pedigree.

","""Minority Report"" is the best sci-fi film I've seen since ""Blade Runner,"" a P.K. Dick vision really brought to life -- greatly suspenseful, adventurous and riveting.  I do have some nit-picks with the film, mainly the new, popular ""fast motion"" visual style of action, where it looks like the camera is handheld and frames are dropped on purpose.  Also, the (relatively minor) plot holes mentioned by other reviewers.<br/><br/>*** minor spoilers follow ***<br/><br/>I would have liked to have seen more character development (e.g. more about Agatha) and better plot development in regards to the whole ""minority report"" concept and Anderton's son... this film could easily have run over 3 hours -- like A.I., it felt rushed, and a bit too ambitious given the running time.  Also like A.I., the film can't quite decide where to end. These flaws prevent ""Minority Report"" from being a true classic in my eyes.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong though.  This is visionary science fiction, better than A.I. (which I did enjoy) in every conceivable sense.  The characters are ""real"" and not stereotyped, the plot fast moving and believable within the world it creates, and my attention was riveted the entire time.  The special effects indeed go to further the story (a rare thing these days).<br/><br/>
9/10 -- misses ""classic"" status by a hair.  One more like this, and Spielberg will be up there with the science fiction greats like ""2001"" or ""Blade Runner."""

","""Minority Report"" is a heck of a movie. I suppose by that I mean that it's rather mind-boggling. It's also well done. There are a few holes and minor annoyances (such as a bit of annoying avant-garde camera work) and one very brief scene in which what happens is just TOOOOOO fakey.... I'll leave the scene unnamed because if you tune in on those things you'll catch it, and if you don't I'll only have broken the action for you.<br/><br/>All that said, one of the marks of a good movie is its ability to draw you into the plot and make you forget you're watching a movie; its ability to arouse emotion and give you an experience. It also helps if you can't quite predict what's going to happen. Minority Report is a nail-biting roller-coaster ride, and one with a few surprises to boot.<br/><br/>Parents be warned: this is NOT a film for kids. Not at all. This is a ""hard"" PG-13 which in my opinion really should be rated R due to graphic violence and nightmarish scenes. As an action film for adults who like nail-biting action futuristic science fiction, though, I'd say it's at least the equal of Blade Runner, which, incidentally, was another Philip K. Dick story adapted to film (along with Total Recall and Screamers).<br/><br/>
BTW, if you like these Philip K. Dick stories, keep your eyes open for ""Paycheck,"" my personal absolute favorite PKD short story, which is due to hit the big screen in a year or two."

","Well, having read some of the comments on here, it seems people overall liked this film.  I liked the film, but I did quibble a bit with the ending. SPOILER AHEAD......<br/><br/>I didn't think that if Burgess was so determined to make Precrime work at any cost that he would be so magnanimous as to take himself out when he realized that he had risked too much for it.  He turned out to be such an ass that I really found it difficult to believe that he would do what he did when he realized that he had perhaps crossed ethical lines in ensuring Precrime's success.  <br/><br/>END SPOILER<br/><br/>Also, I found, in retrospect, that Spielberg's insertion of Anderton (Cruise)'s kid is a rather saccharine plot device to connect Anderton to the action.  I found this was the reappearance of the old Spielberg, and the one who made AI last about 20 minutes too long last year.  It should have ended when we saw that the robots were frozen underwater years later. <br/><br/>
Nevertheless, these are not major quibbles.  Spielberg hs really changed from a mass-entertainment corporation to a more adventurous and curious film-maker.  The provocative nature of the principles that underlie Precrime is very interesting and there is not Spielberg's usual levity to ""soothe"" the audience.  The tone here is consistently dark and foreboding and I think that is fitting.  I'm just glad that he is more emotionally honest and does not try to emotionally con the audience.  <br/><br/>I have to give credit to Tom Cruise.  He doesn't have a very flashy role, but he without his hard work and determination, this movie does not roll as it should.  Cruise is someone who does not rest on his laurels and he must be credited for not taking easy, simple roles, but for challenging himself and trying to give audiences some cinematic cud to chew on.  I also thought that Peter Stormare was great as the rogue surgeon who replaces his eyes (that's right).  Colin Farrell has great presence and you can't take your eyes off him.  He is a man who could carry a film.  I found him very charismatic.  Tim Blake Nelson is great as Gideon, the organ-playing prison warden, and Samantha Morton is also very compelling as the most sensitive pre-cog.  She seems to feels things more acutely than most and Morton conveys the strength with which she feels things in an evocative, moody manner.  Finally, I thought that the lady who Anderton meets out in the greenhouse who was partially responsible for the development of PreCrime is pretty compelling and watchable too.  <br/><br/>I have to say though that I found Kazminski's cinematography somewhat off-putting.  It is certainly evocative and adds to the ambience, but I found that it distracted me from the overall nature of life and the story then.  <br/><br/>However, again, I find that Spielberg really has developed as a film-maker and has become a much more provocative and interesting director and I look forward to whatever his next film is."
"davidholmesfr","9","0","0","28 June 2002"," Once In A While
","Cinema should be about entertainment, but without provoking some serious thinking it's as expendable as a pack of chips.  Once in a while along comes a movie that justifies the very existence of the medium. Minority Report is one that does just that. I had no idea what this was about when I entered the cinema, killing an over-bearingly hot afternoon in, ironically, Washington. Then I sat spellbound for over 2 hours as Spielberg and his crew span a tale so pertinent to our time. A multi-layered movie that works on, well, every layer. Whether it's action, special effects, film noir, or just plain politics this is a film that is intelligent. It uses, rather than depends on, special effects and poses so many questions about freedom and security. How relevant at the moment, especially as it seems that US citizens can be put away for just thinking about ""terrorist acts"".<br/><br/>
Somewhat episodic in its early stages, though well spiced with humour, it matures into a free-flowing thriller laced with political messages that we ignore at our peril. A must-see for any movie-goer with an ounce of intelligence."
"Time Tripper","6","0","0","28 June 2002"," So many plot holes, so little time.
","MINORITY REPORT is an achievement of directorial brilliance.  Speilberg's vision gives this movie a special quality that makes it very enjoyable to watch.  Like many science fiction films, the environment is its own character (when done right the environment in films are supporting characters, when done wrong they are the main character).  The first two acts of the film move along marvelously, with suspense, intelligence, and energy. Unfortunately the third act is an incoherent mess, filled with cliches and illogical pretenses.  I wouldn't want to give away all the third act plot twists, but I'm not sure I could type them all in a way that would make sense...not that they made any sense in the movie.  The very nature of this movie invites paradox and contradictions, since it is about people who can see the future and all.  Unlike a film like MEMENTO, however, the inconsistencies in the plot cannot be rationalized.  The best description of this movie is MISSION IMPOSSIBLE (the movie) meets TIMECOP.  Not a bad formula for an action movie fan, except the film is being advertised as a stunning masterpiece of modern science fiction.  Perhaps all those critics meant the book that the movie's based on?"

","Many critics are hailing Steven Spielberg's new sci-fi thriller ""Minority Report"" as his best film in years, a return to action-escapist form for a filmmaker who has basically split the last decade between ""Jurassic Park"" films and more weighty historical dramas.  The critical hyperbole is only half-warranted.  ""Minority Report"" does not represent either a storytelling pinnacle or a visual breakthrough for the filmmaker, as many viewers and film pundits are claiming.  However, it is still a swift, compelling entertainment with a lot more brains than most action pictures racketing around the multiplex these days.<br/><br/>It's 2054, and John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is chief officer of the Washington D.C. Department of PreCrime.  This organization uses the psychic visions of three pre-cognitive humans (known as Pre-Cogs) to arrest murderers before they even have the chance to commit their crimes.  Although the Pre-Cops have done such an effective job of reducing D.C.'s murder rate that the federal government is thinking of taking the program national, there is a lot of criticism of the department's work.  Many feel that arresting criminals before they've become criminals is the same as convicting innocent people, and that the Pre-Cogs, who spend their whole lives floating in a nutrient tank hooked up to computer screens, have been reduced to dehumanized information conduits.  Meanwhile, Anderton's got problems of his own.  He's still haunted by memories of his son, who was kidnapped and likely murdered before PreCrime made such events a thing of the past, and he eases his pain with liberal doses of drugs.  A Justice Department suit, Witwer (Colin Farrell) has begun sniffing around in Anderton's turf.  Then, things really go ballistic when the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton himself will kill a man he's never even met in 36 hours' time.  Anderton goes on the run, along with Agatha (Samantha Morton), the most powerful of the Pre-Cogs who he's kidnapped to help him.  He's got to prove he's innocent, but all the while, he might be moving ever closer to guilt.<br/><br/>Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's screenplay (adapted from a short story by ""Blade Runner"" scribe Phillip K. Dick) is more thought-provoking than your average action picture.  In this current era of terrorist paranoia and ethnic profiling, this film dramatizes the potential dangers of branding individuals as criminals solely on intuition.  There's a real metaphysical weight to the questions raised here.  If the crime is stopped before it is committed, are those arrested really criminals?  Is fate enough to go on in a criminal investigation?  Does mankind really have the power to consciously change its future?<br/><br/>Still, ""Minority Report"" can be thoroughly enjoyed without thinking too deeply about these questions.  Spielberg spices the picture with a number of exhilarating action sequences.  There's a thrilling scene in which Anderton leaps between cars rocketing rapidly down a vertical stretch of highway, a beautifully staged battle with jet-pack cops, and a fight on an auto-plant conveyor belt that would have been more effective if I hadn't already seen basically the same scene a month ago in ""Attack of the Clones"" (Lucas and Spielberg are buddies, after all; it makes one wonder who ripped off whose scene).  Though all of these scenes come off quite well, surprisingly, the film's pace eventually  flags.  Spielberg is normally a master of making a film move, but here there seems to be a lot of flab in the back half. There's no wholly unnecessary scenes here, but tighter editing would have made everything spank along much more urgently.<br/><br/>The film is anchored by sturdy performances.  Tom Cruise is always at his best with obsessive, single-minded characters, and this role is no exception.  The actor makes us truly ache for his lost son, and he acquits himself as an action hero more effectively than in the dispiriting ""Mission: Impossible 2"".  Farrell's got a nice, no-nonsense tone here, and Morton, an Oscar nominee for ""Sweet and Lowdown"", again uses her marvelously expressive face and body to impressive effect.  Also noteworthy in this cast are Tim Blake Nelson as a creepy wheelchair-bound prison warden, Peter Stormare as a truly disturbing back-alley eye doctor, and veteran thesp Max von Sydow as Cruise's Pre-Crime mentor.<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" has been widely praised as one of Spielberg's most visually impressive films, and indeed, Spielberg's tech crew, including cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, costume designer Deborah L. Scott, production designer Alex McDowell, and countless f/x artists, create some truly astounding sights onscreen.  In addition to the aforementioned vertical cars and jet packs, there's the menacing silver spider-robots that hunt Anderton through a slum-town building, a panorama of ever-shifting animated subway billboards that address potential consumers by name, and, perhaps most impressively, a mid-air computer matrix that allows the Pre-Cops to manipulate floating images like conductors shaping a symphony. Kaminski cloaks all these wonders in stark blues and grays, creating a vision of the future as endlessly encroaching night.  It's all very stunning, but I just don't know if I'd call it a breakthrough.  After all, doesn't this ""innovative"" film look an awful lot like ""A.I."", Spielberg's summer 2001 sci-fi offering?<br/><br/>Still, I did not come to praise Spielberg and Co. with faint damns.  While ""Minority Report"" is not a masterpiece, it's a skillfully made and intriguing picture that will please action buffs and thoughtful moviegoers alike.  It's no ""Jaws"", but it's no ""Lost World"" either, and for that we can truly thank our lucky stars."

The lurid visions of the pre-cogs are likely, but not certain, to happen; nevertheless, any killer envisioned in a pre-cog dream is determined by the state to be guilty, and punishment for the guilty is indefinite storage in a pod-like enclosure hooked up on mind machines. Sucks.

","Sparked to go see this one out of sheer morbid curiosity after the ""A.I."" debacle (a year old movie I still have yet to decide whether I liked or not) and by some very positive reviews from critics, this is one of those rare Hollywood films (like last month's ""Insomnia)"" that I was literally shocked by how good it was and how much I liked it. Spielberg's first attempt at film noir is quite the doozy, and it's always a treat to see an actor like Tom Cruise actually try to act and inhabit a character instead of just projecting his ego on screen and playing what is essentially himself (much the same way Pacino delivered an Oscar-worthy performance in ""Insomnia""). What is so pleasing about this film is the way it follows all of the traditional film noir rules (betrayals, mysteries, and plot twists galore, memorable dialogue, philosophizing, great chase scenes, intricate detail into crime and detection) while at the same time giving us one of the most well thought out, beautifully designed, and utterly captivating views of the near future ever brought to screen that falls somewhere between over the top Verhoueven satire (""Total Recall""/""Starship Troopers"") and Kubrickian dystopia (""2001"", ""Clockwork Orange""). Unlike ""A.I."", this film also benefits from some much needed sense of humor to offset the often disturbing imagery, and also isn't afraid to utilize a nice tidy ending and many genre clichÃ©s (stunning action sequences, predictable but still powerful plot twists) to propel the story. I for one have become a huge fan of this latter day Spielberg, the more mature, darker, and clearly Kubrick inspired auteur. In the end, Minority Report may up come a few straws short of a pure classic, but when so much of what Hollywood puts out there for mass consumers is pure drivel, it is nice to see that some people in La-La land are still making one hell of an effort to truly entertain."

","Minority Report is an enthralling film of the highest order, containing a plausible future scenario full of spell-binding imageries and concepts, all wrapped up in a thought-provoking storyline. The movie is an amalgam of Blade Runner, The Fugitive and Mission-Impossible, and just as, if not more, exciting. But what puts this film above others is the workout your brain gets, along with the usual visual pleasantries you would get from a typical Steven Spielberg film. <br/><br/>The story revolves around Tom Cruise as John Anderton, a detective who works for the Pre-Crime unit of the police department around the mid-21st Century. By employing the psychic abilities of 3 pre-Cogs, John Anderton and his team are able to catch potential killers before they commit a crime. Unfortunately, John Anderton becomes tagged as the next would-be murderer by the premonitary visions the pre-Cogs have and, thereafter, finds himself on the lam, evading authorities while trying to uncover the truth behind the events that have been foretold. <br/><br/>Along the way, the viewer is treated to a futuristic world that is oddly familiar, but,in many ways,different from ours. There are the familiar homes situated in typical suburban settings that are straight out of any old suburban neighborhood in the U.S. and people wearing clothes that are more 20th Century than what people wore in , say, Blade Runner. However, look closely and the world of Minority Report is brimming with high-tech gadgetry and imageries:from the sophisticated pre-Crimefcrafts to the eye scanning machines that detect the ID of person, from ""moving"" billboards covering just about every wall to the computer screens that can show moving visual images in life-like size,...in short, it is a highly believable future world. <br/><br/>Aside from the briskly-paced storyline and great action sequences are the myriad questions the film raises:about free will, freedom, personal loss, etc...Although I do believe that the film sends,IMHO, the right message regarding free will, the ending seemed too mundane and blah for the task of answering such a grand philosophical inquiry, even if the film is touted mainly as a murder mystery. <br/><br/>However, the overall strength of the film clearly outweighs any minor flaws of the film.Clearly,Tom Cruise was right for the role of John Anderton. He is able to imbue the character with the right mixture of complexity, vulnerability and brashness to paint a solidly fleshed out character. Steven Spielberg's direction and visual flair is, as always, technically brilliant and sophisticated. A great film."

","Overall, without a doubt a competent production and worth seeing.<br/><br/>I would like to express some disappointment about the way the soundtrack transpires. The soundtrack is not a creative achievement of wonderfully interactive and suitably mooded music - it is a committee-decided, money-maximising load of tripe. Granted, the music composed by John Williams is excellent but the way the music integrates with the movie is commercialism at its worst.<br/><br/>The jail-keeper plays the organ evidently just to ensure that the final soundtrack could contain a Bach organ piece (and even worse, one that is heard at weddings every weekend). When the unfinished symphony was played, it worked for a while but then I wondered what the hell this music was doing as it lost the mood... then I realised... they've got to sell the soundtrack! This is becoming very common nowadays and this type of commercialism really puts me off Hollywood movies altogether. Sell, sell, sell... If the music in movies keeps going down this track, I'll book a box of tickets to the independent theatre as soon as possible."

","This is a terrific bit of film making, but . . .<br/><br/>Given the rave reviews by critics and members of IMDB, you might be left with the impression that this is the best film Spielberg has made in a long, long time.  I respectfully beg to differ.<br/><br/>
Yes there is great cinematography (thanks Janusz Kaminski!), yes there is a brilliant little kernel of a plot premise (thanks Philip K. Dick!), yes there is a great cartoon chase scene filled with Spielberg humor, yes there are some Indiana Jones gross out scenes, yes there are fun performances aplenty and yes, it is way above what we have come to expect out of a summer movie.  However, there are a lot of plot holes and movie coincidences that will nag at you for hours after the images have faded.  OK, I know, willing suspension of belief and all that but still . . .<br/><br/>Also, haven't we seen most of this before?  (""Blade Runner"", ""Chinatown"", ""Serpico"", etc.)  The difference between those movies and this one is that this one is filtered through an ""Artificial Intelligence"" trailer.  In fact, AI is a much more compelling film.  Though AI is a rehash of the Pinnochio story, it is a fresh take on a universal fable; much of ""Minority Report"" is just a rehash.  (""Minority Report"" does have better action scenes.)<br/><br/>This IS a good film, just not ""Saving Private Ryan"", ""Indiana Jones"", or ""Artificial Intelligence.""  Go see it.  Enjoy.  Just don't believe all the hype."

","It's like Indiana Jones meets Blade Runner. It combines the spectacular adventure elements of the former with the futuristic film noir fare of the latter. It's almost three hours long, but you won't take your eyes off of it for a second.<br/><br/> The film stars Tom Cruise as cop John Anderton, a man on the run when his agent, the Department of Precrime, turns against him after he is discovered to be a future murderer. I won't say any more about the plot, you'll just have to discover that for yourself.<br/><br/> What makes this film so great is Spielberg's approach in generating intensity and emotion in a way that he hasn't in a while. Minority Report is a much darker picture than something like AI, which although great, was overly optimistic and sappy. In this film however, our hero is a drug addicted cop with a vengeful streak in him caused by the loss of his son.<br/><br/> Spielberg has recently gotten the reputation for making the endings of his films too upbeat and optimistic, as if he's willing to sacrifice good filmmaking to try to make people feel good about what they saw. With Minority Report, he realizes this and the ending is like nothing you would expect.<br/><br/> This is a great film, better than most of Spielberg's recent endeavors by a longshot. The filmmaking techniques he uses are beautifully done, the special effects gorgeous and tasteful, the action and story gripping. This movie is for everyone, and if you don't check it out, you're really missing out"

","It's important to note that I thought A.I. was a piece of trash, and that made the stunning Minority Report even better. Never had I been more disapointed after seeing A.I., and I'm glad to say that, despite the astronomically high hopes I had for this movie, it was better than I expected in every regard. I don't think I've ever been so engrossed in a movie since I saw Jaws on TBS when I was five. Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance as Anderton, and Spielberg shows off his genius behind the lens in almost every shot of the film. The story is genius, with enough twists to keep you guessing, and the score by John Williams is a brilliant pair with the tense, mysterious story taking place on screen. Perhaps I was just so happy to see Spielberg making something worthwhile, but I enjoyed Minority Report better than any other film this year, and probably this decade. Go see this film now. ****"

","first AI (which i know some people didnt like but i personally thought it was an excellent example of steven spielbergs talent) no minority report steven spielberg is on a role. though similar in genre as AI (futuristic, sci-fi) it is completely different in story, colours, action mood, and just about everything else. steven spielbergs has a knack for getting the lighting and angles just right so that you feel transported into the scene and are not just a fan at a movie theater. tom cruise is another who is on a role, he was excellent in Vanilla Sky and puts on another excellent performance in this film. though the film is less of a mind number than Vanilla Sky it still grabs your attention and doesnt let go until the end. another thing that i loved was how steven spielberg made a cameo in Vanilla sky and in this film both cameron crowe and cameron diaz make cameos (watch for them on the subway) the stunning visuals in the film seamlessly blend live action with CGI, like in the scene(which im sure all of you have seen in the preview) where anderton(cruise) takes a ride on the magnetic highway system that can travel down the sides of buildings and jumps from one car to another, steven spielberg has many a close up of tom and they are beautifully done. unless you were analyzing the CGI work in the film you wouldn't even realize that it was all CGI. which i think the purpose of CGI really is, unlike in Star Wars: Attack of the Clones where you are bombarded with fake images and bad acting, but back to a much better film. minority report also doesnt shy away from using actual sets and actual people which i think directors should do more and stop relying so heavily on CGI. this movie also has an amazing supporting cast from colin farrell, who has an excellent performance in this film bringing the tension that every film needs, to samantha morton who sends chills down your spine every time she talks. all in all this film is one of if not the best film ive seen this year and i would recommend it to every one          9.5 0ut of 10"

","""Minority Report"" holds your interest all the way through.  It takes pains to set up its basic framework of new ideas (the pre-cogs) clearly, and although this makes the first half-hour of the movie irrelevant to the plot, Spielberg's skill is such that this background information is not only a necessary precursor to the gist of the movie, but also exciting for the viewer.<br/><br/>It follows from this that ""Minority Report""'s strengths are its plot and its ideas.  The ability of the actors and director means that even when the plot descends into a cliched pursuit of a fugitive, as it does sometimes, the movie doesn't flag.<br/><br/>The movie does sometimes renege on the premises it set up, and bend the rules of what the pre-cogs can do, as a means of setting up thrilling or tear-jerking scenes, but it's still very watchable.  It's a little disappointing that the world of 2054 is more or less like today except with a lot more product placement - but hopefully, some of the companies who paid handsomely for their names to be mentioned will go the way of Pan Am in ""2001""."
"dfranzen70","9","0","0","24 June 2002"," Nearly flawless Cruise vehicle
","John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the chief of Precrime, a futuristic law-enforcement program that allows authorities to stop murders - before they occur. In a nutshell, three beings called Precogs (short for ""Precognitive"") are able to foresee all killings, usually a day (or less) before they occur. They can identify the killer and the victim, as well as the time of the murder (to the second); it's up to the Precrime team to figure out exactly where the murder will occur based on the Precog visions.<br/><br/>It's a system that's never wrong. The Precogs only see crimes that WOULD have happened, not murders that might have happened. In other words, premeditative killings. (Why can't the Precogs see other crimes, such as rapes? Because of, as Anderton put it, ""the nature of murder""; that is, murder is an act unlike any other crime.)<br/><br/>As a result of Precrime's efforts, murder in Washington, DC has diminished rapidly - down by 90%. People don't even think about committing murders anymore; the system is that much of a deterrant.<br/><br/>Which makes it ripe for a setup, doesn't it?<br/><br/>Enter Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell). He's with the Justice Department, on orders from the Attorney General, and he wants to examine Precrime a little more closely. He knows no mistakes are made, but he wants to know why. He's reluctantly given a tour of the facilities by Anderton, and he's even allowed to see the three Precogs.<br/><br/>Shortly thereafter, the red ball that indicates the name of the guilty rolls a familiar name - Anderton himself. The next ball, showing the victim, reveals a name unknown to Anderton himself. He doesn't recognize the name, but he's supposed to kill the man in less than three days.  Needless to say, he runs; needless to say, his Precrim teammates follow.<br/><br/>This much you would have gathered from the endless promos for the film. It looks, on the surface, like a standard Tom Cruise they're-out-to-get-me movie. In fact, when I saw previews of this movie, that's exactly what I thought. The man's been set up like a bowling pin in movie after movie.<br/><br/>But hold on! It's a lot more complicated than that. Anderton's task is not only to find out the connection between him and the victim but also to find out who would want him to kill the man - and why. It's a trip that takes him through some of his own darkest memories (his son was kidnapped, never to be seen again, as a young boy at a public pool).<br/><br/>Anderton is not your typical hero figure, either. He's hooked on the new drug of choice, which is consumed in the same way an asthmatic would breathe on an inhaler. He tortures himself nightly by viewing old discs (home movies) of his son and his wife, who left him after the boy's disappearance.<br/><br/>Luckily, though, it's not a movie that leans heavily on making things up as it goes along, much like Cruise's last opus, Vanilla Sky. It's full of twists, torturous but not murky. Characters from John's past figure prominently into the plotline, but it's up to him to decide how much importance any one person has in resolving his inner and outer conflicts.<br/><br/>The movie is also filled with wonderful special effects, the kind that enhance a film, rather than simply detract from its essence. It doesn't depend on these effects to pull it out of illogical missteps, either. Director Steven Spielberg, with this movie, rebounds nicely from the travesty of A.I. to produce what that alternate-reality movie failed miserably to provide: a real, believable plot powered by appealing, plausible characters. The story, based on a Philip K. Dick short story, keeps Anderton on his toes, and the audience along with him. The difference between this movie and many other pretenders is that Minority Report makes the audience care what happens to Anderton at each step of the movie. With many other films, the viewer sort of gives up on the character, either because they can't relate to him or her or because the pacing of the movie is so turgid as to prevent anything but ennui.<br/><br/>And Cruise is perfect in the role. Absolutely perfect. When I saw the preview for this film, I thought the movie was trying to turn Tom into another Arnold-like sci-fi hero (Schwarzenegger's Total Recall was also based on a Dick story). I doubted seriously Cruise's ability to get down and dirty with a role, and pull it off. You may recall he was disfigured in Vanilla Sky; here he goes along a similar route, but his motivations and nuances are perfectly captured. The atmosphere created by the elite cinematography and the dazzling characterization from Cruise himself were the highlights of the movie."
"Recessive","Null","0","0","25 June 2002"," The Eyes Have It
","Minority Report is a BRILLIANT MOVIE.<br/><br/> Phillip K. Dick, sci-fi writer and the inspiration behind 'Minority Report', also inspired the 1990 'Total Recall'. 'Total Recall', for those who haven't seen it, is a brilliant watch - it involves you in a very immersive world, and leaves you almost as lost as the lead character, as to where the twists may turn next.  The thing about 'Total Recall', though, was that it wasn't for the faint hearted - even the censored version sees quite a bit of gore.<br/><br/> Now, I'll admit to you now, I'm a bit of a squeamish fellow.  And when people choose to put unnecessary gore, make the movie into an unnecessary freak show, then it makes an otherwise brilliant tangle of ideas into something that alienates your simpler viewer.<br/><br/> Having said that, I was very excited about 'Minority Report' coming out, but I approached it very anxiously, hoping it wouldn't turn into a freakshow.<br/><br/> The truth of the matter is, 'Minority Report' is a much, much more accessible movie than the aforementioned gem - it still gives you the creeps at all the right moments, especially if you value your eyeballs - but it never violates your trust in Spielberg's better judgement.<br/><br/> It takes place in one possible future - sometimes bright, sometimes bleak, but by all accounts, a frighteningly apt projection - where murder has all but been wiped out by the department of Pre-Crime.  This department, headed by a well cast Max Von Sydow, and employing the services of a VERY well cast Tom Cruise, (the only possible actor who could have made this role work) uses the predictions of three 'Pre Cogs' to stop murders before they happen.<br/><br/> The system is only in experimental stages, but it is all but expected to be adopted by mainstream culture when the vote is put to masses.  All the same, a devilishly likeable Colin Farrell is brought into investigate the inner workings.  Coincidently or not, this just happens to coincide with our flawed hero Anderton (Cruise) finding himself in a dilly of a pickle - the latest case he attempts to piece together finds himself as the killer.<br/><br/> If you think you know where this movie is headed, you're in for a rude awakening - somehow, I doubt even the Pre-Cogs themselves could see the ending to this one.<br/><br/> Well, maybe the Pre-Cogs.<br/><br/> 10 out of 10, 100 out of 100 - a movie to be encouraged.  It is rich in story, it doesn't lose itself in dodgy CGI special effects, and it opens up a lot of avenues of thought, particularly to the nastier elements of mankind."

Tom Cruise has reclaimed his fame in my book, and has propelled himself into my Top Ten Actor's list (my favorite actor of all time begin Brad Pitt, of course).<br/><br/>Although I will not divulge the plot of the film, for the sake of those poor souls who still have yet to see it, I will say that I was greatly surprised and delighted by it. And I think that the best idea in the entire film had to be those sweet guns that John Anderton (Cruise) had to spin around, the ones that fired those balls of sound energy (from the part in the Lexus assembly line). However thought those guns up was a genius.<br/><br/>Surely, ""Minority Report"" is an excellent film worth seeing time and time again. And after seeing it, you will constantly be saying, ""Murder..."" in the voice of Agatha (one of the Pre-Cogs) and come up with scenarios that involve Precrime S.W.A.T. teams busting through windows and such.<br/><br/>

Minority Report is deeply thought. It has a better plot than the classic Bladerunner and the look is just as spectacular. I won't say that is a better film than Bladerunner (yet). Spielberg has done it again by bringing some very hard edges to his style. The world's all-time best director has left warm and fuzzy far behind. His screenwriters have done a great job at staying true to Phillip K. Dick's mind-bending prose. This a plot driven movie with some very cool performances especially in the supporting (and cameo) roles. Tom Cruise is fine as the hunter turned hunted. However Samantha Morton had the most difficult job to pull off as a future telling savant and she definitely should be remembered at Oscar time. Steven Spielberg has rocketed into adulthood since Schindler's List. I still love CE3K, E.T. and Raiders, but Minority joins, Ryan and A.I. as very daring cinema that refuses a safety net. The gadgets and the the eye-candy are less obvious than A.I. but every bit as fantastic. This is a great detective story brilliantly told 52 years from now. If you like Phillip K.

Just the idea of it is enough to captivate the viewer, but Spielberg's direction makes for a pay-off ten times greater than one could imagine. Everything that could work in this film does and works in a way the viewer didn't see coming. Summing up the merits of this film is impossible because they are merits incapable of being condensed.

","Forget those BORING Star Wars and Lord of the Rings movies... MINORITY REPORT is what you need to see for excitement and a good story to keep you focused in. This movie will all you'll be thinking about after watching it.<br/><br/>Easily one of the best movies ever! The story was brilliant and very original, something we've never even imagined of seeing. The movie is never predictable, many scenes shocked me with amazement giving me chills throughout the movie. Very exciting and highly interesting story with spectacular gorgeous special effects. I enjoyed even just watching the futuristic surroundings. And I thought the future world in ""Back to the Future: Part II"" was amazing and then when I saw A.I, but WOW, wait till you see Minority Report!<br/><br/>The action scenes were thrilling and very intense (I enjoyed every second of it) as well as the story! There were many dramatic moments which I liked but still had good humor in it.<br/><br/>Speilberg likes to extend his movies a lot until he can conclude it entirely without leaving you hanging. You think it's about to end but it keeps going and I think people didn't like A.I as much because it overextended (fairy scene). But in Minority Report the ending was good, not too disappointing after all the anticipation for this movie, I thought he ended it well. A solid movie from beginning to end.<br/><br/>I wouldn't recommend taking your kids to see this movie at the theaters, the action might seem great to them but I think the story would be confusing for them and Minority Report had some sexual scenes and some language (I remember Tom saying the ""F"" word). In the other hand A.I was more ""Disney"" like so I think little kids would like that better but thank god Speilberg made the elements for Minority Report for older audiences.<br/><br/>I thought A.I was kind of mainly for kids and Minority Report is great for adults. <br/><br/>Don't worry if you were disappointed with A.I (I thought A.I was good but the ending was too Disney like), you'll definitely enjoy Minority Report all the way through or at least I did.<br/><br/>Don't think the movie will be really really really really good cause sometimes when you have high expectations for it, it usually ends up less good and you'll end up being disappointed. But I don't know, I knew this movie would be good and it ended up being good so I guess there's an exception for this movie. (Just saying because I expected too much for Spider-Man with everyone saying it's really good and seeing the rating on IMDB also. Then after seeing it I was wondering what was so good about it?)<br/><br/>The movie is 2 and half hours long, there are a few slow downs so you have to be patient sometimes! But there are many exciting moments between them.<br/><br/>
Minority Report is definitely this summer's blockbuster, could be Oscar material. Even those two critics that complain a lot gave it Two Thumbs WAY UP and called it a masterpiece. This movie is already top 100 on IMDB.<br/><br/>What more can I say... Go see this movie! Definitely worth the money.<br/><br/>Words can't describe this movie, you have to see it for yourself!<br/><br/>I can't wait to buy this on DVD. I think Speilberg and Cruise should work together more and Speilberg should make more futuristic movies!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise and Steven Speilberg both proves again they are one of the best actor/director with this movie.<br/><br/>Overall Rating: 9/10"

","*** If you have not seen the movie, DO NOT READ ON -Spoiler Notice***<br/><br/>From a CNN Reviewer who was obviously close to the mark but looking for his paycheck: `Of course, it all begins with the written word, and screenwriters Scott Frank (""Out Of Sight,"" 1998) and Jon Cohen have crafted an action-filled thriller that is not totally insulting to the intelligence of a 12-year-old. Very refreshing.'<br/><br/>Yeah, but insulting to the intelligence of anyone OVER 12.<br/><br/>The logical flaws from the technical perspective are going to keep Minority Report from being a Great Movie, verse a good movie, to me.  Unfortunately I have noticed what I will call the `this is too tough to really figure out and write' trend in a number of movies.<br/><br/>Now I am going to focus on some flaws in the logic of the technology presentation in the movie, though I feel that for the entire package to be believable the script writers MUST be able to deliver the entire deal. What I envision is Spielberg and crew sitting around a table, hopefully saying to themselves, `Well that is just not realistic, but since this is a summer popcorn movie and most of our audiences are just mindless sheep we have pulled into our valley, we will go with it.'<br/><br/>Point #1:  They have these cool guns that shoot some kind of sonic pulse that can blow people off the ground or knock huge barrels around, but do not seem to be at all lethal.  Yet when the cops go to get John Anderton, none of the SIX seem to have this wonderful weapon and must engage in hand to hand combat with John to capture him.  Of course he is quickly able to escape from all six of them even though they ARE armed with cattle prods that make you vomit and all kinds of body armor.<br/><br/>Point #2:  Eye replacement surgery that can be done and healed in 24 hours. I think we are going to have some amazing medical advances in 50 years, but there are *SO* many advances that have to happen for this to come true- 1) eye replacement  2)  amazing 12 hour healing drugs  3) eye replacement<br/><br/>Point #3:  This is a wonderful combo statement.  And the one that *REALLY* gets me ticked, as the writers used the contrivance a number of times, not satisfied to just sneak it in and let it lie out there as complete crap. After John has his eyes miraculously replaced and healed in 12 hours, he gets to keep his old eyeballs.  Now he is able to somehow gain access through a `back door' to a passageway that leads right up to the bottom of the precogs tank area and the *ONLY* security he has to elude to get to this point (the most valuable asset of this entire company, in fact, the asset that this entire very technologically sophisticated and well funded company is built upon) is one iris scan locked door. Ok here I am about to really destroy my credibility of the movie.  When he gets to this single barrier to his entrance (security cameras, motion sensors, don't exist in 50 years? Yeah, right), he gains entrance by pulling out (and then dropping for some comic relief) his old eyeballs.  Which after dramatically chasing down a ramp (which they roll down like marbles, because you see eyeballs are hard and smooth. anyway.), he then holds up to the scanner and voila! he gains entrance!  Wonderful except for the *TOTALLY* unbelievable fact that in 50 years, in a secure police facility that utilizes amazing technology to stop murders, once one of their own is implicated as a criminal and they send squads of police out to capture him, they are UNABLE to mark him in their own security system as unauthorized for access.  Now unless I am mistaken, this is amazingly simple to do in our own systems today (MS Windows, Account Inactive, done).  And don't even get me started on the whole disconnection of the precog from her supposedly complete life support systems and then the escape down this huge drain in the middle of their `tank'.  I am laughing as I write this, what the heck were these guys thinking?<br/><br/>And another point, (geez, these keep coming up!)- if the precogs are able to see images of the future, but unable to be specific about location, how are they able to tell EXACTLY the names of the victims and murderer and the time?  (The names of which then are scribed onto wooden balls that roll down this tube system- again the actors must have had many takes while they tried to stop laughing as the little balls rolled down and they then had to seriously pick them up.)<br/><br/>OOO-  one other point I should not fail to mention is the whole `Mission Impossible' scene stuck into this movie with the lines `So I have to somehow go back to impossibly secure room, break in, retrieve most protected article, and somehow get out' line.  Lazy, lazy, lazy!!!<br/><br/>Oh man, my rating for this movie just keeps going down.  Mr. Spielberg and Mr. Cruise certainly did pay a lot of money and put a ton of wonderful effects together for this film.  But unfortunately as is the case with many movies lately, they have let the effects be the driver for the movie instead of the story.  Too many are falling victim to this lately.  The adage that less is more is always sage advice and I believe will always produce a better movie.  Check out Blade Runner!  Highly technical yet you only remember the story.  The effects blend into the background.<br/><br/>Just another minor point.  When John first comes home and gets out of his car, he walks into the apartment and says `I'm home' at which point the lights come on.  Again, a properly designed system would AUTOMATICALLY turn the lights on when he arrived and stepped through the door- what else would he be other than `home' when he steps out of the car into the apartment?"
"Drakkhen","9","0","0","26 June 2002"," Futuristic Film Noir
","I loved A.I.', Spielberg's last foray into science fiction. It wasn't perfect  but for me, science fiction is about the philosophy of scientific progression; the wrongs, the rights, the gains, and the consequences of making the human being closer to our perception of efficiency. In Spielberg's tribute to the late Stanley Kubrick, he explores the morality and responsibilities in creating' life. Does intelligence dictate life form, and if so, who owns the right to take that away? Would killing an artificially created life form be considered murder? It is not the actual questions that attracted me so, but how these questions are played out in Spielberg's universe  how the movie works with these issues.<br/><br/>
This is also why I feel Spielberg's follow-up to A.I. is so wonderfully extravagant in its telling. The year is 2054. Murder has been all but eliminated thanks to a new technique called pre-crime'. This term refers to the ability to see murders before they happen  giving the police (pre-cops) time to find the place, and people involved in the murder, and hopefully prevent it. Even though this system has seen continued success, much of the population still doubted the idea of preventing something before it happens. The scenario is laid out wonderfully by a meeting between John Anderton (Tom Cruise), an accomplished pre-cop, and a representative/cop from the government, Danny Witwer (Collin Farrel). <br/><br/>Witwer's main purpose is to find flaws in the system  somehow prove that although it is possible to predict the future, it is impossible to be certain that it will happen unless it happens. Anderton, who we find early on is one of the best pre-cops in the business, and believes that the system is sound, rolls a ball along a table in which Witwer catches. Anderton asks him why he caught the ball, in which Witwer replies, `Because it was going to fall'. The answer, in every sense of the word, was a prediction  an educated one at that, but still nothing more. From this, we can extrapolate the greater scope of this example: Is it possible to predict  for certain  that something will happen? Is it right to condemn someone for a crime that he/she has not yet committed? From this moment, Anderton and Witwer, because of their opposing beliefs, are immediately split into their own proverbial corners of the ring. <br/><br/>Philosophy aside, this is above all an action movie; something Stephen Spielberg is no stranger to. His experience in working behind the camera shows in almost every aspect of motion picture from the shot to the timing. In the climax to an amazing scene were little spider-like robots are sent in to an apartment complex to find Anderton, one of the spiders creeps under the door to a bathroom where Anderton is hiding under water. We watch as the robot looks around the room and turns to leave after not noticing the submerged subject. We cut to a shot of a tiny air bubble that barely escapes Anderton's nose. The bubble bursts just as the last moving leg of the spider is about to leave under the closed door. Suddenly, the spider stops, and turns around for a closer look. The description of the scene is very mundane. However, with Spielberg's ability to masterfully time the action on screen, he is able to create a huge sense of tension. <br/><br/>Spielberg's eye is as masterful as his timing. One of the most interesting shots in the movie comes near the later stages, where Anderton and Agatha are embracing. It is a two shot (very commonly used in modern Hollywood cinema), but used in a manner in which I've never seen before. The profile of the two characters looking away while talking to each other is wonderful, and lends itself perfectly to the subject matter of the scene; a stroke of genius during a scene that could have been just another scene.<br/><br/>
I also have to comment on the special effects of the movie. In many movies, some recent one which come to mind include `Attack of the Clones' and `Spiderman', the special effects, were used in a way such th at it seemed like the filmmakers were building the movie around the special effects. For me, this is a huge distraction  possibly intended to take our eyes off some horrible acting (I'm not naming any names here!). In `Minority Report', the effects are used to help and compliment the movie, never poking its way to the centre of attention, and letting the movie and its characters tell the story. Amongst the huge firecracker explosions and web swinging computer graphics of the modern day action movie, this was a refreshing change for me, and I hope the filmmakers take note and follow suit.<br/><br/>
Aside from these scenes, Spielberg's ability to play with the audience is consistent throughout the length of the film. It is so easy for him to startle, play with, and manipulate the viewer  and all the time being so very discrete. Much of the film is shot with a filter that makes whites seem oversaturated. This helps contrast dark shadows and retain a great film noir feel. It also lends itself to the idea of how hard it is to hide in a city illuminated by light and surrounded by tiny cameras.<br/><br/>The casting is solid, and everyone played their roles convincingly. Samantha Morton was surprisingly convincing, and Collin Farrel was great at making us dislike him right from the start. People who are looking for something to calm their appetite for an action movie will surely be satisfied with Minority Report'. The fact that this action movie comes with a brain is a welcomed bonus. <br/><br/>In a summer that has so far been filled with mediocre blockbuster fare, Spielberg unloads what is sure to be one of his most technically challenging and rewarding works.<br/><br/>Larry www.crankyfilms.com"

","Steven Spielberg returns to greatness with Minority Report. After slacking on the job with his films in the last decade, the man who once showed the world movies made by a genious director has finally returned from a decade of slumber. In Minority Report spielberg unites with Tom Cruise, who here is at his best to produce a masterwork futuristic science fiction/film-noir. Having viewed The Maltese Falcon and The Big Sleep for ideas Spielberg had crafted the best film-noir mystery to come upon the big screen since Christopher Nolan`s masterpiece Memento. Creating dazzling chase scenes mixed with a mystery, Spielberg as a director is at his best. Tom Cruise plays John Anderton,a grieving father who had lost a son 6 years earlier. John is the head of a pre-crime unit in the district of columbia,the year 2054.When John sees a vision from 3 precog units who are psychicly able to see crimes of murder that will happen in the future he goes on the run. The futuristic setting is very reminicent to, but not as dark as Blade Runner,cars move along the sides of buildings, and people can get their eyes surgically replaced with a new pair for a couple thousand dollars on the street. John believes that he was framed by Ed Witwer played by Colin Farell and must find the man that he is supposedly going to murder within 72 hours while also eluding capture on behalf of his former associates. I will not going to go into detail about the plot here. Minority Report is a wonderful film, a masterpiece of a blend of sci-fi/film-noir. Steven Spielberg has a reference to his late friend Stanley Kubrick with a scene or two symbolic to Kubrick's A Clockwork Orange and a scene reminiscent to Tom Cruises character in Vanilla Sky. ****<br/><br/>copyrighted 2002 bigtymer2k2-Argus<br/><br/>

","Well I must say, this movie was the bomb.  first of all it was written very very well, unlike Spielberg's last film A.I., which was Kubrik style which I'm not a huge fan of of. This movie has more depth and wasn't slow moving at all it was kind of interesting, because with the forshadowing you knew that it was all going to tie together but you couldn't tell how and when you thought was going to happen and when it did, a few minutes later they'd throw it back at you and say sike.  The performances of this movie were also excellent, Mr. Cruise did not over do his acting in very touching moments, but he became a tragic hero who faced his own demons and eventually faced them and slayed them, a big thumbs up on the acting.  Finally, Mr. Spielberg did a fantastic job and I would have expected nothing less from this great director of our time.  All in all this movie was excellently done and I can't wait to go see it again and pick out all the little things in this futuristic world that was created.  My hat go off to this production."
"jmhalm","10","0","0","24 June 2002"," Possible alternate ending to Minority Report - SPOILERS!
","I loved Minority Report and wanted to pose a question for you readers to ponder.<br/><br/>After Tom Cruise is captured and given his halo, Gideon or the organ player (Tim Blake-Nelson), comments while welcoming Anderton to his imprisonment that ""sometimes the prisoners see their lives flash before their eyes."" With that comment, the movie was turned completely upside-down.<br/><br/>You see, what if while in their stasis, the prisoners create a new reality for themselves. They live out their lives how they wished things could have gone. They can't erase the past, but create their own future (doesn't it kind of sound like Tom's last movie).<br/><br/>Like, in The Piano or Vanilla Sky/Open Your Eyes, what if Anderton's ideal life flashed before his eyes? Didn't the movie end a little too perfect. Not only was Anderton, reunited with his ex-wife (who rescued him), but the system that he had so much faith in - but ultimately betrayed him is shut down thereby freeing the pre-cogs. And to top it all off, Anderton kicked his drug addiction while impregnating his ex-wife.<br/><br/>Do you feel that I am reading too much into the last 45 minutes of the film? Or, did anyone else feel that maybe Burgess got away with everything and the pre-cogs and precrime division went on business as usual? It would certainly fit more closely with Dick's dark themes, wouldn't it?"
"wkbeason","7","0","0","24 June 2002"," Shrug...
","Overall, I am puzzled by the relative consistency of high marks given it by the critics.  The film's just OK.  It is certainly not great and there are many parts that are downright bad.  Max von Sydow is excellent and the soft, bleak cinematography is noteworthy, but that's about it.  Spielberg is starting to bore me with these predictable endings and the apparent attempts among intellectuals to make the film somewhat more `meaningful' in the wake of America's Homeland Security fetish come up lame with me.<br/><br/>
Setting that aside, the material in the film - based, of course, on the Philip K. Dick short story - makes a direct philosophical statement: What happens in your life is all predetermined unless you somehow can foresee the future in which case - unlike others - you can make a choice. This premise has (had) a great deal of potential, but it never quite comes together. Those comparing this film with the likes of The Matrix or Blade Runner are naive.  It has no comparable metaphorical or character depth.  As for the direct ""point"" posed by Minority Report...it was more interesting and effective in the short story than in the 2 and 1/2 hour film.  I gave it a 6."
"Minstrelman","6","0","0","26 June 2002"," Disappointing
","Well, this film is entertaining.  It is well thought out.  It is well written.  It is well directed.  And it is well acted.  However, it did not come up to my expectations.  Maybe this is because I had really high expectations.  At any event, I was a little disappointed with the final outcome.  <br/><br/>I think that one of the reasons is that there was so much time watching Detective Anderton going through the recorded images of the Pre-Cogs, waving his hands around with his fingers sticking out, or watching him jump from vehicle to vehicle on the magnetic car highway, or the wall projected images from the ""PC"" in Anderton's home.  This seemed to me to be more about Spielberg's image of the future than about a very good crime drama.  I think that's where the film lost me.  I also thought the CGI images weren't very good.  I would have expected better.<br/><br/>Maybe a second viewing will change my mind, but this one is worth seeing at a matinee, not at a full price showing."

","Perhaps my favorite part of Minority Report is the feeling of P.K. Dick-iness.  Despite the Gap plugs, Pepsi plugs, etc., there's Dick's fundamental dislike and distrust of ads, of society, etc.<br/><br/>Frankly, I liked A.I., and I liked this movie a lot.  I hadn't expected much, except for some neat Blade Runner-style action, but I was pleasantly surprised.<br/><br/>Really, only three problems: camera filters.  Sometimes the picture was just too blurred out, too blue, too grey, whatever.  Editing.  Ignoring the A.I. like ""false ending"" (the whole halo shot...you'll see what I mean), which could've been great, but dragged on to the inevitable, tidy, glowing happy ending.  I was so looking forward to a down note, because no one ever seems to take risks anymore and maybe p**s off an audience.  Anyway.  Humor. Most of it was good, but the whole spoiled food bit should've been dropped. Actually, the deletion of that bit alone would've satisfied me.  Those are small, though, and I can see that Spielberg had to throw a bone to stupid people to keep them interested.<br/><br/>As for plot holes: 1) suspension of disbelief.  You people accept precogs as valid, but nothing else?  Get some perspective. 2) deal with it. Something tells me both Dick and the people involved with the movie gave it a little more thought than you did, and came up with a suitable answer that didn't make it onto screen (for example, why is it not feasible that the precogs are actually RESTRAINED to D.C.?  You don't know how powerful they are. And someone mentioned that the precogs had had their rights violated...well...duh.  Did you show up late or something?  They're not there voluntarily, but no one bothered to ask 'em, and they're too drugged up to do anything).<br/><br/>I would also like to respond to another post, one in which the movie was called a ""good movie, but not a good sci-fi movie"" (or some such rot...I can't be bothered to look it up).  Minority Report, from every conversation I've ever had about the nature of sci-fi (lucky me, I got to take a class about science fiction and read Dick for credit :), is a great example of sci-fi, particularly in that it follows principles set down by Gernsback, Campbell, etc., and specifically Heinlein, such as, ""The problem itself -- the plot -- must be a human problem,"" ""the conditions must be, in some respect, different from here-and-now..."" ""the new condition must be an essential part of the story.""<br/><br/>Sitting in the theater, I couldn't help but check all of those points off in my head, and smile to myself, as I'm always heartened when SF is raised above our society's perceptions of it (Battlestar Galactica, Star Trek), and show that literature/art is just that, no matter what's going on.<br/><br/>In short: Minority Report has some flaws (it ain't gonna win an Oscar for ""Best Editing,"" but I'm hoping for ""Best Supporting Actress"" for the woman who played Agatha), but it's very enjoyable, and manages to raise some questions about destiny, reality, and privacy."

","To put it vaguely, it was decent.  I don't think I was expecting much more from this movie due to my increasing hatred towards movies based on books or comics or other movies.<br/><br/>But the cinematography was excellent, I don't know who the cinematographer was, however.  It was especially good during the scenes where Cruise is looking at the murder on that screen in the beginning.<br/><br/>However, the overall directing, I thought was bad.  Characters will often start off from the opposite side of the room walk to each other so they are 5 inches away from each other's face then start talking.  It got very awkward, and if someone got that close to my face I would back away.<br/><br/>However, after seeing it I developed this really weird fixation on the bald girl, Agatha, despite the fact that she looks like a lizard and looks mentally retarded in certain scenes.

"opher-2","6","0","0","23 June 2002"," Three more plot holes
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Sort of a *SPOILER*<br/><br/>I only looked back around 40 comments, so maybe this was mentioned a long time ago, but:<br/><br/>1) (This one really bugs me) John Anderton had a witness (Agatha) who could give compelling evidence that he did not kill Leo Crowe and that he could not have killed Witwer because he was with her the entire time during which the crime occurred.  In addition, there is no way that John could have had the gun he supposedly used to kill Witwer because it was found (with fingerprints intact) at the scene of the first 'crime.'  Even if pre-crime convictions are somehow completely devoid of any due process (see #2), John's crimes would not count as pre-crimes and he should have a full-fledged trial where these issues would come out.<br/><br/>2) The link between being able to tell the future and the complete lack of due process doesn't make sense.  The legal status of the pre-cog's evidence even if they were never wrong, would be something like 'eye witness' evidence, leaving the pre-murderer all of the usual protections of the law including plea-bargaining down to manslaughter, justifiable homicide, and temporary insanity.  It might be like someone telling the police about a murder that is planned (or in progress).  These situations have clear precedents in law.  Further, even if you did find that pre-crime was not 100% accurate, it could probably still be used effectively in crime prevention without junking the entire project.  Why not just prevent the murder without locking up anybody?<br/><br/>3) The supposed infallibility of the pre-crime unit doesn't make sense. In every case we saw it in action (the scissors at the beginning, the suicide of Leo Crowe, and the near-murder of John Anderton) they either arrived too late or almost too late.  After all, if you're given 10 or 15 minutes to find a murder happening somewhere in DC, what are your odds of actually stopping it in time?  I imagine that they'd be pretty low, and that's how they're portrayed by the film as well."

","Minority Report<br/><br/>This is an excellent story, but, with acting by Tom Cruise and directing by Steven Spielberg, the movie is even cooler than is already would be without such great people making the movie. At first, Cruise, a pre-crime policeman, sees no flaws in the apparent perfect system. But once his name is called as the future killer of a man he doesn't know, he tries to find a way to prove he is not guilty. The policemen chase Cruise, but he eventually evades them (after a very cool action sequence) and visits the person who apparently ""created"" pre-crime. There he learns the one flaw of pre-crime (which I am not going to tell you what it is, see the movie) and then goes to expose the pre-crime system. On his journey, Cruise slowly pieces together how he was set up. But, along the way there are several unexpected twists and turns which leaves a very odd choice for the villain (I'm not going to tell you who he is) at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Minority Report is not just another crappy Hollywood action movie.

","The movie is in short, a visual feast, and really at no point turns gimmicky. It is definitely the first of the most stylistically important films of the new millenium.  The use of colors like the blues and greys is incredible, dramatic, and in some ways, painfully reminiscent of Kubrick... obviously, so is the use of classical music here and there.  The music was used more importantly in Kubrick's movies though (in a ClockWork Orange to denote scenes of dark humor, sex, or violence).  In Minority Report, it is scattered at random.  Blade Runner's plot and characters are more complete and even more interesting, but is kind of unfair to compare since that film has such a cult following, and the critics didn't like it when it first came out (which is kind of irrelevant, but it shows how things change with culture and time).  Minority Report felt a little forced, though.  Things didn't open up naturally like a really good movie.  There were no serious plot twists to keep the viewer engaged, and the ending was cliche.  The screenplay needed more work and so did the character development. Spielberg's eye for visual detail is definately still there, and growing. Has Spielberg lost his touch?  I haven't seen AI to comment on that, but Saving Private Ryan was made just a few years earlier and that movie was flat out awesome, so I think he is still very capable of great films. However, I was expecting Schindler's List, which is unfair, but that is where my bar is at now, and I still believe Spielberg will go to his grave and never top that movie.  I left Minority Report as a whole dissatisfied, but I did not feel it was a waste of money.  I just wanted more from the movie."
"maccaveili","10","0","0","23 June 2002"," Thank you Spielberg - Finally a movie worth seeing in the theater
","Heading into see Minority Report, I was very excited and had high hopes. For me that is usually a recipe for disappointment, but that was NOT the case this time.  As usual, Spielberg did a magnificent job again with only a couple of minor cheesy scenes which when you see it you'll know what I mean, but it did not detract from my overall impression of the movie.<br/><br/>Being a traditionalist when it comes to movies, I don't usually go for the futuristic/sci-fi atmosphere as usually those movies are done in such an unbelievable way that it just bores me.  However, even though this one takes place in 2054 it doesn't bother me, because of the way that Spielberg presents it.  He does it in a tactful way that lets people like me accept things like the futuristic mass transit system, the glass looking futuristic computers or the eye scanners at every mall and store that allowed the advertisements to personally address each customer.<br/><br/>I think that one reason it was easier for me to accept the futuristic atmosphere of a ""Pre-crime"" unit in Washington D.C. is due to the Pre-crime department's dependency on the three ""pre-cogs"".  The pre-cogs were 3 human individuals who had a ""gift"" to be able to see murders before they happen, anywhere from minutes to days in advance, depending on whether the murder was an all of the sudden passion crime or a thought out, planned murder. Even though the department uses very high tech computers in their crime prevention, none of it could work without the 3 pre-cogs, who were human. So that human element helped me relate to all the high tech futuristic aspects that the rest of the movie sustained.<br/><br/>Anyways, w/o going on to describe the entire movie, let me just say that I thought Cruise did an extremely good job playing detective John Anderton. However, I truly believe that had any other director worked with this script, it would not have been nearly the same quality as it turned out to be.  Much of the credit must go to Spielberg.  This movie had so many elements.  There was the high tech computers intertwined with the pre-cogs' abilities to foresee future murders which posed the moral dilemma of imprisoning people who have yet to actually commit any crime.  To further explore that moral dilemma, sometimes not all 3 pre-cogs saw the same thing in their visions.  Apparently, sometimes one of them would see something different, and that vision was called the minority report and was discarded. They had to be thrown out or else the Pre-Crime Department would have to be shut down if the public knew that sometimes these contradicting minority reports existed.<br/><br/>While it may seem like you know how the movie ends, you probably do not, as it has a few twists, and in addition to that it goes beyond the point of which you would expect it to end.  I'd recommend this movie to anyone who wants to be entertained not only with an interesting main plot, but with several sub-plots and the way that Spielberg mixes the ""Hollywood-ness"" of it all with the actual drama of the story line.  Nobody in my mind does that better than him.<br/><br/>In the end, I really liked this movie, it was probably my favorite theater movie I've seen in a long time, since seeing The Matrix.  And I've seen quite a few good ones (Enemy at the Gates, The Others and 13 Days to name a few.)  Ironically, I found Minority Report to have a good bit of humor, spaced out at the perfect times to get the audience laughing together in what was otherwise an action-drama flick.  And don't be surprised if on more than one occasion you find yourself jumping out of your seat on those ""sudden, in your face"" type of shots that put a spike in your heartbeat.<br/><br/>
Great movie, well worth my money.  Can't wait for it to come out on video now.  If you liked the Matrix, you'll probably like this one too. Although I'd rank this a notch under the Matrix."

","Lets see, Steven Spielberg had to find a way to pay for 'A.I.' and 'Minority Report' so why not sell the real estate? Product placement is one thing and certainly the powers that be at Fox saw this script as a perfect way to not only get a way with product placement but out and out commercials - so they did - and Spielberg let them get away with it (and maybe even encouraged them, who knows). It's a visually brilliant film, full of action and an okay, if not predictable plot that yes, mirrors the Indiana Jones movies and a few others but pales in comparison. The performances are fine, and two scenes are even brilliant, but every time another Gap or Pepsi or Lexis commercial came on the screen - which was often- I totally left the film and fumbled for the non-existent remote. So after paying to see the film, watching the commercials before the film - then during the film - I think they owe me money and a few hours of my time."

","Okay, maybe there's more than one thing, but one thing to consider for sure: how stupid are company executives if they will pay for product placements in these kinds of movies?  I don't know if they're gullible enough to be fooled by some slick talking or they don't get to know in what context their products will be 'placed' but, man is it ever a bad marketing decision!<br/><br/>I mean product placement in Bond or Spiderman or Fast and the Furious is one thing, but would you pay for your product to be featured in American Beauty (I'm guessing Mercedes did?) or Fight Club (My bet is on Starbucks for this one)? I'm not saying Minority Report is anything like those two movies. It's vastly inferior to the first and vastly superior to the second. All I'm saying is this product placement isn't positive or even neutral, all it does is underscore how annoying and pervasive these companies and their ads are/will be. And since by definition all large corporations are/(regarded as) evil it doesn't mean these companies are somehow worse. It means their representatives in charge of promotion are a bunch of dumb asses...<br/><br/>Strange isn't it?<br/><br/>What? Oh! Minority Report. Good movie, in that it could just as well be taking place is 2014 as 2054. Whilst the concept takes a gigantic amount of suspension of disbelief, the effects are great, the black and blue colours nice and it does have some thrilling/exciting/gruesome/but more exciting than gruesome moments (although, admittedly, some of them are achieved through what we call 'fx' but to use an old-fashioned word could be described as 'loudness'. Still, it's only for some of them, not all).<br/><br/>And, of course the ending is Spielberg/Darabontian - it's not even all that happy, it's just sappy and stupid - which means this is a pretty good movie which can be made much better by doing your homework on the movie's length and walking out about 10 minutes early and pretending that was the end."

","I definitely recommend this Spielberg film, especially if you like Blade Runner, murder-mysteries, and other thinking movies.  ""Minority Report"" has so many quality ingredients, it should give most viewers good value for their dollar.<br/><br/>NOTE: this film does not have a warm cathartic feeling at the end, nor does it have many laughs.  Instead, Minority Report has a disturbing and accumulating tension and ""A.I.-like"" flavor to it, and it doesn't even release you from that feeling at the climax. (READ: don't take a first date to this film).<br/><br/>HIGHLIGHTS OF THIS MOVIE:  it is based on a Philip K. Dick story, just like Blade Runner, and it conveys a very similar-tasting gritty ambience; the technology in the movie is compelling; the surprisingly-few action scenes in the movie are well-choreographed; Tom Cruise does a very textured and noteworthy job as an embittered cop with emotional baggage; the cars in this movie are wonderful to watch; soundtrack is anxious and emotional; the narrative and quick dialogue are definitely appealing to thinking viewers.<br/><br/>LOW POINTS OF THIS MOVIE: there was no humor to release the tension; the first 15 minutes are bound to confuse many people; there could have been a few more gunfights for us testosterone viewers; the medical scenes with eyeball replacement will nauseate some viewers; the end leaves you with mixed emotions and disturbed visions of the future.<br/><br/>OVERALL:  I thoroughly enjoyed Minority Report.  If you like ""Blade Runner"" and other future-speculative fiction, or if you just like a good murder-mystery, then I recommend this as a full-price movie.<br/><br/>Four and a half stars out of Five."

","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** I'm surprised, how high the critics have rated this movie. This movie has some very obvious inherent draw backs and the movie has some low class comedy scenes. I'll give it a 7/10. 7 are for the new idea of precrimes and good performance by Tom Cruise. The direction by Spielberg was rather disappointing and at the same level of Lost World.<br/><br/>********************** SPOILERS ****************************<br/><br/>Drawbacks in direction:<br/><br/>The eyes of Tom Cruise were still functional at all security access locations even after he was charged with the murder. Those eyes were placed just in a simple plastic bag and they survived a fall to the floor and Tom Cruise who was so smart was stupid at that time to open those sensitive eyes like that and they instead of bursting they started rolling like golf balls and they even didn't disintegrate with time and continued to work after his imprisonment at all security access points.<br/><br/>The comedy scene where Tom Cruise was shown blind and he tried to eat something is not of Spielberg's standards. If a clever agent like Tom Cruise after eating a rotten bread can't even smell the rotten milk before drinking it, its a shame. He was not able to eat proper food but he was able to get in the tub with all the ice in time to get him saved from spiders.<br/><br/>I can't believe there was a big hole where those three psychics were kept and you can flush water so that two people can get out. They didn't show how they were able to get out so easily through that place and didn't face any security. This was unbelieveable flaw.<br/><br/>How the killer that tried to fool the system didn't realize that the psychics can see his face when he is trying to cover his face as they can arbitrarily see in future what is going to happen before a murder.<br/><br/>Spielberg should have explained how the killer planned to trap Tom Cruise and would have enticed him to go inside the building to try to kill the rented man as he went inside the building just he had watched the future predicted by the three psychics other wise the killer and rented man didn't try to do anything to make Tom Cruise come inside.<br/><br/>The UI of the video editing seem difficult and counter intutive and more like a musician waving his hands and the idea of names coming out on a carved ball is rather ridiculous.<br/><br/>The last scene where all the people were watching the video, Tom Cruise character hasn't seen that the girl psychic will send future stream of his murder so how he knew that if the killer didn't kill him the pre crime will fail and the future in the killers hand.<br/><br/>There are many such flaws like that and its not movie that you'll remember after some time. Its a good entertainment while in theater and when you come out you'll be surprised why are the critics doing not doing their job well."

All of these movies seemed way more optimistic then the Dick's stories, read Do Androids dream of Electric Sleep and compare it to Blade Runner.

","After Spielberg's efforts with A.I., I was worried that Phillip K Dick would suffer the same pink bunnies approach that Spielberg killed the Aldiss-Kubrick hybrid with.  I was wrong.  Minority Report is a gritty, deep, thoughtful action-packed thriller which caters to both fans of Dick's cynical approach to technology as well as people seeking the best of generic hybridisation where action-adventure meets thriller meets noir meets science fiction.  The performances are up to scratch, but the eyes to detail in terms of special effects are definitely worth watching and re-watching. From the Â‘clear' medium where images remain visible in storage to magnetic cars to eye-scanning techno-organic spiders, Minority Report caters to the obsessive detail watcher in all of us.  Great chase scenes, human characters, a love interest, a sexy precognitive, moral ambiguity and Big Brother (Huxley style) omnipresent advertising all add to your film-going pleasure.  The ending is perhaps a bit too up-beat but will no doubt be remedied by a darker director's cut on DVD by Christmas time!"

It plays out very believably. (Well, you know... with the normal suspension of disbelief and all...)<br/><br/>As you've seen from the trailers, the Washington DC Precrime Unit has<br/><br/>technology (hooked into good ol' human clairovoyants) that allows them to see murders before they happen.

Spielberg seems to have turned a corner with this film, and taken his formerly grandiose direction and minimized its scope.  You see, the beauty of this film is in the details.  Every lighting angle, every shot, seems like a dark, looming piece of art, meanwhile the story is thrilling you at a breakneck pace.  Some of the writing does leave you doubting chunks of the story (and their continuity/plausibility), but sure enough the freight train Spielberg has you on won't let you ponder those speed bumps. The future we're allowed to glimpse is so caught up in marketing and glamour that it feels like less science fiction and more like the future of our culture.  Look for marketing suits to steal ideas from this film to sell you hip clothing in ten years.  Nevertheless, in the grand scope of things, this film still feels like a little bit of a let down from the director (although the future technology is so plausible its worth ticket prices alone), a step in the right direction for a Cruise, and an overall media coup for closet genius Philip K.

Although there are some huge flaws in its logic, the main concepts it introduces certainly give you something to think about, which is what good SF is supposed to do. However, Spielberg's attempt to compensate for the film's lack of emotional pull by tacking on a happily-ever-after ending might cancel out the introspective aspects of the story for some people; I don't mind happy endings, but this ending was a bit too much.<br/><br/>The film gives you other things to chew on besides the SF concepts: action sequences, special effects, neat little gadgets, a few startling moments, a bit of humour, a bit of mystery, and Tom Cruise's chiselled and well-photographed face if you're into that.  It has a little bit of everything to satisfy most people.<br/><br/>Overall, though, ""Minority Report"" is a science fiction film, the kind that gives you something cool to look at and a few things to think about while you're being distracted by the action.

To me this film just exacerbates the trend towards relying on effects to carry the film where plot development and acting didn't quite pull it off.  I would love to Ask Steve Spielberg: Was it Emily Dickinson who said ""A Wooden way / Regardless grown, / A Quartz contentment, like a stone-- / This is the Hour of Lead""?  She had it just about right, Steve, but I think it was 2 plus hours of lead.  And Max Von Sydow  sure he is a great Villain, but you can't help but guess the entire second half of the movie when he shows up in a position of authority.

So much of this was creative, that it really bugged me when the writing spoiled it by ripping off LA Confidential with a surprise death scene, and also the fugitive, and even snake eyes, (that overhead shot was a DePalma move, even if nobody saw it). Despite these cheap attempts to hide the lack of originality, there is still a ton going for this movie. The PreCrime system is really clever. The plot and what one has to do in this situation, considering the workings of precrime, is also extremely smart. And the atmosphere and bleached look of the film is out of this world. This is the best Spielberg movie I've seen in a while. AI was stupid (when it wasn't Kubrick behind the scene), and Catch Me If You Can was corny as hell.

","There's a scene in Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"" in which cop-turned fugitive John Anderton (Tom Cruise) disguises himself by altering the appearance of his face using a silver-colored metal rod that, well, that changes the appearance of one's face, in the year 2054.<br/><br/>The prop master of ""Men in Black"" should check the stock, because that movie?s high-tech rod -- you know, the one the alien-hunters use to induce amnesia in anyone who has seen something they shouldn't -- has been pilfered.<br/><br/>How about the pursuit, during which Anderton is chased through the city by a squad of high-tech cops while trying to avoid retina scanners and other police-state-type identification devices?  And the central plot engine of frame-up and betrayal?  Think ""Total Recall.""<br/><br/>These are but two examples of how heavily ""Report"" has borrowed from futuristic films that went before.<br/><br/>Minority Report, in fact, is a great-looking pastiche of concepts and devices from other movies.  Unfortunately, it has precious little to call its own.<br/><br/>True, the meld of CGI imagery and live action is perhaps done as well as it has ever been done and the story moves along at a nice, action-filled pace. The plot, however, is paper-thin, and turns on a logical paradox that -- although it's acknowledged as such in the movie -- still leaves a hole in the story big enough to fly a jetpack through.<br/><br/>""Report's"" biggest sin, however, may be the utter lack of that element that invested ""Total Recall"" and ""Men in Black"" with much of their charm -- humor.   <br/><br/>OK, so there is that mild chuckle afforded by the eyes in the plastic bag, but this is a movie that takes itself 'way too seriously.<br/><br/>If Spielberg thought that the tragic plot line of an abducted child and controversy over a legal system that punishes people for what they MIGHT do (shades of post-Sept. 11 angst) would elevate this offering above familiar sci-fi fare, he was wrong.<br/><br/>And while the script is workmanlike, it may be notable for the absence of even one memorable line, such as Leon's chilling, ""Wake up, it's time to die"" in ""Blade Runner.""<br/><br/>Minority Report is slick and fun, and about as substantial as cotton candy which, considering it's a product of Steven Spielberg's undeniable skill and a whole whack of money, makes it a major disappointment."

","This is an extraordinary film.  The acting, casting, screenplay, and overall film was top-notch.  Going into watch the movie I was not so confident of Tom Cruise's acting ability because of his work in Mission: Impossible 2. Cruise's performance was absolutely incredible.  He was a perfect choice for the role of John Anderton.<br/><br/>One thing about this film you might want to know before you watch it s that this is not the kind of movie you see because you like to laugh or because you're looking for over the top action sequences.  Don't be fooled by the PG-13 rating either.  I belive this movie will be enjoyed most by intelligent adults.  You have to look at the meaning of the film and what it's asking.  Is everything predetermined from the start?  Does fate exist? Is everything predetermined until you see how it will happen and change it? Of course everyone will say no at first because nobody likes the idea that they aren't in control of their life.  It's one of those unanswerable questions.<br/><br/>This film was inspired by a Philip K. Dick story.  So were two other movies that I know of. They are Blade Runner and Total Recall.  I would recommend both of these to anyone who liked the film Minority Report.  Both are similar in the way that they are both depictions of what the future could be like and they have deeper meanings to them.  I would also recommend seeing The Matrix if you enjoyed Minority Report.  Of course all of these films I've mentioned are not for everybody.<br/><br/>The overall film is very enjoyable and worth watching.  You won't want to leave to go to the bathroom or to refill your drink you'll be so interested as the story unfolds with several twists and a very surprising resolution.<br/><br/>Rating: A- or 9/10"

","*Spoiler alert* I have many many things to say about the many illogical plot points of this movie but most are being said already so here's one.  I kept thinking throughout the movie that sometime between now and 2054 we must have thrown out the US Constitution.  First of all, the foundation of Precrime rests with the precogs... floating HUMANS.  So, they clearly have no rights. Second, premurderers are arrested immediately with only a retinal scan to confirm who they are and sent immediately to Containment.  No trial, lawyer, no judge, no jury and once they are haloed, effectively no longer living either.  So in essence, capital punishment with absolutely NO DUE PROCESS!!! So for the sake of the story, I suspended disbelief and went with it. Yet there John Anderton was (AFTER the time of the murder had already expired to boot!) administering the Miranda warning.  Apparently, the Constitution still does exist but only when it suits the plot.  Mr. Spielberg, I love you but this is a lesser director's effort not worthy of the man who has brought us so many brilliantly done movies before.  Thank god I paid less than the price of a rental to see this as I won't be renting it in the future (well, maybe in 2054, if I live that long, just to compare)"

","I have found that sci-fi films don't work anymore. If we try to think of truely GOOD sci-fi films the list is pretty short... most of them contain the names James Cameron or Steven Spielberg. While this seems to be the case (especially in the last couple of years) Steven Spielberg has done the impossible and created an amazing piece of filmmaking by fusing an interesting future world with the best ideas of Film Noir.<br/><br/>Without going into detail about the film it's all classic ""who-done-it"" and when, where and why. Tom Cruise clocks in an amazing performance (which means allot coming from me because I usually stray far & away from Tom Cruise films) which is depressed and twitchy. Spielbergs directing is at a new level and, while he hasn't mastered this level yet, he is obviously not far from it. The only real failing of the film is its ending which takes a bit too long to wind up everything into a nice and tight little ball. Even though the story does fit together well it still lacks a climax which can overcome the first heart pounding hour of the film. Still though, it's the best I've seen in a long time and can't wait to see what Spielberg will turn out next.

"dltdvd","8","0","0","22 June 2002"," Entertaining film despite its slow moments...
","First of all, I'd like to start off that Steven Spielberg is my all-time favorite director, and believe it or not, ""A.I."" has got to be my all-time favorite film. A year later, the genius director comes up with another futuristic tale that has an even more rewardingly dark tone to it than his previous outing. But does that mean it's as good?<br/><br/>It's tough not to like ""Minority Report,"" given that I'm a die-hard science fiction fan. I will admit that Spielberg's ""Minority"" is slow at times, but entertaining, nonetheless. The casting is brilliant as is the beautiful futuristic world, even if it does have a quite uglier nature.<br/><br/>Last year's ""A.I."" paid homage to some of Stanley Kubrick's movies by incorporating some of the darkest elements of human nature, which I'm very fond of. It allowed its audience to think as well as be stunned by its colorful world. ""Minority Report"" perhaps had the most complicated story elements of any movie I've seen up-to-date. It's impossible to understand the story completely in just one viewing, especially when the audience tends to get lost somewhere in the middle of the 2-and-a-half-hour movie. I rather believe that this is the beauty of the whole film. It's not your ordinary action movie, but it's more of a deep psychological thriller. That is what makes ""Minority Report"" yet another homage to Stanley Kubrick from Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>What will catch the audiences' eyes at the first viewing are the state-of-the-art special effects. However, unlike ""A.I.,"" ""Minority"" shows the most obvious effects at the beginning rather than the end, where most people make their final judgments as to whether or not they like the movie. Spielberg tells the story with special effects, which is why the effects in the second part are for the most part very subtle. The nice camerawork by Spielberg's long-time cinematographer Janusz Kaminski is also what helps the film's mood.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Minority Report"" is a decent sci-fi flick. I'm not going to say it was great because there is still a lot I've got to figure out. I'm sure with several more viewings I will learn to like the film. By then the minority will rule. Grade: B"

","People who quibble about plotholes seem to miss the point entirely.  But it is sadness knowing that people will never cease to miss the point. Most never attempt to find one. So Spielberg needs to stop bending over backwards for commercial success. The high concept here is too sublime  to cheapen with mainstream action sequences, no matter how 'creative' they are. It is also beautiful filmmaking, not gaudy or excessive like George Lucas' recent travesties.  Spielberg's future is not superfluous eye-candy but an essential part of the work. He assumes his environment exists, and so it does. No heavy-handed pans or long shots besides those which are relevant. So Spielberg creates atmosphere as well as he always does - in AI, Schindler's List, E.T. All these movies have palpable atmosphere, ripe with both emotion and intellect. And SS disowns the notion of consistent future, opting instead for the likely medium between what is and what will be.  Like AI, his setting changes with the plotline - the plotline doesn't work around the setting. No foresaking the practice of allusion with excess - all allusions in this movie are loaded, literary-like, with relevance. Although I don't like the Matrix fanfare(the sound effect - horns and spiders crawling up the stairs?) Thematically this movie is somewhere between a Comedy and a Tragedy. I just hope that Tom Cruise's late line, vaguely remembered as ""You know your own future which means you can change it,"" is meant to be taken with a grain of salt. But the resultant philosophical can of worms is too big to open right now. Regardless, I love this movie. See it. 9.5/10(here, 9/10)"
"jowidag","8","0","0","22 June 2002"," explanation of ""plot holes"" for those who SAW the movie
","first of all, I loved this movie, but that's not what I'm here to do.  I'm here to clear up 2 frequent misconceptions people had about this movie which for many people were disguised as a plot holes.  warning: this one IS A SPOILER!<br/><br/>Many people said, ""without the precogs telling john anderton that he would kill this man, he would never have been in that room and would never have met him.  So if the precogs hadn't determined his fate, it would never really have been his fate.""<br/><br/>That is true.  If he hadn't been on the run because the pre-cogs determined he would kill the guy, he would never have gone to the inventor of pre-crime's house and found out about the minority report, would never have found out who really killed that women (i forget her name, would never have been set up, would never have kidnapped agatha, would never have gone to that hotel, and he never would never have seen that man.<br/><br/>But that was his fate.  He was meant to see the pre-cogs prediction just as he was meant to do all of those other things.  Though the pre-cog's prediction itself changed the future, the altered future is what was meant to happen.  You can't say ""what if he didn't see the visions?  would he still have committed the murder?"" because he was meant to see the visions. It's like if today, i was to find a magic crystal ball that told be that tomorrow I would find treasure.  And the ball then went on to tell me exactly where the treasure was.  Say it was in hawaii.  So the next day I fly to hawaii and get the treasure. It's true that without even finding the crystal ball, i never would have flown to Hawaii and found the treasure. But my fate was to find the crystal ball, so that was already accounted for in my future.<br/><br/>Another thing people don't get that ties into the previous one is how could the pre-cogs see the future murders if the future murders weren't going to happen.  And how could the future be changed at the last second but not before that point.  How could Mr. Marks be destined to kill his wife but that destiny could only be changed at the last second.  How could John Anderton be taken to the point at which he was meant to kill the guy but not go through with it. When John was with Agatha and he said ""how can I kill a man i don't even know?   and i've never even been in that room""  She replies ""a sequence of events in your life will lead you to that room and to the man.  but once there, you will still have a choice.  You can still walk away.""  So he was going to be in that room, no matter how hard he tried to stop it and he was going to meet the man and be presented with a choice.  But once presented with that choice, only then could he change his future.  And that's what he did. And that was the whole point of the movie.  It's important to understand these ""plot holes"" were introduced intentionally as thought provokers and as representations for reality.  I won't get into that too much, because I don't know enough about it, but the film and the answers to these questions can be answered on two levels.  The logical, and the metaphorical, wherein the movie tries to depict current controversal beliefs and such in a futuristic background.  And that's why this is such a great movie."
"Frodo4934","Null","0","0","22 June 2002"," Worthy Effort
","I really enjoyed this movie, although to a truly deep thinking person I would advise you leave your logical mind at the door. There are a few flaws that are not addressed in this otherwise carefully crafted film. First: If the proscribed method of justice were to go nationwide, where would all the necessary ""precogs"" come from? Second: As in the current jury system which requires that all members agree, why would the system simply not place as much credence on a situation where the three ""precogs"" did not agree? Seems logical to conclude that unanimity would be required before action be taken. There were other flaws as well, but they detracted very little from the overall rollercoaster ride. It is well worth spending an afternoon away from the office to attend the matinee."

Some parts almost reminded me of AI like when John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) was fighting a guy named Crow who John thinks he's responsible for his kidnapped son, Sean. The part was similar to the AI movie when David was fighting a clone of himself trying to prove that theres only one android child like him. AI was also a cool movie but what I don't like is that the story was light-hearted and less dark. But When I watched Minority Report, it was darker than AI.

It's imaginative, dark and occasionally thrilling, with one or two sequences worthy of Hitchcock were he to make a sci fi version of one of his wrong man scenarios.  Then you get to the last twenty minutes, which are dreadful.  Not only does Spielberg seem unable or unwilling to allow one of his movies to have a dark or disturbing ending but he can't even allow a potentially upsetting thread to remain hanging.  Instead the bad guy has to get caught, the good guy has to be vindicated, he has to repair his relationship with his estranged wife and she has to be expecting, the future crime program has to be terminated and the precogs have to be shown to be leaving satisfying lives.  Yuck.  The ending is ludicrous and betrays everything that the first two hours of the movie had accomplished."

These seeming anachronisms put me off in the beginning of the film but then the plot and powerful visuals took hold and whirled me along.<br/><br/>The only other disappointment was the director's insistence on over explaining everything -- the temple/god/priests bit with the cops, in particular.

"Steven Reynolds","8","0","0","24 June 2002"," Cool and calculated
","You'll enjoy this stylish blend of sci-fi and film noir if you're willing to suspend your disbelief at the door.  Many reviewers have decried the plain lazy plot holes in Scott Frank and Jon Cohen's otherwise excellent screenplay, but in the end these deficiencies hardly matter.  Movies dealing with predestination never answer the big questions effectively - they just use them as the springboard for a story.  And 'Minority Report' tells a pretty good one, even if it does say where it's heading too soon and is occasionally marred by Spielberg's trademark mawkishness. Cruise is hugely enjoyable as the frantic John Anderton, and Colin Farrell does a really fine job of making you hate Detective Witwer.  The film looks great, sounds great, holds your attention for all 147 minutes, and will even have you giggling at the spectacular product placements and some unexpectedly comic moments.  This is a reasonably faithful adaptation of Philip K. Dick's short story so fans of the original should be pleased, although Act 3 does see the writers wandering off into Hollywood-ending territory (oddly reminiscent of 'The Fugitive') and has Spielberg wrapping things up on a typically optimistic false note.  Still, it's refreshing to see a bunch of filmmakers tackling a sci-fi adaptation seriously, successfully, yet still with an eye on the marketplace. I don't see that as a compromise.  If you're going to spend close to $100 million on a sci-fi project - and, let's face it, these days you have to - then you've got to consider the box-office.  The result is a memorable film that strikes a good balance between deep thought and summer fun.  It probably won't have enough explosions to please the die-hard action fans, nor enough depth to really thrill the sci-fi devotees Â– but it certainly worked for me."
"enlight","Null","0","0","22 June 2002"," Philip Dick strikes again
","Top billing for Minority Report will go to the infamous Steven Spielberg. But as the creator of the intense but crushingly sentimental Saving Private Ryan, and the promising but cruelly lobotomized AI, it's clear he's only part of this puzzle. The credit for what is probably one of the most vital, important, and timely science fiction movies of the 21st century so far ultimately goes to two dead men; the also-infamous Philip K. Dick (the criminal mastermind behind such diverse works as Blade Runner, Total Recall, and Screamers), and Spielberg's eccentric British alter-ego, Stanley Kubrick, whose influence (along with a series of touching allusions) haunt this film like a frightening but ultimately benevolent ghost. With uncharacteristic restraint, Spielberg admits as much, as his `precognitive' tells the distraught Tom Cruise, `the dead watch, and help the living.'<br/><br/>In fact, uncharacteristic restraint is the surprising hallmark of this movie, making one think that perhaps in Dick, Spielberg has finally met his match. A dividend of his material's prolific genius, the moviemakers seem at last capable of letting facts settle in to place quietly and the difficult moral and philosophical dimensions of the story hang true, an almost unknown level of class from a moviemaking culture in general and a filmmaker in particular so accustomed to black-and-white morality tales and audience-bludgeoning simplicity.<br/><br/>The story of psychics who are forced to dream an endless string of murders so the police can prevent them is more than just unsettling in its alienness; it represents a comforting and powerful weapon against violence, depicted in all of its terrifying spectacle so that we understand what is at stake; it's allowed to enter the ancient struggle to defend the myth of choice - to feel that, despite all the growing evidence, we determine our own fate through the mystical agency of free will. It shows us, and quietly tells us, that no human system can ever be perfect. Finally, we are led back to the foundations of our democracy - wordlessly reminded that the architects of our country knowingly intended that `a hundred criminals go free rather than one innocent be deprived of their freedom' - and that they had very good reasons for their beliefs.<br/><br/>Minority Report knowingly makes a beautiful example of how a society's weaknesses are often its strengths: the more powerful and technocratic a state, the more awful it is when bent towards abuse. Yet the movie never preaches, and it never pretends to give answers it doesn't have. Dick, and I think even Kubrick, would be proud.<br/><br/>For better or worse, Spielberg's most often used talent these days is his ability to preside over a state-of-the-art technical production with verve and style, to truly use the CG rather than be used by it, and he does so masterfully; just as in AI, the sets and the effects are stunning, yet equally as restrained and refined as the story. His cadre of production designers, editors and choreographers has created pacing and rendered action sequences so breathtaking that they risk belying the humble and earnest genius of the script.<br/><br/>Attention should be paid to the always-neglected screenwriters, who in this case are Scott Frank, author of the surprisingly watchable Out of Sight as well as the excellent Dead Again, and the unknown Jon Cohen, who has apparently started very big. Their science fiction summer blockbuster has more social conscience than most of its mainstream, independent and art house contemporaries, and it is not uncommon to see tears in the theater, lit by the closing credits. It will be very interesting to see how they top this effort."

The special effects were fantastic. The plot was intricate and anxiety ridden. It was definitely one of the best films I have ever seen. The story(by Philip K. Dick, who also wrote the story for Ridley Scott's 1982 sci-fi cult classic, Blade Runner) is of a future where murders can be predicted before they occur by three gifted individuals known as ""Precog's"". The Washington D.C. pre-crime department has taken advantage of these three persons to help them arrest might-be-murderer's. The brilliance and flaw of the system lie therein...even though these ""precog's"" say they will, will the person actually commit the crime. Is it worth not taking any chances and accidentally arresting some of the wrong people, or is it better to allow so many more murders to occur. This and plenty of thought provoking questions are revealed throughout all of Minority Report's twisting.

But if you want to see one of the most intelligent and not to mention most entertaining movies that have come out this year, you should really not miss out on the ""Minority Report""."

In another time, another place, another movie.  This was not just another movie, though. This was a movie that lost me in the twists and turns and strange futuristic ideas, no matter how predictable some of them were.<br/><br/>Someone buy Spielberg a drink.  He's done it!  AGAIN!

","Spielberg has put together a masterpiece in every sense of the word. Spielberg is possibly the greatest filmmaker of our timeand every aspect of this film displays that.  First of all, an obvious section is the action. This film has put together some rip-roaring action that keeps you excited, but also the action purely melds with the time frame in a way that is completely believable.  Secondly, intruige. This movie never lets you stop thinking.  You are always contemplating what is happening and why and what is coming up next.  Next is suspense.  There must be 10 scenes in this film that had me gripping my chair literally wondering how its going to turn out. That feeling to me is unbelievable Spielberg is probably 2nd most master of suspense next to Alfred Hitchcock (whom Spielberg studied for this film). Finally is story, all of these elements (including many more that I havent mentioned, i.e. cinematogrophy, acting, special effects) blend seemlessly to create not just a movie dominated by action and special effescts (which are cool in thier own right) but an eloquent and intruiging story that makes the action and special effects just icing on this dang tasty cake.  Quite simply, Speilberg has created one of the most breathtaking and jaw dropping films I have ever seen.  Minority Report is a masterpiece!!!!"

","This movie is what all the other ""one man against the futuristic system that's working against him"" movies wish they had been.  I can think of a bunch: Demolition Man, Total Recall, Gattaca, Logan's Run, Time Cop, etc., etc.  I think this is as good as a movie of this type could possibly be, and I hesitate to even mention it in the same breath as the others, lest people that hated one or more of them give this one a miss.<br/><br/>This is a character driven piece that has elements of Drama, Sci- Fi, Action, Whodunit and Locked Door Murder.  The vision of the future is first-rate, Art Direction beautiful, the Camera work is masterful.  Clearly Spielberg at his best. As other comments have said, there *are* plot holes (which I won't discuss)- I thought of 2 of them during the movie, half a dozen more later, but I think all of them can be chalked up to sloppy procedures by the pre-crime police, and I'd argue that any homicide department that hadn't dealt with a successful murderer in 6 years would get sloppy, so it didn't detract from my enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>If there's any chance you might ever like a movie in this genre, go see Minority Report - I'd bet it's the one."

","To say that this movie is perfect wouldn't be a total lie, however, it does have its flaws. I mean every movie does, some of its the actors and some of it is the way the film is made. In this case it was neither, the flaw is simply the story, the whole basis for the film. To me, its the film that will suffer in the long run.<br/><br/>The whole aspect, the futuristic authority, catching someone before they even commit a crime. Unbelievable. Spielberg does some amazing things, that I won't deny, some of the stuff that goes on in the movie is just simply amazing, but not perfect.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a Detective for Pre-Crime (go figure..), he lost his son back in the past to a kidnapper...thus is why he goes to work there anyway. Von Exel is Burgess, like his mentor, his guiding light, the person who continues to tell him everything is okay, Also is the director of this Pre-Crime.<br/><br/>So Cruise's character John Anderton is set up for murder so he believes...but then be begins to believe otherwise..Colin Farrel (aka Bullseye, Yeah!) is a investigator sent to the Pre-Crime Unit to seek out flaws and he finds one.

"karlbimdb","10","0","0","21 June 2002"," Fresh Science Fiction Noir peppered with Character segments.
","From the opening Fox and Dreamworks logos, this film sets a style and tone that is clear - Science Fiction noir... a whodunnit framed in a future society issues and values.<br/><br/>The film doesnt soapbox - it simply moves forward with the story from the opening scenes.  Its a smart film, knowing (or guiding) exactly what the audience wants to see.<br/><br/>The story mixes some wonderful character scene pieces - Peter Stormare's dirty doctor; the Lois Smith's slightly mad Pre-cog inventor; David Stifel's very cool Lycon the Black Inhaler dealer; and more.  Such scenes give the audience a breather, fills in the blanks, moves the story, and provides an awesome texture and depth not found in many contemporary science fiction films.<br/><br/>The screen play does have a few ""leaps of faith"".  I dont think they are holes, as this implies plot error.  Rather, these are plot issues that may not seem plausible or represent common sense.  Yet the core whodunnit mystery stays intact and is fair and interesting enough for the broad audience.<br/><br/>Another gripe is the length of the film.  Without exposing plot, the story does tend to end anticlimatically, rather than a nice dramatic close. Spielberg does need to punctuate a bit more.<br/><br/>Spielberg's magic comes in presentation.  He is just a master at finding the right camera angle, the right nuiance, the proper pacing.  The effects for most of the film are seamless with their film counterparts.  The two-shot with Samantha and Tom is a master stroke of a director absorbing the audience into a scene.<br/><br/>Its a go-see for sure."

"RuffRide","8","0","0","21 June 2002"," ""Minority Report"" is a film that will be hard to forget and hard to dislike.
","Steven Spielberg directs this futuristic tale of murder, set-ups and just plain strange.  The movie stars Tom Cruise(another great preformance turned in by him...off the footsteps of his last film ""Vanilla Sky"" and still a great preformance), he plays Detective John Anderton, a man who is a druggie and a broken man, ever since the abduction of his young son while they were at a public pool.  That follows him throughout the moive, and of course it becomes his weakness, but all in all, it's what brings him down.  He works for a special unit of police officers called 'Pre-Crime', they stopped murders before they actually happen.  Anderton, and his other workers, are introduced to Detective Ed Witwer(wonderfully played by Colin Farrell,a actor I enjoy watching), he is there to investigate; as he tells Cruise at one point, he's there to find a problem in the 'Pre-Crime' unit because there always is one.<br/><br/>The tabels are then turned on Anderton when he accused of a murder that he has no clue he is goin to preform, he doesn't even have a clue who the person is that he is suppose to kill.  He then runs, he runs from his co-workers, his friends, because he has no other choice; as told in the movie on many times and which is the tagline of the movie; 'everybody runs'. He then is informned by the creator of 'Pre-Crime' that there might be a chance he can find something called a 'Minority Report' were is shows that they could be wrong.  The movie is then placed with Cruise running(sometimes flying as a chase with jetpacks is shown; and is one of the highlights of this movie), and him trying to get ahold of that report...to prove he was innocent.<br/><br/>The movie looks prefect, just the color of all the scenes, a grayish color, that made me fall in love with it.  I thought the effects were done prefectly(another favorite of mine is the guns the officers use, you will know what I mean when you see it), and the preformances are something else that makes the movie...Cruise is great(again); Colin Farrell is great as the cocky detective bent on ruining Anderton; Max von Sydow is also good as Direcor Burgess half creator of 'Pre-Crime' and a personal friend of Anderton he doesn't want to believe the crime either; and last theres a small role, cameo if you will, by one of my favorites; Peter Stormare as Doctor Solomon; a one time crazy plastic surgeon that Anderton put away for burning his victims alive and tape them, he's always entertaing at his movies, again I was surprised and happy to see him in this movie.<br/><br/>
""Minority Report"" was a very good film, it also has a twist(which I'm not goin to tell) in the middle, keeps you awake.  It has a little comedy invovled to make you smile and maybe chuckle, it also has fun with advertisements within the movie; such as 'Gap' and ' Pespi', I don't know if it was on purpose or was for fun, that I'm not sure about.  This is on my top 10 list of best movies on 2002; ""Windtalkers"" took number one last week and will be hard to beat; but ""Minority Report"" has made it on my top 10 list, I really enjoyed it and thought it was as great as I thought it was going to be."

Well, since that's a dramatic masterpiece it belongs with films like ""The Godfather"" that you might watch once every five to ten years.<br/><br/>I predict ""Minority Report"" will set a new record for DVD sales, and be one of those movies you can easily watch two or three times a year and have a Rock & Roll Ride each time.<br/><br/>I guarantee ""Minority Report"" will literally make your eyes pop out!<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is quite good in the comedic moments, and that makes his cameo in ""Austin Powers in Goldmember"" something to look forward to!<br/><br/>The Coming Attractions trailers that accompany the film are quite sensational.<br/><br/>Usually, I may see a movie when it comes out in the theaters, and then rent the DVD when it comes out 6 months later.

","The Film is a great success. It is telling that both Spielberg and Cruise have worked with Kubrick. From the opening scenes his presence is felt and welcome. Shades of Brazil and W.Gibson are there as well. Most importantly it is the most faithful adaptation of a P K Dick story, period. Humor, wit and suspense are all presence. The images are stunning. Tom Cruise is great. What an ultimate ascention to credibility from the pretty boy actor who starred in Top Gun and Cocktail. Spielberg and crew also seem to be reasserting themselves after the critical drumming that A.I. took. All the flaws of A.I> are cleaned up. Gone are the fluff and disneyesque visions of the future. It's all streamlined Dickian vision here. The psychic loops and societal pot shots of a great Dick novel are all healthily present. Any Hard Sci-fi buff would be in heaven here with all the jaw dropping visions o f convincing future technologies. I found the surrealism of PK's humor very surprisingly present. If there is any flaw at all it is perhaps that there may have been a touch too much back story, bogging down an otherwise streamlined picture that has the uncanny ability of taking the viewer along empathetically in such a bizarre future scenario. I have much respect for all of those involved in the making of this picture.  Minority Report is the highest form of respect to both the author and the genre of sci-fi as a whole.<br/><br/> 10 out of 10. I'm floored"

","Minor Spoilers Included<br/><br/> Speaking as a huge Spielberg fan, I was looking forward to Minority Report, but was ultimately disappointed by the film. On the surface it has so much going for it, interesting story (especially the issue of individual privacy and free will), good cast, and terrific special effects, yet it never lives up to all its potential. For me, Tom Cruise's mechanical, uninspiring performance stands as a mirror for the entire film. Yet, what I found most disappointing, was the last twenty to thirty minutes of the movie when the story turns into your standard action film, culminating in a typical confrontation between the good guy and the villain, and a tidy little ending.<br/><br/> On a more positive note, both Samantha Morton and Colin Farrell give wonderful performances. Farrell, with his good looks, intensity, and brimming sexuality steals every scene and completely out shines Cruise."
"rodneyrude01","10","0","0","21 June 2002"," Best film of the year
","Without a doubt, Spielberg's masterpiece Minority Report would be the best film of the year and ultimately, it is one of the first Summer blockbusters since The Matrix that can combine a terrific storyline within a blockbuster framework. Although Spielberg's last effort A.I. which also was equally brilliant, sat on the fence with viewers, Minority Report is much more appealing to mainstream viewers yet again incorporates a dark and probing storyline. Tom Cruise puts in a surprisingly good and credible performance that easily surpasses his previous action-y performances in Mission Impossible 2. Along with Cruise, the supporting cast is excellent with sleeper actor Samantha Morton giving an emotional performance. The Phillip K Dick story is wonderfully adapted by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen into a brilliantly rendered narrative that portrays a bleak, jawdropping and very intriguing view of the future and it's resultant flaws. The score by John Williams, as always, expertly captures every emotion of the film and accompanies the celluloid with oblique ambiance to providing thrilling action riffs. A definite highlight is the cinematography by lens legend Janusz Kaminski. His contrast of grey and blue filters to overwashed and overexposed scenes create a unique environment to the phenomenal sets and production design. Finally, cutos goes to Spielberg, who never fails with his flawless direction. With his fluid camera movement, perfect composition, expert pacing with the help of Michael Kahn's spoton editing, helming of action sequences and an eye for capturing the emotions and actions of his actors, he is by far the best modern director Hollywood film has seen and is an icon among film buffs. Minority Report is a technical masterpiece with a story to match and will join the walls of Steven Spielberg's brilliant career. 5 out of 5"
"Brogan","10","0","0","20 June 2002"," Man on the Run.
","Steven Spielberg returns to his roots from his suspense of JAWS in his latest film, MINORITY REPORT.  Where his last film, A.I. was more of a film of wonder, MINORITY REPORTY is more of fear.  The best way to describe this film is: ""Spielberg does Hitchcock.""  It proves that when a old dog does tricks, he can do them well, and still impress people. MINORITY REPORT is based on the short story by the late Phillip K. Dick who wrote the novels for other sci-fi classics of BLADE RUNNER and TOTAL RECALL.  In Washington D.C. of the year 2054, the strongest police unit in the force is the ""precrime"" unit.  With the precrime unit, a officer can detect and find out when and where a murder is going to happen before the act is even committed.  Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) feels that the system is perfect and  precrime is what is keep society safe.  John is then confronted by Ed Witwer (Colin Farrell) from the Attorney General's office who believes a theory: ""if they see the person committing a act of murder in the future, how do they know that the murderer didn't change their mind at the last minute?""  John sees this theory as nonsense until he is the next target of arrest for a murder of a man that he doesn't even know.  John who hunted down killers is now the hunted, with his old partner, Officer Fletcher (Neal McDonough) leading the force after John.  John must beat the countdown clock to zero to find out is he going to commit a act of murder and who is the victim? MINORITY REPORT has Spielberg return to the suspense genre with a big bang.  This is one excellent and mind-blowing film that will please everyone in the audience.  Where A.I. was for the thinking man and JURASSIC PARK was for the eye candy, MINORITY REPORT will please the intellects with the suspense filled Hitchcock plot and anti-punishment theme similar to Kubrick's A CLOCKWORK ORANGE.  The ones for eye candy will enjoy the action scenes and the spectacular realistic effects of the future. My favorite is the transportation system of the everyday person and their express ways.<br/><br/>     Another aspect of MINORITY REPORT that I enjoyed a lot was the use of blue and grey coloring.  From the very begining when the Fox and Dreamworks studio logo appear, it gives the viewer the clue on what type of movie this is going to be.  The coloring adds to the mood and tone of the story where this is a dark and mysterious future.  Credit should go to Spielberg and his regular cinematographer Janusz Kaminski, who use the same coloring that was in SAVING PRIVATE RYAN and much more different than the colorful A.I. and HOOK. I also did enjoy the editing by Michael Kahn and the scoring by the legendary John Williams, who are both Spielberg regulars.  Kahn does a great job by keeping the editing in a rapid pace, yet he gives the audience a chance to see what is going on.  There is never really a dull or worthless scene that is shown in MINORITY REPORT.  And John Williams does his Hitchcock style of music by doing a Bernard Herrman similar score from NORTH BY NORTHWEST.  Which would make sense since both movies are about that same theme, the man on the run. The only thing I would complain about MINORITY REPORT is the character development.  The actors all do a good job in their roles, but there isn't enough substance to understand on who the character's are.  The viewer does get to know who John Anderton is, but that is pretty much the only character on who the film focuses on.  There were some questions left open for me: Why did Witwer feel the system can have mistakes, yet he uses it to try to capture John?  Why is the relationship between Precrime Director Burgess (Max Von Sydow) and John Anderton so strong?       But that is small potatoes comparing with the rest of the film, and believe me the rest of the film succeeds!  I haven't had this much with a film in a while.  The suspense and action gives enough energy to make this two hour plus movie go by very quickly.  I have to give this movie credit, I did not look at my watch once to see what time it was.  I haven't done that with a movie in years. Where you have comic book action with SPIDER-MAN in one corner, the space opera of ATTACK OF THE CLONES in another corner, and the miltary gone wrong action of SUM OF ALL FEARS in the third corner.  I would reccommend that you go to the final corner and view the mystery/action/suspense of MINORITY REPORT.  And who knows, maybe after watching this movie, it might give you a different point of view on murder.  Spielberg returns to the excitement and fun similar to RAIDERS OF THE LOST ARK and JURASSIC PARK with MINORITY REPORT.  Do yourself a favor and see this movie!  ***** (out of five)"

One might think that taking away one's basic rights and freedoms in the name of justice is the answer, then that System turns on one of their own.<br/><br/>Governments, pay attention.

","...Am I really the only one who dislikes this film?<br/><br/>This film, which I saw just earlier today, is based on a short story by science fiction master Philip K Dick. PKD fans can rest assured that the original story is more or less intact. Even the cheesier bits, like the precogs, have been retained - also the title, the character names, and a lot of what happens.<br/><br/>But PKD's stories get a lot more original than this. Let's face it, anyoine who has read PKD's stuff is not lilkely to latch onto this mid-1950s mild porridge as a good story to adapt. Is this really even worth adapting? To me it was a lapse in PKD's usual brilliance. Come on!<br/><br/>Anyway, the end resulyt is a film that has all the cheese of 1950s pulp sci-fi. Frankly, the script stinks badly. The changes that were made to the original story - and there are some - neatly remove the tight plotting of the original story. A morass of shapeless dialogue is left. The  action is silly. The pacing is off. There are boring sections that you wouldn't believe. I can see no action-film buff enjoying this, any more than an intellectual, or a sci-fi geek.<br/><br/>Although I repect the fact that other people have a right to like a film that I dislike, here is an example of a film that I think is so blatantly flawed that I wonder what all the other reviewers are on. Did they even see the same film I did??!<br/><br/>As a PKD fan, I can only say that I am glad PKD's stories are being given such wide audience now! The Matrix, The Truman Show, The Thirteenth Floor, Dark City, Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Existenz, Cube, Fight Club, Sixth Sense, Memento, and now Minority Report, are all based on that late genius' ideas.<br/><br/>If only Spielberg had done this better, and/or used one of Mr Dick's more original stories to adapt! I want to see Ubik or Three Stigmata of Palmer Eldritch on the big screen, please! Though it would probably give the studios ulcers if they found out how unconventionally strange these stories are...<br/><br/>PS, the Matrix is really cool, and it's probably THE most adequate adaption of PKD's ideas to date!!!"

","This movie works on so many different levels.  Its elements of mystery, action, suspense, science fiction and drama all fit nicely into a 2 hour storytelling shell.  The acting is superb.  The directing is consistant with what we have come to expect from a Speilberg film.  This is definetly his best work in many years.  The developmental points of the film were woven seamlessly with the futuristic vision.  Speilberg succeeds with Minority Report where AI failed.  I left the theater thinking about the film in the same way I did with Vanilla Sky and The Matrix.  Minority Report flows, letting the story direct the way rather than the present issues of morality. There is little time to rest the eyes or ease the thought.  Speilberg's visual flair, Williams' engaging score and the story's twists and turns keep the viewer's attention sharp and focused."
"kouch21","8","0","0","21 June 2002"," Can you see?
","Minority Report is a welcome departure from the fluff that defines most summer movies.  I should expect no less from Spielberg, who directs this adaptation of the Philip K. Dick short story.  The film is set 52 years in the future, when murders (in Washington D.C. anyway) are a thing of the past.  Cruise plays a cop in the Orwellian pre-crime unit who, through the use of three 'oracles', prevent potential murders from taking place. However, when the system is turned on him, he runs in pursuit of the truth. His odyssey changes his perception of pre-crime and all that comes with it, giving him new vision along the way.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives another solid performance (as he did in Vanilla Sky and Eyes Wide Shut) and Colin Farrell was adequate in the detective role.  The film certainly has a unique visual style, sleekly futuristic but not overly rich in color (as was Soderbergh's D.C. in Traffic).  John Williams' score for the film was his usual, though at points I wanted to yell out that this wasn't Jurassic Park or an Indiana Jones' movie.  A couple spots in this film were (in my opinion) rather predictable, and it wasn't due to the heavy marketing campaign for the film.  Also, I couldn't help but feel that the ending was a little too upbeat with very few loose ends.  Why let the audience have imagination when you can narrate it away?<br/><br/>
Despite these shortcomings, I have to say that I believe this film to be the most complete film of the summer (so far) and is worth the trip to the cinema to see."

OK, on to the real review...<br/><br/>Contains Spoilers<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" is a very good movie, but not nearly as superb as some on IMDB would have you believe.  But in this day and age, it is so rare that we are treated to an intelligent, thought-provoking action/sci-fi movie that you just have to admire it.  Yes, this is a welcome rebound from Spielberg after the dreadful ""A.I.""  He is smart enough to show us a vision of the future that is neither a bleak wasteland nor a candy-coated utopia.<br/><br/>I, for one, very much enjoyed the muted cinematography and felt it added realism to the visual effects.  The plot is solid, if somewhat predictable. Even though an observant viewer can see where the story is headed, there are enough twists and depth to the loyalties of each character that Spielberg keeps you guessing just enough to be enthralled.  The acting is solid throughout, with special accolades going to Ruffalo as an impassioned investigator.<br/><br/>I did feel, however, that the film is conceptually flawed.  One of the main themes driven home near the conclusion is that if you know what the future is to be, you have the power to alter it.  This is obviously true, so why weren't the Precrime units used as a deterrent instead of an arrest force? If they can see someone is going to commit murder in 3 days, why not just go to their door and tell the future murderer that if he/she goes through with it that they're going to live the rest of their lives in a plastic tube with a pair of lobotomy earphones?  That would stop me from committing murder. As for yet another minor complaint, I thought the overabundance of product placement was distracting.<br/><br/>But aside from those quibbles, I found this is to be a challenging, exciting and cerebral movie.  Definitely worth a viewing.<br/><br/>Rating: 8/10"

","My wife and I saw this film twice. We live in rural Appalachia and unfortunately, a lot of the people in the audience just didn't `get' this movie. I saw three couples get up and leave about half way through. One man mumbled `What a rip-off, this is boring' on the way out. Another couple plotted to break into Scooby Doo. That's more of a comment on the poor taste of rural Appalachians than of the quality of the movie. This film required thought to watch and some people just don't like to think.<br/><br/>
MILD SPOILERS (not too many details, like a movie trailer)<br/><br/>My wife and I both found the move totally thrilling. It is definitely not a mindless a `Triple X' or `Mission Impossible 2' type action flick. In fact, Spielberg's film is only part action. It also contains equal measures of sci-fi, and murder mystery. Much to our delight, the film succeeded on all three fronts. So many Sci-fi pictures fail because they don't paint a believable image of the future. Spielberg creates a very plausible future universe that is *ALMOST* devoid of annoying plot holes. The holes are so minor, that I didn't even notice them until the next day. His vision of the future is one segregated by classes, where the rich live in new, completely automated luxury apartments and cruise on elevated highways far above the old city. The middle class are still living in vinyl sided or brick faced two story houses in bland suburban neighborhoods. The poor are huddled into government build apartment complexes. Advertising has run rampant. Everyone has their eyes scanned whenever they walk by a talking billboard, shop at the GAP, and even when they get on the Subway. I take it the subway sends them a bill based on their retinal scan. Personal privacy in Spielberg's future world has been compromised to a believable degree. And that in itself is kind of scary.<br/><br/>As far as action, there are plenty of cliff hanging, high speed chases. But the highlight was a fight on the conveyor belt or a 100% automated LEXUS plant where Cruise's character escapes by driving off in a car that ends up being built around him. That's clever! Most people were caught off guard by the resolution of the mystery, but they didn't complain. The mystery plot, like the rest of the film, was not all that far fetched, and a delight when finally revealed.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes are quite beautiful. Drenched in brilliant white light or grey industrial skies, every scene from start to end is pure eye candy.  The female `precog', Agatha, is freaky to behold while lying in her `soup' bath (you'll understand) and even weirder when on the lamb.<br/><br/>
There are so many GOOD things about this movie, so much attention to detail, that I can't possibly list everything that this film managed to do well. But there is one consistent fault Spielberg that he can't seem to shake--his incessant and predictable use of the `Hollywood ending.' In my opinion, it is the only thing holding Spielberg back from being a timeless director. In my opinion, the ending could have been way better. The film would have made more of an impact if it stopped twenty minutes earlier in the prison. The ending as it stands almost seems tacked on. I can't help but think that Spielberg did end the film where I thought it should end, but it didn't `test well' in group, so he re-wrote it. Perhaps a redneck or two at the screening test got up and walked out because it wasn't to their liking. Ah, well. All I can say is if the ending had been a little less predictable, I would have liked this film even more than I did. It gets a nearly perfect 9 out of 10."

","Minority Report was one tight movie which will be loved by SF fans the world over, but listening to people exiting, I couldn't help but wonder if this movie won't get the credit it deserves...<br/><br/>The plot of Minority Report is brilliant. I haven't read the original Philip K. Dick story it was based on, but movie adaptations of Dick's stories are usually better on the big screen than reading his depressing tales. Minority Report is no exception - it loops and weaves, mainly in the realms of predictability, but then the element of 'choice' steps in and the final 20 minutes are completely unpredictable. <br/><br/>That fact that most of the movie is predictable doesn't really detract from the strong story - it just leaves you more time to focus on little details that make up this film - like the product placement... Although most of the products probably will be around in 2054, some raised an eyebrow or two! I'd like the watch though! The technology being envisioned for 2054 is also really slick - we'll probably be 90% there or have completely blown past some of the technology on offer. Can't see the huge magnetic roads coming into play though - too much capital would have to be found...<br/><br/>It was a pleasant change to see Tom Cruise in a movie where it wasn't ""Tom Cruise playing someone with a different name"" I'm not leaping up here and saying he can act, but this would be the first Tom Cruise movie I've seen in a long time where I was able to forget that I was watching Tom Cruise and actually believe in Jon Anderton instead. A refreshing change!<br/><br/>The thing that really urked me the most in the film was Spielberg's decision to run the film through the computer and strip it of colour to create that 'moody' atmosphere. We don't live in a blue and yellow world and I doubt we will be in 2054 either!  It took a film that could have easily sat on the pedastal next to Blade Runner and made it into a weaker second cousin. Honestly, the sooner film makers stop running film through computers and fiddling with colour, the better! Ridley Scott made Blade Runner in full technicolor without stripping it of any colour, and it is the darkest, moodiest, most atmospheric film every produced - and that was made 20 years ago! <br/><br/>I'd recommend Minority Report to anyone, but if its anything like Blade Runner, I'll end up in the cinema by myself seeing it again until its re-released in 10 years time (and it would be nice if Spielberg added back the colour for that version...) when it will have found a cult fan base and respect in the industry for the decent movie that it is!"
"DD-931","8","0","0","23 June 2002"," Spielberg Pays His Respects to Philip K. Dick
","I should start this by saying Philip K. Dick is my favorite writer, bar none.  From ""Eye in the Sky"" through ""The Man in the High Castle"" to ""Valis"", his visionary prose is unmatched.  I will continue by saying that Steven Spielberg is not someone I would normally associate with Dick. <br/><br/>
Until I saw ""A.I."".<br/><br/>It fascinates me to see Spielberg move in a Dickian direction as an artist. To put this film up against ""Jaws"" or ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" is tantamount to whiplash.  Only the ending of ""Minority Report"", which I will not go into here, reminds us of the boyish ideals which normally drive Spielberg's work.<br/><br/>So is the film a classic?  Questionable.  The MTV bug bit Steven a little too hard here, and as a result the film is overloaded and muddy in several places.  However, as a tribute to the works of Philip K. Dick, the movie does quite a respectable job.  The two central premises of Dick's body of work, ""What is reality?"" and ""What is human?"" are both touched on as well as can be expected in mainstream cinematic terms (certainly more so than in ""Total Recall""), and the downbeat vision of the future in the midst of a somewhat overoptimistic projection of technological advancements is actually very close to the type of stories Dick wrote (He had transcontinental aircars in the 1990's in some of his works).  And the agonized dilemma John Anderton (Tom Cruise) experiences is very Dickian.  By the way, this may be one of Cruise's best performances in his career.<br/><br/>So yes.  ""Minority Report"" is well worth experiencing.  And although some elitist critics will look down their noses at it, it is a film as worthy of respect as any made in the last hundred years."

Minority Report was a fully entertaining action that I can't stop thinking about!  My friends and I got to the theater a little late so we skipped on buying food.  One friend said she'll go buy popcorn when a scene gets a little dull (we did this a few times in AI).  Well, just to show you how entertaining this movie was she never bought that popcorn! <br/><br/>
Even though it's extremely entertaining it also has a great plot and visuals that are sure to win an Academy Award.  This movie should be recognized during Oscar season in all fields.<br/><br/>The acting was great, and this is coming from someone who can't stand Tom Cruise.  The movie really only focuses on him.  He's in about 95% of the scenes.  He was fantastic.  It's hard to name my favorite scene but the end (not the final ending scenes in general, though they were great and had that Speilberg warmth) blew me away!

What a great film, and it's never slow.  I'd like to say it's a combination of ""Blade Runner"" and ""Mission Impossible"" (both great films), but it really does stand alone all on it's own.  I was really impressed with Samantha Morton's character Agatha (the smartest of the pre-cogs) and it was nice to see Max von Sydow appear in another fantastic film...   Not a real spoiler here, but wouldn't you think that Anderton's (Cruise) real eyes would not have been granted access from security within the police building after it was clearly established he was on the run?

"ericventura","3","3","8","5 June 2017"," One of Spielberg's Worst
","The film poses the question: is one guilty of a crime they will (?) commit in the future? Pleasantly surprised to see Steven Spielberg was directing, the movie soon turned into one of Spielberg's worst. Resorting to the typical action chase sequences popularized by The French Connection (1971), it becomes the mindless slobber of the masses, starring Tom Cruise. And Tom Cruise, who rather than pull off another Magnolia (1999) level performance, devolves to the emotionless action hero, a la Arnold Schwarzenegger. The film that starts off as an intriguing moral debate morphs to the action movie formula, including long, improbable, and exciting chase scenes; huge government conspiracies; and a false climax, or twist with no cinematic purpose whatsoever. A movie, whose moral question could've been answered earlier, stretches into a 2 and a half hour fiasco with an answer at the end to a question proposed at the beginning - with no further development throughout the interim. Despite the film's fantastic sets and artistic development, predicting a beautiful Utopian future, the movie becomes one of improbabilities and unrealistic expectations. The title itself, which upon introduction, seems to integrate itself perfectly into the story as a plot, development, and thematic device, instead fading out of conscience into the abyss of fodder action flicks. With a mystery half-explored - half left in the annals of cinematic nothingness (along with the rest of the potential of the film) and the other half being the more exciting and action flick-acceptable â€“ the movie is content with a weak answer to a weak question. The viewer shouldn't be. In a noble pursuit, Spielberg attempts to attack a system, much like Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb (1964); however, he attacks an imaginary system to come to an imaginary answer for the imaginary question. His noble pursuit, instead of flying across the Atlantic like Charles Lindbergh, crosses a gargantuan gorge on a wooden bridge with no bottom, plummeting into the crocodile-infested waters below. The legendary Indiana Jones may have been able to do it, but not John Anderton of Minority Report. Kudos to the set; kudos to the attempt; failure otherwise."

","How can a movie starring Tom Cruise with direction by Steve Spielberg be bad? This movie actually answers that question. I guess whenever a movie has little or no plot going for it, you throw in chuck loads of special effects and set it in the future. Who could argue the validity of the plot? Ask yourself, why would Cruise wave his hands like a mime in front of a floating computer screen to access information from a database if not for a large paycheck? What's he trying to locate? Information on people who are going to commit a crime in the future. Even an idiot can figure out that he will become a victim of this technology. Anyone remember Logan's Run? A similar thing happens to Logan who was a cop that terminated people over the age of 30.<br/><br/>It always seems that when you take two great talents and try to marry them into a movie, you get nothing but special effects and very little plot or acting in the end."

It is obvious that most actors haven't read a single page of Philip K Dick. <br/><br/>The second sad thing is that many people believe Spielberg and those guys invented the visions, imaginations, the precogs, the bizarre ideas (like the one with changing eyes).

With any other actor playing the lead role this film would merely be poor, but Cruise manages to take an otherwise forgettable story and make it memorably rancid. It's difficult to know where to begin in making a serious critique of this one, so I wont bother. Cruise's teeth are far too white, and I suspect his dramatic pauses are really forgotten lines. I only watched this movie because I picked up the wrong one from the video store by mistake. What a terrible mistake it was. I suppose Tom Cruise does have a definite intensity about him though; intensely angry, intensely sad, intensely confused, etc. Unfortunately it's impossible to tell which is which. He seems to have one universal expression for all of these emotions - a slightly pained stare which could convey anything from ""I've just sat on something very sharp"" to ""Help, I'm having a brain embolism"". Maybe I'm being too harsh. After all, he does have a very symmetrical skull and a nice haircut. So I guess it wasn't all bad. I mean it did actually end, so that's something.

","Despite the expectedly fine visual-design-cum-special-effects, I knew this film was in trouble when the two leads admit to each other that they decided to devote their lives to fighting ""pre-crime"" after close family members were murdered. Gee, how many times have we heard THAT one? <br/><br/>And so it goes. At the heart of it, ""Minority Report"" is a very routine crime thriller in the guise of a futuristic vision. Predictable plotting, hackneyed dialog, and embarrassingly poor acting (most of the exaggerated secondary characters almost seem to be in a different movie from the deadpan performances by Cruise, Farrell, and von Sydow) can't be redeemed by the multitude of we've-seen-it-all-before action sequences and chase scenes. And the obligatory Spielberg nods toward the importance of family and the near-holiness of children are only dreary reminders that he seems once again (as in his ""fallow period"" of the late 80s) incapable of keeping Hallmark-card sentimentality out of his work. Maybe he needs to go back to making WWII movies?"
"jon.h.ochiai","8","2","5","10 December 2004"," Choice or Conspiracy?
","Steven Spielbergs's ""Minority Report"" is a visual and technical masterpiece, with great action, with an awesome movie star and actor in Tom Cruise at the top of his game, that somehow fails to deliver in the end. Give ""Minority Report"" it's due, it is a wild ride. However, it is long at 2 1/2 hours. The year is 2054, and Spielberg captures a viable world, specifically Wasington, D.C., where there have been no murders in 6 years due to the efforts of the Pre-Crime Unit headed by Cruise's John Anderton. The screenplay by Scott Frank and Jon Cohen based on the Philip K. Dick short story is fascinating and poses some worthwhile questions. <br/><br/>In 2054, there are ""Precogs""-- tech for pre-cognizants-- who foresee premeditated or passionate murders up to 36 hours before they are to happen. So it is the Pre-Crime units job to prevent the murders from happening, by arresting the ""murderer"". One now asks: If that person does not murder the victim or isn't even aware that he or she intends to, then how can they be guilty, much less punished? We don't get to dwell in the inquiry. However, the question becomes very real for Anderton (Cruise)when he discovers that he is to murder a man he doesn't even know, Leo Crow, within 36 hours. There are 3 Precogs, the most talented of the three is Agatha (a very good Sammantha Morton). Apparently, in the cases where all three do not agree on a foretold murder, a Minority Report is filed. The Report is in Agatha, and Anderton must uncover the truth-- whatever that may be. The chase is on. Meanwhile, a government agent is sent to audit the process to see if the program can go nationwide. This is headed by Danny Witwar, a deceptively competent character, well played by Colin Farrell. <br/><br/>There are some great effects: futuristic car chases, crashing jet packs, and robotic spiders. Though the biggest asset is Tom Cruise. Cruise is so intense, and it is amazing how his Anderton stays so intense. He looks great, and does all the action sequences expertly. With Cruise, one gets a sense of his drive, and also the burnout. He makes Anderton very human and empathetic. It is also refreshing to see Cruise not playing a character who is incomplete with his father, instead he plays an incomplete father. He does it well. Sammantha Morton as Agatha has some excellent scenes-- a solid performance. All this is what makes ""Minority Report"" disappointing in the end. The movie sets itself as a character play of fate, looking at the nature of true choice. However, what occurs instead of choice is conspiracy in a very long drawn conclusion. This does not give anything away. But the story and movie sells out the efforts of Cruise as Anderton, and perhaps the the value of the inquiry itself which made the movie so compelling from the start.<br/><br/>Cruise and Spielberg have pooled their great talents together, and made a movie well worth seeing. Though ultimately there is no choice. And that is disappointing."

Dick's writings and themes, I won't criticize what isn't in the film, only what is.<br/><br/>In Minority Report Speilberg gives a few overt nods to another film about a future society that tries to eliminate crime, Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" (the eye pieces, the drunk in the hallway) But this film has neither the impact or the depth of the Kubrick film.  <br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays the same character he always does....Tom Cruise.  The film suffers from many things; its too long, too much plot, lots of redundant dialogue, a camera that won't stay still when it should, predictable plotting.  My BIGGEST gripe is that the script includes too many scenes of people explaining things: its excruciating.  Janusz Kaminski proves again he is masterful with texture but has no idea how to frame a SINGLE memorable image.  And we, of course, have the obligatory happy Spielberg ending. <br/><br/>

Then a few of my co-workers saw it and when I asked for a review they kept saying ""you'll have to see it yourself"".  That's never a good sign because a good movie - like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" will be passed along willingly by those who see it.<br/><br/>Six of us went to the 'twilight' showing which is the late afternoon and the time when fewest people go to the movies.  The theater was the big and very technically equipped AMC on Van Ness in SF.  We figured since school was out for the summer we'd better go early.  Surprise -  there were just a handful of movie goers in the theater for ""Minority Report"" while the line for ""The Bourne Identity"" and ""MIBII"" went out the door.<br/><br/>Suffice it to say ""Minority Report"" is another one of those dud Steven Spielberg clunkers along the same lines as ""Artificial Intelligence"" (a snoozer fur shure).  Steven needs to make another Indiana Jones because the guy has never been able to live up to the hype that surrounds him.<br/><br/>Tom Cruiz is a lousy actor.  I can't think of one movie they guy has made in the last ten years that was any good.  Mission Impossible I was so convoluted no one could figure it out.  Mission Impossible II was a total disaster.  Now his eX-wife's ""The Others"" made us all sit up and take notice.  (Very much along the lines of ""The Sixth Sense"" but just a bit short of standing in our chairs and cheering.)  Believe it or not, we were in the theater to see Minority Report on the day Cruiz turned 40.  The guy simply cannot act his way out of a paper bag.  Now Colin Farrell,  was excellent, incredibly handsome (tho' he looks rather short in size) and one of the few very bright spots on the screen.  He is sure to  have a good career if he keeps at it.  He played the somewhat 'bad' cop role and the guy we all thought would be (and should have been) the  person behind Anderton's problems (Cruiz played Anderton) - but he wasn't .  THAT was a let-down when revealed.  The movie should have ended there but it went on, and on, and on... some two hours and 30 minutes worth of silly, gory and ridiculous storyline.  The ending is pathetic to say the least.<br/><br/>It is not a good movie. Each week ten of us select a movie and after work, walk the few blocks to see the latest flick.  We came out of ""The Bourne Identity"" and every one of us were talking about it.  Same for ""My Big Fat..."" - even ""The Count Of Monte Cristo"" got good reviews from us but wh en we came out of ""Minority Report"" no one said anything other then ""anybody want to go to dinner?""<br/><br/>That's a sure sign our $4.50 ticket fee (Twilight movie prices) was too much.  I can't imagine anyone paying $9 to see ""Minority Report"" because it really isn't worth 2 cents."

","The year is 2054 and Washington DC is the host of a nervy experiment in crime prevention. Deep in the Pre-Crime agency lie the 'pre-cogs' - three psychics who dangle in liquid suspension, sharing their incriminating visions with the police. Devised by retired law enforcement officer Lamar Burgess (a brilliant Max von Sydow), the system uses the talents of these pre-cogs with exceptional psychic abilities who are kept in a constant state of dream sleep by a combination of mind-numbing drugs, partial immersion in a huge sensory-deprivation tank, and electronic 'halos' attached to their heads. Using the fragmented images seen by them, which are projected onto a screen, the agency is able to predict and prevent every murder that is about to happen in the city, deftly stepping in and arresting the suspect before the crime has even been committed, to let him rot in a suspended-animation prison. With no homicides in six years, it's a flawless system headed by a perfect guardian, Chief John Anderton (a riveting act by Tom Cruise). Motored by the death of his son, his Pavlovian impulse is to slam the lid on any homicide before it happens. A nifty prologue shows the system's ruthless efficiency, but the arrival of a rival detective Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell, all growl and snap) sets into motion an unbreakable chain of events that sees Anderton on the run from the very system he championed. Pre-cog Agatha (Samantha Morton, in an alternately touching and haunting performance) has marked him for murder and there's just 36 hours before his date with his secret victim. It's a set-up all right. But who's pulling the strings?<br/><br/>From the description alone, Minority Report may appear to be wholly outrageous and borderline unbelievable. This being a work based on a story by Philip K Dick, wacko embellishments are a given, and with its singing cereal packets, vertical freeways, virtual shopkeepers and simulated reality parlors that make your wildest wish come true, Minority Report's world - a surreal cityscape of opulent chromes and 1940s grub - makes for an extraordinary spectacle, made all the creepier by a parched and seedy color palette. If the universe is fully immersive, so is the plot thanks to a screenplay which is hardboiled but never scrambled and the dialogue which is sour and smart-mouthed.<br/><br/>But above all, Minority Report works because of its director Steven Spielberg, who deftly juggles an intricate plot. The storyline allows him ample room to accent and detail - and no one is better at building a fictional reality than Mr. Blockbuster. Although this film is nearly three hours long, it is constantly exhilarating, either from the standpoint of its futuristic vision or its tense plot line. Spielberg packs the frame with reminders of humanity trudging along despite the bleakness of its surroundings, delivering a product which is well-rendered, technically and emotionally, as the subtler moments resonate with real sentiment and insight.<br/><br/>Minority Report is not just some fairy tale gussied up with hi-tech cars and cool costumes and called science-fiction. It is a science-fiction story that actually dares to be 'Science'- 'Fiction' – a gripping whodunit and a murky future-noir with style to spare!"
"schroeder-gustavo","9","1","2","11 October 2015"," Smart and Thought provoking
","Minority Report is one of those rare science fiction movies that comes every once in a while to induce some weird, yet really intriguing and thought provoking ideas in our minds. The very idea of a pre-crime police department is simply cool to think about but also spooky.<br/><br/>In the great hands of one of the greatest film directors of all time, Spielberg, Minority report has breathtaking visuals, a compelling story and a pretty good performance by Tom Cruise. It' also a very gruesome, no holds barred kind of movie. One could say it even feels dirty at times, but it does exactly what it sets out to do.<br/><br/>There are a few things that bother me about the movie. Keep in mind this movie was released in 2002, which was more or less a pretty experimental age for CGI effects. The effects in movies like X-Men and Attack of the Clones simply do not hold up anymore and look like PS2 games. Although not entirely the case with Minority Report, some scenes do look pretty dated and the effects just look silly at times. There are also some pretty over the top action sequences in the movie and some over the top dialogue as well. Spielberg actually did this very well in the Indiana Jones movies, but those movies were supposed to be kind of over the top big budget silly movies (although pretty smart at the same time). In this movie sometimes it feels like it doesn't belong.<br/><br/>Despite its flaws, Minority Report is a great sci-fi thriller that has some great ideas."

Steven Spielberg's direction is extraordinary and visceral the color palate and the shots are all darkened and very atonal almost like a dark painting or a vision of the future as it so happens it is unusual to see Steven Spielberg use these color schemes and shot compositions it is lit very eerily and atonal which is unusually odd for Steven Spielberg to shoot a film like this he is experimenting with different shots colors he is trying to change the way we make films and entertain the audiences's he makes the films he makes for and tell a original story with an imaginative vision That's why Steven Spielberg is the greatest film director of our time he makes a genre of film new again he breathes life into the film noir and makes it entertaining for the audience that's the goal that's his job to tell the type of story which Minority Report is trying to tell and not make it sound old fashioned he makes it new again for the new generation of film Makers! The film has a beautiful score by John Williams Sean's theme is one of the best individual theme he has ever composed for a film and the suite which I call Theme From Minority Report combines Sean's theme and new themes in there as well and plays over the end credits as well as that separate performance of Sean's theme which I will not give away what the theme underscores because the film will be ruined! Tom Cruise's performance was fantastic And Max Von Sydow's performance too was phenomenal and when the twist comes relating to his character he really delivers Kudos to Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton 2 great performances!

","Derived from a short story of the legendary sci-fi writer Philip K. Dick (who was always decades ahead of his time) this amazing movie is truly an all-time classic for me. A story that turned into an epic sci-fi thriller in the hands of S.Spielberg, Minority Report is a very good combination of different genres and themes. One of the most amazing aspects of this film is that it has a very unique neo-noir visual style achieved by pastel blue tones, dark shadows and rain (Also some bypassing and color corrections were applied into the films negative in the post production process.) <br/><br/>The climax point of the movie for me is where precog Agatha asks a three word question when she is taken by John Anderton: ""IS IT NOW?"" <br/><br/>Worth watching over and over again."
"blazesnakes9","10","1","2","26 December 2013"," Minority Report gets a A+
","When people go to the movies, they go with a lot of emotion build up inside of them. Those emotions can be happy, sad, angry or even excitement. Steven Spielberg is particularly one of the best movie director out there in Hollywood today. He can make movies the way movies were meant to be made. He makes movies that are filled with wonder, magic, and even thrills. But, in this science-fiction thriller made by Spielberg, those emotions are obvious to the audience. In Minority Report, Tom Cruise plays John Anderton, the chief of Washington D.C. PreCrime police force. As the movie opens, Anderton and his fellow colleagues witness an upcoming murder from a future killer, who's planning to commit a future crime. The way it works is that in 2054 A.D., PreCrime can stop a future criminal from having to commit a future crime. In other words, catch the criminal before he or she commits the crime. For the last six years, Washington D.C. has been murder-free because of PreCrime. Furthermore, the PreCogs that are used in this police unit can see visions of the future. There are three of them, each of which are stationed inside a pool of milk. These PreCogs have precognitive abilities to see their future murders. Everything seems to be okay for Anderton until one day he witnesses himself committing a future crime. Now, how did that happen? Anderton quickly tries to hide the footage and is forced to run from the law as he tries to dodge the police every which way he can. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an very risky Department of Justice agent in the PreCrime unit. Witwer and Anderton inexplicably creates a tension between themselves even at the beginning of Anderton's run from the law. Max Von Sydow plays the official of the PreCrime unit and is also Anderton's superior. He is also drawn into the investigation. Meanwhile, Witwer tries to replace Anderton's position by placing himself as the chief of the PreCrime police force. Most of the movie consists of Anderton trying to outrun the law by avoiding them at any costs. Some of the action sequences in Minority Report are very well-directed by Spielberg. One of my favorite out of all of them is when Anderton gets into a fight with Witwer inside a car factory. The storyline of Minority Report gets complicated, I think, because the movie wants us to solve this entire mystery behind all of the technology that this world has in store. But, there's more to that. The movie also deals with specific themes of mistaken identity and family relationships. We even see how Anderton deal with the pain and suffering throughout the movie with him feeding himself pills and medication. Even more specifically, we see a distinctive relationship between him and his son, who drowned in a swimming pool. The story of Minority Report was based off a short story by cult science-fiction author Phillip K. Dick. To me, Dick's other movie adaptations including Blade Runner and Total Recall were also very successful critically, but also holds a deeper meaning to the hardware. In both movies, you can see the everyday man being forced into a situation where technology affects their surroundings and themselves. The cinematography is absolutely well photographed with a bleached-colored tint. The look of the movie is fascinating to see and eye-popping to look at. Spielberg's vision of the future has never been more better than before. This is the second Steven Spielberg's movie to be set in the future during the early 2000's. His other sci-fi film, A.I.: Artificial Intelligence, was also a very good looking movie. Minority Report is certainly one of the best movies of 2002. The feel and look of the movie makes it seems that Spielberg was actually making a tech-noir film, which he did. The one other criticism that I have about Minority Report is that this movie focuses more on everyday themes that affect our society. That is significant to other science-fiction movies as well. But, the way Minority Report portrays those themes makes us wonder about the world we live in. This movie did come out in the early 2000's and according to my critical praise of this movie, I can only say this world is probably moving a lot more faster, even though technology is making several advantages and advances in our everyday lives. You can love it or you hate it, but you can't underestimate technology in the 21st century. The world is changing and we are too. ★★★★ 4 stars."

","Definitely amongst the most intelligent sci-fi thrillers to surface on the silver screen, Minority Report is an ingeniously envisioned, smartly crafted & cleverly narrated cinema from Steven Spielberg that presents the director in prime form, paints an endlessly fascinating portrait of the future & remains one of the most creative works of Spielberg's filmmaking career.<br/><br/>Set in Washington D.C. in the year 2054 where crime has been entirely eradicated thanks to an advanced system that's able to pre-determine any criminal activity, allowing the cops to arrest the perpetrators before they commit their crimes, Minority Report follows the Special Police Force's chief who one day finds himself accused of a future murder & tries to prevent it from happening.<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg, the film doesn't wallow in explaining how everything works in the future but simply gets on with its main plot within few minutes into the story. Spielberg's execution deserves kudos for he does a terrific job in narrating its complicated plot & keeps everyone firmly glued to their seats from start to finish while the screenplay is a masterwork of imagination in itself.<br/><br/>Art Direction puts up some extensively detailed sets on the screen, the sci-fi elements that are infused into the story carry a thought-provoking, well-researched & plausible dimension, Cinematography encapsulates the film with a neo-noirish ambiance, thanks to its splendid use of desaturated colours, high contrasts n lighting. Editing relentlessly paces the whole narrative & John Williams' score is fitting.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, Minority Report features a pretty reliable cast in Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton & Max von Sydow and everyone is very convincing in their given roles. The action sequences are an absolute delight to look at, Visual Effects is state- of-the-art stuff as in every Spielberg film and even though it enhances the experience by a great deal, it never overshadows the story at hand.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Minority Report is a bravura piece of work from Steven Spielberg that digs way too deeper than most sci-fi flicks dare to, has been influential in the creation of a few technologies in existence today, and on a thematic level is as rich as Blade Runner. Its deeper layers may unearth on multiple viewings but even for those who aren't in mood for excavation, Minority Report simply happens to be an extremely gripping, wildly entertaining & thoroughly satisfying experience. Highly recommended."
"carlhuitong","9","1","2","12 June 2012"," One of the most impeccable science fiction films
","It is said that a picture is worth a thousand words, then moving pictures are worth a million words, which is why it may generate at least a million words.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg conducts another cinematic masterpiece and the movie is one of the most beautifully crafted movies ever made. It is an engrossing story about a system called ""Precrime"" seeing into the future and predict crimes beforehand by three gifted humans (called ""Pre-Cogs"") with special powers.<br/><br/>At the beginning,the film gives a snapshot of the background in the year 2054 A.D where technology is highly advanced and the state-of-the-art compared to that nowadays. For instance,hand-touch screens,automatic traffic moving system and sci-fi weapons will have commonly used in the foreseeable future.<br/><br/>The content is unquestionably amazing.The background sets in the year 2054 A.D and the ""Precrime"" with highly advanced technology prevent crimes,usually murder cases, from happening. But,will the system realize when i become a hoary-headed old man? I reckon everything will happen.<br/><br/>The story is undoubtedly impeccable,but a little bit complicated.It raises some questions about morality, justice, exploitation and society issues. For example, can the authority declare guilty of someone who 'may' murder via the ""Precrime"" that affect their whole life? is the ""Precrime"" flawless if some officers use the system to help their friends or relatives with their authority,just like Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise)?? How the government monitor the system which might be mis-used and cheated??<br/><br/>The casts craft a visually stunning movie that give a amazing plot portraying the US authority tries to stop murder cases from happening. Steven Spielberg still makes film noir via sci-fi means. Tom Cruise shows his talent through vivid performances and he delivers a first class performance as usual to the audience. Also,other professional actors and actresses,like Max von Sydow and Neal McDonough show their unique idiosyncrasy.<br/><br/>In a nutshell,the movie is perfect and worth watching."
"Kessler1996","10","1","2","22 November 2011"," The Finest Film Spielberg Has Ever Made
","There is only one film for me, just one exclusively, that flawlessly captures every last ounce of director Steven Spielberg's finesse and meticulous expertise. That film is 'Minority Report' (2002).<br/><br/>Imagine the year is 2054, in Washington, D.C. A time when the planet is smothered in Artificial Intelligence, dominated by invasive targeted advertising and intrusive security extents, a world existing in the midst of a technological domination. The District Of Columbia is 100% murder-free thanks entirely to the astoundingly reliable specialised police department ""Pre-Crime"", which identifies killers before they commit their murders. It is captained by Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a Father crushed by the disappearance of his son Sean, living a hollow existence lined only with the self- destruction of guilt. To compensate, he joined Pre-Crime. The system relies on the precognitions of the""Pre-Cogs"", Arthur and Dash – the twins – and Agatha (Samantha Morton), the natural leader, the most gifted. Three mutated humans with psychic abilities. And yes, I tell you now, those names are indeed references to the three great mystery writers: Agatha Christie, Arthur Conan Doyle, and Dashiell Hammett. But when Anderton is framed for a future murder, he has just 36 hours to prove his innocence. <br/><br/>The Pre-Cogs are surviving examples of children born from parents addicted to the fictional drug Neuroin (a heroin-like drug) under scientific experimentation. Most of these children wouldn't live past the age of 12, yet these three were seen as ""gifted"", graced with a certain talent. They would wake up at night screaming, shaking in the corner as they saw murder over and over, an image that continually haunted them. It wasn't long before someone realised that these dreams were murders that were actually happening and so they were exploited for use in Pre-Crime. Hyper-sensitive brain scanners read activity in the brain tissue of the Pre-Cogs and an intricate electronic system displays the images they see onto monitors. <br/><br/>That is what Pre-Crime is dependent upon; three genetic mutants heavily drugged, generally unaware of their surroundings and conditions, predicting the future. From there, it's up to the officers to analyse the images they're given on the screens to find where this murder is taking place. And, seeing as it'll be going nation-wide soon, cocky Department Of Justice representative Agent Danny Witwer (played with excellent charisma by Colin Farrell) comes along to supervise and ultimately dictate everything. The system is perfect, it's never wrong. However, the Pre-Cogs have been known to disagree occasionally a record of their disagreement is known as 'minority report', of which the film gets its title from.<br/><br/>So this is the future? The Earth has finally surrendered to these bombarding technological advances that occur so swiftly that us petty humans have to keep running just to stay in the exact same place. ""The Red Queen Hypothesis"" is most certainly a relevant factor in this world. The streets are littered with ruthlessly efficient Eye-Dentiscanners that identify the passing civilian and plagues them with targeted advertising from one of its countless gloriously attractive holographic advertisements, calling their name directly to seize attention. ""John Anderton! You could use a Guiness right about now!"" shouts one of the invisible voice with its corny fiddle soundtrack from the remarkable glass walls that dazzle and distract passers-by. This film is crammed with product-placement: visual telecommunication screens by Nokia, exotic holidays with holographic Hawaiian girls for American Express, GAP clothing, Bvlgari perfume, and even Lexus designed an entire car for this film! The greatest element of 'Minority Report' is its believability. All this incredible technology, from transport pods that drive themselves on vast freeway networks with vertical inclines to singing cereal packets, has been presented in a fashion so rich and affluent in detail that it seems so real. <br/><br/>To ensure the utmost plausibility of a world where even the walls of alley-ways are technological, alive with grotesque public announcements, Spielberg consulted numerous scientists. The effect of all this is a result so immaculately polished that even now, nine years after release, it is still realistic. <br/><br/>There is so much to admire, adore, appreciate, and question in this deliciously complex film. I reserve it specially as the only film I have ever seen in which Tom Cruise presents a clear ability to act. Most films starring Tom Cruise feature Tom Cruise in the cast playing Tom Cruise! Yet in this, with the professional guidance of Spielberg, Cruise plays his character with brilliant realism. He is almost constantly engaging. Other factors to be remembered of this film are its screenplay. The story behind this film is so beautifully active, but the explanation that is presented to the viewers is abstract. This is a rare example of a mystery film, entirely due to the deliverance of its magnificent plot-line; there is never an example when, like many other initially promising but subsequently destroyed films, the plot is given to us on a silver tray. It is flattering to the viewer's intelligence to be able understand this film. Its complexity and intrigue, which is unravelled gradually, makes the wonderful experience of explanation feel so much more rewarding. <br/><br/>Another feature is the musical score, by John Williams. The addition of Williams' soundtrack lifts the film, providing one of the finest examples I can imagine of giving suspense to otherwise already extremely exciting scenes. For instance, when Anderton is escaping Danny Witwer and his men through an automobile manufacturing factory, the thumping trumpet blasts and violin shrieks are reminiscent to his Oscar-winning score of 'Star Wars Episode VI: A New Hope' (1977). <br/><br/>'Minority Report' is my absolute favourite Steven Spielberg film."

Believing the incident to be a setup, Anderton attempts to hide the case and quickly leaves the area.He seeks the advice of Dr. Iris Hineman,played by Lois Smith,the lead researcher of the PreCrime technology. She explains to him that the three precogs may see different visions of the future, and that the system only provides data on the two reports which agree. The minority report,which reflects the potential future where a predicted killer would have done something different, is discarded. According to her, the female precog Agatha,Samantha Morton in an excellent role, is likely the one who witnessed the minority report.<br/><br/>The story is a combination action,mystery,suspense and thriller.It was excellent from beginning to end.Aside from that,the digital production design was simply outstanding. I consider one of the best films done by both Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg.Special mention should also be given to both Colin Farrell and Samantha Morton. It is a must-see for people that loves intelligent mystery thrillers."

","A great deal must have been spent on this film. I was hesitant at first. For one thing, the whole issue of prior restraint, that 1984 sort of thought police thing. It's also dependent on a unique group of young people who are being exploited for their visions. When they realize that a murder is going to be committed, they produce a little ball with the name of the perpetrator on it. This is a bit odd. It seems they could have come up with a little different way of presenting this. If one thinks too much, this all falls apart, but if we are going to enjoy, we need to dive in and accept this. It moves along at a nice pace and provides reasonable satisfaction at the conclusion."

","This movie was okay, nothing really special. A Tom Cruise science fiction action/mystery/suspense that works on some levels, but not on levels concerning the story as I found it weak and full of holes. It is the future in this movie and there are some nice visuals and some stuff I can actually see happening. What I do not see happening is the whole seeing a murder before it happens and people who have not actually committed a crime being sent to some strange tanks for the rest of their lives. The opening kind of demonstration shows a murder that any lawyer could get a person a much lesser sentence for as it was a crime of passion and would likely draw a manslaughter charge at most. Well the lead guy on this squad of super cops who rely on psychics to find out who is going to commit murder before they occur is now on the run because the psychics have said is going to commit a murder. Well a nice initial chase scene occurs and there is a lot of cat and mouse that works nicely. Then there are scenes that make one think ""what the heck is going on?"" as the guy on the run gets his eyes replaced and plays pick the food. Yes, he has two choices of good sandwich bad sandwich and good milk bad milk. Strange plants that ensnare guests and a bunch of other just strange stuff more fitting for say an anime rather than a future that they are trying to present itself as realistic. It is nice to find out they culprit behind a bizarre murder case, but there are just too many strange moments for me to say this movie is all that good. It was watchable and somewhat enjoyable, but there just are not enough really cool scenes like that initial chase scene to make this a really good movie."

It is not just a few gimmicks. It creates a complete world, complete with shopping malls, advertising, office buildings, gardens, airports, cars, elevators...<br/><br/>The scene when Cruise gets new eyes is pure little-boy Spielberg, grossing out his younger sister with an unlimited budget.

"Lucabrasisleeps","10","1","2","9 January 2009"," Tense, fast moving thriller
","I haven't seen much of Spielberg's movies. I have had many good things about his movies yet I haven't been in the mood to see them. At least until now. This movie is basically one of the best sci fi movies that have ever been released. That's weird considering I am not a sci fi fan at all. Of all the brainless action movies and pseudo sci fi movies that have come out recently, this is one movie that can actually stop and make you think. It has the usual sentimental moments of Spielberg that the ""critics"" hate. Instead here it is not an overdose with cute kids and harmless aliens. It is actually a tense atmospheric thriller which accurately portrays the emotions of a man who believes he is innocent and is on the run from the system he once championed. This movie is quite relevant especially in developing countries where the police have more power and people are even jailed without properly establishing their guilt. In this way it is not exactly a science fiction movie and it is more of a movie that can actually appeal to a lot of people who value justice and human rights.<br/><br/>The storyline sounds quite ridiculous. But the execution - perfect. The story is about a policeman named John Anderton who is in charge of a system called Precrime. Precrime is a system where suspects are prevented from committing a crime. John Anderton fervently believes in the system and even justifies it to FBI agent Colin Farrell. He arrests these suspects based on the previsions(premonitions) from Pre Cogs which are three bodies lying in a pool of milk. The trouble here is that John Anderton himself is accused of the crime of murder by the system. He runs as a fugitive from the law and a nationwide hunt is in progress to catch him. The plot is quite confusing because of the advanced technology being described and in that sense it could be described as the most complex movie Spielberg has ever directed. The beauty is that everything comes together so perfectly in the end. The length of the film is not a hindrance at all.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is somewhat of an underrated actor. Although I don't think he deserves an Oscar, he has had some pretty intense performances. This one, particularly, carries the film and IMO might be one of Cruise's best performances. His confused emotions when his system betrays him are quite good and so is his acting with regard to the scenes with the memories of his son. Colin Farrell is OK but he doesn't have much to do, he should have been given a bigger role. Samantha Morton is also pretty good in her role. The special effects are quite advanced. Even though I don't really care about special effects, the special effects in this are quite impressive. What I loved most about the movie was the cinematography. The dark tinge reminded me mostly of directors like Fincher. The camera-work gives a dark and grainy feel to the whole movie and portrays the mindset of the main character. The complexity of the plot is not a hindrance as it doesn't have many loose ends. For this, praise must be given to the screenplay writers, Scott Frank and Jon Cohen who have written a fluid screenplay which moves smoothly. The background score should also have special mention. I feel this movie also has a feel of a horror film, in the sense that, it has some really tense sequences. The scene with John Anderton in the ice cold bathtub when the spiders check him out is of special mention.<br/><br/>I can't really think of many negatives to this movie. Maybe the number of action scenes could have been reduced. But I still couldn't think of it as a flaw because I really enjoyed them.<br/><br/>10/10"
"wes-connors","8","1","2","23 December 2008"," Tomorrow Never Knows
","In the year 2054, Washington D.C. is murder free zone. This is because a futuristic ""Precrime"" program has obtained three precognitive humans (called ""pre-cogs"") who have a talent for predicting murder. The three individuals perpetually dream about future crimes, in a secured area nicknamed ""The Temple""; there, they float in a tank of water. The US government falsely claims the three live a luxurious lifestyle - working out in a weight room, for example - but, the pre-cogs are, essentially, imprisoned for the good of society. According to Precrime, the pre-cogs ""see the future"" and are ""never wrong"". The Washington program has prevented all murders for the past six years, and is about to be implemented nationally. <br/><br/>As the film opens, top Precrime gun Tom Cruise (as John Anderton) goes through some visual evidence downloaded from the pre-cogs' minds, and arrests an individual for the ""future murder"" of his wife and lover. Mr. Cruise has a back-story. Years earlier, Cruise's young son was abducted, indirectly destroying his marriage. Cruise also takes illegal drugs, which does not effect his work or appearance adversely.<br/><br/>Distinguished Director of Precrime Max von Sydow (as Lamar Burgess) is wary of arriving agent Colin Farrell (as Danny Witwer). He should be, Mr. Farrell is there to investigate the Precrime program. Farrell fears the system may be flawed. Due to a startling encounter with pre-cog Samantha Morton (as Agatha), Cruise also becomes suspicious. Then, the pre-cogs identify an unexpected murderer, right in the heart of Precrime! <br/><br/>Orwellian ""thought police"" (aka thinkpol) are never a good utopian sign. There are plenty of plot holes and/or contrivances in ""Minority Report"". For example, how is it that these geniuses can't anticipate or detect an eye transplant?

"ackstasis","10","1","2","28 November 2008"," ""There hasn't been a murder in 6 years. There's nothing wrong with the system, it is perfect""
","Philip K. Dick was always fascinated by advanced human technology, and the effect that it would have upon both society and individuals. He also frequently proposed that there can be no single, objective plane of reality; our perception of time and existence is inescapably influenced by the meagre subjective workings of our brains. Dick's musings on reality and awareness, largely influenced by his experimentation with mind-altering narcotics, were ahead of their time in science-fiction literature, and it's no surprise that adaptations of his works comprise some of the genre's finest cinematic entries  including Scott's 'Blade Runner (1982),' Verhoeven's 'Total Recall (1990)' and Spielberg's 'Minority Report (2002).' Originally published in 1956, ""The Minority Report"" is not one of Dick's richest short stories, really serving only to introduce the basic concept of precognition, and to briefly explore the relevant themes inherent in its mechanics; namely, free will vs. determinism. Out of this fascinating framework, however, Steven Spielberg has crafted one of the most breathtakingly comprehensive futuristic visions ever committed to the screen.<br/><br/>I've always loved time-travel movies, mostly because they explore the intriguing notions of causality, determinism and fatalism. Though 'Minority Report' doesn't strictly qualify (since it's only information making the journey), it nonetheless grapples with similar metaphysical ideas, paradoxes and moral dilemmas. Can the Precogs truly be foreseeing the future if their visions result in the prevention of those future events? Is it ethical to punish citizens who have committed no crime, but may conceivably have done so in an alternate timeline? John Anderton (Tom Cruise) believes unwaveringly in the merits of Pre-Crime, having lost his son in an unsolved kidnapping six years earlier, and being determined never to allow another such an atrocity to take place. However, his implicit trust in this ""perfect"" system is suddenly shattered when he, Anderton, is accused of the future murder of a man he's never met. Convinced that he is being framed by an ambitious federal representative (Colin Farrell), Anderton goes on the lam, and, to prove his innocence, must elude and defeat the system he helped create.<br/><br/>This ""man on the run"" framework supplies the blueprints for a series of heart-stopping action and suspense sequences, with Spielberg exploiting possible future technology (such as self-driving cars, police jet-packs, and ""spyder"" surveillance gadgets) for maximum thrills. The completeness of his future vision is simply breathtaking, with CGI used extensively but never intrusively. The cinematography of Janusz Kaminski resembles that of his previous Spielberg collaboration, 'AI: Artificial Intelligence (2001),' adding to the great tradition of visually-rich science fiction cinema. Washington D.C. in 2054 possesses elements of both a utopian and dystopian future. In the city's more respectable districts, where businessmen and politicians debate the future of Pre-Crime, the rooms are awash with light, deliberately over-lit and with extreme colour desaturation, the negative having been bleach-bypassed in post-production. In the city's destitute slums, known as the Sprawl, we witness the decadence of contemporary society, bathed in a shadowy noirish darkness, where blind drug dealers lounge in the shadows and spout wisdom like ""in the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.""<br/><br/>The concept of eyes  our primary means of perceiving the world  is very important to the film. They are continually used to identify us, but this technology can be bypassed through relatively inexpensive underground surgical procedures (performed in a manner that calls to mind the Ludovico technique in Kubrick's 'A Clockwork Orange (1971),' another film that explores the notion of free-will). Just as the eye can fool others, the visuals provided to our own brains have the tendency to mislead. The Precog Agatha (Samantha Morton) frequently uses the phrase ""Can you see?"", in a manner that implies not just optical recognition but an otherwise-elusive greater understanding of human nature. The brightly-lit surroundings of upper-class Washington DC are merely a facade, designed to bolster the mind into a false sense of optimism and security, lest we remove our blindfolds to genuinely appreciate society's darkened heart. The Pre-Crime system may be perfect, contends Danny Witwer, but, if there's a flaw, it's human. In such a way, deliberate misdirection allows elderly director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) to hoodwink the senses and get away with murder.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg has often been criticised for an overwhelming need to end his films on an upbeat note. It's true that he likes to have his patrons leave the cinema smiling, and, over the years, I suppose that he's developed a rapport with his audience that he's hesitant about breaking; in a way, he's the antithesis of Terry Gilliam, who likes to end his sci-fis by kicking the audience in the guts. However, delve a little deeper into each films' themes, and often the outcome isn't as optimistic as we'd initially thought. The much-disparaged epilogue to 'AI: Artificial Intelligence,' carried over from Stanley Kubrick, is much sadder and despairing than we initially believe. Likewise, in 'Minority Report,' I've only recently become intrigued by prison warden Gideon's parting words as Anderton is lowered into indefinite incarceration: ""they say you have visions, that your life flashes before your eyes, that all your dreams come true."" Could the perfectly-just sequence of events that follows merely be the desperate longings of an imprisoned man? Philip K. Dick would probably have said so."
"murray_johnc","Null","1","2","7 September 2008"," Nice Effects but the basic plot premise is pure B.S. Cruise Should Know Better
","Reality Check! I think that responsible and intelligent film reviewers should make a clear distinction between the genres of ""science fiction"" and ""science fantasy"". The first genre occasionally produces an intelligent script based on what could theoretically be possible if human knowledge and technology continue to expand at the present rate. The second genre is a time-wasting mess of ""fairy tales"" (the sort of moronic drivel LRH specialized in) that could only appeal to or entertain flakes. If only our country's pathetic education system could somehow instill in the majority of students the two most basic laws of physics (the first and second laws of thermodynamics)we'd all get along a lot better. The brilliant physicist, Stephen Hawking, vainly tried to explain, in detail*, that the second law of thermodynamics makes it absolutely impossible to foretell the future - not even with the haziest accuracy. Even Scientologists acknowledge that cognitive thought has mass and energy; - ergo, human cognition must be subject to the laws of entropy. You can no more recall the future than you could travel to work today on gasoline or diesel fuel that have not yet been refined and would have to be derived from fossil fuels that have not yet even been been extracted from the ground! Three years before production began, Steven Spielberg assembled a team of sixteen future experts in Santa Monica to brainstorm out the year 2054 for him. These 16 ""futurologists"" came up with a city in 2014 where newspapers are still printed and delivered by hand, and there's a reference to the now defunct Radio Shack chain! Cuckoo!

After the opening scene it just kept flowing in the right direction and you started to forget you in a theater.

","The Philosophical Problem: arrest and detention of ""criminals"" before they committed any crime - the future is certain, as the crime is divined by three ""gifted"" humans who lie submerged in a tank of neurotransmitters at the Precrime center. They feed visions of future murders to the police, who prevent the commission of the crime.<br/><br/>In a word: We have the arrest and imprisonment of ""criminals"" absent the actus reas, although the guilty mind is certainly at work.<br/><br/>Result: The crime rate plummets - pre-meditated murder is obviated. Only the odd ""crime"" of passion remain.<br/><br/>Philosophical Assumption: we live in a deterministic world; time is a running reel, each effect determined by its antecedent cause.<br/><br/>Caveat: when we are made aware that we will commit a crime of passion -the film gives the agents a choice to execute or avoid.<br/><br/>Problem: its incoherent to have a vision of a future if that future is in any way alterable. Assuming determinism, there is one future, a still shot of the running reel.<br/><br/>Problem: if the crime is prevented, the future ""crime"" reported by the precogs is impossible - the future is the prevention of the ""crime"" - and then it really becomes confusing.<br/><br/>Solution: the precogs report likely futures, taking into account the antecedent circumstances, they report a highly probable occurrence, that for any number of reasons focus on violence and crime. They could just as well ""see"" the apple falling from the tree and landing in the bush.<br/><br/>Problem: the intervention of the probable act renders that event highly unlikely - now we're in the land of contradiction, and absurdity. If the precogs predict highly likely occurrences, and the crime is going to be prevented, so it has a zero chance of occurrence.<br/><br/>I would have to conclude from the above nonsense that knowledge of the future is impossible. And this irks me.<br/><br/>Problem: is it moral to incarcerate people who have committed no real act of violence - only the formation of intent to commit the crime. There is a case for incarcerating those who haven't committed the crime. An analogy would be the husband who wishes to kill his wife, but hires an assassin to do the dirty work. The husband has clearly acted immorally, yet his shirt is clean of blood.<br/><br/>The assassin is prevented to kill the wife, however. There is no murder, no actus reas. Everyone lives. One would have to have a very high standard of morality to condemn mere thoughts in the absence of harm.<br/><br/>There's a lot of dirty work to be done to sort this out, and I am already in over my depth. Incidentally, Minority Report is a pretty entertaining flick."

It's a film that for most of its two-and-a-half hours seems more interested in the sci-fi thriller elements of the story than in the difficult questions it poses. While the movie transcends its genre because it deals with such an interesting topic, it shortchanges that topic by skirting around these tough questions.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays a cop in the mid-21st century who's part of a unit called ""pre-crime."" A trio of psychics can tell when someone somewhere is going to commit murder. One example: A man inadvertently walks in on his wife with another man. In the heat of the moment, he picks up a pair of scissors and is about to stab her, when the cops burst in and prevent him from doing what the psychics had predicted he would do. They slip a weird machine over the man's eyes and keep him locked up, immobile, and comatose.<br/><br/>Right there you have a problem. Even in our justice system, a man who raises a weapon to someone has committed a crime, even if he's caught before he has had a chance to carry out the act. That has nothing to do with ""pre-crime."" Of course, the punishment this man receives seems quite harsh for attempted murder or assault. But it would seem quite harsh even if the man had carried out the act. The notion that preventing this man from killing his wife would require that he be detained indefinitely, particularly in such a grotesque fashion, is absurd. But there are examples of preventive detention that are not so easy to dismiss. By failing to address such examples, the movie weakens its own argument.<br/><br/>As in other anti-utopian tales, the very person who carries out the corrupt form of justice becomes its next victim. The psychics envision that Cruise will soon commit a murder. Since Cruise believes in his job, shouldn't he accept their reading and allow himself to be arrested? But he finds himself in the same position as the people he has detained. They all swear to their innocence. Up to now he has trusted the psychics, knowing that the detainees would have committed the crimes if not for his intervention. But he knows he is no killer. The psychics must be wrong this time! Caring for his own self-preservation, he goes on the run.<br/><br/>The rest of the film is an intense hunt-and-chase thriller as Cruise evades the police while trying to solve the whodunit. His adventures will take him in icky directions as he encounters spider-like robots and men without eyes. He also must meet with a strange old lady in a sequence that seems ripped off from ""The Matrix,"" which is ironic, since ""The Matrix"" was itself inspired by Philip Dick's fiction. ""Minority Report"" is longer and more complicated than necessary, but it is handled with the intricate craftsmanship that we have come to expect from Spielberg.<br/><br/>The problem is that the movie is so focused on the complex plot that most of the time it forgets about its provocative themes. Certain plot points are muddier than they should be. Until I read the original story, I did not understand what the minority report was. (It was actually quite simple: one of the three psychics may have a different reading than the other two. But the movie explains this concept poorly.) And the final explanation for why the cop was thought to be a potential killer, which involves something of a time-travel paradox, was much simpler and to-the-point in the original story, leaving readers with something to grapple with. The movie tries so hard to argue against preventive detention that its case feels forced.<br/><br/>Dick was never much interested in the design of his futuristic stories, and that's certainly true of the story on which this movie is based. In that story, the detainees were kept in ordinary fenced areas. There was nothing about them being suspended in a bizarre, computer-induced coma. In an effort to create a visual representation of the story, the film envisions a lot of new technology, including the ability to transfer the psychics' thought to a screen, a level of technological advancement that I doubt will exist by 2054. The movie does capture some of the paranoia that was typical in Philip Dick's fiction. To escape the police, Cruise has to take some gruesome measures because of the government's sophisticated means of identifying everyone, a possibility that doesn't seem far off in our own world.<br/><br/>But all this technology distracts from the movie's political and philosophical message. Spielberg is a master of design, and his vision of the not-too-distant future is impressive but not exceptional. Most big-budget science fiction movies today do a good job at the level of world creation. I just can't help feeling a little frustrated every time a Philip Dick story gets turned into an action movie. Ironically, a film like ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,"" which is not based on any of Dick's stories, does a better job of bringing out his ideas than any of the actual adaptations of his works have done. Because it focuses on the consequences of technology rather than the conception, it comes closer to the spirit of this great philosopher of science fiction."

","WARNING - SPOILERS! Some things you can't deny about this movie. Steven Spielberg is the best at telling a story visually. Tom Cruise gives 100%. And everyone else behind the camera does their best work.<br/><br/>But one thing bothered me about the plot. The main character's mentor, or the person he takes orders from, or the person he most reveres, turns out to be the bad guy. Well, la-de-freakin-da! And the bad guy's goal is to completely destroy the life and reputation of his star pupil/protégé for the good of a flawed system, and hide this plan from his protégé for as long as possible.<br/><br/>I've seen this come about as an actual trend in the last 10-15 years. There are too many films using this horrible writing crutch to name here, but I will name one that stands out as a prime example. ""Judge Dread."" And you know what? Max Von Sydow played the exact same bad guy in that movie, too.<br/><br/>I was disappointed."

","Steven Spielberg has made his first religious movie. Sure, he's dabbled in religious symbolism before with his messianic ""E.T."" and it's not your typical sand-and-sandals Biblical epic, but ""Minority Report"" definitely qualifies as a religious movie. The stated subject of the film is the validity of predicting criminal acts before they occur. This is referred to as ""pre-crime"" and has been compared to racial profiling, but it used to go by another name: prophecy. A trio of prophets (ESPers, really) exist in a sterile environment in the service of a bureau charged with heading off such crimes. Tom Cruise, as an agency operative, plays with computer screens like God playing with the cosmos (or, perhaps more fitting, like Mickey Mouse as the Sorcerer's Apprentice in ""Fantasia""). The stress of his job and the hell of his personal life are assuaged by recreational drug use. The plot gains traction when he himself is accused of a future murder; he must both prevent and solve the uncommitted crime. Add in a former seminarian, a ghoulish jailer with the not-at-all subtle name ""Gideon"" who dresses like a rodeo-circuit preacher and addresses his cryogenic-frozen charges as his ""flock,"" and the brooding presence of Max Von Sydow (who had played Jesus in ""The Greatest Story Ever Told""), and you don't even have to wait for the scene where one of the ESPers turns angelus and provides Cruise with some much-needed solace. While the key crime in this story is solved thanks to that old plot stand-by The Detail That Only The Killer Would Know, and while the special effects are as stunning as the legendary Spielberg pacing, this film also works as a meditation on the pervasiveness of toxic faith in the service of the State at the beginning of the 21st century."
"Mr_PCM","8","1","2","8 December 2005"," The future is not necessarily bright
","Spielberg has returned to his favourite type of film  the summer blockbuster. Minority Report is a good old-fashioned crime/conspiracy thriller, but with a difference  the crimes are predicted and prevented before they even occur thanks to the ability to see the future. When the Chief of the Pre-Crime Department John Anderton (Tom Cruise) sees a prediction of himself committing murder, he finds himself on the run trying to prove his innocence and figure out who he kills and why, before he actually does it, and who has set him up.<br/><br/>The film is a fascinating vision of the future, and therefore comes with hundreds of futuristic-looking gadgets that sure would be fun to have around now. But this is not a bright vision of the future; colours are kept to a minimum, and the film has a grimy, grainy look to it  which shows the future to not be the perfection we would hope it will be. It makes a refreshing change from the normal science-fiction which shows the future to be all smooth and shiny, with lots of green to make it look pretty. Instead it looks drab, impersonal and unfriendly.<br/><br/>This is Cruise's first major foray into science-fiction, but Spielberg is an old hand at this kind of thing now, thanks to ET, Close Encounters and Jurassic Park, and his experience and expertise are clear. The story is adapted from a story written by legendary sci-fi writer Philip K Dick  and surely there is no one better than Spielberg for adapting a sci-fi tale and turning it into a crowd-pleasing blockbuster.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell appears, in the middle of an extremely busy film-making period for him, and again shows his versatility in playing a rather slimy young hotshot who investigates Cruise's department. Max von Sydow also stars, in possibly his biggest and best role since 1973's classic horror The Exorcist.<br/><br/>The story is genuinely exciting and gripping, as a good conspiracy thriller should be, and keeps you guessing right through. Some viewers (myself included) may however find some scenes disturbing  most notably a couple of scenes involving eyeballs. Eyeballs aside however, Spielberg has delivered the perfect Saturday evening film, and begins a profitable partnership with Cruise that continues into the slightly less gripping War of the Worlds. It is however probably best if you just sit back and enjoy, and try not to think about the film's potential plot-holes too much, as you will spot them. Just relish trying to figure out the answer before the film gets there. A perfect evening viewing really."

","Watchable sci-fi action film, but nothing like as deep as it would at first appear. The story is overly contrived, the flaws in the central premise never fully dealt with, and the ending far too simplistic to make this an overall satisfying experience. The ostensibly complex conundrum at the heart of this film- whether preventing a predicted event actually negates the concept of fate upon which precognition rests- is conveniently swept aside in favour of mindless action, and the futuristic setting merely an excuse for Spielberg to play with some expensive CGI toys. The plot holes become more gaping with each viewing. See it once and enjoy the visuals, but don't think about it too hard."
"unauthorized","8","1","2","20 November 2005"," Great movie.
","Great movie. Even if I have the feeling it could've been even better..<br/><br/>It's a great movie. To begin with, I think it's impossible for someone not to acknowledge how awesome the story behind it is, written by such a gifted mind as Philip K. Dick. Maybe that's the reason the motion picture cannot get a 10/10 rating. How could anybody possibly direct a movie who lives up to this story's potential? (One could argue that Riddley Scott did this once, creating perhaps the best sci-fi movie ever, out of Dick's ""Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?"", but that's another story).<br/><br/>One has to admit that Spielberg does his best in order to direct such a story. He's careful so as to keep a good pace, not exaggerating, not extracting you from the story with useless futuristic fx, the acting is good, with some of the secondary roles being even better than the movie's star -Tom Cruise- and the story goes on very well, giving you the opportunity to contemplate at its every step: ""Is this justice?"", ""Could this be a set up?"", or even posing oneself harder, actual philosophical questions, when watching Agatha asking: ""Is it now?"", while watching closely the movie as the plot moves on.<br/><br/>The ending was unexpected enough and it all began to make sense in an excellent way, proving once again how great the story was. The very last moments (let's not disclose anything more here) though, were more optimistic than what I would have possibly liked, leading to an unnecessary sort of happy-ending.<br/><br/>Overall: great. But it could have been the movie of the decade."

","As a matter of fact, I do not like Tom Cruise as an actor. I have nothing against him personally; however, I don't think he is a good actor.<br/><br/>In spite of all above, ""Minority Report"" is a movie which is worth looking at. The movie, basically, deals with an important problem of ethics and philosophy, which, in itself is appreciable. The movie deals with looking into future but entirely differently from time-travel movies. It is looking into an individual's future, finding out if he/she is going to commit a crime, and capturing a criminal before he/she actually becomes one. Tom Cruise is a police officer in ""Pre-crime"" and turns out to be a future criminal.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise was not bad in the character.

Tom Cruise plays a very interesting and superb character who is very good at his job, his character is The Hero of this film and it also has a few religious contents such as the halo that the put around the victims head and also the 'temple' where the precogs are.

","""Minority Report"" is one visually splendid looking movie. It's a science-fiction movie made with lots of style and eye for detail for an imaginary futuristic society. Everything is nicely constructed which makes the movie somewhat believable to watch. Also non-fans of the science-fiction genre will probably enjoy seeing this movie.<br/><br/>The movie perfectly mix entertaining lighthearted action and thought provoking issues.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg really is one great actor director. Tom Cruise is truly superb as the main character John Anderton. This movie also marked the breakthrough for now well known actor Colin Farrell who really is excellent in his role! It might very well be his very best role yet and when I saw this movie in the cinema back in 2002 I was really impressed by this 'new' unknown actor and expected great things from him in the future. It's a bit of a shame that he has never surpassed his ""Minority Report"" role yet and his choices of roles aren't always good but I still regarded him as a very good actor. Other fine roles are portrayed by movie veteran Max von Sydow, Steve Harris (probably best known for his role in ""The Practice""), Neal McDonough who worked with Spielberg before previously on the 10 part mini-series ""Band of Brothers"", Lois Smith, Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare.<br/><br/>Truly the best thing of the movie is the look of it. Cinematographer Janusz Kaminski really surpasses himself at times and the use of light at times is simple stunning. There also is nothing wrong with the special effects and they look highly realistic and convincing, without ever overusing them. For some odd reason neither of those two elements were nominated for an Oscar. The only nomination it received was for 'Best Sound Editing'. <br/><br/>To be honest, I have never been fond of the whole conspiracy theory element of the movie and I thought it was unfitting for the movie. It was a bit too heavy for such an entertaining movie as this one.<br/><br/>All in all to be honest this wasn't exactly a movie I was blown away by but I most certainly was entertained by it. Maybe not as good as people always say it is but it certainly is still a very recommendable movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"master_tananh","9","1","2","12 September 2005"," Very impressive. Spielberg and Cruise's first collaboration is an awesome sci-fi thrill ride!
","Minority Report is an interesting blend of sci-fi and thriller. With a combination like Stephen Spielberg and Tom Cruise, you know it's going to be awesome without even hearing what the movie is about. But of course, it is my job to tell you these kind of things, so here I go.<br/><br/>Minority Report takes place in the near future of 2054. Now before you scoff at some of the seemingly too-advanced technology they seem to have, you should know that before production, Spielberg gathered some of the world's greatest scientists and had them brainstorm on what the world would be like in fifty years and he mostly used what they came up with. Of course he did add some stuff, but they're cool additions so I'll let it slide.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around John Anderton (Tom Cruise). He is the chief of an experimental program called ""Pre-Crime"". Pre-Crime uses the Pre-Cogs' ability to see when and who is going to commit murder to stop them from ever happening. The Pre-Cogs are three people actually, who can precict the aforementioned murders. They keep them drugged and isolated so they can predict these murders better. This is really my only big problem with Minority Report, the Pre-Cogs. For some reason I just can't buy the fact that they gained this ""ability"" from a combination of different drugs and medicines. That really is the only part of the plot that is a little too far-fetched. Anyway, eventually the Pre-Cogs predict that Anderton himself will kill a man named Leo Crow, whom John has never heard of before.<br/><br/>This leads Anderton into a wild flight for his life as he tries to discover whether he had been set up, or the system is imperfect, contrary to what everyone believes. Or, worst of all, maybe he really is destined to kill Leo Crow. The chase leads him to many different places and people, which leads us to what I think is the best part of Minority Report, the diverse characters. The Supporting Cast that you rarely see at all are fantastic in themselves. From the peculiar Dr. Iris Heneman (Louis Smith), to the shady Dr. Solomon Eddie (Peter Stormare), to the eccentric Rufu T Riley (Jason Anton), all of these characters are fascinating in themselves and it's a shame we don't get to see more of them.<br/><br/>With a great supporting cast, the main cast is even better. Colin Farrell plays Danny Witwer, an FBI agent who is trying to take control of PreCrime and leads the hunt for John. He does a very impressive job and I was amazed to later find out he was Irish! Everyone should definitely keep an eye on him. Max von Sydow plays Lamar Burgess, the Director and creator of PreCrime. He is something of a father figure to John and will do anything to keep PreCrime alive. Kathryn Morris also plays Lara, Anderton's ex-wife. They all perform spectacularly as they interact with each other and move the plot along at a good pace.<br/><br/>Then there is John himself. Although appearing successful at first, you quickly realize he is a shell of a man. His life has fallen apart following the kidnapping of his son. His wife left him and he is reduced to getting high and watching home videos during the evenings.<br/><br/>The film is filled with a very gritty feel to it and the coloring is filled with the cooler colors of the spectrum, especially blues and whites. It's also surprisingly packed with questions that most sci-fi movies don't bother with. It's filled with questions like ""Are the lives saved by PreCrime worth it if the system is imperfect and some innocent people are imprisoned for murders they actually wouldn't have committed?"" It's surprisingly deep for it's genre and leaves you thinking after the movie. As for the action sequences, they are all top-notch. Especially this one very impressive scene in which John is fleeing his former squad who are armed with all kinds of cool thins, most notably jet packs. I bet that was a pain to shoot.<br/><br/>Minority report is a high quality sci-fi thriller. With it's impressive stunts, inventive but believable (except for the PreCogs) plot, the vast range of characters, and the intelligent presentation, I give this movie a 9 out of 10."
"gottogorunning","9","1","2","13 August 2005"," Great fantasy film
","There's an overabundance of abuse of this here and quite frankly, the only reason I'm not shocked is because opinions are like...oh, well, you get the picture...<br/><br/>There is no doubt Spielberg is a talented filmmaker and though a lot of people dog him, Cruise is a pretty darn talented actor. Want to rate him against other leading men today, all you have to do is take a look at one emotionless Keanu Reeves performance or Ben Affleck (though I think Affleck is better than Reeves) and then try to put them into Cruise' shoes in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" or Minority report and think for a minute. Not a chance.<br/><br/>So what is it, fault Spielberg because he didn't satisfy your vision of whatever tripe you had in your head or Cruise, because he's flying the Jet you've only known in fantasy? People love to hate and show contempt when the majority of us have no foundation upon which to stand other than ""I liked it,"" or ""I didn't."" Reviewers like ""tedg,"" who apparently seem to be professors, still have only cinematic license to critique based on formulaic visions for what is, should be and how they might have changed it etc. etc.<br/><br/>While the majority of films for example are supposed to stick to non-filmmaker Syd Field's three act recommendation, some of the better works through time follow their own conventions and paths, not those set out before writers by non artists, who have never made more than the crap in their drawers.<br/><br/>Of course this is all garbage ultimately too, since the analysis of another's art, commercial or otherwise is simply opinion. Though it's nice for guys like Spielberg to consider the audience and commercially succeed, as well as being a requirement for continued work in this field (unless you fully finance everything you do), I think he probably wants to do movies he will like, regardless of what others think. Of course that's just my opinion. With opportunity to satisfy himself as well as others, and make lots and lots of money, well that can't be all that bad.<br/><br/>So why do I bother reviewing myself, one might ask? Because credit should sometimes be given where credit is due. As a big fan of Science Fiction or Fantasy, there is so little worthy of praise and a greater tendency toward cheese than in the Troma horror ""classics."" Just the sheer magnitude of a work does not make it worthy or watchable, and people seem to expect a better movie for the money, for example ""Waterworld,"" which at its time was perhaps the most expensive work ever done, and never lived up to expectations...versus ""Cube,"" done on a comparative shoe string with unknowns and a truly interesting story.<br/><br/>Minority Report on its hand is both ambitious and lived up to my expectations. For this reason, I choose to critique the critics rather than film. Many more labels of trash are accompanied by no explanation than are those praiseworthy.<br/><br/>Lest I go on...I am typing here simply because I had not before and it's hardly worth missing a warm meal to gripe for or against this amidst the masses.<br/><br/>Definitely some interesting ""aspects"" here. Of course who goes to the movies to examine ""aspects?"" I go to be entertained and I loved this flick. Good job Hollywood!"

I enjoy Tom Cruise and even more Spielberg films so this was, of course, a must-see for me. Taking place in 2054 Washington D.C., Tom Cruise is a police chief who heads a ""Precrime unit"", a brand-new police unit with futuristic technology that allows them to discover precisely when, where, and by who homicides are going to be committed. <br/><br/>This technology is much appreciated as it began to decrease D.C.'s massive homicide rate and eventually left the city without a single murder in six years. Using mind-readers called ""pre-cogs"" (referring to the pre-cognitive), this police unit catches future murderers before they commit their act.... imprisoning them but leaving their victims unharmed. Considered ""flawless"" by the U.S. government, there is an occasional disagreement about a specific crime that is supposed to take place by one of the three mind-reader ""pre-cogs""... This disagreement by the mind-reader is referred to by the government as a ""minority report"" and is deleted, in order to keep up the idea that this new precrime system is flawless and works without doubt. However, this small flaw becomes a very big problem when Tom Cruise (himself the unit's chief) is accused of murder himself... when one of the pre-cogs has a flaw and it is not exactly 100% certain that Cruise does in fact become a murderer but the 2/3 suspicion of him by the pre-cogs is enough to have the entire D.C. police unit crawling through the city for him...<br/><br/>This film soon becomes an exciting action-packed chase that involves Cruise constantly running from his fellow police officers as he tries to find out who framed him in a system that is supposed to be perfect for preventing murders.

It's a great sci-fi action flick with really cool special effects and great acting.<br/><br/>John Anderton (Cruise) is a pre-crime cop. What exactly is pre-crime? Well, in the future, they have developed a way to track murders and find murderers before they do the deed. Detective Anderton is one of the guys that brings in the murderers before anything happens.<br/><br/>One of the most interesting points I think that this movie raises is the notion of predestination. How can we know something was going to happen if we stop it? Are we really in control of our lives, or is everything decided ahead of time? Interesting.<br/><br/>But after Anderton starts investigating one of the first pre-crime cases about a woman named Anne Lively being drowned, things start happening. The next pre-crime case that pops up, the murderer happens to be John Anderton himself. In less than forty eight hours, he is supposed to kill a man that he has never met.<br/><br/>As the story unfolds, twists and turns come out at every corner.

","MINORITY REPORT (3+ outta 5 stars) Interesting premise (inspired by a short story by Philip K Dick) about a future society whose law enforcement relies on a trio of powerful psychics who can predict crimes before they happen so that the perpetrators can be apprehended *before* the harm is done. Complications ensue when one of the top law officers (Tom Cruise) becomes implicated in a murder. He goes on the lam, waiting for a chance to prove that he has no intention of killing anyone and doesn't even *know* the man is supposed to kill. I would probably like this movie twice as much if it had the last half hour chopped off. The true climax of the movie comes when Cruise finally confronts the man he is supposed to kill. (An extremely powerful confrontation that actually had me in tears the first time I saw it.) After that we get a totally predictable finale with the good guys triumphing over the bad guys (and neatly side-stepping a lot of the murkier issues of morality and justice raised in the first 4/5 of the film). Based on this and ""A-I"" I am beginning to think that ALL Spielberg movies should just automatically have the last 30 minutes chopped off. Still, this is a fun movie... probably Spielberg's best action movie since the original ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"". There are a few goofy scenes of ""comedy relief"" that may be inspired by Terry Gilliam's films... but they seem really out of place here (an eyeball-chasing scene in particular)."
"Brains_Not_Beauty","9","1","2","13 February 2005"," Intriguing and Original...""Minority Report"" soars
","When most first hear the plot of ""Minority Report"", they roll your eyes and think ""Sure, whatever."" I was certainly one of the many who didn't find the concept intriguing, but, more or less, stupid. I am a huge Tom Cruise fan  but then again, who isn't?  as well as a huge Collin Farrel fan. To see both extreme talents in one movie seemed like heaven. Add Steven Spielberg, one of the great directors of our time, to the mix and you've got a real treat. But with such a silly plot, I doubted the movie could be anything over okay. Needless to say, I was wrong.<br/><br/>In the year 2054, John Anderton (played by Tom Cruise) leads a group of cops under a program called ""Pre Crime"". Pre Crime is the futuristic way to track murderers. Inside a ""temple"" are three ""Pre Cogs"". Pre Cogs are basically humans who were born with the gift of seeing murders before they happen. Three of them, the main being Agatha (played by Samantha Morton), are kept inside the temple. Whenever a murder in the Washington D. C. area is about to happen, the Pre Cogs sense it and a short clip of that murder is projected onto a screen. Anderton and his team look the video over and find out where the murder will take place. To put all that in a nutshell: Pre Crime lets cops see murders before they happen, enabling the cops to stop them. That's just the basics right there; the actual system is both more impressive and complex.<br/><br/>Pre Crime is a system used only in Washington D. C. The founder of the system is Lamar Burgess (played by Max von Sydow), who would just love to make Pre Crime go national. Collin Farrel's character is Danny Witwer. Danny is a detective sent by the government to look over Pre Crime; Danny claims that he can find a flaw in the Pre Crime system.<br/><br/>So here's the real start of the story: The Pre Cogs sense a murder coming up. Big deal, right? It's just another D. C. murder for the records, right? Wrong. This time, the killer is none other then John Anderton himself. In about thirty-two hours John is supposed to kill Leo Crow, a man he's never met. Obviously this is a problem, and John is forced to run from his own ""employees"", now being lead by Danny Witwer.<br/><br/>So, you ask, where does the title come in? I'll skip circles around a spoiler and tell you that a minority report is an alternate way of murder. If I told you anything more then that, I'd have to give away a major plot point. Once you discover the value and meaning of a minority report, the entire film takes a different turn for you. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is as great as ever as John Anderton. Though he at first seems like a run-of-the-mill cop, we discover he's much more then that. What would have been a lifeless cop is a great one with Cruise in the role. Also exceptional is Collin Farrel as Witwer. I still find it amazing that Farrel can make himself sound American, not his native Irish, in practically every film he does. That proves a good actor.<br/><br/>Every movie has something that could be changed to make it better. Though ""Minority Report"" is an exceptional movie by most means, it fails in one. That would be the colors the film is shot in. I have never seen a movie that showed so much blue, black, and brown and such little of every other color. Everything in the film has a blue glow; a soft brown in it. The colors can get very distracting and sometimes they seem to take away from the over-all feel of the film. All the shots are nice and clean though, and Spielberg hasn't started using the now-popular ""shaky camera"" affects yet.<br/><br/>The plot at first seems simple and predictable, but it takes many twists and turns along the way. A plot that seems silly becomes intriguing. The acting is good, the direction is good, and the ending is a sure-fire knockout that just might blow you out of your seat.<br/><br/>MINORITY REPORT: RATED PG-13  VIOLENCE, SOME SEXUALITY, A FEW BAD WORDS 3 ½ OUT OF 4 STARS BOTTOM LINE: INTRIGUING"

"pyrocitor","10","1","2","22 November 2004"," The future is bright
","Spoilers herein<br/><br/>When Steven Spielberg, arguably the most influential director in film history tries his hand at sci-fi with Tom Cruise at the helm, you know something good is underway. This is indeed the case with Minority Report, with Steven Spielberg returning back to the future after 2001's A.I. The story takes place in the year 2054, with a new police department called 'pre-crime' which harnesses the powers of three psychics known as 'pre-cogs' to predict and stop future crimes before they occur. The system is supposed to be flawless, until officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is accused of murdering a man he has never met or heard of in less than 36 hours. To prove his innocence, Anderton kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton) the most gifted of the pre-cogs to delve into her mind to see whether he will actually commit the murder, or whether he's been set up, presumably by FBI agent Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) who openly wants Anderton's job.<br/><br/>Although primarily a science fiction tale, (based on a short story by author Philip K. Dick, who also penned 'Paycheck' and 'Blade Runner') Minority Report ends up as more of a film noire, with hidden clues being hinted at, but concealed from the audience until the last second, as Anderton races to prove his innocence, and discover his presumed saboteur. The noire element blends wonderfully with the science fiction portion of the story, ending up with a genuinely compelling and original tale of futuristic intrigue.<br/><br/>Similarly to A.I., in the year 2054 in Minority Report the future is bright, with everything from cars to buildings appearing silver, streamlined and very visually slick. The colour use is worth mentioning, with all colours dulled to virtually shades of white and black, perhaps to give a retro feel to a futuristic movie? Whatever the intention, the colours work quite well, and always add to and never interfere with the rest of the film. But it's Spielberg's envisioning of what future advertising and marketing will be like that makes the film so compelling all stores in malls have eye scanners, so models representing the store can talk to each person individually. Giving the general inconsideration for the public's privacy that modern advertising displays, in the future, this is an entirely possible outcome, heaven forbid.<br/><br/>Spielberg also brings his own quirky sense of humour into play here, as demonstrated with scenes such as Anderton falling through a window, and landing next to a circle of contortionists doing their warm up exercises, and the Swedish eye doctor making duck noises periodically. There's not really any reason for including these bits, but they do add to the bizarre intrigue of the film rather well, surprisingly enough.<br/><br/>The cast perform exceptionally, whether together or individually. Tom Cruise is spellbinding and surprisingly passionate as John Anderton, police officer on the run. This could have been transformed into a standard M:I2 style action performance, but Cruise is far too vulnerable and sensitive for this to be the case, emitting shocking emotion when reflecting on the kidnapping of his son. (the reason he became a police officer - pre-crime could have prevented his son's abduction)<br/><br/>Max Von Sydow is spectacular as Anderton's compassionate yet mysterious boss Lamar Burgess, underplaying the part to perfect effect, to create genuine audience confusion. We never know exactly where the guy is coming from, and he keeps us guessing until the end, where he is eventually revealed to be a desperate man, willing to resort to murder to maintain his enterprise.<br/><br/>Colin Farrell's Danny Witwer is also a cryptic character whose position is essentially the opposite of Burgess - originally you perceive him as the villain, framing Anderton for a murder in order to incapacitate him and seize his job, but in the end he is a good man with respectable morals, who just happened to take a dislike to Anderton. But just when we realize that he is in fact trying to clear Anderton from his premature accusation, Witwer is shot by Burgess for uncovering too much evidence. Farrell has great chemistry with the other cast members, and covers up his Irish accent beautifully.<br/><br/>But perhaps the real star of the show is Samantha Morton as Agatha, the pre cog abducted by Anderton. She is so convincing as a being who is not quite human, yet feels many human emotions which she can't quite come to terms with that you begin to feel really creeped out with the knowledge that she is, in fact, a real person, merely playing a role. A perfect definition of an actor totally inhabiting a role, Morton never fails to astonish us with her stunning characterization.<br/><br/>Of course, John William's exceptional scores never fail to complement Spielberg's work, and Minority Report is no exception - William's beautifully moving score perfectly adds to the mysterious tone of the movie. And with Spielberg at the helm, with an exceptional cast and the creative urge to do something refreshingly different, Minority Report could never really be anything but a huge success. Which, of course, it is.<br/><br/>-10/10"

","A view to a future, which may come true or not. A contribution to, say P.K.Dick's legacy, but not for real perhaps. Some say Steven Spielberg is a never grown up kid for the Hollywood entertainment factory. This film may promote their point. If one tries to convert a story of human life, its restlessness, unknown future, void ending against the ultimate eternal questions, Spielberg has failed so far for sure. His 'Report' is easy in the reading and unavoidably summed up in the 'happy ending'. I find it the very opposite thing to Dick's prose. He underlined our seclusion in our ultimate experiences, our specific and unique comprehension of the external input, the meaning of 'external', the unease, when balancing the choice between the real and elusive, and the rejecting of unnatural. It's a 'game' between our beliefs in God and the agnostics. Spielberg's made it easy to please the executives and audience. I do like the movie but it's far away from the Dick's prose and his message for us."

","The first review I read here of this film mentions The Fugitive, Blade Runner and The Matrix.

Star Wars II, anyone?<br/><br/>The Fugitive is more emotional, and as it's set in our world we can identify with it. Blade Runner is a damn sexy film, and I think the female character (what was her name) coming to terms with the fact she has been designed and built is much more engaging than than the run-and-hide as the star wonders whether or not he will murder, or is he being set up. The Matrix was much more in-tune with popular culture, fashion and pop-philosophy and predictions for the future, albeit blatantly copied from Terminator.<br/><br/>It's not even particularly memorable. Not actually a bad film, Minority Report simply fails to stand out from the crowd in any way."

But yes this movie's biggest turn off for me was the pushing off the technology, too unbelievable.<br/><br/>Along with the fact of the over doing of the future technology, this movie was fairly boring when it starts off, if money wasn't spent on this movie's rental it would have been turned off before it even ended. My friend in fact, fell asleep during the movie. <br/><br/>Sure eventually the movie picked up, through a few good twists, but all together, but by then it was too late, I had already barely payed attention to the majority of the first half.

"Manthorpe","8","1","2","17 June 2004"," The Patriot Act...evovled.
","One of the better science fiction films that has come out in the past few years, I was pleasantly surprised by Minority Report. The visuals are simply stunning and really get your imagination going. Not only are they nice to look at, they're fairly probable. I especially enjoyed the cars that drive themselves and take you up to your apartment or condo. The retina scanning cameras that are everywhere are also very realistic. The US government is already trying to implement biological modes of identification besides simply having you give your fingerprint at the DPS station to renew your driver's license. In all actuality, it's fairly feasible, even scary. Although the film takes place in the not so distant future, it's more like 1984.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is a hit or miss for me, sometimes he's enjoyable and sometimes I want to crush his head in a vise. It always seems to be a toss up, but he does a decent job here. Colin Farrell outshines him though as the investigator of Pre-Crime who's trying to dig up dirt on Cruise's character, although his role is minimal. You really do hate him at first because of his character, which is a good sign that he did a nice job...even if he reminds you of a gibbon monkey or a man in a Gillette Mach 3 commercial. Let's just pray suspenders aren't around in the future. Overall a very entertaining film from Spielberg with some excellent action sequences and a few decent twists. But since it is Spielberg, you always know how the film will end. Nice and pretty, everything's fine and you get breakfast in bed while winning the lottery. If he didn't always end films the same way, it might make his movies more enjoyable as you wouldn't be able to predict what type of ending they'd have. That said though, extremely entertaining but could have used a less goody two shoes ending...still a grade A sci-fi film."

","This film is almost a follow-up to Steven Spielberg's ""AI: Artificial Intelligence"", released a year after this film.  Both are attempts at more intellectual ""adult"" science-fiction.<br/><br/>Adapted from a short story by Philip K Dick, ""Minority Report"" takes place in Washington DC in the year 2054, where the murder rate has been reduced to zero thanks to an experimental division of the police force, which utilises three ""pre-cogs"" (individuals who have a powerful ability to see into the future).  This means that murderers are arrested before they commit their crimes.  The head of this division (Tom Cruise) believes it to be perfect, until he is accused of a future murder.<br/><br/>Steven Spielberg is a hugely talented film-maker, but this film suffers from his main flaw, which is mainly an excess of sentiment.  The future on display is intriguing and well-designed.  The entire movie is shot in an interesting style which bleaches out vibrant colours from the image.  This accentuates the dark tone of most of the story.  Tom Cruise's character is a deeply flawed individual (he has never recovered from the disappearance of his son, and he takes drugs), but Cruise never really manages to get into the depths of the character.<br/><br/>Although the film sounds like an action-packed thriller, in actual fact, a few spectacular sequences aside, it's mostly very dialogue driven."
"jazzest","7","1","2","18 March 2004"," Good Adaptation of Philip K. Dick's Nightmarish World
","SPOILERS INCLUDED<br/><br/>Philip K. Dick's sci-fi novels essentially reflect the contemporary world, no matter what futuristic gadgets he uses. As if his characters were living in our era, we can easily relate ourselves to them who struggle to fix what is going wrong. For the realization of the Dick world as a mirror of the contemporary society, Minority Report did a better job than glossy Blade Runner did.<br/><br/>There seems to be a logical contradiction in the plot, but it is usual for Dick's setting and the filmmakers must have been aware of it. It is impossible for Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow) to design a murder that Detective John Anderton (Tom Cruise) will commit in the future, while the only reason Anderton will commit is that he witnesses his own future murder and is driven to discover why he will. This chicken-and-egg problem suggests the fragility of reality, one of Dick's long-lasting themes.<br/><br/>With craftsmanship Steven Spielberg seamlessly takes in Hollywood cinema's package requirements, such as elements of action flicks and flashy sci-fi movies. Stoicism might have worked better to respect P. K. Dick, but it may be too much to ask Hollywood. Spielberg has a strange habit to mysteriously leave some avoidable blemishes. For example, why do Dr. Iris Hineman (Lois Smith) and Anderton kiss, when she informs him of the minority report? It is completely out of the blue. Also, why does Dr. Solomon Eddie (Peter Stormare), who replaces Anderton's eyes, have to be a jerk like a stereotypical underground doctor in a comic book?<br/><br/>The picture with blue-ish hard tone and intense brightness contrast, which is probably manipulated through the postproduction, is appropriately futuristic and unforgettably unique."
"gus120970","Null","1","2","23 February 2004"," Spielberg regains his vision
","Twenty minutes into Minority Report and I am thinking - is this Spielberg's mid-career masterpiece? On the ebbing strength of the last half hour, perhaps not, but it is still a masterful piece of film-making.<br/><br/>I'd like to think of this as Spielberg's equivalent of 'Measure for Measure', an accomplished piece of storytelling from an excellent writer source, but emotionally detached while philosophically engaged.<br/><br/>
The basis of the plot is a law enforcement experiment called 'Pre Crime' that uses three humans with drug-induced 'second sight' which causes them to have visions of crime in advance of them happening. These visions are manipulated via the information technology of 50 years in the future to piece together the time and location of the intended crime, enabling teams to get there first and arrest the pre-cognised perpetrator.<br/><br/>The premise is worked through in a dazzling 10 minute set-piece at the start of the movie which sets the tone for its stylistic verve. The ideation of the virtual moving 'scrapbooks' which are used to rearrange evidence is quite simply brilliant, but just one facet of the film's visual inventiveness. Spielberg uses FX frequently to play around with rough cut digital video imagery, which is far from his trademark sumptious and immaculate composition (still precedent in the foreground).<br/><br/>There is a deeper philosophical layer behind the Spielbergian eye candy. Behind the success of pre-crime as a tool for civic harmony and the implications of interning individuals for actions they did not actually commit. In essence - the argument between predestination and Free Willl - which has been exercising humankind since Socrates and perhaps before.<br/><br/>
It is only the idea of the infallibility of the pre-crime process, and the unanimity of the three precogs, effectively a reworking of the three classical 'fates' that lend the programme its moral authority.<br/><br/>This is where the parallels with Measure for Measure emerge. In Shakespeare's play, the events take place in a degraded civic society and the argument is that sometimes illiberal measures are needed to protect society at large from the forces that would destroy it through vice and crime. This is clearly the philosophical settlement made by the society of the time of Minority Report, which is able to countenance the oppression of the 'not yet guilty' to protect the 'not yet victimed'.<br/><br/>The film has been criticised for not portraying a suitably dystopian view of the future, which is laid at the door of Spielberg for his inability to be truly bleak (those having missed Schindler's List). The inevitable comparison is with Bladerunner - truly the sine qua non of unfortunate futures. But I find Spielberg's ambivalent vision a lot more interesting and probably accurate.<br/><br/>It is unlikely that the state will be all Fascistic, that all the trees will be uprooted, that it will rain all the time and everyone will be unhappy and unloved in the near or even far future. Despite our fears, that is not really how life turns out. It is much more likely there will be mix of rich, poor, luck and unfortunate that has typified human society since it has been recordable.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, the ambience of a more illiberal society, by a degree, is created in the progress of the film. One of the most memorable set-pieces is the 'spider sequence', where a SWAT team is searching for the film's fugitive anti-hero, played by Tom Cruise. They unleash a swarm of mechanoid 'spiders' into an apartment block who intelligently seek out humans from their heat signatures with the aim of reading their iris for a positive identification.<br/><br/>The sequence is brilliantly realised uses a roving plan-view of the apartment complex to show how the machines infiltrate each apartment to apprehend their 'prey', each of which are indulging in the mundane activities of life, from taking a dump to arguing in the kitchen.<br/><br/>What is interesting is those vignette characters' reaction to the intrusion of these sinister devices. They appear neither surprised nor shocked by their arrival, but instead either wait patiently to be scanned or ignore them. This occurrence is normalised, yet it appears to the viewer to be an unsettling violation of our rights to privacy and anonymity. What levels of control and intrusion will become normalised in the preceding generation.<br/><br/>The theme of vision and sight is repeatedly explored throughout the film. The iris is the instrument of identification - the eye functions to define our individuality and our citizenship, but it also functions as a shackle, an inescapable 'mark of Cain'. Interestingly, again from classical parallels, is the means Anderton uses to escape from that particular problem when on the run - it is an established them in classical literature for those outside society - the hermit or outcast - to be blinded.<br/><br/>I will avoid discussion of the film's last segment, the emergence of the precog character, the final plot twist and the denouement. It appears that when Spielberg intends them to account for themselves directly to the audience something is lost. From the loss of Colin Farrell, the anti-hero's nemesis - onward, the film loses something and cruises towards it resolution. This just makes the latter stylistics seems slightly forced and ephemeral.<br/><br/>But there is intellectual engagement enough across the entire two and half hours to merit the regard of being a truly great film."

","If there was ever a director less appropriate by temperament than Stephen Spielberg to adapt the work of PHILIP K. DICK, I couldn't guess who it might be.<br/><br/>On the one hand, you've got the borderline personality of SF writer Dick, plagued by demons (schizophrenia, drug addiction, paranoid delusions, and an affection for classical music), whose writings describe dystopian futures where reality is no more than a collective hunch, and corporate fascism controls our lives, and nobody wins.<br/><br/>On the other hand, you've got the oeuvre of Mr. Spielberg, the Disney of the modern era, an idiot savant whose portraits of adolescents yearning for nuclear family security, played out against fantastical backgrounds, nearly always end in triumph and affirmation.<br/><br/>Man, is this a marriage made in HELL, or what?<br/><br/>Like the equally psycho-schizoid merger of Kubrick/Spielberg in ""AI"", the MINORITY REPORT is a partly brilliant, partly moronic, fully beautiful rendering of Dick's ideas, utterly betrayed by Spielberg's compulsive need to be loved.<br/><br/>Also as in `AI', if this film had ended 15-20 minutes sooner, we would've been offered a truly terrifying and bleak depiction of a future that could've made our blood run cold. But Spielberg and Cruise were not about to put themselves in such a position.  So, at the denouement, we end up with the reunion of Cruise and his ex-wife (unseen as a romantic couple for the entire film!) starting over with a new pregnancy and a happy ending, utterly unearned by anything that preceded it. [End spoiler]<br/><br/>There is also a TRAGIC misstep in casting. No, not Cruise, who is fine. There is a secondary role played by a world-renowned character actor famous for playing villains. If you cast him, it better by either as a villain, or as someone you want the audience to THINK is a villain just to fool them because he's really NOT the baddie, but merely a red herring. If you cast him as a seemingly nice guy who TURNS OUT to be the bad guy, and if THAT is supposed to be a surprise twist, then you've just shot yourself in the foot... narratively speaking. [End spoiler]<br/><br/>There are some ingenious images and ideas in the film, and it's well paced, for the most part. But it's not an action-packed summer thriller, by any means, nor a particularly cerebral think piece, either.<br/><br/>

"Clive-Silas","8","1","2","9 January 2004"," McKee was wrong: you don't need a great final act.
","This film has a fascinating and original premise which is unfortunately not explored to its full potential, but also contains some of the most intelligent and visionary future actualisation ever brought to the cinema screen. Amazingly full of non-Spielbergian features - such as after a hard and successful day's precrime fighting, our protagonist is then immediately shown buying and taking drugs, or the lascivious kiss suddenly planted on John Anderton by the elderly Dr. Hineman - the film nonetheless contrives to remind you who the director is at certain points, like the schmaltzy final shot or the lack of nudity when displaying male fantasy images. Those elements aside the entire film works as a much better Kubrick homage than the mawkish A.I.<br/><br/>As others have mentioned, the film sometimes doesn't know what it should be pursuing as a theme. The sheer injustice of arresting and imprisoning (apparently without due process) people who haven't even committed any crimes does not seem to come into the purview of the script, which seems to decide that the injustice arises when one of the three pre-cogs disagrees with the other two, and that the inventors of the system arbitrarily had such ""Minority Reports"" summarily and automatically wiped from the ""testimony"". Witwer (Farrell) represents the ""enemy"", the villainous Attorney General who wants John Anderton and Burgess out of their jobs - oh, wait, that means he must be on the side of Justice and the American Constitution. Hang on, no, it's OK, he wants them out on their ears, but he wants to make PreCrime national, so it's alright to hate him. No, now I'm confused because it looks like he's a hero again! I guess that's not a bad set of ambiguities for a character, now I come to think of it. Incidentally, Witwer's name adds to the general atmosphere of bereavement (Alderton has lost his son, and the precogs have been deprived of a normal life) - Witwer is German for ""widower"".<br/><br/>Very few films in the supposed Science Fiction genre have been so clear-eyed and intelligent in their depiction of the future. Of *course* all the major advances in science and technology are going to be put to the advantage of marketing and the benefit of the large corporations (although I do think that in 50 years time the TV show ""Cops"" might actually have changed its theme song - ""Bad Boys"" by then being regarded as classical music, presumably). Unfortunately, some of this technology is so perfect and seamless that the only way out of Anderton's obstacles for the scriptwriters involved them having to dig enormous holes in the plot. It is simply not credible that the security checks did not remove Anderton as ""authorised personnel"" the second he started running. This led to the enormous implausibility that 2054's state-of-the-art ""deep freeze"" prison can effectively be broken out of with the aid of one person wielding a gun. There were other problems, too, like the fact that three murders successfully take place during the course of the movie, despite the oft-stated claim that the Precrime department have stopped all murders for six years. Could the cops only get there on time if Tom Cruise was with them? So it seems...<br/><br/>So, what did I mean by my subtitle? If you've seen Adaptation, the legendary script guru Robert McKee appears as a character and expounds some of his theory of scriptwriting to Charlie Kaufman: ""I'll tell you a secret. The last act makes the film. Wow them in the end, and you've got a hit. You can have flaws, problems, but wow them in the end, and you've got a hit. Find an ending, but don't cheat, and don't you dare bring in a deus ex machina."" Minority Report is the movie that proves that this is actually nonsense. If there's a good enough premise and you can get a more than exciting trailer out of the main body of the movie, your last act can be utter rubbish, as is the case here. All the ""Wows"" in this movie come before Anderton's arrest - after that it really does get a little ho-hum. They even made a terrible bosh of the ex-wife, upgrading a minor character, introduced sometime in the middle of the movie, into a major protagonist?? But the public forgave that and everything else and gave this movie a certain success.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise does a very good job with good strong support, at least partly because he handles the little touches of humour very well, and (for once) is not afraid to look a little silly, as when he chases his own eyeballs down a corridor.<br/><br/>Samantha Morton is an absolute revelation and absolutely un-missable. You literally cannot take your eyes off her whenever she appears. This is another reason for the failure of the last act, since she is off screen for most of it.<br/><br/>""Wait........ wait.............. wait.........."""

","As previous commentators have argued, there are plenty of plot holes & inconsistencies throughout the film, but besides all that it was an interesting & enjoyable film to watch. The acting was very good for these sort of films, with Tom Cruise putting in a good performance as usual. The best though were the non American contigent of Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, & the impressive Samantha Morton who is now finally proving herself on the international stage. In the UK, Samantha Morton has been fairly well known for years, starting out as a child actress, & coming to fame on the long running gritty drama TV series Band of Gold, where she played a teenage prostitute. 7/10"

","Another look into the future by the fabulous mind of Philip K. Dick is not so fabulously translated to the screen by Steven Spielberg. Although the plot line engrosses you about how law enforcement works in the mid 21st century Washington, D.C., it attempts to rely too much on Tom Cruise's character to pull it all together.<br/><br/>Notable scenes involve how society is portrayed under Big Brother's eye, a la Madison Avenue advertising/capitalism gone mad. If you think crowd conditioned thinking to monopolistic advertising is bad NOW.... wait till you see what lies in store for us!<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable film, but I think Steven Spielberg is NOT in his element when dealing with Philip K. Dick's stories of our future. The ending was a bit too predictable, and even though you felt some sympathy for Tom Cruise's character as he races against the clock to prove he is ""innocent"" of a murder not yet commited, you've got to pay a LOT of attention to what is going on, and what is being said to get anything very meaningful out of the story.<br/><br/>Collin Farrell and Max von Sydow add their charm and mastery of acting in their pivotal roles, and for once, Tom Cruise is not a ""hot-shot"" glamour type wanting to be the center of attention. In this film noir-ish science fiction movie, he is almost ""reluctantly"" the center of attention."

","Leave it to Spielberg to ruin an otherwise genius work of Science Fiction by Philip K. Dick. If movies like this, the Color Purple or Schindler's List inspire people to go out and read the original works -- then I have to at least give him that much credit. Then again, the more people actually read these stories (and come to realize Spielberg's gross misinterpretation of each of them), the smaller his future audiences will become. This probably won't matter much though, considering all of his audiences seem to have an intellectual age of about 9-11 years (I loved ""Jaws"" - I was 9 years old), which appears to be a large segment of the movie-going audience.<br/><br/>The story line is still compelling, despite the childish special effects.

","Others have already provided articulate, nuanced comments for this film. Of course, the opinions run the gamut from Love or Hate, to Damning with Faint Praise.<br/><br/>But in speed-scanning all posted comments, I feel I've noticed a trend; a dichotomy in the tone of reactions to the movie that may help those who have not seen it decide if it's worth their time and money.  (But after the the two numbered items below, I'm just rambling.)<br/><br/>1.  Those who have stated or implied that they have READ any work by Philip K. Dick tend to have enjoyed the movie.  (This does not mean that they--or I--would have preferred Spielberg as director, or Cruise as lead protagonist.)<br/><br/>2.  Commentators who don't mention that they've read any book by Dick tend to dislike the movie, or feel it's mediocre (beyond being reduced by Spielberg/Cruise.)<br/><br/>I don't mean for this to be iron-clad, and the pleasure/disgust in viewing MR has been well-stated both ways.  It's also true that I've read a handful of Dick's novels, and find that his characters' themes of alienation, despair and worry about paying the rent play out well, as projected into futuristic settings (or revisions of history, as in The Man in the High Castle, and Radio-Free Albemuth.)<br/><br/>Phil Dick used a life-long battle with obesity as an excuse to become an amphetamine addict (check the Author's Note at the end of his 1977 novel, A Scanner Darkly.)  His fans lost him in 1982--the speed-abuse had severely damaged his pancreas.  He was about 60.<br/><br/>The year prior to his death, he gave an interview in which he stated that he believed his first novel was superb (Solar Lottery, 1955.  There are two other titles for it.  One was only used in a British edition of the work.) He flatly stated that his next 25 novels--and other short writings during the period--were ""junk....worthless.""  It's funny that the story from which Minority Report was derived was written during this time span.<br/><br/>Presumably, the next ""quality"" novel Dick felt he had written was The Man in the High Castle, published in 1962."

Blade Runner dug the grave on this one, although MR might well have got away with it if it had only announced itself as a homage to Scott's masterpiece. Morton was good, von Sydow you expect to be this good. Cruise, well... there is an old martial arts movie with David Carradine, where he breaks a beautiful boy's nose in order for the boy not to grow up a tyrant.

","The movie is visually great, and I found it entertaining. I didn't even guess *all* of the plot twists before the end.<br/><br/>But I got annoyed when I reflected on the plot and tried to mentally fill in the missing pieces. This is impossible. Not only did the movie have the usually ""causal impossibility"" of ""B is the direct cause of A-is-true"", and simultaneously ""A is the direct cause of B-is-false"" (future murder causes precog tagging, but precog tagging falsifies the occurrence of the future murder), but try to answer the following question :<br/><br/>How was Tom Cruise's character Anderton set up for the framed killing? That is, what actions did the framer take in order to cause Anderton to go to the high-rise apartment and shoot the impersonator? We're told that he arranged for the impersonator to do the impersonation, should he meet someone matching Anderton's description. Presumably the impersonator may have also been told to be at a particular place, with the fake ""evidence"", at around a particular time or times, and to expect Anderton to come by and shoot him. But how would arranging the impersonation CAUSE Anderton to go to the high-rise apartment and meet the impersonator? It's insufficient! The framer should have acted directly on Anderton to lure him to the scene of the ""crime"", to make sure that he had a reason for going there and would meet up with the impersonator. For example, Anderton could have been given a false message, by the framer, to lure him to the same place where the impersonator was. But instead, all we are told indicates that the *cause* of Anderton going to the scene of the crime was...that Anderton was seen by the precogs to be at the scene of the crime. But wait! The framer couldn't plant visions into the precogs, could he? How could the framer know that the precogs would see Anderton committing the ""crime"", or how could the arrangement with the impersonator be the cause of their seeing this? It's not enough. There is no causal connection between the set-up and Anderton's falling into the trap! Anderton went there because the precogs saw him go there. And they saw him go there because he went there. And he went there because they saw him go there. And....and...<br/><br/>So now the main plot line has collapsed into ""A is the precursor and direct cause of B"", and simultaneously ""B is the precursor and direct cause of A"". And yet there's a third event C--the plot to frame Anderton,--which isn't a direct cause of either A or B! My tolerance for the usual nonsense of time-tripping paradoxes is now exceeded.<br/><br/>I would have given this movie high marks if only I could shut my mind off after viewing it. There are many other aspects of the plot that Spielberg should be ashamed for anyone to try to analyze. (Why would the impersonator put faith in his family's being rewarded by a man he ""didn't know"" the identify of?) But the paradox of paradoxes I describe here is the big doozy for me. Enough to sour me on this film."

","A strange lifeless film by the Hollywood master, Spielberg. It follows the usual story arch, which we have seen too many times already, so nothing surprises. And despite this being a science fiction movie of sorts. Of sorts, because besides the premise, everything else appears to be only futuristic rather than science fiction, which is not the same. Somewhere along the line the energy dissipates. It becomes an empty exercise on pirotechnics (aka FX aka special effects) in an extended chase that does not add up to drama. Performances are well below average for all actors, all of whom besides Tom Cruise and Max von Sydow are unknowns or TV cops that eat on screen while they talk (same food as in 1950s, 60s, 70s, 80s and 90s cop movies...). In fact, they fail to be believable. Cruise remains capable and saves the tedium with his charisma. Von Sydow tries hard with very little. Production design is flawless, cinematography superb, and direction capable without pulling it off as it should. Fails absolutely to deliver an exciting action scifi film along the lines of the classic of all classics, ""Blade Runner."" Pass the DVD rental unless you are a film student in need of some FX background."

","The film gets its name from a mention, half-way into the film, that when one of the three ""predictions"" differs from the other two it is suppressed as a ""minority report"" so as to not cause a furor. The main protagonist, John (Tom Cruise), pursues this to see if there is a flaw in the pre-crime arrests and perhaps innocent people are incarcerated. <br/><br/>If you take away the futuristic setting of this film, and all the special effects, it is quite an ordinary film noire ""whodunnit."" Crime fighters are at work, someone double-crosses, an innocent person is framed, he goes on the run, has to figure out the bad guy. Same story has been done many times. To his great credit, Spielberg didn't just try to invent what technology will be prevalent in 50 years, he held a retreat with experts in various fields and used their input for the film's design. Perhaps the most likely to be implemented are the various retinal scanners to identify people, and even target public advertisements as individuals walk past.<br/><br/>The whole story of ""Minority Report"" would fall apart without (1) the belief in God who creates a pre-determined universe and (2) God will choose to communicate the pre-determined path. In the two depicted ""future"" murders the film uses, at least 3 or 4 people are involved in the images that are transmitted as ""future"" events. In a random universe, it is quite unlikely that the events, even only 20 or 30 minutes in the future, would happen exactly as predicted, and it would be impossible for any one participant to ""see"" all the others. Therefore, it would have to be a supreme being, causing a pre-determination, and communicating it. For me, and probably for most others, that idea is so foreign that we can never take the concept as even a ""what if"" premise. Interesting science fiction, but may work better as a comedy (like Back To The Future or Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure) rather than a dark drama.<br/><br/>SPOILERS follow -- Turns out John's mentor, the old and wise Lamar (Max von Sydow) needed to murder Agatha's (Samantha Morton) mother to keep Agatha as one, and the most effective, of the three predictors. So as not to get caught he hired a drifter to murder someone else at the very same spot, edge of a lake, dressed in the same clothes. When he duplicated it with Agatha's mother they thought it was an deja vu echo, and ignored it, because he had set up the system to work that way. The pre-crime division was dissolved, the three predictors, who had been the only survivors of a genetic experiment, lived out their lives in seclusion near the ocean.<br/><br/>Sept 2017 update: Just watched it again after 14 1/2 years, still an interesting story."

Instead, like a song without a melody  or even a consistent key, it jumped all around in tone, in era (future versus modern), and even in plot, which utterly changes partway through to having nothing to do with a so-called `minority report'  with a resulting mishmash of other movie pieces and tones, borrowing momentary bits here and there from Bladerunner, Angelheart, Jacobs ladder, country love stories, Patriot Games, even your run-of-the-mill action flick (the ones with those chase scenes that are interminably long and not at all interesting).  There's even a little MIB-like face-changing gizmo, used only once and for no purpose at all.  While we start all high tech sideways travel, by midway, we're just plain old mall shopping in the rain, the scenery, clothing, architecture straight out of 1990s (wasn't that mall interior used by Woody Allen?), and country screen porches elsewhere.  And when are movies going to quit being all gray and blue and humorless as if that is how to create suspense? 	Wish the precogs could have foreseen this waste of film."

","As a huge fan of Blade Runner, Philip K. Dick, and sci-fi in general, I should have loved this film. So why did it leave me saying ""ho hum""?  Because good sci-fi as any true fan knows is not about the science or the effects or the story--it's about the characters. This film does very little in the way of character development. We get to know John a little bit but every other character on the screen is one-dimensional. SPOILER AHEAD You have no idea why Lamar chose to kill in order to set up a program to catch killers, you have no idea what makes Danny be so relentless, you don't know how such a crazy woman as Iris was able to lay the foundation for such a large program as Pre-Crime, etc. I left the film having many more questions than answers. And these were plot-related questions, not deep philosophical questions such as Blade Runner left me with. We the audience are supposed to care about the question of crime and its prevention, but that topic is forced far into the background by all the other plot elements crammed into this film, and thus you don't continue pondering it once the film ends. -Kurt"
"tributarystu","9","1","2","29 December 2002"," Great work
","First of all, I'd want to say that I admire most of Spielberg's works, and I consider him one of the best directors there are. He did have some disappointing movies, but most of his ""works"" were great or even brilliant works, like this here or AI. Examples are many... You should first know a little bit about the story. A man is being chased by the system he trusted, a system based on predictions. These predictions of the so called ""Visioneers"" help preventing crimes. As the whole operation is about to go nation wide, problems appear. A small study on the characters would be implied in my opinion.<br/><br/>  There's Paul Anderton, represented on screen by the one and only Tom Cruise, who does show us good quality acting. His character is one which you do meet through quite a few films, the kind of guy who lost a son, and who tries through his job to help other people which might suffer similar losses, and who usually feels better because of it. It's a kind of thing such characters do to keep living, to give their life a real sense. Paul is a smart guy, self determined and with good intention. Initially he doesn't have any doubts on the system, but that is just because he is not well informed. He believes he is the head of the  operation, but it is not truly so.    Then, we get to see the humanity in every person, even in him as he finds out he is about to kill someone. He is determined that he was framed, and tries to find out who did it, and why. We then meet an event which is arguable. The fact that there does exist only one future, and that it can not be changed. That is what the Visioneers represent. And the system itself. A future that can not be set under any doubt. Is it really so? I do not believe it is, and it seems that neither does Spielberg. You will see that after viewing the movie.<br/><br/>   So there's Anderton. Another important character is Danny Witwer(Colin Farrell), who works for the government. I think he is as smart as Anderton, and he might certainly has more experience in murder cases. He is actually quite alike with him. He wishes justice too, but he has a flaw which is very, very disturbing for some: he is arrogant, and he probably doesn't even know this because he is eager to prove himself. He's a good guy.<br/><br/>   Lamar is the so called ""bad guy"" here, despite the fact that he is just an old, and self obsessed man...he is all that matters, and his system of course. Anyone who stands in the way goes...well, you know. He is old, and the system is all he lives for. The fact that it might be going nation wide is of critical importance, but what I did not clearly understand is if he wants it or if he doesn't want it to go nation wide. Anyway, as a paradox, he will be the one who will prove that the Visioneers can be wrong.<br/><br/>
   The special effects of the movie are great, and I especially enjoyed the whole idea of the film. The spiders were great too, and I must say the same about the acting of all actors. <br/><br/>   This movie is new...and still it is old. Many of the ideas we see here have been used in other movies too, but Spielberg makes them look new, and I believe that the success of this movie is mostly because of Steven Spielberg.<br/><br/>  I would consider it for the Oscars too, even for the best picture category, though I doubt it will get there. The movie would have been even better, if the end hadn't been quite disappointing. That's how I consider it, because it would have been just right if things had stayed as they were. The role of the wife had been so meaningless, and now the fact that she frees him just doesn't seem right. <br/><br/>   The story also points out a pretty important thing. If you agree or not, that's your decision. The system might be perfect, but the mistakes are made by human hands. <br/><br/>  Before I end this, there would be one more thing I'd have in mind. Was the choice of the year 2054 totally coincidental? Or maybe, it wasn't...because 1000 years before the Catholic and Orthodox Churches had separated each other. Maybe it's the same thing in the movie. We can see a conflict between generations, and then the fact that the program might go nation wide...it might make them all safe. But it does not happen so, and again everybody is in danger. How it partially was after 1054, because people had been separated again by ""higher"" forces. It's just my opinion...might be a coincidence. <br/><br/>    As a mark...I'd say somewhere between 8,5 and 9 out of 10. I consider it a certain ""must-see""."

","This time, Spielberg has tried to be too clever for his own good. For a storyline that brings up so many fascinating philosophical issues (such as predetermination and free will), the chance to make a classic is wasted. Stevo wants us to take him seriously, but when a chased man in a tightly secured future world can escape about fifty heavily-armed cops coming right at him from all directions, be able to then get back into the PD as a fugitive by just bringing along his eye with him and then having his wife do it again is ridiculous to say the least. Some people may be ok with this, but I need a little more from my films (unless Arnie's in it cos you're just prepared for the ridiculously unbelievable then). The ending was a HUGE let-down, nothing to save the film there. Also, why did all the actors feel it necessary to mumble through their lines? The story is confusing enough as it is, let alone having to keep rewinding the tape to try and decipher what they were all saying. <br/><br/>I can't even commend the storyline for being original, practically the same one was used in an episode of 'Sliders' that was made years before this film started production. All in all, a poor effort. 3/10."
"Rob_Taylor","9","1","2","26 December 2002"," Minority Report is a good, solid mystery film.
","SPOILERS AHEAD<br/><br/>Minority Report is a good, solid mystery film. When I first saw the trailers, I was convinced I knew what was going on...that it was, in fact a clone of the hero that had committed the murder. How wrong could I be? The film will keep you guessing until about the last twenty minutes or so, when it all becomes clear.<br/><br/>The special effects are decent enough, though I spotted one tiny error regarding the case numbers. When they first begin to look at the murder the hero is supposed to commit, it's assigned a number 1109. But when he's reviewing the images on the big ""monitor"" you can see the number 1108 at the top. 1108 being the murder they showed previously in order to set the scene and take the audience through how things worked.<br/><br/>One other minor gripe. The precogs can apparently tell who is being murdered and who is the murderer...they name names! But they can't tell where the murder is being committed? But then it gives the cops something to do, trying to figure out where a murder is being committed, I suppose.<br/><br/>A couple of minor bugs, though, in an otherwise great movie. Well worth a look if you are a fan of cop drama, scifi or just plain old mystery movies.<br/><br/>There are a number of people that don't get this movie, which is puzzling, since it really isn't anything more than a whodunnit set in the future. A very good whodunnit, which'll keeping you guessing for a long time, but still that's all it really is.<br/><br/>Funnily enough, those that don't get this, also don't get films like Vanilla Sky, which is another movie that keeps you wondering until the end. Could it be that Hollywood has successfully weaned people off intelligent movies and on to bland, action-oriented fare like Die Another Day? I hope not. But then, a friend recently saw The Two Towers and reported there were people in the audience who didn't understand the simple concept of flashbacks, which is pretty scary.<br/><br/>Anyway, watch it and judge for yourself."

","Yes, I would agree that 'Minority Report' wasn't all that it was hyped up to be, but it is still a wonderful film worth watching.<br/><br/>The plain fact is Speilberg has made a movie that is both ACTION and STORY.

","This is Spielberg's most lamentable movie to date. No, I take that back - still Hook! Spielberg has taken over from Quentin Tarantino in trying to blend any number of different movies together in a cinematic blender. Tarantino does it subtly for the most part but he makes the film his own. How many different films did we see in Minority Report? Demolition Man (the eyeballs and the futuristic fascist overtones). The Matrix (when Tom and the pre cog get flushed down the tube in 'The Temple' just like Neo when disconnected from his battery pod. The Fugitive (on the run and we just knew it wouldn't be Colin Farrell who was the baddy but Max Von Sydow (his old buddy) just like Kimble's doctor friend. Someone already mentioned LA Confidential (exactly right when Kevin Spacey got shot). The problem with this was, even though the pre-cogs did not see that coming, the audience saw it the day before. Spielberg should have been arrested by the Pre-Crime unit himself for wasting such a promising idea with dead end plot lines (minority report, hello! Where did it go? They all saw the same thing.) Those that remember the sense of awe and enlightenment that one felt after watching The Matrix the first time understand why Minority Report is unfit to sit on the same Video Store shelves as that great film."

I know this world isn't perfect, and I don't expect films to depict it as perfect.

","When Spielberg had started to discourage us with his latest films, Minority report has come to tell those that thought that Spielberg wouldn´t be able to make and amazing film again, a film like ET or Jurassic Park, that he has still things to show us from his personal universe.<br/><br/>The action is present from the beginning, after a brief ""mise en scene"" to teach the audience how the justice works in the 2054. A frightening method that allows the cops to know who is going to make a crime in the hours next. A malfunction (Or at least is that what we are inducted to think) gives place a prosecution that reminds ""North by Northwest"", the hunt of an innocent that is at the same time trying to get clues that can demonstrate his innocence. This is the part of the film that we enjoy the most, even when is a simple action film at this moment, the audience know the injustice and tries to identify themselves with our hero.<br/><br/>But there is always a problem, first of all and the most important, we know the ending or at least we suppose how is it going to end, that´s really the problem of this film, with an exceptional start, has a common ending. The second is the amount of brands that we see during the film, at one moment we have the sensation that we are watching a commercial, this has to make us think how the cinema has lost its art component and now is a simple business, an industry. It´s really a shame that a good director that has something to tell accept to include publicity in his film, from that moment he is accepting that everything is permitted to get money to make the film."

","Ok Mr Spielberg you are the king of movie entertainment. You know what it takes to please American audiences. You obviously have big fun making movies and what is more you make the big buck. Hitchcock was once overlooked as a mere entertainer but there's nothing ridiculous in every single movie he shot between, say, 1935 and 1963. And he shot one a year. Perhaps childhood was too sweet for you and you don't want to become a big boy. You like better when everything seems beautiful and nice in the end. Too bad you're the kind of spoilt child with a gift for directing and pleased with your stuff.<br/><br/>Minority Report is the typical Spielberg movie. A patchwork of high flying directoring skills with an abysmal ending. The result is a movie you will forget as fast and smoothly as any action flick by some dull director.<br/><br/>The premise was excellent.

I tends to deal with a serious issues like a presumption of innocence in such an awkward manner that I kind of expected Tom&Jerry to jump out of the screen. The future life style and technology are depicted in a way that reminded me of Ed Wood's movies.

MR is more entertaining than BR but less than A.I., Spielberg´s last film. I want to point out a ""major"" plot hole though that brings down the whole concept of the movie and will keep me from watching it again. SPOILER! Apparently, Director Burgess framed Anderton (Cruise) and set up everything so Anderton could fulfill is future and in order to get rid of a possible threat to his life work. At first sight it looks all so logical. Everything has been prepared, the poor guy has been payed for getting himself killed, photos have been arranged and you think ""now it makes sense!"". Problem is, that it is the most illogical plot ever conceived. It is not even the typical ""time travel paradox"", it is just plain stupid. Just ask yourself, how could Burgess have known about and planned all this in the past before ever seeing the ""precog""-vision for himself that he could not see before he planned the set-up in the first place? How could he know where to send the ""to-be killed"" guy? How could he know where Anderton would go, what he would do? He just could not!

I think I would have enjoyed the film more if the chase hadn't been so long that I got bored and picked apart the movie during the chase.

","I have a major grudge with this film.**SPOILERS** As a fan of Philip K. Dick (writer of the original story-I really hope you knew that), and a huge fan of such dark sci-fi noir classics like ""Blade Runner"", I was hoping for the best. A wonderful, wonderful concept, solid cast, high production values. I was really looking forward to this movie. The hype kept calling it the ""Blade Runner"" of the new millenium. I was there with my friends on opening day, first showing...it had been awhile since I'd seen a truly great new film....And for close to 2 hours, things were going pretty well. Maybe the film felt a little padded, and the eye transplant seen was amusing but a bit grotesque. No, the film wasn't perfect, but it was going well. ...The end is coming up (SPOILER ALERT), Anderton is soon to meet the man he's destined to kill. After all this time trying to avoid what's been predicted, nothing will stop fate. We find out the crucial motivation that would lead Anderton to do the deed (although I got a bit nervous as what they labelled the ""orgy of evidence"", something felt a little off here), and then its finally set to happen, Anderton will fulfill his destiny......Or will he? The movie goes and pulls a serious 180...And now I was angry. What's going on? At about two hours in, ""Minority Report"" self-destructs.<br/><br/>I just don't understand it. The POINT of the movie is the idea of whether Anderton is destined to do the crime following what is predicted. To follow the cool logic of Dick's original story (which was flawed but MADE SENSE) the answer would be ""yes."" If the movie had ended with Anderton pulling the trigger as predicted, I would have loved this movie. Unfortunately, that hack Spielberg doesn't understand the idea of decent storytelling, and lets his sentimental streak contrive a 30+ min denoument destroying the fabric of the rest of the film. Frankly, Spielberg has taken material I have long viewed to be of great potential for a classic film and made a film that misses the point. ""Minority Report"" is a wonderful technical achievement with great special effects, and solid acting, but it doesn't understand where to go. The notion of pre-crime is quite a determinist concept, and by wimping out on following through on the implications of the source material, we have a perfectly acceptable thrill-ride with no soul. As popcorn entertainment, ""Minority Report"" is more than adequate. But this is by no means a classic. Instead, this flawed sci-fi opus will likely go down as a sad failure, as it should to anyone who understands the underlying concepts behind a system like ""pre-crime"" that the movie missed. I can only hope someday someone does this material right."

Ok, atmosphere is fine, but this is too much.  It actually detracts (for this viewer) from the plot.  So much hinges on technology that it loses validity when shot in some 50s B-movie quality. The jet-copter used is very reminiscent of the classic ""Metropolis"", giving a very dated feel, especially combined with the grainy film, yet we are then expected to believe all the rest of the technology.  Nah, doesn't work.<br/><br/>""Blair Witch""-esque camera work also spoils the film.  Jerky camera movement abounds, quite literally, in some pathetic effort to make you feel a part of the chase.

There's been a lot of talk about intrusive advertising, but this is an important part of the plot.  The fact that the companies involved are actual companies selling today just adds realism (and a part of the budget too, the cynic in me tends to think)<br/><br/>All in all, a movie worth watching, but wait till it comes out on DVD/video and rent it.

However, close to the end some logical mistakes are made in the movie. Just an example, would be very easy to prove that John Anderton don't kill Danny Witwer. First, Agatha will can testify the innocence of Anderton, second the gun used to kill Danny was left to Anderton in the place of the first ""crime"" and the pre-crime police officers known that. Also, was easy for Anderton's wife infiltrate in the place that in principle should be a security installation. For this reason, a cast 7 for this movie."

A ball is rolled off a table, but is caught.  Of course, it is explained, the ball WOULD have fallen to the ground.  I see, and so this movie explained.  BUT, let's rationalize the rest:  The ball did NOT fall to the ground, and therefore did not get scratched, dented, etc. from falling.  HENCE, the ball did not SUFFER THE CONSEQUENCES for it's fall because it didn't happen.  Oh well, we can suspend disbelief, because after all we're watching a movie.<br/><br/>Try also not to examine the computers of the future too closely, or you'll realize how antiquated it is that you need something the size of a floppy disc to store information.  Or, God help us, you'll have to transfer picture files from one supercomputer to another via a notebook-sized piece of glass.<br/><br/>For continuity, the eyeball doctor's revenge was horribly misplaced and unnecessary.  The moldy sandwich/spoiled milk bit was abominable, and served no point being in the movie.<br/><br/>And unfortunately I don't believe that someone with the power given to the Director Burgess couldn't get a court order for custody of a child rather than having to murder her mother.  Perhaps this could happen in the vein of 'Homeland Security'.<br/><br/>I also question the society that has cars driving down walls but doesn't have effective antidepressants for our grief-stricken hero.<br/><br/>Amazingly, this movie manages to get a 5/10, which is probably 2 points too high.

","Tom Cruise gives a very good performance in a mess of a film. Phillip K. Dick, one of the most brilliant sci-fi writers of all time, is very hard to adapt, because when you read his stories, your mind and imagination are always going to come up with a much better visual than what a movie can show you. This movie seemed to want to be a whole bunch of things but it never came together as a one solid film. The main plot is smart and clever (Dick's) and that is what propels the movie, but man, it is no shock who the secret villain is and the last part of the movie is padded with the typical Hollywood twists and turns that are so forced and just basically tap dancing while you look at your watch and wonder when they're gonna wrap the damn thing up. Speilberg, a gifted director, has to get away from these dark, sinister attempts, just like the disasterous A.I., Speilberg tries so damn hard, using all the tricks and gimmicks available to him and even though it LOOKS good, it's slick and glossy and impressive, these dark, moody films of his never seem ORGANIC, they never seem to be coming from a real place within him. I mean, for crissakes, look at his logo for Dreamworks, a Tom Sawyerish boy sits on the moon with his fishin' pole???? I mean - how 1950's and sweet is that? THAT'S Speilberg - that's what he knows, that is what makes his heart beat, that's why he can hit a home run with E.T. and Indiana Jones, etc. They're fun and breezy. But his last two attempts to make these dark, brooding adult sci-fi films just seem like weak singles into shallow left field. In the long run, they're empty and hollow. All flash, no substance. (Oh, and a horrid cartoonish performance by Tim Blake Nelson as the wheelchair bound tech assistant - he seemed to be performing in a Coen Brothers film. Sheesh!!!)"

The three oracles, who are kept asleep with drugs and left to float in a tank to foresee violence of the future, who are they? Is it alright for a society, that calls itself humane and that wants to prevent crime, to do that by sentencing three people to a life in coma? Do we at all want to know the future?<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" is an action thriller, a crime story and, at times, a comedy. But, as good SF, it is also philosophing over the future, the evolution of society and the eternal question: Are there discoveries and inventions we should avoid, though we are able to make them?<br/><br/>If you like ""Minority Report"", you might also want to consider watching ""Total Recall"" and ""Gattaca"" (of which the first is based on yet another story by Philip K. Dick)."
"Tessa-7","5","1","2","17 July 2002"," Blade Runner meets Splash - another crime which wasn't prevented
","This film managed to keep my attention but, in hindsight, was a sloppy piece of sci-fi which stole gimmicks from Bladerunner, the Matrix, and [insert name of any previous half-decent sci-fi film].<br/><br/>So what's it all about? Search me. It seems that Daryl Hannah (AKA Samantha Morton as the main precog who also does a great line in gasping) has to lie shaven-headed in a flotation tank all day with two other mermen. Whenever she has a premonition of a future crime, she triggers the National Lottery machine which produces two bonus balls with the name of the victim & the perp. (Sadly not Dale Winton.)<br/><br/>When this happens, Tom Cruise comes over all ""Jean-Michel Jarre"" and starts conducting a large interactive monitor (not quite so sexy with a mouse & a keyboard)in order to pinpoint the exact location of said crime so he can catch the future miscreant before it happens.<br/><br/>Said miscreant is then housed in The Matrix (copyright Wachowski) with only a lone organist for company and - hey presto - the world is again a safer, crime-free place.<br/><br/>But, oh no, the system's flawed! And - oh my god! - it looks like poor, troubled-after-the-death-of-his-son-so-now-addicted-to-ventolin? Tom Cruise could be implicated!!!<br/><br/>After that, I stopped caring as the plot's numerous holes were instead filled with outrageous product placement and interminable ""action"" scenes.<br/><br/>
Not unlike the precogs, I had a feeling as I went into the cinema that a crime was about to be committed. Unfortunately, no pre-crime cops came crashing through the roof in time to stop the projectionist...<br/><br/>The real criminals, Hollywood directors such as Spielberg, are guilty of laziness & complacency. The fact that they fail to think through the plots of such big budget films really beggars belief - are they that desperate for the cash? Do they really think their audiences are that stupid?<br/><br/>I want to see more films made with interesting & complex plots (Twelve Monkeys); excellent dialogue (Heat) and intelligent casting (Wonder Boys) - spending less on CGI and more on the script. By demanding an end to fast-buck films, we can stop any further crimes before they're committed!"

","You will find many people here going on and on about how this is one of the all-time great movies (it's high ranking on IMDB justifies that).  I don't quite share the same opinion but I do think that in a time when summer movies are getting dumber and dumber, Minority Report is a welcome and after Scooby Doo, MIIB, Mr. Deeds, and yet another uninspired Star Wars sequel a very refreshing movie.  It is the most suspenseful movie I have seen this year and only Road to Perdition is a better looking film.  However, as hard as I tried, I still couldn't help getting confused (just a little) by the plot.  But at least I thought about the plot afterwards which is more than I can say for most of these ""event"" movies.  Cruise and Speilberg are in top form and Colin Farrell, who seemingly came out of nowhere, is fast becoming a BIG star.  The best scene in any movie I've seen this year goes a little like this.  Cruise is hiding from those robotic spiders (spiders that ID you by crawling up on you and scanning your eyes)that are searching for him. He does this by holding his breath in a tub of ice (with them being able to detect body heat and all).  He holds his breath for what seems like an eternity before a small breath of air causes a bubble to slowly rise to the surface.  Just that small bubble is enough to draw the attention of these ""spiders"", that come charging into the bathroom and surrounds an unsuspecting Cruise in the tub.  See, I told you it was suspenseful! 8.5 out of 10"
"melinda2001","3","1","2","16 July 2002"," Don't do it!
","This movie is terrible that I am profoundly disgusted. Certainly my expectations were too high because I was fully expecting to love it. I was unprepared for something this bad. I suppose you want details. OK, well, the opening scene shows a group of clairvoyants predicting a murder. As soon as the machine they're plugged into detects this prediction it doesn't just send a computer message; instead it carves a ball from a block of wood and engraves the name of the victim on it, and another ball with the name of the murderer. One ball then rolls down a spiral tube in one direction, and the other ball spirals down another tube in the other direction. Someone then explains that it's important for the machine to do this because something about the grain of the wood makes it impossible to counterfeit. Does that make any sense to you? It sure didn't to me. <br/><br/>Then there's the entirely gratuitous giant virtual reality setup that the Tom Cruse character uses to understand the details of each murder. Lots of expensive computer graphics are likewise complete wastes of resources. Likewise for the chase scenes and love interests, but at least that's nothing unusual.<br/><br/>So how did it happen that so much money was spent to make such a lousy movie? I can answer that in two words: ""Product Placements"". The movie seemed to include at least a dozen prominent placements for products such as Lexus, The Gap, and Revo sunglasses. This is nothing like the placements we commonly see where you're never 100% sure it was paid for by the company who's logo or product is shown. This movie hits you over the head with each one.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I was expecting to like the movie is because Ebert & Roper raved about it. They never even mentioned how this movie takes product placements to new heights. I now trust him less.<br/><br/>Finally, Steven Spielberg has tended to make better and better movies, so I'm equally disappointed with him. _Shrek_ and _Artificial Intelligence_ were brilliant. I can only guess that he's either hard up for cash or gone off the rails.<br/><br/>If this were just a normal summer blockbuster I wouldn't have commented on it, but this one is so bad that I have to call out the IMDb voters that pushed it into the best 250 movies of all time! (Now it's down to 7.7 in 2011. BTW, I don't think that IMDb should list movies in the top 250 until at least a year after their release.0<br/><br/>If you haven't seen it yet, don't bother."

There are also significant plot ommisions and stuff that just plain makes no sense, but I guess that is to be expected.  The product placements are significant because of the sheer number of them and how out of place they are.  Hello, it's supposed to be the year 2054, right?

Of course, Spielberg and company couldn't just use made-up brands of the future to drive home any point they were trying to make about ad saturation.  Not when they could make millions by assuming that the people of the future still watch ""Cops"" on their holo-projectors and wear Remo shades.  In fact, some scenes seem to be included solely for the purpose of pushing a product (i.e. the scene at a well-known clothing store with fashions that just so happen to look very 2002).

Some people have expressed the view that MR is the Bladerunner of this decade. I'd say not in 2054 years.

Here again despite the appeal of Cruise, is a movie that lacks any cohesion, sensitivity, vision, or logic.  There is no ""minority report"".  Rather there is an echo.  There is no sympathetic character, only a world devoid of any redeeming characteristics.  Craft maybe high but the story is totally lacking.  Why is Spielberg so fascinated by the loss of children?  How do you justify motivations covering 6 years? Why do the plots have to be transparent? Why does the movie drag on?

I suppose it helps that I already feel spamed everywhere I go. The concept of a system of crime prevention had great potential too, but things took a sharp slide and kept going worse. What should have been a captivating look at the future and tech and humanity and fate and free will, instead went to picking a thread-worn plotline from the list of standby yawners. If you have seen a movie or read a book of any kind of your life, there is no way you will be surprised by anything that happens by at least the last two-thirds of the movie, where it has switched fully into a miserable attempt at thriller-mode. I don't even have to mention the numb plot points specifically (which I won't, because it would too painful). There's everything here but the long lost twins, no wait, there's sorta that too. At best, it all feels like filler, bland uninspired filler. Maybe worse, there is no way you will care; about the chars, ending, or anything but wishing you had that time back to spend over.

My gut says those over 40 have a far less sanguine view of this film than younger viewers who have been weened on the computer and television. Perhaps Spielberg and SKG have chosen to target the younger audience at the expense of those who prefer gray matter over CRT's for stimulating the imagination.<br/><br/>
As an aside--the young lady who played the pre-cog may have had the most physically and emotionally demanding role in this film.

In short it doesn't, it almost does, but there is no doubt that this is a modern classic. You all probably know the plot, but for those who haven't seen the film, don't go in thinking this is a huge action film like the trailer boasts. Don't get me wrong, there is action, but it doesn't over populate the film. It focuses on character and story. And all the better for it. As always, the brilliant John Williams is on music duty, and instead of driving the movie with his score, he makes it more suttle and quiet, providing a backdrop to a scene, that is quite frankly, gorgous. And Spielberg again, shows why he is the best director in the business. Some of the camera work and design of the shots are fantastic, and the acing which he gets out of the actors is superb. Tom Cruise is great as the flawed drug abusing John Anderton, but he has competition in the best actor stakes. As an opposing federal agent, Colin Farrell steals almost every scene with his cool, determind gum chewing character Danny Witwer. He plays the role with such confidence, it's hard not to dislike him. After the first two hours of mayhem and confusion, it slows down a gear, which for some people may drag the film down. I certainly felt a bit funny when it changed from ace futuristic thriller into an almost cliched who-dunnit crime drama, and maybe Spielberg played his all too familiar sentiment card too much, but it certainly weakens one of the best films in recent years. But despite the change of pace, on second viewing, the ending does work, but it still felt just a tad too long. But by the end, you are willing to forgive it for the minor setback, because the previous 2 hours are just brilliant, in every possible way. Can Spielberg make a bad film?"

I actually turned to my friend at the end of the film and apologized for making him see it, knowing that no words I could ever say could make up for the fact that he had just been subjected to Minority Report.  Most of the plotholes have been brought up here, but there is one that I haven't seen yet, maybe because it's easily answered or maybe because it just gets lost in the ocean of other plotholes.  Here goes.  Why would the pre-cog (who's words taken as gospel by the police) not simply say that the supposed murder victim killed himself by pulling the gun into him. Collin Farrell actually suspects something fishy and all he has to<br/><br/>freakin do is ask the EYEWITNESS in the room!!! C'MON!!! End of movie.

The movie takes a little while to really get going, but turns into a clever, fast-paced entertainment, only to absolutely stop dead for the last 20 minutes or so.  The scene @ Anderton's ex-wife's house just stops the movie cold, and it never quite recovers.  Then, when we are expecting the movie to end there, with all major players in the movie meeting up and tying up the loose ends, the film dribbles on for another half-dozen scenes, each one lumbering a little closer to resolution; some rethinking @ script stage could have easily made this one a classic.

","I found the movie to be disappointing.  In my view, it fell apart at the end (not unexpected) and too many features of the plot and even some of the visuals were a bit too reminiscent of a certain recent noir movie with the initials of a large California city in the name.  The Janus shot towards the end was kind of neat.  This is yet another movie where abundant special effects substitutes for good script and editing.  But then again that might be unfair as we had just finished viewing the 1st disk of the Criterion ""Children of Paradise"" DVD prior to seeing ""Minority Report"" and other movies just fall away in comparison.  I scored it a 5/10."
"GaryMotev","2","1","2","1 July 2002"," A Disappointing ""Report"" Card
","***SLIGHT SPOILERS*** It's easy to see why the critics have been doing hand-springs for the mediocre ""Minority Report"" - another dud for Spielberg (and a second bomb, after ""Vanilla Sky"", for its star, Tom Cruise) could begin to impact both of their high-flying careers. And Spielberg has, in recent years, become something of a middle-brow human revival house: he's made two David Lean movies (""Schindler's List"" and ""Saving Private Ryan""), followed by a Stanley Kubrick movie (""A.I.""), without ever really forging his own style or perspective (while taking breathers with the ""Jurassic Parks"", which were just family-sweetened ""Jaws"" rehashes).<br/><br/>In artistic terms, Spielberg's been running on empty for as long as twenty years (since his last good-all-the-way-through movie, ""E.T.""), and at some base level, everybody knows he's leveraged to the hilt - but he can still put together dazzlingly kinetic sequences (D-Day in ""Ryan""; the attack on the Jewish ghetto in ""Schindler"") that give the audience something to like. It doesn't matter that ""Ryan"" and ""Schindler"" can't come close to Lean, or that ""A.I."" basically rewrote - and botched - Kubrick's ironic ending. They SEEM like the old kind of popular, yet artistically successful movies; we can pretend they are, at any rate - and that's worth something. With Spielberg in serious decline - and Sam Raimi waiting in the wings - the whole boomer 70s Hollywood balloon seems somehow in jeopardy.<br/><br/>And so the laurels are thrown for a movie far more muddled than ""A.I."", but not nearly as interesting. Spielberg has drenched ""Minority Report"" in a grainy, silvery light, as if we were watching the whole thing reflected on chrome - obviously we're supposed to be like one of his ""pre-cogs"", dreaming the future in a silvery secret sauce. The film is based on a Philip K. Dick short story, but Dick would probably do a few revolutions in his grave if he saw it. His amusing, paradoxical idea (of stopping crime by seeing into the future and preventing murders, but then prosecuting the would-be killers anyway) has been extended far, far beyond its limited ability to distract us. As he demonstrated in ""Ryan"", Spielberg seems to believe that he can inflate even slim ironies and paradoxes into two hour-plus meditations. Alas, he can't.<br/><br/>At least ""Ryan"" was founded on a real (if small) irony; but from the beginning we sense problems with ""Minority Report""'s ""paradox"". After all, if the pre-cogs are really seeing ""the future"", shouldn't they see the police bursting in and STOPPING the crime, too? In fact, the police could save themselves a whole lot of detective work by just shouting out the address when they arrive (which they would hear back in the past) so they'd know exactly where to go. For some reason, of course, the ""pre-cogs"" are dreaming an ALTERNATE future, which takes into account the murderer's free will, but not the intervention of the police, or the pre-cogs themselves. This isn't a ""paradox"" - it's just not thought all the way through.<br/><br/>Oh, well - we're willing to ignore this, of course, if the movie can tease out some interesting thematic material from its premise. But it can't. After the initial souped-up chase, and the shocking twist! (Cruise is fingered as the next murderer), the movie begins to pile on the filler: technology that's not quite interesting enough, half-baked plot strands that are then dropped (like the back story of Cruise's eye surgeon), and long, expository scenes alternating with chase after chase through a future world not nearly as interesting as the one in ""A.I."", much less ""Blade Runner"".  Meanwhile the themes of justice and free will seem to be put on permanent hold as the action-picture gears begin to grind.<br/><br/>But even as we're puzzling over the non-paradoxical paradox of the pre-cogs, we can't help but notice that the main plot is a mess, too. (SPOILER ALERT.) Cruise's simple backstory, for example, is so heavily underlined that we have no trouble guessing exactly why he might want to murder someone (you feel like a pre-cog in more ways than one while you're watching this movie). We expect, of course, that he'll realize this himself as he gets his come-uppance - and maybe a little self-awareness in the process, too. But no. He ends up on top o' the world, without even a dent in that orthodontically-enhanced smile. Likewise, we expect, after a lengthy sequence in which he's chased by digital spiders trying to scan his newly-implanted retinas, that he'll be at least partly blinded by the experience (""King Lear"", anyone?). But again, no. The movie works up a whole ""vision"" theme, then drops it with a clunk (Cruise drops his old eyeballs, too).<br/><br/>The movie does right itself, briefly, when Cruise arrives at the murder scene, with a pale, shivering pre-cog (Samantha Morton) in tow. For a few minutes, the omens and portents of her dreams (the man in sun-glasses turning out to be a billboard, the creepily-laughing woman with a pipe) play out with a genuine chill.<br/><br/>But alas, once THIS plot has been resolved, we're off and running with a SECOND plot even less convincing than the first. Of course Cruise was ""set up"" by someone, and if you can't guess who, you really need to see more movies (or at least ""The Fugitive"" and ""L.A. Confidential""). Colin Farrell's on hand as the handsome red herring (in the process demonstrating an easy charisma that almost blows Cruise off the screen), but he's soon disposed of, too - and by now the plot mechanics are SO awkward that the only suspense lies in wondering just how much they think we'll swallow. The very pretext of Von Sydow's vast set-up is ridiculous: Morton grabs Cruise for a split second as a few obscure images splash over her screen - hardly enough to make Von Sydow immediately jump to murdering Cruise, which wouldn't solve the problem anyway (the problem is Morton!).   And how did the set-up work, anyway?  How did Von Sydow know Cruise would eventually FIND the set-up, for Morton to dream about, since he wouldn't know about it UNTIL Morton dreamed - oh, fuggeddaboudit!  Then there's the issue of exactly what the ""minority report"" is supposed to BE. First we're led to believe that it will exonerate Cruise, then we learn it doesn't really exist, then we think it DOES exist about another murder, but then we learn that the evidence is really a bit of pre-cog ""deja vu"", not a minority report at all. Uh - what?<br/><br/>Clearly, as is his wont, Spielberg's been rewriting on the fly, and the results (as in ""Ryan"" and ""A.I."") are a tangled mess. Why can't this guy respect the parameters of a genuine story, and just leave well enough alone? Steve, you're a DIRECTOR, not a writer! You're good at effects, not ideas! It would probably be a good thing if ""Minority Report"" bombed (I think after a huge opening weekend it will taper off significantly) - but only if Spielberg could be made to understand WHY it bombed. But that of course will probably never happen. Bring on Sam Raimi!"
"The Original Sam Gray","3","1","2","30 June 2002"," Badly written and full of plot holes
","I can accept the idea that, in the future Minority Report presents, there is a Division of Pre-Crime that prevents murder through the use of ""pre-cogs"" who can see the future.  Such is the film's conceit and the basis for its internal reality.  However, I cannot accept the fact that the movie's characters behave without intelligence, and neither can I accept its plot holes.<br/><br/>When Tom Cruise's future detective shows up as a perpetrator in the pre-cogs' visions, he escapes.  Cruise's former co-workers are allegedly out to stop him from committing the predicted murder, but while they tiredlessly search for him, it never occurs to any of them to seek the victim and keep him away from the scene of the crime.  Obviously, if the victim is not at the proper location, Cruise won't be able to kill him, and the narrow timetable in which the cops have to catch him would be eliminated.  This is simple common sense, and though there are images of Cruise all over the film's billboards and newspapers, there's never the slightest warning to the victim.  Why not?  The only explanation is that the cops are stupid. Similarly, Cruise is at one point able to gain access to an area that shoul d be restricted to him given the fact that he's wanted for a future murder. However, the cops are once again too stupid to have revoked his access.  Of course, the cops are idiots because it serves the film's plot.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the plot is in-of-itself illogical.  Watching Minority Report, I excepted there to be a reasonable explanation for Cruise's identification as a killer.  After all, he clearly doesn't plan on killing anyone.  However, once the film gives us its ""explanation"" (which I won't reveal here to avoid spoilers), it seemed to me that Cruise never could have been in this situation had he never seen the vision to begin with.  Some might be inclined to call this a paradox.  I call it bad writing.<br/><br/>Additionally, the dialogue is too often expositionary in nature, and the tone of the film is uncertain (this is often due to the inclusion of bizarre supporting characters played by Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare).  I do give the film high marks in the visual department; the cinematography is excellent and the CGI work fits the context.  The performances are also quite good for those actors that don't have ridiculous roles like Nelson and Stormare do (Samantha Morton, as a precog, is particularly good).  Still, style without true substance is neve enough (the film's arguments about free will vs. predestination come up vague) - especially when watching stupid people navigate a ridiculous scenario.  3/10"

","By itself, this film is decent entertainment, but not a great film. Some nice special effects, a couple of clever visions of the future, but also several unoriginal (or just plain dopey) ideas, and a serviceable but uninspiring plot.<br/><br/>My main complaint is that the makers of this movie pulled a Total Recall. They took the basic premise of a Philip K. Dick story, then wrote a completely different story with the same premise, changing both text and subtext. At least the makers of Total Recall released their film under a different name than that of the short story it was ""based on"".<br/><br/>I was hoping for something more true to the original Philip K. Dick story, like Blade Runner or Screamers. With The Minority Report, I really think the original Dick story could have been fleshed out and made into a very interesting film. Regardless of how one feels about that issue, Minority Report is still decent summer entertainment."

I say so because this movie is LONG.  Tedious.  And at certain points, quite boring, to be honest.<br/><br/>It's not the great action, sci-fi, edge-of-your-seat, nail-biting thriller kind of experience that the commercials and trailers try to make you believe.  Rather, it's a drawn-out mystery with an intricate plot wrapped in CGI to cover up any mistakes.<br/><br/>And I'll say right now, the special effects in this movie are really great. The futuristic appearance is sometimes a little overdone (Policemen with jetpacks?  Why not Flash Gordon, too?) but such scenes as the highway (as Anderton jumps from unmanned, autopiloted car to car) are really excellent.<br/><br/>I was expecting action.  You know, jump around, get dirty, fight, mess with futuristic machinery, that sort of stuff.  Well, we get the futuristic machinery, but not too much of the rest.  There are really only three or four action sequences (which are pretty cool), but the rest is Anderton's search for the truth.  Well, that's great, but let's put that in the commercials and trailers, shall we?<br/><br/>And John Williams' music?  Hah!  Matches the theme of the movie--slow and tedious.  It has its good parts, such as the highway scene, but even then I could tell Williams is losing his touch with action music.  I don't feel as thrilled anymore like I did with The Lost World's heart-pounding ethnic drums, Jurassic Park's raptor theme, or The Phantom Menace's Duel of the Fates.  I think Danny Elfman or James Newton Howard (heck, even Howard Shore) could have done much better.  Or maybe Hans Zimmer...<br/><br/>Let's face it.  This movie was a disappointment.  Some parts were exciting, others were hilarious (the spiders in the apartment), but most of the movie was just dull.  It had too much explaining to do.  It was interesting at first, and I'm sure it would have stayed that way had I been able to stay awake and pay attention.<br/><br/>So I'd really suggest seeing this movie when it comes out on DVD.

","Warning: commerical placement spoilers.<br/><br/>I am not a big fan of Tom Cruise, and got dragged into seeing this movie by a friend. 2+ hours later, I came out disappointed. The movie was like a giant souless commercial vehicle with endless product placements (bvlgari, lexus, some cigs?, cruise himself). The plot was OK, with enough twists and turns that you did not feel you could predict what happens next. The problem for me was that I did not care for any of the characters. Cruise was a classic cop with an edge (caused by some troubles long time ago). He wore the usual expression of righteous anger/self confidence through the entire movie, no other emotions ever escaped his face. Some minor characters were more interesting, his boss. But this is what I expected. What I was really hoping for were some cool special effects & chase scenes. There were 2 chase scenes, the memorable one with Cruise riding the guy with a jet-pack, another a common video-game chase. Not enough to keep me from closing my eyes often. Some special effects were nifty, such as animalistic plants. The entire movie was shot in a dull gray tone, that I found depressing. The fast action cuts so cool in Matrix (where Keanu runs super-fast) felt out of place here, since Cruise plays a non-cyborg. So, I did not care about the characters, chases, visuals, which leaves one last chance for the rescue: babes. Sadly, there were none, and I was left grasping the imaginary fast forward button most of the time."

","I did not read the original story by Dick, but I am sure that he never intended to write the script for a movie like this. Despite the display of special effects, the visionary, nightmare-like features commonly found in Dick's novels are completely absent. Everything (from social relations to trademarks) is exactly like it is now, with the predictable SF-movie minor technical exceptions (guns, cars, eye-surgery etc.); the only real difference is the pre-crime department, but it is treated mainly as the un-usual scenario for the usual hi-tech action movie, rather than the story main point of interest. There are actually some scenes where some kind of reflection takes place, but they are kept as sketchy as possible. Furthermore, even if you simply look at it as an action movie, the quality is neither bad nor particularly good, because of too many unrealistic ""details"" (e.g. the escape from SIX armed guards).

It just seems that as an adult i am more annoyed with the quirky humorous segments.<br/><br/>And i am one who loves to laugh.<br/><br/>There are people i would recommend this movie to and i would tell other people that i respect to see something else.<br/><br/>Overall definitely not worth full price."

","Now, many will tell you of the intricasies of the plot, or the holes, or whatever else.  And yes, both are there.  But, what bothered me about this film, and why I think it will be forgotten (it is NOT #128, as it is ranked here), is that it is so derivative of other Speilberg works (there i spelled his name two ways).<br/><br/>Spoiler-ish:<br/><br/>What I mean by derivative, is that so many of his films are exactly the same on a structural level, which makes each one less satisfying.<br/><br/>Here's how it goes:<br/><br/>1. Establish far out premise and lots of things we need to accept as fact. 2. Set up main character who we are supposed to like 3. Set up a scenario for this character to be chased 4. Spend LOTS of time having this character get chased, and get away, chased and get away. 5. Have character find answer with very little work (or by accident) 6. Have a happy ending 7. Give the audience ""something to think about"" that is less and less deep the more you dwell on it.<br/><br/>Films that fit this mold:<br/><br/>ET, Jurassic Park, AI, Minority Report.  To a lesser extent, Jaws, Raiders, and Close Encounters still follow this Silly Premise-lots of chasing-ending in which main character is not that active.  But at least Raiders, Jaws, and CE were original and entertaining.  This film is not too original, and only sometimes entertaining.<br/><br/>It's not as if he writes all these scripts, but he seems to choose all of them, and directs them the same way.<br/><br/>Think about it, and you'll see that basically, this film has very little new in it, either from a Sci Fi standpoint or a Speilberg/Filmmaking standpoint.  The style is repetitive (Matrix, Gladiator, Vanilla Sky even!), the technology is stolen (Strange Days, Matrix), the jokes are lame and out of place, the acting is all over the place, and the future is very unrealistic.<br/><br/>So, don't buy the hype.<br/><br/>When i got home, Rules of Engagement was on TV.  And honestly, seeing both so close together, R of E is a better film, and it isn't a great film!  Had never seen either, but liked the second better.  What does that say about MR?"
"cthulhu-23","8","1","2","27 June 2002"," Good movie that stays pretty close to author's style
","SPOILER WARNING<br/><br/>I saw this last night and absolutely loved the first two thirds of it.  The ending devolved into a drawn-out mish mash that strayed away from the spirit of Philip K. Dick's writing, but was still satisfying.  The first part of the movie did a very good job of sticking within Dick's style of story, common elements of which are: 1) What is reality?, 2) drug use (he had a problem), and 3) who is good/evil?  <br/><br/>The more I think about the ending, the more frustrated I become.  I have not read the short story upon which this was based, but I would say the point at which we see Anderton lowered into Containment would probably have been Dick's ending.  Not only that, it would have come AFTER Max von Sydow's character killed himself and we saw Anderton reunited with his pregnant wife, meaning the ""happy"" ending was a figment of Anderton's imagination. Tim Blake Nelson's character said something about ""all your dreams come true"" because of the halo and being in stasis.  It's possible that having the warden say that was Spielberg's way of suggesting the end wasn't what we thought.  It's also possible Spielberg had it right but later got cold feet when the ending wasn't happy--the closeups of Anderton's face after he was haloed and as he was being lowered into stasis, plus the dream quality of the end sequence of him with his pregnant wife and the pre-cogs on an isolated farm, would fit in to this theory--but they sure seemed to make it clear there was a happy ending.  <br/><br/>I highly recommend ""Ubik,"" ""Man in the High Castle,"" and ""The Collected Stories of Philip K. Dick,"" which is a five-volume collection of his short stories, to anyone who enjoyed this movie.  ""Blade Runner,"" ""Total Recall,"" and ""Screamers"" are other movies based on Dick stories, but with the exception of ""Screamers"" (an otherwise bad movie) they so butchered his original story it was virtually unrecognizable."

The difference is that the good ones work; the bad ones just confuse and strike you as phony while you're watching them. One of the most annoying aspects of this film is the incessant product plugs, particularly those of Gap, which will not even be around in 2054.

","I was excited to see this movie based on the rave previews.  I wanted so bad for it to be good since I braved the lines and annoying people in the theatre.  However, it was not the groundbreaking movie it is said to be. It closely resembled A.I. in appearance, the high-tech toys and dark cinematography.  The story here is not thought-provoking or new, it is basically another movie with a tortured cop with his own demons and a villain who is predictable.  The special effects were nice, but not necessarily new to the audience.  They are primarily in the form of cleverly featured product placement from the Gap, Lexus, and others.  The speeding cars and futuristic police chases reminded me a great deal of The Fifth Element with Bruce Willis.  There are many scenes that are unrealistic and conveniently include ""items"" or characteristics in the characters that allow them to work through a dilemma.  Society would never based a form of police power on some ""psychic friends"" or Miss Cleo would be President.  It was also too focused on producing gadgets to prove the movie was high-tech that it didn't make sense (like producing the wood engraved ball with the name of the criminal that looks like a lotto ball, when they already have recorded visuals of the crime and talking psychics).  It is an ""okay"" movie for entertainment but gadgets and interesting angles don't make up for the script."

He is a criminal genius who plans and details his murders oh so precisely.

This is such a simple, cliched way to ""catch"" a bad guy and has been done a million times.  Such unoriginaility.  He basically confessed.

","I didn't go in with the attitude to be critical but Spielberg made me critical because in some places he went nearly overboard with technological advances but totally ignored other things.<br/><br/>The cars and freeways looked like something we'll MAYBE see 100 years from now.  But in contrast do you really believe people will still be wearing glasses?  Would you be surprised that medical science still can't do anything about a minor bullet wound?<br/><br/>Homes looked basically identical to today (and I'm not even talking about today's ultra-modern designs) except for pretty much all having a wall that was a big screen tv and 3D projection and computer displays being basically a sheet of glass along with a few other fancy gadgets here & there.<br/><br/>
How about guns?  They had one cool ""sonic"" type gun in only one scene and we never saw that gun again.

The police had cool clothes but the rest of the people wore today's fashions.<br/><br/>Like I said I didn't want to be overly critical but when you create a lot of cool futuristic advances, the things you forget become glaring contradictions.  Compare a modern kitchen of today with one from 1940. Compare clothing from 1900 to that of 1960.  And as we know technological advances are happening faster & faster.<br/><br/>The story itself was okay but most of the group I went with predicted the ""bad guy"" fairly early on.

"UCB Agent1","5","1","2","24 June 2002"," One word: Overrated
","Minority Report is nothing more than an average, cliched whodunit, spruced up to take place in an semi-Orwellian Washington DC of 2052.  The movie is exceptional only in it's vision of the future.  Everything else is simply pedestrian, which you don't expect from Spielberg, which makes the movie that much more disapointing.<br/><br/>We all know the story, so I won't get into it.  I'll just comment on the problems.  The biggest are the massive plot holes that exist throughout the movie.  They are massive, and crucial to the plot, which is why the film cannot survive them.  One would think that Spielberg would have done something to cover them up, but they are in plain view for anyone to see.<br/><br/>Secondly, for a movie that is supposedly about big ideas, such as surveliance and privacy, surprisingly little is said about them.  They are mentioned, then glossed over.  What is shockingly absent is an explination for the way the future criminals that Cruise and his team catch are incarcerated.  Are they like the way they are forever, or what?  That would make for an interesting debate, but it is never brought up.<br/><br/>Finally, the ending is to typically Spielberg that it makes the movie even less relevant than it has become.  No big quesions (privacy wise)are answered, everything gets wrapped up in a neat little bow, and the movie just ends.  Again, like in AI, Spielberg can't commit to a dark ending like his biggest influence as of late, Stanley Kubrick.<br/><br/>The acting is fine, but the characters are one-dimensional, with the exception of Samantha Morton's Agatha, a Pre-cog.  The future vision is interesting, and a discussion about this future world compared to ours would be welcome.  However, this movie has no discussion.  It is a simple film, which is a shame.  Perhaps a more daring director than Spielberg should have been chosen.  He takes no risks here, and the film suffers.  For future visions, I'll stick with Blade Runner and 2001."

","When commenting Minority Report, everybody talks about Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise, but some people forget the real brain behind the film: Philip K. Dick. His great imagination created this little masterpiece, just as he did with Blade Runner and Total Recall, all great science-fiction movies. Minority Report joins his ""brothers"" with honors. It is better than Total Recall, but not yet a classic like Blade Runner (only time will tell). Spielberg did a great job creating the greatest action scenes of the year, and a script that takes the Philip K. Dick's universe closer to Agatha Christie's, and other mystery authors. The crew behind the movie took a little (but brilliant) tale written by Dick and extended it to 2 hours of mysteries and surprises. Tom Cruise is the same as usual, but it's great to see both of the richest names in Hollywood (Spielberg and Cruise) making an intelligent film.<br/><br/>I hope time brings justice to Minority Report, so people will recognize the masterpiece disguised as sci-fi blockbuster movie.<br/><br/>(sorry for the English mistakes!)"

","Minority Report had a lot to live up to for me, so perhaps I was building myself up for a bit of disappointment. I wanted it to forever banish A. I. from my mind. Now don't get me wrong - I really enjoyed the film and felt the the direction and main leads, Tom Cruise and Max Von Sydow, were excellent. The story was well constructed, although there were several plot holes that only really became apparent as we talked about it on the way home. For me the main problem was the last three quarters of an hour, where the pace was allowed to slip, and there was a little too much explaining being done. I'm sure Spielberg did this so as not to fall into the same trap as the original version of Blade Runner, also based on a Philip K Dick story, which proved to be baffling to a great deal of the audience. There was also some rather alarming similarities to the noir classic L. A. Confidential, which I won't give away here in case you haven't seen it.<br/><br/>Having said all this, I would still recommend this film, as it is a cut above the usual multiplex fare, and shows that after almost thirty years in the business, Spielberg is still a director full of suprises."

","Spielberg's latest film Minority Report has much going for it. It is loaded with amazing special effects that do not intrude on the story.  The story has intriguing and believable twists that leave the viewer guessing...at least about the mechanics of the crime if not the cause. It successfully shows us a world of fifty years hence that is neither as antiseptically clean as Gene Roddenberry's, nor as convincingly dark as Ridley Scott's.<br/><br/>Despite its positives, the film just barely passed the good-ole watch test.  Although I never actually looked at my watch, I was tempted.  Maybe a half hour to forty-five minutes less immersion into this future world would have improved the pace enough to keep the story energetically moving and to make me completely forget my watch.<br/><br/>The acting was not bad, but left fairly one-dimensional characters. Cruise had a few brief moments outside the box, but everyone else just did a good job portraying the one facet of their character that Spielberg wanted us to see.  These cardboard characters along with the length mired a great film, leaving behind one that was just above average.<br/><br/>Murder is not the killing of another human being.  It is the killing of another human being in a illegal fashion and under our system of justice can only be determined after due process.  The film demonstrates the importance of that distinction in a very dramatic way, but at the same time, the message may be too subtle for many viewers.  It should be a strong warning about today's cybercrime units that often fight crime using a philosophy similar to Anderton's precrime unit.<br/><br/>It did impact me in at least one other way.

The special effects are mostly seamless and there is some very original use of technology. The main character is faulty... a drug addict who likes to lose himself when not at work and that enhances the quality of the story. There are some good action sequences and a pretty good story that holds you for the entire movie. The non-essential characters are briefly seen interacting but for the most part the movie sticks to a handful of important characters (all well performed).<br/><br/>***MINOR SPOILER****<br/><br/>The not-so-good.<br/><br/>There is a development in the story very late in the movie that I felt was unnecessary and changed the movie from a classic to just a good movie. Instead of taking a huge leap and making it a powerful movie about not being able to change the future Spielberg takes the easy way out. After that the movie becomes about something else and kind of loses its power. Plus, there is one scene in the last few minutes of the movie that is never explained (where someone gains access to an area... without the access key ever being shown as given or access to the area being terminated as should be done via SOP). This final part could be a plot hole... or at least demands that the audience write their own scenario.<br/><br/>Other than that this movie works. It is not a movie I believe people will see over and over. It is good for a one time viewing but I am not sure how exciting it would be to see twice. None of the special effects are mind blowing and none of the action is effective enough for the audience to dream about seeing it again.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1 to 10 I would rate this movie a solid 8.

It's the kind of film you can enjoy even if you spot some of the flaws in the logic.<br/><br/>However, despite some of the ingredients that don't quite make sense, it's a thinking man's thriller and Steven Spielberg has produced it on a grand scale befitting a superior thriller of its kind. He's created a futuristic world that is full of larger than life plasma screens and the sort of technology that borders on the believable, given some of the advances already made today.<br/><br/>The premise of the story is even more disturbing since we live in the post-9/11 world where much debate has taken place over the government's right to interfere in citizen's private correspondence (via telephone, for example), while fear of rights being trampled have led to sharp policy differences between Democrats and Republicans. But this, of course, makes the story even more timely and intriguing.<br/><br/>TOM CRUISE gets to play his action hero role in more than a one-dimensional way and is quite convincing as the man on a strange mission to find the man he is destined to kill--unless he can prevent what the pre-cogs have predicted. And COLIN FARRELL and MAX VON SYDOW lend conviction to key supporting roles.<br/><br/>Furthermore, John Williams has written a busy score that magnifies the tension at every turn. <br/><br/>Summing up: Well worth viewing for sci-fi fans who want more than just action-filled, brain numbing excitement."

","So, Minority Report, a Spielberg film that came from the 2000s era. Here's the cold hard truth. No pretending, no illusions, no nostalgia blinding me this time. This movie, it sucks ass!<br/><br/>I'm sure it was praised when it came out, but this movie feels lousy. The reason I say that is the directing. The directing just feels so lacking. It seems that Spielberg wants to use the Phillip K Dick story to form an action thriller with complex themes but he never takes on a moral stance offered by the story and as such he doesn't deliver a story that has much meaning behind it. The movie should have taken a stance when it comes to whether we are free or unfree and stuck with it instead of trying to say both are possible. This movie leaves out the complexity of this subject matter and dumbs it down to the viewers by not exploring how Pre-Cog may be morally acceptable. In the original story by Phillip K Dick, Anderton kills a man to preserve Pre-Crime and keep the system intact since it would be the lesser of two evils. Unfortunately, this movie tries to give a very black and white scenario with big government vs little guy and therefore leaves out the complexity that made the story fantastic. It's just watered down to make way for another generic action movie. <br/><br/>Also, on a side note, the dialogue sounds like garbage! Almost every line is some pointless overdramatic philosophical rambling or insane techno-jargon that we just have to assume makes sense. It honestly reminded me of bad M Night Shyalaman writing.....I seriously mean that. <br/><br/>As for the action itself, it feels average. Nothing really stood out and though the CGI was okay it didn't seem that imaginative. Though the funniest scene was when that lady started beating the jetpack cop and Tom Cruise during that escape sequence. Tom Cruise is pretty much Tom Cruise, I cannot see him as anything else in this movie. There's just nothing remarkable about his character, it's as cliche as it can be. The girl he's with is like a boring version of Eleven from Stranger Things, and that is not a compliment. She's just empty. <br/><br/>It's really unsurprising why nobody remembers this movie. When one considers all the good movies Speilberg made before the 2000s and the massive successes they were, it makes me wonder why he didn't try to make anything remotely that awesome when it came to this movie. Minority Report but with Indiana Jones level action! How about that? Anything other than this. I feel like I listened to a bad philosophy lecture. <br/><br/>6/10 a disappointing flick."

","I used to think Tom Cruise couldn't act to save his life. Having seen ""Minority Report"", I now know better. He delivers a down-to-earth, realistic performance in a challenging role. Set in the future, in the year 2054, Cruise plays the chief of the Precrime Department. Basically, technology has evolved, and there is now a way to stop crimes from occurring. However, he falls victim to this ""perfect"" system when he himself is accused of committing a future crimeÂ… This is one of the most involving thrillers I have ever seen. The mystery behind the plot is rather cloudy at first, but once it starts to be explained, it becomes obvious who the perpetrator is. Collin Farrell (who was in ""Phone Booth"") delivers a solid performance as well, as does the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>Have I ever been disappointed by Spielberg? No, and for the record, I loved his unique portrayal of future times in Minority Report. Most films set in the future have a classic feel: the future looks nice and pretty on the outside, but underneath the surface, people are as disgruntled as ever. However, Spielberg doesn't go with any of that nonsense here. The colours are all dull, monochromatic, bleached out. The lighting is dark. It is a refreshingly bleak and hopeless outlook on the future.<br/><br/>In addition, Spielberg has the audience jump at all the wrong moments. No, perhaps I worded that poorly. What I meant was: oftentimes, the audience thinks Cruise is in danger, when in reality, there's nothing to worry about. Meanwhile, when the audience should be on the edge of their seat, Spielberg does nothing of the sort. It'll make sense when you see it.<br/><br/>Combine grand special effects, another amazing score by John Williams, strong performances, and Spielberg's capable direction, and you get a great movie."

Superb visuals and a push and pull of the pace that never lets the movie fall into any long dull parts or unnecessary drawn out action sequences make this a thoroughly entertaining film. The plot twists fit well with the other parts of the movie creating a mildly intellectually stimulating movie. While the twists may seem to be predictable for some, the twists are for creating an engrossing plot rather than just for the shock factor. I thoroughly recommend this movie beginning to end."

","Tom Cruise is the star of ""Minority Report,"" a 2002 film from Steven Spielberg. Max von Sydow, Colin Farrell, Samantha Morton, Steve Harris, Lois Smith, Neal McDonough and Jessica Capshaw also star. Cruise is John Anderton, a futuristic cop at a time when murders can be prevented by being predicted ahead of time by three precogs. When the precogs see him kill someone he doesn't know, he attempts to find out who has set him up and why and keep the murder from happening.<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" has a clever script beautifully handled by Spielberg. (The title refers to a report generated when all three precogs don't have the same vision of events.) Some of the effects are awesome, and one can easily see them becoming realities in the future. Newspaper headlines change before your eyes, disks are in the form of holograms, the images that the precogs see are projected, and the police see the whole event by moving their hands around the screen. People travel using jet packs. Everyone is identified by retinal scans. In one scene, Anderton, on the run from his own unit, has his eyes removed and new ones inserted so he can go around without being recognized. He is also given something that can place under his chin and dramatically alter his face for a very short time. There are some very exciting and tense scenes, as well as some poignant ones - Anderton goes home at night and puts a hologram into the computer that brings back his dead son. His vulnerability in that area will bring him more grief.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very unusual, giving the film its own special look. There are tributes throughout to film noir and Kubrick.<br/><br/>This is a thrilling film with excellent performances, with Samantha Morton a standout as Agatha, the most sensitive precog, who is kidnapped by Anderton to help him uncover the truth. She is amazing. I am not always impressed by Tom Cruise. As an actor, he is somewhat external; however, it works very well in this type of slick film. Von Sydow is always good. And it was wonderful to see handsome Neal McDonough of Boomtown. Lois Smith has one big scene, and she comes off as both eccentric and mysterious.<br/><br/>The future may be closer than we think. Don't miss this provocative, suspenseful and disturbing film from one of the great cinematic masters."
"view_and_review","8","1","3","16 May 2007"," Maybe the best of 2002
","Minority Report was creative genius. I saw the movie in theater back in '02 and I was thoroughly pleased. I thought that Minority Report was one of, if not the best movie of '02. It was a spectacular blend of Sci-Fi, cutting edge technology, and crime mystery. This was definitely one of those movies that cause you to think and have you replaying every minute fact in your head to see what was the key to it all. Even to this day I continue to think, ""How did John Anderton (Tom Cruise) get into the position of being wanted for murder?"" Hear my stance if it makes sense and then you will see the crux of my dilemma.<br/><br/>The three oracles can see murders that happen in the future and they can see a premeditated murder up to 36 hours in advance. Now, they saw John Anderton committing a premeditated murder, hence the prediction ball with John's name on it dropped. John was the first to see the ball, and as a result he fled the precinct and began his quest to find the person he was supposed to kill. <br/><br/>I think this is a classic case of the chicken or the egg theory. I say that John doesn't even get put into the position of killing if it weren't for the prognostication. The vision set the ball into motion (both figuratively and literally). The prophecy caused John to seek out the potential victim in order for him to clear his name, which means the vision played an active role in the murder not a passive one. Unless, the vision was of what would have happened even if there existed no oracles. Meaning that John would have found and killed the contracted victim without the helpful guidance of the three oracles.<br/><br/>In that case the person to be John's victim most likely would have had to seek John out, or make himself painfully obvious as the person who kidnapped John's son in order for John to kill him. But, the whole set up never looked like the contracted victim was ever going to seek John out, but rather just ostentatiously have his prolific pedophile profile spread out for John to see once John found him. Do you follow me at all?<br/><br/>Still, this movie was excellent even if this one crucial concept continues to boggle my mind."
"jeremy3","7","1","3","3 May 2007"," Tom Cruise role that is not annoying
","About 50% of Tom Cruise's roles are annoying extensions of his personality. However, this one was not one of those. It was a straight acting role by Tom Cruise. He was not ""superhuman"", although he did have some pretty incredible escapes. Cruise plays the manager of the Pre-Crimes Division in 2054. In 2054, people are found guilty and punished for a crime before they can commit them. The politicians of the future love this, because DC has zero murders. There are these three people - one female, two male who are kept in a pool in a semi-conscious state. They are able to predict crimes before they happen. Max Von Sydow plays the big boss, who pretends to be his friend. Colin Ferrell plays the young idealist Assistant DA, who thinks that he can come crashing in on the program and find flaws. Unbeknownst to him, Von Sydow's character betrays Cruise's character. He ends up being himself the subject of a manhunt. Allegedly, he is to kill someone he hasn't even met. The movie is not quite as good as Gattaca or Bladerunner, but Spielberg does a good job keeping a tight, entertaining plot. I would say a 7.6 out of 10."
"DavidSim240183","9","1","3","25 April 2007"," Spielberg's gritty, hard edged SF thrill-fest
","Minority Report was nominated best film of 2002 by quite a few film critics. Although I think that honour surely goes to the underrated SF film Cypher, Steven Spielberg's MR ranks highly in his film repertoire. Its intelligent science-fiction. A rare thing these days. It provides a fascinating view of our possible future (or futures). And Spielberg draws out a strong, commanding performance from Tom Cruise.<br/><br/>In 2054, the crime rates of Washington DC have all but vanished. Thanks to the PreCrime Division. Its a special bureau where with the aid of three psychics (called PreCogs), they can predict a crime about to take place before it even occurs. The opening sequences quite ingeniously draws us into this process, in the case of a man about to kill his adulterous wife and her partner.<br/><br/>John Anderton (Cruise) is one of PreCrime's top detectives. While identifying possible crimes about to happen, he gives the impression of a conductor leading an orchestra. Moving his arms about majestically, focused intently on numerous video screens, he pinpoints names, places and times with unnerving accuracy.<br/><br/>PreCrime has proved so successful that the Government wants it expanded into all cities. Not just Washington. But Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell) of the Justice Department is convinced the system is flawed. And its only a matter of time before the cracks start to show themselves. John doesn't agree. He has complete confidence in the system. At least he does, until the next crime the PreCog's foresee is a murder committed by...John himself!<br/><br/>With less than 36 hours before the murder occurs, John must go on the run from the bureau he once admired to discover the truth. And see if its true. To see if John is about to kill somebody he doesn't even know.<br/><br/>Minority Report must rank as one of Spielberg's most intelligently crafted films to date. Granted when creating the Washington of the future, he's taken a leaf or two out of Blade Runner's book with enormous animated advertising billboards and the like, but he really has outdone himself in terms of set-design.<br/><br/>I'm not really sure where to begin when describing how the city looks. Because there is so much to see and hear, it's actually a little hard to recall. Some moments that spring to mind are the vertically inclined highways for cars of the future, but the best way to experience Spielberg's superb flights of imagination is by watching the film itself.<br/><br/>Also, screenwriters Jon Cohen and Scott Frank have really placed a superb and masterfully intricate screenplay at Spielberg's disposal. They may have been inspired by Raymond Chandler, but there's a finite sense of paranoia running through the film. Some of the dialogue is beautifully constructed around some tough moral dilemmas for Cruise's character. Not to mention the fact it raises some fascinating ethical viewpoints.<br/><br/>If we actually had a process for learning the identities of future murderers, and they were stopped, than is it ethically right to imprison them for crimes they never committed? Or mind-bending conceits like trying to stop a future event may be the very thing that sets it in motion. Its nice to see a SF film that actually makes you think in this day and age.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see that Spielberg has started to come out of juvenile wish fulfilment fantasies like ET and Hook. With his transition into the 21st Century, he started with AI which was initially promising, but Spielberg got lost somewhere along the way with that film. With Minority Report, he has redeemed himself considerably. This is a much grittier and downbeat Spielberg film than any of his others so far. Even things like sexuality and drug abuse crop up. There may be hope for him yet!<br/><br/>Still this being a Spielberg film, there are the customary family values and parental issues that are always ever present in whatever he gets his hands on. John was a man who lost his son and this has left him a broken man. Spielberg ties this into John's dilemma, which makes the final revelations a little disappointing, but not enough to ruin the film as a whole.<br/><br/>Spielberg is still a master of action and he stages some fantastic set-pieces. I love the moment when Cruise has to hide in bathwater from these mechanical spiders. They comb the building searching for him, and the way the camera hovers overhead on the different apartments and the people in them, it reminded me of Rear Window.<br/><br/>The one scene I loved is when John kidnaps one of the PreCogs, Agatha, for help. They're being chased by PreCrime at the time, and she foresees their methods so they know exactly what to do to avoid them. Its brilliantly directed. And funny too!<br/><br/>Minority Report is a thrilling piece of entertainment. It all works on the level of a beautifully unfolding puzzle. Towards the end, the pace flags a little, but its still superb entertainment. And the final closing shot is a scene of such wonderful depth perception it makes MR worth seeing for this one moment alone."

","At the start of it all, I had put this film off due to a number of things. For starters, it seemed as though it was going to be another Mission Impossible type film, that and I highly disliked Tom Cruise. However, after some time when I was at my father's selecting a few movies of his to take home and watch, I decided since it had such good ratings, I might as well give it an opportunity to impress me, after all, a movie I had watched just a week before staring Cruise, another which I had also put off, was The Last Samurai, and it was absolutely fantastic. Anyhow, this film took a new level on both crime dramas and sci-fi. It was an original idea with a comfortable, familiar feel to it that kept you drawn. The storyline is addictive and impressive, with a relatively surprising ending, as well as good. The entire movie is just terrific. I'd recommend this to just about anyone looking for a good movie.

BUT what bugged me most were the many glaring lapses of logic, and one in particular that will necessitate a SPOILER to explain (below).<br/><br/>OK, Cruise is on the run--formerly a government cop, now a wanted man, considered a top criminal by the all powerful government. The most common means of identification in the future (apparantly)is the retinal scan. Everything requires a retinal scan. They always know what you're doing and where you are via the retinal scans of your eyes. SO, Cruise has his eyes removed and replaced in order to make it harder for the government to ID and find him by a retinal scan. Got that? OK. Now, after his eye transplant, Cruise wants to sneak back into his old super-secret, high security government controlled lab. So, what does he do? He brings his original eyes with him in a jar and uses them in the retinal scanner in order to get entry.<br/><br/>DID YOU GET THAT?<br/><br/>Do you get how stupid that is? HE HAD HIS EYES REMOVED FOR THE EXPRESS PURPOSE OF NOT ALERTING THE GOVERNMENT TO HIS WHEREABOUTS WHEN HE HAS TO USE A RETINAL SCANNING DEVICE!!! I MEAN, HAVING DIFFERENT EYES WAS THE WHOLE POINT--WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE IF HE'S CARRYING THEM IN A JAR OR THEY'RE STILL IN HIS SKULL? IT'S THE STUPIDEST THING EVER!<br/><br/>DON'T YA THINK THE POWERS THAT BE WOULD HAVE REVOKED HIS SECURITY PRIVALIGES ONCE HE BECAME A TOP CRIMINAL? Or, at the very least don't ya think that once the retinal pattern of the most wanted man in the country showed up on the grid that the omnipotent government would then rush to the scene?<br/><br/>It's this kind of complete disregard for even the simplest logic that convinced me that Spielberg needs to just stay away from Science Fiction all together. <br/><br/>All in all--very slick, but also very sloppy.

","Steven Spielberg's science fiction thriller (based on a short story by Philip K. Dick) is overlong and dry with plot holes too glaring to avoid and with twists so easy to anticipate that all the suspense bleeds out. Tom Cruise (competent in a role tailored to his limitations) plays a cop in a future Washington D.C. who heads a unit that, based on the visions of three seeming autistics, prevents murders before they can occur; when he's implicated in a future murder, the chase begins. The first section is full of didactic bluster as Cruise and a theologian-turned-Justice Department investigator (Colin Farrell, quite good, reminiscent of a young Treat Williams) hash out the moral and spiritual implications of a government preventing acts of free will--a political topic Hollywood superpowers such as Spielberg love to bellow mightily about--and for a while `Minority Report' seems like it's going to be good paranoid fun. But around the time Cruise is forced to go on the lam, Spielberg eschews the philosophizing in favor of run of the mill (if expertly done) chases and fights; when he finally returns to his theme at the end, it seems distant and an afterthought--too much time has elapsed for the earlier discussions to retain any power. With Max von Sydow as Cruise's boss, Samantha Morton as the most important clairvoyant and, in a very funny cameo as an illegally-practicing surgeon, Peter Stormare. The garish, backlit cinematography is by Spielberg's longtime collaborator, Janusz Kaminski."

What is it when people rate a film not on its own merit, but by who makes it.  Same applies  to Gangs of new York.  Minority Report does not have any of the paranoia that is the trademark of Dick.

"RIK-22","5","1","3","16 August 2002"," Nice Fx, but very weak sci-fi
","If anyone has read any of my other reviews for Spielberg films, they will know I am far from a fan.  For me he is the McDonalds of filmmaking.  Quick, simplistic, formulaic story telling, no variety or depth in what he is showing.  I liked Raiders and Indiana J as I was growing up and I still love Jaws, but since then I don't believe he has moved on.  What disturbed me was not so much the success, but the acclaim he received.  Let's be honest, to be successful in Hollywood (i.e. make money) to have to make films with mass appeal you have to make movies that are very bland, so they will appeal to as many people as possible.  That's fine, as long as people respect that it's just tat at the end of the day.<br/><br/>What seems to have happened with the last couple of films (A.I. and now Minority Report) is that people are starting to realise that Mr S, is a one trick pony.  <br/><br/>Minority Report, isn't terrible, but it's very far from great, the story is ok and some of the concepts could have made an excellent Sci-Fi movie, but with SS at the helm it's dragged down to the lowest level.  Personally I don't like Tom Cruise as a action lead, he's small and looks like Pee-wee Herman could give him a fight, yet he is able to beat up and fight numerous well trained policeman.  The very stupid part to this was the way the Cruise character could jump through windows, walls, etc, without even so much as a scratch.<br/><br/>The plot holes are also massive, if these people could see into the future then they would be able to see all the events that took place.  Why couldn't they see that Burgess was going to murder Witwer.  The fact that one of them wasn't there in the present time shouldn't make any difference.  The eyeball thing was very stupid, as many have pointed out, John's security access would have been removed immediately and also the fact the eyes were effectively dead.  Also, if they could discover someone's identity from the Pre-cogs surely then they could find out where they live, without having to guess the house.<br/><br/>Anyway, the special FX, are nice and plenty of them, there's a lot of action, but otherwise a poor film, 5/10."

","Steven Spielberg's ""Minority Report"", like his equally under-achieving ""A.I.: Artificial Intelligence"", loses its way late and the all-world director proves once again that he is beginning to have trouble knowing when to punch the stop button. It is the not-too-distant-future and crimes have become a thing of the past as a new system has been developed to prevent crimes before they occur. Max von Sydow is the mastermind behind the so-called flawless system and Tom Cruise leads the special task force of police officers. However when Cruise becomes the man to commit a murder, he becomes determined to show that he has been somehow set up by snooping FBI man Colin Farrell and that the possibility of him committing a murder is ludicrous. Naturally a whole host of twists of turns will occur as Cruise does his best Harrison Ford in ""The Fugitive"" imitation to clear his name and find out the real truth. The screenplay sputters way too much for the film to be a complete success. Spielberg's direction starts out strong, but he soon too becomes a bit overwhelmed by the whole project it seems. Cruise does a good job here, but he gets little support from the rest of the cast and soon he seems a bit out-of-place as the film progresses. Colin Farrell though does an excellent job here as he is easily the film's greatest plus. He adds depth and interest to the film when he is on screen, but to be honest his screen-time is not near enough. Spielberg continues to try to copy techniques used by Stanley Kubrick and when he does this the whole project eventually collapses. This was true with ""A.I."" and it is true once again with ""Minority Report"". 4 stars out of 5."

This is just one example of the many brilliant ideas Spielberg created while in his ""think tank"", to which he invited many prominent scientists and futurists. The special effects in this movie put those of Spider - Man and Episode III to shame, not because of how much cgi there is, but how it is used. Spielberg is a technical wizard but knows that special effects are just a way to enhance his vision, and that the real meat of a film is characters and plot. Minority Report is a masterful work which is deserving of the millions it is sure to make at the box office."
"chrisbrown6453","9","1","3","23 June 2002"," How can I put this into words? Well, for starters, Steven Spielberg never ceases to amaze me. How's that? Say what you will about his films, choices, decisions and career but that's my story and I'm sticking
","***SPOILERS***   ***SPOILERS*** Getting the introductions out of the way, it is 2054 in Washington D.C. and Tom Cruise plays, John Anderton, a Precrime enforcement detective who heads up a crack team specializing in preventing murders before they occur, also arresting criminals before they kill. Out of the loop, the cops come calling in the form of Colin Farrell's character, Detective Witwer who backs Anderton into a corner, seizing control of the experimental operation and taking control of Precrime's affairs. Through the minds of three precognitive and abnormally gifted youths who, when asleep, dream only of murder in technologically projected second sight, Anderton sees his own criminal fate and sets out to alter his unknown predestination.<br/><br/>
Estranged from his wife and a father struggling to cope with the disappearance of his son, Anderton seeks a temporary high in the dark world of illegal street drugs but when his murderous number comes down the pipe, both the law and Precrime chart a course for his apprehension before he kills. In a highly advanced and technologically sound society, Anderton goes on the run in search of the truth behind the world's most advanced crime unit and a precognitive flaw in its design know as a ""Minority Report.""<br/><br/>
After seeing the trailers, I immediately thought A.I. (Artificial Intelligence) meets Mission Impossible and, for the most part, that's exactly what it is. However, it's much more the former rather than latter. Although I'm still spinning from the theatrical experience, I essentially see Minority Report as an extension of Spielberg's previous Kubrick inspired interpretation. Visually interchangeable with both worlds in its visual presentation, Minority Report most definitely shares the same headspace as A.I... which isn't a bad thing at all. Based on a short story by acclaimed science fiction writer Philip K. Dick, the underlying subtext is equally complex as the film looms heavy in theme, tackling such debatable issues as divinity versus science, the right to life, God's will, man's innate feeling of superiority, and our preoccupation with technology.<br/><br/>Visually, Minority Report is awesome. Although this similarity may seem strange, it's very much a case of the future catching up with the past, as Steven Spielberg is most certainly the Tiger Woods of filmmaking. You'd tend to think people get soft as they grow older but with regard to Spielberg's last two films, the director continues to, not only, challenge himself with complex subject matter but also reinvent himself as a director at the same time. Hell, amid the dazzling imagery and computer-generated eye-candy, Spielberg even takes to a few-held shots, jumping back into the days of Guerilla filmmaking to set the appropriate tone.<br/><br/>Set fifty-two years ahead of us in 2054, the seamless blend of CGI used to create the future Washington is staggering and strikingly impressive. Unlike many preceding and recent science fiction films, Minority Report is a unique identity all to its own. In creating such an invigorating visual world, as previously mentioned, Spielberg's vision is very similar to A.I. in both structure and spacecraft, but the limitations of the film's 21st Century setting only helps to demystify the unknown, making society much more familiar while also giving the audience an identifiable future to look into. All cityscapes and highway sequences are both astonishing and highly innovative, somehow proving to push the envelope of the science fiction genre itself.<br/><br/>Much to my surprise and Spielberg's credit, the film sticks religiously (no symbolic reference intended) to Anderton's immediate world, which of course is filled with a lot of cool eye candy and technologically advanced gadgetry. A very creative look at what the future may have in store for us, society is ripe with eye identification scanners and interactive advertising (which is very cool). including song and dance cereal box characters that look a lot like those Mini-Wheat guys. A hot topic especially in the last decade, holographic imagery comes to life, preserving Anderton's family memories in transparent 3-D files. To say the least, Spielberg has crafted a very dark but believable future with a grounded sense of realism that's not too far fetched given some of today's strides in modern advancement.<br/><br/>
Having proven himself to be more than just a pretty face with performances in Jerry Maguire and Magnolia, Tom Cruise is rock solid in the role of Precrime specialist, John Anderton. One of the more appealing aspects of the film is seeing Cruise jump into the skin of a tortured drug addicted cop on the run. certainly a nice break from the safe confines of superstar status. Although Cruise maximizes the role's potential, unfortunately, he's also bound by the film's pacing. In certain scenes when sympathetic emotional intent is clear, the film's fast paced storyline doesn't give Cruise time enough to shine, or the audience occasion to feel his pain. In addition to momentum, the story also suffers from certain logical loopholes with regard to the entire concept of ""Precrime,"" leaving many unanswered questions when reflecting back on the plot, which could be interpreted as justification for such a fast paced adrenaline ride.<br/><br/>Spoiler Alert<br/><br/>My main problem with Minority Report is the the film, at least the idea of it, should have never happened.  We've run into this problem before with movies such as Terminator 2 and Back to the Future.  Here's the problem; Anderton would have never went to kill Crowe had he not seen it in the Precrime room.  But the Precogs show it to him as if he had planned it. That's another thing; the precogs only give an ample amount of time to catch these `murderers' when there is premeditation.  In the opening scene, we are explained that when there is no premeditation, there is little time to stop there murders from happening.  Assuming that Anderton didn't see his crime, and also assuming that Anderton was thrust into a position where he was face to face with Crowe, there would have been no premeditation.  My problem is, again, Anderton would have never went to find (and kill) Crowe had he not seen it happen.  So it would have never happened therefore never been shown to him. As much as I enjoyed Minority Report, the film left me bruised with a few bumps on the head after my theater chair also served as an ejection seat which, at times, launched me out of the movie to the roof, then back again. Believe me, too much exposition hurts. However, with a supporting cast that includes the great Max von Sydow as Precrime Director Burgess, Colin Farrell, Steve Harris from ABC's The Practice, Tim Blake Nelson, Samantha Morton and a slew of highly recognizable cameos, Minority Report isn't soft in the acting department.<br/><br/>At times, Minority Report also upholds a level of class and orchestral dignity as Anderton also serves as a visual conductor to John Williams' haunting, mysterious and heart pounding score via visual precognition. With famed cinematographer Janusz Kaminski working his magic, Minority Report's presentation is second to none in visual appearance. From this reviewer's perspective, Minority Report represents a new benchmark in the science fiction genre in subject matter and visual appeal. I admire the places Spielberg is willing to explore as a director. Sure, he could make ""E.T. 2"" but instead, he chooses to take on challenging films such as this. Simply put, Minority Report is an impressive visual extravaganza that takes the mind on a cerebral action packed ride into the future."

","If you suffer from insomnia and really need some sleep, then congratulations! You don't have to take sleeping pills anymore. Instead, you can watch the first half of this film, ""Minority Report"", which is extremely slow and sufficiently boring to make you sleep. All the digressions and flashbacks only shatter the main plot, and render the film rather unfocused. You only know what ""minority report"" means after the one hour mark."

I know it was supposed to be like a futurist society, but seriously, it seemed more like a parody than something the audience can think deeper about it. Boring, dull, stupid. Also 2054 won't be like that lol."

Lame effects with those gliding-flying self-driving round cars. Didn't we see that back in the 30's and 50's sci-fi flicks? 70 years later, but cars are still not flying, still need a driver, still burning gasoline. In 2054 people will watch this pop-culture brainless waste of time and laugh at us. Time travel or future prediction is a fascinating idea, but Mr. Spielberg is too small-minded and uncultured to show us something truly original and innovative. The best they can do, are jet-packs (has been done 1000 times), Plexiglas video screens (done 100 times) and gliding self-driving cars (done 10,000 times). ...BORING!!!!!!!!!!!"
"Hunky Stud","8","1","4","6 March 2007"," Where are the minorities?
","when I watched the production documentary, especially when the computer animation department were doing their screen review, it seems that all the workers were Caucasians . Where are the ""intelligent"" ""smart"" Asian engineers, animators, etc? And if I remember it clearly, it seems that everyone who is in charge of those individual departments are Caucasians. Are Asian Americans not capable of managing any of those departments? <br/><br/>That made me to think further, how come there was not any major Asian actors in this movie? In the year of 2050, Washington DC seems to have only two races, whites and blacks. I don't want to accuse anyone being racist, however, it just doesn't seem to be right. After all, Hollywood is located right in Los Angeles, where Asian population is very big. They actually had meetings with all kinds of scientists talking about what kind of things, weapons people will use in 2050, how can the director, casting director forget to mention about the race issue in 2050? Ever since Jesse jackson protested during one Oscar event, we now constantly see black actors being nominated and won Oscar awards. Just because Asians do not protest, that does not mean that Hollywood movies should ignore the Asian race, especially for a movie that is set in the future when Asian population will be even bigger.<br/><br/>Why are those three precogs all Caucasian, and the female actor was not even a US citizen. Are they willingly agreed to be put in the water tank for the rest of their lives? And if this thing goes national, where are they going to get other precogs for all other cities? And when they die, where are they going to find the new precogs? <br/><br/>Overall, this is a entertaining movie to watch, but it has its logical flaws."
"parhat","1","1","4","7 October 2005"," Great Technically Fails on Logic
","Warning, Spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>O.K. I watched this movie over 50 times and I still can't make sense of the story. If I turn off my logic, then it is an enjoyable film.<br/><br/>Now let us see, why need a cop if you know the future you can prevent a crime from happening by just stopping ahead of time instead of actual arrest? For example I am planning to go to a shopping mall where a murderer is waiting to kill me. Police warned me weeks ahead of time so I changed my schedule. The police grabs the potential murderer telling him we have to fine you because you were planning to murder. If next time you think of doing this again, we will put you in jail. So you save prison costs. Now remember, these pre-cogs can predict events far into the future, not minutes or seconds, but the next day. How do I know that? The movie said so! They predicted events one day ahead while they were treated at the hospital.<br/><br/>The plots that really gets me sick is Agatha, if she is so psychic how come she won't tell John Anderton that Ann Lively is her mother and the police chief is the murderer. She should be able to tell can't she? Or she can't remember her mother? How can even John Anderton ever figure out Agatha is the daughter of Ann Lively? There is no part in the story that reveals that fact? O.K. let us be forgiving about Agatha and assume she knows nothing, she don't even know that the police chief murdered Ann Lively. Now how can that be? O.K. Echo. Well, why don't Agatha tell them those are not ""echo"" they are different. Why does Agatha even bothered working for pre-cog? What happens if she dies of heart attack, won't the entire pre-crime police be relying on one woman just a bit too much? Or do they have a low quality neroine in the works to make more of these ""Agathas"" and kill more innocent children. Sounds like a catch-22, kill more people to save more people? What a circular logic! Why won't Agatha file a misconduct to police department in censoring her on the account of her ""minority report"" and that the pre-cogs are fallible! What is wrong with Agatha? Why bother tell John Anderton's son, when he is already dead????? Is she so fallible, I mean super fallible, so fallible it makes me shame especially in the final seen when police head commit suicide, completely wrong! Now assuming that these pre-cogs have pretty good, as opposed to always perfect in prediction you can make use of their talents. Instead of arresting since you are uncertain a crime will take place because these silly pre-cogs are only 50% right, you can still get a crime reduction by 50% through prevention. How? Suppose a potential rapist which the pre-cog predicts will take place at Hyde Park on 3.00 p.m. They are only 50% correct. So the police goes to Hyde Park at 3.00 p.m. The rapist seeing that changes his mind and quit because the police warned him that he may rape someone so they slapped him with a record of warnings. That is enough to just make him think twice.<br/><br/>The other issues I have with this movie is what happens with your ID if you have no eyes. Remember the person who sell John Anderton clarity? He had no eyes. For me it seems the ""chip"" implant that the U.S. government currently proposing as part of the ID of all people in U.S. makes more sense than to use eyeball ID! Another silly analogies that I really hate in the movie is when John Anderton throws the wooden ball to the other end where the other guy from the Justice department receives and said something like ""predetermination!"" Well I would feign a throw a ball to Lt. John Anderton back and throw it in such a away that he can't catch him and I would yell back ""free will!"" What about free will? Didn't that element existed even before the final scenes when the pre-cogs made a terrible price by making the predictions wrong.<br/><br/>The other part that incensed me is where the police chief kills the son of John Anderton to ""set him up"" in some distance the future. It would have been much easier, assuming the head knows John Anderton could be a headache in the future by just transferring him to another division. Give him a good excuse, tell him his son may be kidnapped if he work for this unit! I mean this crime is way too elaborate! If Agatha truly hates to see the future she could make a wrong prediction on purpose and cause the pre-crime units to be closed for business. There is just a lot of loose holes in the story so many that I will just leave this for now. I mean where is the job satisfaction in lying on water all day and all night? Isn't that slavery or something? Wouldn't your body get swell or rot or something? I give 1 star for cool cars."

I can't believe that the great Steven Spielberg directed this.Sue he did a nice job and John Williams score was neat but this film just is too much.I said out loud that's so stupid when this dumb scene appeared and that one scene I'm talking about is when Tom Cruise just got those eye implants several hours later he is at that door and he must use his old eyes via take them out of the bag and scan them or one of them to enter. Next thing you know he drops them and you hear the old squishing sound of them being dropped and we have the pleasure seeing them roll on down the floor and he runs after them and one falls into the sewer and he catches the one by the socket! Yes, I say again he grabbed it by the socket!How disgusting can you be? I want to know how this neat looking but dumb film got on the IMDb top 250: #131? Max Von Sydow is a great actor and he is one of the best actors ever but his talents are wasted here. Sure the role he played was good and he played it well what he was given but even he couldn't save this film. Again I can't believe Spielberg was a part of this. HE could have made another Indiana Jones or something I mean lets face it people wouldn't you want to see another Indiana Jones film instead of the garbage that is the Manurety Report? Just because the film is directed by Spielberg doesn't make it a good film. If haven't seen it yet then please don't see it but if you do see it expect a hard to follow story/plot and stupid things to happen.Avoid it and see something else that Spielberg did right like any of the Indiana Jones films or Jaws to name a couple!

"Vinny-28","1","1","4","17 December 2002"," A Missed Opportunity
","This film is a tragic miscalculation when you know the source material, and what could have been.  A story that should have been about facing your destiny, changing your future, fate and loss gets tossed out of the window so that we can watch good guy Tom Cruise catch the evil Max Von Sydow. Imagine the variety of good endings we could have had:  the precog yelling at Cruise ""You can change your future!"" as Cruise instead chooses to kill the man who murdered his son.  Or perhaps we go with the hopeful ending: Cruise lowers his weapon, and arrests the man instead.  The end.  Or perhaps we really explore the issues raised by pre-crime, and end the film with our human ideals of fairness and justice being more important to us than a ""foolproof"" system.  These and many others could have given us a film that really meant something.  Instead we have a convoluted plot with too many characters, too many gagdets, a tone all over the map--from brooding to goofy ""funny"" action--a hodge-podge that plays like a sci-fi film of the eighties.  All of it building up to the end of the evil Max Von Sydow. The short story had a point:  There never was a ""Majority Report"" for Anderton, because he saw his future--and the fact that he saw his future made every majority report he witnessed a ""Minority Report.""  This was clearly not grasped by the makers of this film, who thought it much better to replace this conceptual twist with the idea that you could ""beat"" pre-crime by performing a copy-cat murder.  Sorry guys, that's clever in and of itself...but don't you see that a story like this should never be ""about"" the pre-crime system?  Rather, the concept should be used as metaphor to discuss and elaborate on questions of fate.  By making a film that finally ends with the bad guy being found out and the pre-crime system being shut down, you shoot yourselves in the foot.  It's a loaded deck.  Who cares?! What we need to see in a film like this is the human dimension, the tragedy, the sacrifice, the intangibility of true justice.  When you give us a Spielberg happy ending, you blow it.  This is a missed opportunity on one of the best potential sci-fi film concepts around.  What a shame."

This film had serious flaws that I could not overlook.  For example, what kind of database would be developed where the programmer would have overlooked the need to lock out known criminals/(former police officer) from the police station entryways; when everywhere else, he is immediately recognized.  Ah.  Too far of a leap of imagination for me.  In addition, how stupid, lame brained does hollywood think that we are?  We are basically spoonfed and led by the hand the whole way through the movie.  I knew in the first 5 minutes that the old guy was behind all the trouble.  There was about as much unexpected occurances in this movie as one finds in a Goosebumps book. Actually, I enjoyed the goosebumps movies better.  This movie was almost as bad as the Matrix.  What is happening to us?

"Antony-4","4","1","4","11 August 2002"," Really pretty bad
","The thing I found most surprising about this movie is that Spielberg directed it. This is just not up to his standards. Cruise does a decent job but there really isn't anything that can make this film believable.<br/><br/>I was kind of worried that the film would present a possible future where everything is watched, monitored and recorded, like 1984. Then I suppose they could assign probabilities to future actions and prevent crimes before they happen, as was the subject of an Asimov short story.<br/><br/>Thankfully they chose a completely impossible, ridiculous psychic imaging prediction instead. Look people, I hate to make life a little more mundane for you, but there are no psychic abilities, they are completely impossible and there is nothing to worry about from any con artist pretending to ascertain your future. If they weren't impossible, someone would be able to walk off with James Randi's $1000000 prize (see www.randi.org).<br/><br/>So, anyway, I'm glad they didn't make the movie too realistic or present an actual possible future because the movie is depressing enough as it is. I can't imagine how awful the world would be to actually have popup ads that knew who you were everywhere you go. Think about it. Would you actually want streaming advertisements everywhere you look? Should we allow that to happen to our society?<br/><br/>The movie wasn't all bad, Max von Sydow was good as usual. The stunt/special effects work was decent, if rather pale in comparison to some of the other movies coming out lately (LoTR).<br/><br/>But the worst thing was the plot, which really couldn't be saved by any effect or actor. I think the whole thing was meant to make people realize that we have to get control of our essential freedoms and how the government and purveyors of trivia like the media companies are trying to not only control but actually ruin our lives. I hope that the people who lost 140 minutes of their lives watching this turkey can get something back out of it in the realization that we can prevent the destruction of our freedom.<br/><br/>Please people, don't let the message go unnoticed. If you let the evil people out there continually take your freedoms away, we'll end up with a horrid world like the one presented in Minority Report."

","I went to see this film with not that great of expectations, it's reviews were flat out good across the board (something that still distresses me), but I was still skeptical of this seemingly (and truly) quintessential ""popcorn summer flick."" A lot of the film is glossed over, lacking any true backbone, and replacing it with amazing visuals and poorly paced action sequences. The main weakness in the film is the direction by Spielberg (not surprising considering the director, less Saving Private Ryan and more AI), he seems to not be able to make up his mind about what this movie is, at times making it purely a serious science fiction thriller, but then throwing in bits of slapstick humor (which proved to be quite painful and did lessen the movie overall) and mystery (Which was both predictable after a certain point and poorly acted out by von Sydow).  The main problems that I have with it is the fact that Spielberg has cheapened the overall product quite a bit with just a few bad scenes. It's not all bad however, the acting is well done, mostly by Cruise, and the cinematography is probably the strongest part of the entire movie with several well set up shots that heightened the action sequences (brought down by their own terrible pacing and attempted humor). As a whole though, I think the movie could've been done a lot better if Spielberg had just tried to make a good movie on his own terms instead of a movie that would essentially please the audience, which it's done quite well apparently. If you're looking for nothing more than a cheap thrill, Minority Report provides well; I would not hope for much more however, as there is little behind Spielberg's visual facade."

The setup of the story takes quite a bit of time in the beginning of the movie, around 1 hour or so. This partly is also the reason why the running time of the movie is on the long side.<br/><br/>The environment where the movie is set tries to present a prediction on how urban living in the future would look like. Strong contrasts can be seen, some scenes are very much on the scifi side where as other scenes are very much on ""nothing has changed"" side. On top of that each of the main characters in the movie are presented with strong personalities which creates some interesting scenes.<br/><br/>So all in all it is many things put into one package, maybe too many things in one package... at times it is hard to see what is the main focus: the story, the techno show or maybe the character personality study.

","Minority Report Directed by: Steven Spielberg Starring: Tom Cruise, Samantha Morton & Max Von Sydow <br/><br/>Mr. Spielberg wants us to think. He wants us to think about our future, and the consequences of what kind of society we will make for our children. So, he has done another sci-fi movie, following A.I. And, like A.I., it's based upon a sci-fi short story, not to say that this is a short movie.<br/><br/>Warning *Spoilers*<br/><br/>This is a movie about the future, the year 2054. It's also about predicting the future where human society is so ravaged by murders that they will resort to anything to reduce (or eliminate) these hideous crimes. Will they do anything? Sadly, yes. They resort to taking those who have the ability to see the future, precognitive mutants, and tap into their minds. Once the `Pre-Crime' police are able to determine who will be murdered and who will do it, they set about arresting the guilty person before the crime is committed. A fascinating premise, to the say the least. However, this brings up some interesting moral and legal questions. Are there some flaws in this system? If it doesn't work perfectly, will it have to be scrapped? What happens when one of the Pre-Crime policemen, John Anderton (Tom Cruise), finds out he is going to murder someone? Well, we don't get any good answers to the first two questions, but we do for the last one. And, the answer is  he runs  and runs  and runs. This is where the movie gets bogged down.

","The combination of the big names Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise turned Minority Report into a predictable futuristic thriller that comes nowhere near Bladerunner, for example, in creating atmosphere and threat. The addition of humor and wacky characters sinks the feeling of a bleak future because Spielberg wanted to make entertainment for the whole family.<br/><br/>Minority Report is full of things to impress people who are impressed by Tom Cruise. He is a big star but not much of an actor. He is a big boy in a big boy's action adventure. The best thing in the film is Samantha Morton. That's it. <br/><br/>Too much product placement. All that money and it's still not a classic thriller. Steven Spielberg makes big expensive films that are supposed to become blockbusters.

","What an insult to my intelligence. This movie had more plot holes than most low budget sci-fi films. I find it hard to believe that most people think Steven Spielberg is a great director. He can only make a movie that appeals to kids or teenagers. When he makes a movie for adults, he either distorts history (Schindler/Amistad) or bores us to death (Color Purple and last 2 hours of Saving P. Ryan). I will not bore you with all the negatives of Minority Report, because they have been stated already by the few people who actually paid attention to the storyline. Minority Report cannot hold a candle to Alien, Blade Runner, 12 Monkey's or Terminator. Heck, 13th Floor was a better movie. As for Spielberg, he should take a lesson from Christopher Nolan (Memento/Insomnia) on how to direct a movie."

","I've recently had the chance to go to a private screening of the brand new film, Minority Report.  The movie stars Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow.  The direction is by the absolutely wonderful Steven Spielberg. When I came out of the screening, I couldn't wait to see it on opening day of June, 21st.  Here's my review:<br/><br/>I've got to say, this is a fantastic film.  Steven Spielberg is great at the direction seat and he definitely directed a true gem. The movie follows a cop who has such great technology, that he can catch future criminals before they actually commit the crime.  The tables are now turned on him and he's in the run for his life to prove that he is not going to commit a crime. I guess the movie's a little bit predictable, but for the most part, it's good enough.  The movie's basically like a Blade Runner (futuristic setting) of our time.  it doesn't have the same plot or nothing but a futuristic vibe. I definitely want the Lexus in the future that Tom Cruise drives.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise proves once again that he knows how to act and this may be one of his best movies since Rain Man.  I've seen Colin Farrell in Hart's War and in that, I guess he proved something.  But in this one, he proves he can act even better.  The last time I've ever saw Max von Sydow was in needful Things and in that he played the devil.  In this he's a little nicer.  He does good in this.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is great and Tom Cruise and Steven Spielburg should work together more often.  The action sequences are great.  I think that this could be another summer blockbuster.  Highly recommended.  Rating 10 out of 10."

In Minority Report, they use the high-tech sci-fi screen so so seriously. I started giggling because my 3-year-old grandson can swipe his tablet just as capably. Using human captives, keeping them sedated and floating in liquid, hooked up to sensors - is that really where the filmmakers think humanity will be in 50 years?

","I love scifi movies. I love seeing movies made from Phillip K. Dick stories (though they can never approach the brilliance of the books). I was able to appreciate BladeRunner, Total Recall & even Paycheck and a Scanner Darkly. I also love stuff that touches on todays political climate and this was the perfect chance to address our current loss of civil rights in the name of ""safety"".<br/><br/>But Spielberg has disappointed me deeply....<br/><br/>I can forgive the casting of both crazy Cruise & Farrell, neither of whom I like as an actor.<br/><br/>Since he's not a first time director should I assume the stolen stuff was intentional homages? Matrix went all GREEN, let's go all BLUE. Let's add TRONs cool looking cars. Clockwork Orange was stunning for it's juxtaposition of calming classical music with violence? Let's use that. OK fine, whatever.<br/><br/>What bothered me were the glaringly sloppy points in the script. I'm willing to suspend a lot of disbelief, ignore plot holes (esp. to do with the future). However, you seriously can't expect me to believe that no one revoked his access to high security areas after he'd been found out. Using his old eyes to get into a building not once by twice -- even after he's been convicted & jailed? That's just lazy! If he's still got access and that doesn't set off any alarms, then there was no need to remove them was there?<br/><br/>Also, as someone else has mentioned, setting the crucial plot twist in a ""murder she wrote"" moment of ""I didn't mention how she died"" was just cheap and ruined the movie.<br/><br/>And as many others have said, the overly sugary, touchy-feely, everyone is happy ending was WAY OVER THE TOP and totally unnecessary.<br/><br/>But what I can't forgive the film is the product placement. I appreciate the way they show how ads are moving to become so individualized. But you know that Guiness, GAP & the others paid Spielberg millions for those scenes! It's incredibly sad that such a famous director would sell out like that. I have lost a lot of respect for him. There could have been other ways to show the same idea without turning the movie into an ad itself. I certainly don't' remember a bunch of scenes set in the mall in PK Dick's story!

Tom Cruise plays PreCrime employee John Anderton, suddenly charged with committing a future crime. Steven Spielberg's direction is good as always, but the movie suffers a little. Don't get me wrong; it's a good concept for a movie, and the idea of an organization being able to go after anyone seemed like an important topic after September 11, 2001.

This is possible due to three special women who are hooked up as they are able to see murders before they happen giving police time to stop it. This system is questioned on the grounds of is it justified to arrest people BEFORE they commit a crime? And how error-free is precrime, which is believed to be 100% accurate.

I would have loved more dive into the ethics of the story's basis and expounding on how the pre-determinism aspect of the precogs was flawed from the beginning. Also an explanation of how the precogs came to be period would help round out my questioning mind. Also, the movie was going for a Hitchcock type of vibe with the music in times where it wasn't necessary and was distracting from letting the actors to do their jobs and pull on the audience.

","Without a doubt this is one of the biggest science fiction films of our time, a fantastic and wide-reaching epic story, mixing in the murder mystery genre with a detective story and a wronged-man FUGITIVE-style chase flick, lacing moments of horror and even outlandish humour into the brew to create an unforgettable concoction. Spielberg has done it again, reaching new levels of maturity in adapting a short story from Phillip K. Dick and creating an action-packed film which manages to be intelligent and suspenseful as well as crowd-pleasing. Although the futuristic trappings are familiar and some elements of the movie are somewhat clichéd (am I the only one getting tired of robotic spiders after this and LOST IN SPACE?), Spielberg and his crew have lovingly crafted each sequence in an artistic and aesthetically pleasing way so that you can physically enjoy what you're watching all the while.<br/><br/>The storyline is complex but not unfathomable; Spielberg tends to throw us in at the deep end at the beginning of the tale, but gradually as the pieces of the plot fall together it all becomes clear until the outstanding climax-upon-climax finale, which explains every detail of the plot in crystal clarity and acts as the icing on the cake. Actually reaching the explanation of the story is an enjoyable and exhilarating process which left me frequently gripped by the actions on screen. The story is backed up with some fantastic visual effects work to create a society somewhat different from ours (hover packs, killer plants, and automated cars being the new additions) and there is enough action to stop anyone becoming bored. A chase sequence in a car factory is frenetically entertaining material and there are a few classic moments of the bizarre thrown in too, including the highlight where Cruise chases his own eyeballs down a corridor.<br/><br/>As the lead, Cruise shines. Even surrounded by gadgetry he puts in an outstanding performance which may be his best yet. He makes for an endearing, emotionally unstable human hero and my long-running hatred of the actor has vanished since his quality performances of recent years. A sterling cast provides the back-up, including fresh-faced Colin Farrell as a dedicated detective (great work from the Irish newcomer), stalwarts such as Peter Stormare and Patrick Kilpatrick doing their bits, and a typically fine showing for Max von Sydow in a substantial role for a change. Eagle-eyed viewers may spot SUSPIRIA starlet Jessica Harper, unrecognisable in a pivotal sequence repeated throughout the movie. MINORITY REPORT is a classic film, full of action, danger, and suspense, and it's one of the best thrill-rides I've seen in a long time that doesn't forsake cerebral challenges in place of dumb explosions."

Too much details, over the top. Too smart a script, too many sidelines. I cannot stand it. Take for example 'EXTRACTED', a 'low-budget' movie, less is more. Am I alone in saying that Spielbergs SF is childish and uninteresting? Compare Ridley Scotts Alien/Prometheus. Such a higher level of story-telling. But maybe it is because of Tom Cruise.

So, you should watch it endless times like I do. <br/><br/>Kidding. <br/><br/>Leo Crow murder is indeed a plot hole, it is by no means a terribly unexplained plot. <br/><br/>Here you go. The producer posits a universe without free will, where our actions are predetermined. No one talks about changing the course of the future or finding ways to collapse the wave function. There is no wave function: time is a straight line, one path, and the precogs can see straight down that path. There is no opportunity for Anderton to be truly free of the precrime in the movie's Universe. <br/><br/>And because there are too many ways to set a person up for felony, it has become an implausible plot. What Lamar did was just to set someone up to lay a bunch of photos of his son somewhere and to be present at the apartment at Lamar's narrated time, precogs would then link the gait to Anderson's future murder? This seems way too implausible because Leo Crow is a total stranger to Anderton. Well, in the movie, he broke it by using his sheer self-control and proved murderers can change the fate of a precrime if they know it earlier. This part has no implication of Agatha's minority report because Agatha did not produce a disparity in vision with the other precogs, only to show the system can be manipulated at will, but Spielberg made it not the right way. That's why it is a plot hole.<br/><br/>What Spielberg should have laid the scene is one that sees Lamar implanting a pair of counterfeit red balls named Leo Crow and Anderson. That's it! Everything after that is all yours."
"alsation72","6","0","1","17 November 2013"," Entertaining and well made, but so divergent from the source it barely needed to credit it.
","Well it is Steven Spielberg directing here so there is that level of quality synonymous with him. Also Tom Cruise is excellent ... I mean the guy's a self-important kook but he is a great all-round performer.<br/><br/>Again though, like A.I, though the effects are superlative there are severe flaws in the logic of the major plot device that drive the story forward. <br/><br/>Also like A.I it barely needs to credit the original story by Philip K. Dick because it has been ""improved"" or ""developed"" to make a full-length film out of it. For example, in the story, the main character is balding and overweight; hardly describes Tom Cruise (who just refuses to age).<br/><br/>The pace and special effects and cinematography and acting are all very good, as usual its the screen-adapters who let it down. If you are going to mess with an original piece of science fiction at least improve it, don't mire it down.<br/><br/>I won't go over the plot as I'm sure you can find that elsewhere, but ... SPOILER TIME<br/><br/>Three pale bald girls in a tank of water having psychic visions about possible future crimes? Are we watching science fiction or a paranormal epic? Because there is a big difference. And yes you can trace this flaw back to the original 1956 story but at least in the story there was so much more of an emphasis of these mutant ""precogs"" and their individual stories.<br/><br/>In the film they might as well be shaved primates in a lab waiting to be freed by animal liberationists. In the source there is much more about their back story (mutation due to the use of 50's-futuristic drugs) and they had different names (also one was male).<br/><br/>The three would have predictions, a computer analyzed the predictions looking for inconsistencies and when at least two of the accusations match that is the ""majority report"". They barely covered this angle in the film.<br/><br/>There are good and bad elements to this. It is watch-able but could have been better had the concepts in the story been explored more thoroughly rather than being discarded."

"marais-alexander","7","0","1","22 September 2013"," Everybody Runs...Or walks...in this conceptually interesting thriller
","Minority Report is classic big-budgeted Steven Spielberg. In the hands of a more subtle but equally competent director, I think the film would have benefited from being a far superior movie. That's not to say Steven is not one of the best directors around, he is, but he is excellent at a certain type of filmmaking that I don't believe is particularly refined. In a science fiction thriller such as this, a sleek, lean, and mean direction is needed. The characters need to be more elaborated upon. Spielberg attempts to thrown in together special effects, plot twists, questions about morality, action, and Tom Cruise all in one basket. Not good. Steven Spielberg in my opinion is not a great mainstream action director, with a few exceptions (including the unforgettable Private Ryan). Every violent scene in Minority Report felt a bit too staged, the punches a bit too bland. John Anderton (Cruise)'s backstory, while conceptually devastating, enacted on the screen is a bit overly sentimental. It felt like a huge divergent too from the bigger meat of the yarn - the pre cogs and Anderton's alternate future. What is a nice twist is the ambiguity about the film's happy ending, and whether or not it is a dream. Some would interpret it to be so, others not. Inception seems to have heavily borrowed ideas from Minority Report, in addition to The Matrix (as the story was written long before The Matrix). It's definitely influential, and being Spielberg is definitely something to see, but Spielberg's bombastic approach to all of his films I think has undermined the film's full potential to be a haunting and subtle film that stays with you. Alas Minority Report, while full of cool ideas, images, and effects, is easily forgettable."

","So I just watched Minority Report last night and I thought it was amazing. My favorite movies are futuristic movies, I also love futuristic cop movies. I also love Cruise and Spielberg, so this movie was my dream movie. I think this movie is very underrated even thought it has a 7.7, I think its Metascore(80) explains how good the movie actually is. I am starting to look at Metascore before the IMDb rating now because the Metascore is usually more telling. Of course the IMDb ranking is usually accurate. What I do is if you add the first number of the Metascore and the first number of the IMDb rating and it totals 14+(So say the IMDb score is 8.3 and Meta is 65 you would take the 8 and 6 and add them to get 14) than it should be a really good movie.

","Minority Report is one of the most complex and best made movies I have seen in a long time. First of all the casting for the characters was phenomenal.Tom Cruise stole the show, mostly because he was the main protagonist and barely had any help. The story line... Sweet mother of movie makers. The story line is one of the most complex and yet exponentially enjoyable because of the ability to grasp the concepts that are being introduced. Every twist the movie makes, you make a prediction and then that blows right out of the window as the next spiral in the script takes its tole at the perfect moment. Even to the very last scene you are on the edge of your seat not knowing exactly who to cheer on and who to condemn in your mind. Overall the ""future world"" has been done better, but the Utopia mindset was approached from a very unique point. I loved the movie and would recommend it to anyone who has eyes;)."
"Bruce722","8","0","1","30 June 2013"," Entertaining and creative film.
","Minority Report is one of the most unique films I've seen. Tom Cruise stars in his role as John Anderton, lead officer in Washington, D.C.'s pre-crime division set in the mid-21st century. ""Pre-crime"" is a concept that revolves around the ability to stop murders before they happen thanks to three ""precogs"" and their ability to see into the future. This is an inherently controversial way to 'solve' crime but is largely accepted because it seems perfect considering that no murders had been committed in the six year experiment. The conflict is introduced when Cruise finds out that he is the next expected murderer. This puts him on the run from the division he once led and on an investigation to find out how he is supposedly going to murder someone he's never met. The action isn't overdone but rather placed well throughout the film. The combat sequences could've been better but they were still enjoyable. A few of the plot points were a little weak also but there weren't actual holes or anything. The acting was solid with Cruise and a supporting cast of Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow among others. The best part of the film, though, was the interesting plot. Even with the few weak parts it's just a very interesting story that develops nicely. Many movies struggle with the concept of the future being predicted but Minority Report does a great job and is very entertaining."

","Most people don't recognize the name Phillip K. Dick and when you read his name, you probably just snickered. He might not have had an easy childhood with a name like that and you may not recognize his name, but he is to Science Fiction what Stephen King is to Horror. The films Blade Runner, Total Recall, Screamers, Paycheck, A Scanner Darkly, Next, & The Adjustment Bureau were all based on stories or books that he wrote. Minority Report is yet another of his stories developed for the big screen and one of the most popular. This ingenious film was Directed by Stephen Spielberg and starred Tom Cruise. I am by no means a fan of Tom Cruise, in fact, I've made it a point over the last few years to avoid seeing anything he is in, but this was one film I couldn't miss. To his credit Cruise was very good and exciting throughout, showing a lot of charisma, it was unexpected, but a welcome change from what we normally see from him. This terrific futuristic tale tells the story of pre-crime, a system in which high functioning autistics can predict murders with a very narrow margin of error. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the lead investigator, whose job it is to stop these crimes before they happen. Things are going well for him, that is until his name comes out of the machine and he becomes a target of his own men. The story was deep, yet somewhat complicated, as I was confused at several points in the movie, but that's how you know it's good Science Fiction. The action and chase sequences were fantastic, as was the direction and special effects. The story does however leave some lose ends and I found the precogs to be more than somewhat creepy. It almost seemed like these disabled people were being abused for their unique abilities and not a single character in the film had any issues with that. Minority Report is a long, complex story, but it's fast paced, visually impactful, and will make you think. It only took thirty years, but you can finally add a Tom Cruise film to the list of movies I enjoyed."
"JohnL11","7","0","1","16 June 2013"," An entertaining film with an interesting premise
","Minority Report is an action movie with an above-average plot about a future in which future murders can be predicted, and the would-be-murderers are jailed, apparently without a trial, before they commit the crime.<br/><br/>If you were hoping for a deep interrogation of the legal system, however, you will be disappointed, because the morals of this new justice system are barely mentioned. Early on, Cruise's character, John Anderton, is predicted to kill a man, and he must run from his old partners in an Indiana Jones-style chase scene set in the future. That is really the problem with this film: interesting concepts hover on the tip of its tongue, but the movie steers towards action instead of tackling interesting ideas. Some other problems include an obvious disregard for reality, such as a Terminator-style spinning shotgun carried by Federal agents, and several incredibly silly mistakes by policemen. The film definitely falls heavier on the ""fiction"" half of ""science fiction.""<br/><br/>Fortunately, the plot is still very praiseworthy as it has enough plot twists to keep the audience interested. The minor characters are all well written and fun to watch, and small details such as the visual comparison between police officers and music conductors are found at every turn.<br/><br/>The film really shines in some of the more visual aspects. The set design is brilliant, from a creepy garden, to roller coaster freeways, to a quack doctor's insane operating room. The bleak lighting and washed out color scale fits the mood and setting perfectly.<br/><br/>At the end of the day, Minority Report is a solid, and highly entertaining, film that, while succeeding in many regards, does fall short of its massive potential."

","Oh, my! What a technologically sound and crime free future! Everything in this film is so imaginative. The subject matter is fascinating, nifty, thoughtful and disturbing. Imagine a seemingly controllable but still humanly fallible future. Has anyone wondered 'what if' something bad befalls the precognitive trio that keeps the fabric of this new reality together? They have to die at some point, yes? Then what? Will there not be rioting in the street as people lament over a once secure country now forced to return to its unpredictable and dangerous past? Maybe the strange pool the trio perpetually floats in is the fountain of youth? The Precrime Division certainly doesn't allow them to go on a date. Maybe they can mate with each other and retain some cognitive power for their offspring? I don't know, and I don't think anyone in this film knows either. They are living peacefully on borrowed time at the expense of these all-knowing slaves.<br/><br/>Oh, have you seen these neat tiny floppy discs? You can store home movies on them. These captured memories are fuzzy, despite the stellar technology everywhere else, further echoing human imperfection. The memory of loved ones is constantly fading. The sad people who watch these videos of the past are hurting. These trinkets of better times fail to purge agony, as do the countless breathtaking gizmos, ""neuroin"" drug business, and an imaginarium that can give you a tasty session of your deepest dreams, any of them... for a price, of course. By the way, there are also retinal scans everywhere, computer programs at the GAP that greet you at the door and remind you of your last purchase as if these computers know your fashion taste...because they do! There are eyes everywhere. There may be a small amount of privacy in futuristic apartments with lights and appliances that activate upon verbal command, until spider droids crawl into your bathroom while you're on the toilet or into your bed while you're making love to make sure you're not the future criminal that Precrime Division is looking for! Last, but not least-- JET PACKS! This film is geek heaven.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is a thrilling spectacle with soldiers a second away from rappelling through your windows and arresting you for a crime you haven't committed yet! No trial, no jury, you get hauled off to a giant storage chamber where you watch cartoons in your head for the rest of your life! The action is awesome, but the intent is controversial, yet it works! Or...does it? Predetermination and choice are putting their boxing gloves on.<br/><br/>As a fan of both, it was a pleasure to see Collin Farrell and Tom Cruise on screen together during a classic ""can't catch the wily protagonist"" fight scene. It winds up with Cruise escaping in one of those slick dreamy cars of the future. I'm not sure how he survived being inside during the car's assembly, though. Be careful of that car! It may override your control so it can start driving in reverse for you! Phooey on your intended destination! Naturally, perfection comes at a cost. I won't say what the cost is, but it's dirty, and the way it is executed avoids the cliché we've come to know so well.<br/><br/>Minority Report is provocative, sly, dazzling and is served wonderfully by 2 hours and 26 minutes, allowed to breathe and let the viewer enjoy this spectacle. It's everything the Total Recall remake tried to be. The CGI work is impressive for 2002, and amidst all of this sheen, there is mostly a substantive story.<br/><br/>I would give it a 9 out of 10. I wish one part could've gotten some closure. Then the ending wouldn't have felt so abrupt."

","With a typically imaginative future-set sci-fi story by Philip K Dick, an A-list cast with Tom Cruise in the lead and Steven Spielberg as director, this big-budget feature looks great on paper. The story's good too, in these days of zero-tolerance towards crime, the idea of stopping a murder before it's actually committed is ingenious and the demonstration of the Pre-Crime Unit in action, effectively the film's prologue, is great as Tom Cruise and his team race against the clock to stop a crime of passion double-murder.<br/><br/>I also liked the fact that the operation was subject to moral and indeed legal scrutiny, in the form of government busybody Colin Farrell, but the main story, and the excuse for Cruise to do his running man schtick one more time is when the system inexplicably turns on him, triggering the obligatory extended chase and action sequences which for me take up too much of the story, spectacle over content. I didn't even think the SFX were that good, especially Cruise's John Anderton's gravity-defying first escape from his pursuers, plus the product-placement to which the viewer is subliminally subjected is outrageously excessive. In addition it was too easy to pick out the real bad guy and I even predicted, without ""pre-cog"", the give-away line before it was said, making the ending somewhat predictable. <br/><br/>There's not much call for great acting here, Cruise doing action-hero better than bereaved parent, Max Van Sydow, looking and sounding like John Huston, but without the devil-meant while Farrell probably comes off best, but is dispensed with too soon and somewhat unnecessarily I thought.<br/><br/>I think that under all the flash-bang-wallop that Spielberg employs here there was a leaner, darker, better film trying to get out. Perhaps if he'd pre-cogged the final cut himself, he might not have blocked his own buster."
"paul2001sw-1","5","0","1","22 May 2013"," Not really trying to be intelligent
","'Minority Report' is a big budget, Steven Spielberg-directed futuristic thriller: I found it disappointing, for three reasons. Firstly, it's definitely not ""hard"" sci-fi: although it has an intriguing premise, a lot of the mechanics of how its world is supposed to actually work is not made clear, unlikely stuff seems to happen for the sole reason it's useful for the purposes of advancing the plot, and society seems divided between gleaming halls and squalor in a way that makes for impressive visuals but is never explained. Secondly, the hero (played by Tom Cruise) appears to be possessed of near super-powers: it's a standard plot line where an individual is forced to run from an entire system, but it's hard to sympathise with him when he seems to be capable of extraordinary feats without breaking sweat, jumping between moving vehicles hundreds of metres above the ground, or single-handedly fighting off an entire armed-response crew. Finally, the story of institutional corruption ultimately focuses on individual motives: the leading protagonists transpire to be extraordinarily personally connected to the system that they manage. And while ""police chief is actually a murderer"" makes for a neat story, in the real world, bad policemen cause damage in generally more subtle, less direct ways. Ultimately, nothing engaged me here: there was plenty of material, but too little interest in exploring it in depth: the ideas provide a backdrop for an action movie, but they're sadly not as important as might first seem."

But Spielberg as we know, is a master of that art. The mannerism in which 2054 AD is depicted, the technology,the gizmos, the transport,the infrastructure and every single component of the plot, it seems like Spielberg himself is a precog who has the ability to foresee the future and tell us how it'll be. Cruise, like always is at the zenith with his action and involvement but for this movie, its the plot and the cogent story line which will capture your imagination. You'd actually feel as if you belong in a real world from the future because its appeal is so very massive. In a nutshell, the movie is about the Colombian department of pre-crime, a department that has been setup with the intention of stopping criminal incidents before they happen. How ? Well, its 3 precogs who are supposedly inculcated with the capability or rather with the gifts of coming up with previsions of crimes that are yet to occur. With state of the art transport, the cops can easily get t the crime scene and stop it from happening. But then comes the twist. A twist that's the real thing to watch out for."

The sci-fi elements are just so very well crafted in this, in a way you can actually buy into what is going on in the future.

Now I ain't a big Tom Cruise fan but he was in some movies I really enjoyed watching. And this is one of them, Tom fit right in this role and his performance in this was great. He was right on spot with this role and it makes the audiences care what happens next. Also this film was probably a big break for the actor Colin Farrell, he was good in this as well. As sort of a rival character to Tom's character who is trying to track him down. Overall this is a sci-fi movie that is worth buying, I sometimes watch this movie sometimes although I already seen it a couple of times which is rare for me.

","This terrific duo should associate more often. I will not enter the empty debate to decide if it's the best PKD adaptation (just because PKD must be read than watched) but there were a lot of good ideas and inspired filmmaking here. The first pre-crime reminds you that Spielberg is really good at thriller and it's a shame that he doesn't do more, above all that he started here (see ""Night Gallery""). At first, the blue filtering didn't convince me here it's fine because this future is really bleak. It reminds me of ""Robocop"": a future not too futurist but with us, common people having become hollow shells and identified data: thoughts, eyes, body warm, localization. What can the ""government"" ask more the moment we can't get any privacy thus identity. This all-seeing eye is well depicted here all the more than PKD is an intelligent rebel: the loss of our liberties would be pernicious, hidden behind the ""it's for your own good"". Tomorrow, it will be casual crimes, but today it's already terrorism, fundamentalism and states debts. But PKD is also a true writer because it's his delicious idea to have a pre-crime cop witnessing his own pre-crime! With Spielberg on command, you can find that the bragging Farrell is decent actor and fresh newcomers (like Morton) as well.

The effort to force the plot into a classic chase movie apparently demanded to ignore some smaller inconsistencies, especially the moral standpoint of the story was never really clear to me. Andertons swift change in motivation seemed odd and Burgess leaves without any clear statement. Appears quite a deal more as lazy scriptwriting then thought provoking.<br/><br/>Besides that Minority Report is still good cinema in terms of scope, detail and a decent portion of vision, presented with the outstanding quality Spielberg got us used to. Not to mention the smart action scenes and the general, pleasingly rapid pace of the movie. And though the storytelling might crumble a bit here and there at least there is a story well worth telling.<br/><br/>Shouldn't be an excuse, but scriptwriting mistakes like these are merely the minimum in most of the improbably successful, billion dollar productions that Hollywood has given us along the last decade. Re- watching this after movies like X-Men: First Class, Spiderman 3 or Inception makes me generally long for flicks as badly written as this one."

","In the film, Minority Report, we see a futuristic team of investigators led by Chief John Anderton, played by Tom Cruise, who uses a set of highly protected precognitive individuals to foresee crimes before they take place. Director Lamar Burgess, played by Max von Sydow, oversees the project and acts as the political spokesman and advocate for the pre-cog program. The team has successfully reduced the murder rate in Washington D.C. to zero using these highly talented individuals. It is only after the Chief Anderton's name appears from the pre-cogs mind that a high speed pursuit begins as the detective desperately attempts to clear his name before the murder takes place. <br/><br/>The theme of this movie involves humanities constant struggle between good and evil and the lengths that we as a species will go to both hide and discover this evil. A constant internal and external struggle is seen as Detective Anderton eludes authorities and attempts to clear his name. The theme of this movie is closely related to the 2009 film, Shirlock Holmes, in that a sinister character cloaked in darkness eventually comes to light and a battle for good ensues. Both movies characterize the struggle that takes place during the investigative process to discover the events leading to the evil character's development. <br/><br/>During the production, the director, Steven Spielberg, uses both lighting and angle to lend example towards this theme. As Detective Anderton begins his run from authorities, he realizes that he must find a surgeon to replace his eyes in order to evade retina scanners throughout the city. During the surgery, viewers are brought into the dark and dingy surroundings of an illegal surgery revealing the underground world of illegal surgery. Spielberg was especially careful to portray this sinister world by using the necessary dark lighting with various camera angles to draw viewers into the seriousness of the event at hand. <br/><br/>Throughout the film, the plot is further supported by the various camera angles used in the high speed chase scenes. Viewers are drawn into the occurrences on the screen by the use of multiple camera shots that quickly change from one angle to another in order to further compound the excitement of the scene. As seen in many action thrillers, the use of these techniques play a vital role in the overall theme of the movie and effectively leave viewers in a heightened level of suspense throughout the film."
"Eternality","10","0","1","5 January 2011"," Minority Report may be the most entertaining, cerebral sci-fi thriller of the 2000s decade.
","Based on a short story by the great sci-fi author Philip K. Dick, whose work inspired popular films such as Ridley Scott's Blade Runner (1982), and Paul Verhoeven's Total Recall (1990), the film adaptation of Minority Report is a cause for celebration for fans of the genre. Directed by Steven Spielberg and released in 2002, Minority Report may be the most entertaining, cerebral sci-fi thriller of the 2000s decade. For a Spielberg picture, Minority Report is quite underrated; it is not very often cited among ""Spielberg's Popcorn Greats"" such as Jaws (1975), Raiders of the Lost Ark (1981), and Jurassic Park (1993), and I feel that needs to change now.<br/><br/>Minority Report is set in the future in which criminals are caught before they commit their crimes. A special Pre-Crime unit headed by John Anderton (Tom Cruise) takes advantage of three ""Pre-Cogs"" who have the ability to ""see"" a crime, and identify its perpetrator and victim before the crime is committed. This has effectively prevented criminals acts from happening for yearsuntil one day the system accuses John of murdering a stranger called Leo Crow. Determined to prove his innocence, John has to escape from the clutches of Pre-Crime officers hunting for him while trying to find answers to his predicament.<br/><br/>First, Spielberg's direction is top-notch. He sets up the story and introduces how Pre-Crime works in a lengthy prologue that is an exciting prelude of what is to come. With an extremely potent blend of quick cuts and kinetic movements within shots, the film is fast-paced, engaging, and in some parts, very tense. One sequence, in which electronic spiders scurry about in an apartment to find John, is vintage Spielberg. In an elaborate long take in this sequence, the camera rises above a huge set consisting of rooms and walls as it tracks in and out as if spying on its occupants.<br/><br/>In addition, towards the end of the above-mentioned sequence, there is a bathtub scene that gives Minority Report its most suspenseful peak. In the canon of Spielberg's ""moments"", this should be considered one of them. Interestingly, the approach is quite similar to the ""alien pod in the basement"" sequence in War of the Worlds (2005), another underrated Spielberg sci-fi thriller. Cruise, who appears in both films, gives a decent performance here, and he is ably backed up by a strong supporting cast consisting of Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow, and Samantha Morton.<br/><br/>Spielberg keeps audiences on their toes by structuring the film like a mystery. There is a sinister truth, in fact multiple truths, that await Cruise's character (and the viewer). And the payoff is beyond expectations. Twisting and turning like a writhing snake, Minority Report haunts as much as it entertains. It is Spielberg at his best, and for those who deride Hollywood for their infamous ability to churn out brainless popcorn flicks, here is one very excellent example of the contrary.<br/><br/>GRADE: A+ (www.filmnomenon.blogspot.com) All rights reserved."

","Spielberg's sci-fi film, 'Minority Report' presents the issue of future crime. Can one foresee a crime happening and prevent it? That's where 'Minority Report' takes us through entertainment. I am glad that Spielberg did not force an alien into the movie.<br/><br/>Starting from the technical side, 'Minority Report' is an exceptionally well made film. The visual effects, cinematography, colour tint, art direction, score and editing are all first rate. The writing is good if one wants to make an entertaining film but given the theme of future crime, Spielberg could have gone deeper and make a film that is more layered, darker and thought-provoking. But then again, the director's purpose was to entertain and he succeeds in that.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise delivers an average, at best, performance. He is by no means terrible and certainly does not ruin the movie but he's easily overshadowed by the supporting cast that includes Colin Farrel, Samantha Morton, Max Von Sydow, Kathryn Morris and Tim Blake Nelson.<br/><br/>Overall, 'Minority Report' promises to some great sci-fi action entertainment. With great visuals and an intriguing suspenseful story, why not take a look at what Spielberg's future crime fighters were up to."

","It's the year 2054; crime and murder are predicted before they happen by special human beings called precognitives. There are three ""precogs"" that are kept in some type of white creamy substance in a room. The visions from their brains are produced as an image on a screen in the Pre Crime division of the police station. It is here, where Chief John Anderton, played by Tom Cruise, searches for clues to murders and the locations using these images. Anderton is painfully reminded by his work and his faith is tested by this system. He lost his son, Sean, six years prior and divorced from his wife. To handle his day-to-day pain he resorts to drugs to help keep him in control.<br/><br/>However, Anderton's life turns one day when the precogs see a vision of him killing a man. Anderton is on the run and must prove his innocence by investigating if this murder was a rare instance to which the precogs don't have the same vision, called a Minority Report The theme is the one of fate versus choice, asking the question of whether humans are ruled by fate or do they have free will. From the opening scene sequences the PreCrime division received a ""pre-vision"" that says a man will be murdering his wife and then the lover upon discovery. The crime was prevented as the man pleas that he wouldn't have killed them however he is still arrested and imprisoned. This theme is similar to that of the Matrix. In the Matrix, Neo, played by Keanu Reeves, must make a choice between the red or blue pill.<br/><br/>In one scene of Minority Report, shows one of the many motifs of the film. The scene involves one character trading one set of eyeballs for another set. This really shows, darkly, how the movie is revolves around new ways of ""seeing"". The lighting and gritty cinematography is haunting and forces the viewer to dark and familiar places. The lighting casts dark shadows, allowing only partial facial recognition. There are many instances where special lighting effects were used during the retina scans, especially when Anderton walks through the mall. The camera angles are placed below and above eye level from the view of the spider-like robots to the above shots dwarfing Anderton.<br/><br/>The director brings to life the struggle of fate versus choice by his use of camera angles, lighting, and the many motifs proving that everybody runs."

","9.3<br/><br/>Leave it to the great minds to imagine the future. Leave it to the scientists to create the future. Leave it to the people to inhabit the future, and thus shape its cultures, its niches, and its memes. Minority Report is a film based on the Phillip K. Dick story by the same name. It takes place in 2054, and there is a division of police officers called Precrime who utilize special humans who have the foresight of future murders. The murders are stopped before they can occur, and thus there are no more murders being carried out. Minority Report takes place in a world very similar to ours, but much more technologically advanced.<br/><br/>Everything from traffic that is operated without the need for human interference, advertisements that cater to your ears and use your name, and retinal recognition everywhere that we go. We also see advanced user interfaces and hologram projections. One thing that Minority Report does is that it peers into the future, but not too far. It is still grounded in our world, these are things that we can see in development right now. Google is currently working on cars that drive themselves. Microsoft, at the time of this writing, is about to release Kinect, a user interface that is similar to the one used by the Precrime officers. The vision of the movie and how it is carried out is stunning. It is a visual treat, and that of one for the imagination as well.<br/><br/>The film itself is not amateurish in any sense, either. Steven Spielberg sits in the director's chair, but not in a lazy fashion. We see here the work of a man who knows what he's doing, and has known what he's doing for a long time now. The film has an interesting look, where everything is shiny and very, very bright. Sometimes the reflection of light on the lens is so strong, the light drowns the scene. This might turn some people off, but I think it gives the movie an interesting look. The entire thing feels like a dream sequence. Spielberg displays his mastery of translating emotion onto film and speakers, with some scenes that will have you choking as you try to swallow them. There is a scene in the movie that is of my favorite scenes in film. The protagonist stands while a female character puts her head on his shoulder. They are both conversing, and you can only see both of their heads in the shot. The lighting is perfect, and you can tell that a lot of thought was put into this shot. Thank you, God, for art. Thank you, mankind, for cinema.<br/><br/>The performances in Minority Report are also very good. Tom Cruise is a good actor, and delivers all of these scenes with conviction. Most of the other actors keep up with him, some delivering as fine of a performance. The music is done by John Williams. Mr. Williams has worked with Spielberg many times before, and his music is pretty recognizable. However, I heard many things here that I don't think I've heard before in a John Williams score. The story is loosely based on the novel, and its twists, turns and conclusion will have you invested and entertained all throughout the film. The film does inspire emotion, even if it is shock, and you might feel yourself a bit drained of emotion by the end of it. This is, of course, the sign of a good film. But just because you can play an instrument beautifully doesn't mean that you should fill the air with constant notes, the audience will become tired of it.<br/><br/>I've said it before: it's easy to nitpick a great piece of art. Just as easy as it is to write about bad art. Minority Report is a great film. It's not done by amateurs in any sense of the word, and the reference material (although I haven't read it myself) is very good. Some will be turned off by the sci-fi feel and the plasticky, metal, electronic look. But those who are into science fiction are in for a real treat, because besides delivering a solid and original science fiction movie, it's also a successful movie in terms of execution of assets and inspiration of emotion. Watching Minority Report is like having a precognition yourself; that of the future."

","""But it didn't fall. You caught it. The fact that you prevented it from happening doesn't change the fact that it was *going* to happen.""<br/><br/>This blockbuster collaboration between Tom Cruise and Steven Spielberg just happens to be one of my favorite sci-fi movies, one of my favorite Tom Cruise movies, and one of my favorite Spielberg movies. It's a gritty, exciting thrill ride that excels in special effects and action, but doesn't solely rely on those two elements.<br/><br/>In a near-future world where a few select people have the ability to see murders before they happen, three of these ""precogs"" have been used by a special government organization known as Precrime to prevent a single murder from happening in Washington D.C. for six years. But, on the eve of the program possibly being expanded nationwide, Precrime officer John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is predicted by the system to murder a man he's never met before in the next few days. Does he allow himself to meekly be captured? Of course not, that wouldn't be much of a movie, would it?<br/><br/>The world of Minority Report is futuristic, but still very much grounded in reality and how metropolitan America may well look in forty years. The movie is filmed with a blue filter that makes everything seem very cold and urban, and it suits the tone perfectly. Cruise is great, and wisely leaves most of his charm and boyishness at home under Spielberg's direction. This is a serious and at times quite dark character for him, and he nailed it. Minority Report strikes a great balance between action and story, and while the plot may not ultimately be the most original ever on its most basic level, it's certainly effective and interesting.<br/><br/>This is the sci-fi movie that I recommend to people who may not normally be into the genre, because it's sure to entertain, regardless of its classification. If you have even a mild interest in it, don't delay in seeing it."

In that at least he's correct, both AI and this are...less than stellar.<br/><br/>His title is some blather about ""rare good sci fi"", when good sci fi is in fact not rare and this is not good science fiction. He then also entirely misses the issue of giving up freedom for safety, seeing only the precogs as being the losers rather than all of us. THEN, to top it off he pans the Blade Runner presentation of the future in favor of this as the superior vision and manages to insinuate a none too subtle attack on the US justice system as well.<br/><br/>It's stunning the garbage some people will produce on these boards...even this movie deserves better."

In 2002, he took another stab at a sci-fi story for adults, and while not as good as the previous film, it comes close.<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" is a satisfyingly nasty little piece of work about a world in which law enforcement officials can see crimes before they happen and arrest perpetrators before they've done their foul deeds. Great system, unless you happen to be one of those officials who's pinned with a crime you haven't yet committed and don't realize you have any intention of committing. That's what happens to Tom Cruise, and the movie is about his efforts to evade capture while being chased by Colin Farrell.<br/><br/>The special effects are nifty. A highlight of the film is one in which the police send an army of little mechanized spiders into an apartment complex to spy on all of the inhabitants, and we get a birds-eye view of all the things they see.

"wolverinesforever","8","0","1","15 July 2010"," Interesting and involving sci-fi thriller from Spielberg
","Set in the middle of the 21st century, ""Minority Report"" follows John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a skilled Pre-Crime cop who is very efficient in preventing murders from happened. He lives in Washington D.C., where there hasn't been a murder in six years thanks to the installment of Pre-Crime. This law enforcement group uses visions from three future-tellers (Precogs) to determine when and where a murder will happen. But when the Precogs predict that John Anderton is planning a murder, he is forced to flee and somehow prove his innocence.<br/><br/>Obviously, one of the big issues here is if it is right to arrest someone from committing a crime you know will happen before the fact. Both sides of the issue are given fair treatment here; we see both the great efficiency of the Pre-Crime unit as well as the consequences it bodes for, as Steven Spielberg put it, ""the .002%"" Such a premise holds a goldmine of material, and Spielberg and his collaborators do a good job mining it for substance. The acting is very good as well. Tom Cruise is solid as the lead, but Samantha Morton steals the show as a Precog who starts developing a connection with Anderton. Max Von Sydow and Colin firth also make good impressions in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>The city of Washington D.C. is richly realized, with its magnetic highways, personalized advertisements, and no-glasses-needed 3-D video files. The cinematography presents a world that is obviously very advanced, but emotionally detached. Overall, this is a very technically accomplished picture.<br/><br/>As much as the creators go into the issues at hand, I ironically wished they had gone deeper. How, for example, was the U.S. Constitution changed to allow for Pre-Crime to exist? I also wished the grand motive for the existence of Pre-Crime by its creator had been better clarified; as it was, it seemed a little sketchy.<br/><br/>Still, this remains a solid achievement. ""Minority Report"" is both thrilling and smart, and is worth your time especially if you are into good works of science fiction or Steven Spielberg's repertoire."

I may have missed something. Unless they are showing it on TV I don't think I'd watch it again, I didn't find the story interesting enough to want to watch it again. I enjoyed the action scenes.

"Vishal_s_kumar","9","0","1","10 April 2010"," Gotta keep running
","One of the best films in the exciting category of ""future technology and radical ideas run amok,"" Director Steven Spielberg's (Saving Private Ryan) Minority Report dazzles through its high-octane action and visuals that are both gritty and fantastically futuristic, while at the same time the film thematically explores the dangerous world of pre-judgment and the quandary of pitting personal liberties and freedom of choice -- not to mention the moral, ethical, and judicial nightmare that is the notion that one may be found guilty of a crime that has yet to be committed -- against the guise of making the world a safer place. While other films similarly explore the dangers and downsides of the role of advanced technologies in futuristic settings, Minority Report proves the best of the bunch for its ability to counter the wonderfully-realized visuals of a bright and glossy utopian future world with an examination of the dark and disquieting elements that under the surface make it so, with superb special effects and exceptional actions scenes in tow to make it a complete Science Fiction picture.<br/><br/>In the year 2054, Washington, D.C. has become one of the safest cities in the world. Premeditated murder has virtually disappeared, and crimes of passion are at an all-time low thanks to the Department of Precrime and the work of the Precogs, a trio of individuals with the capability to see future murders unfold and allow the would-be assailants to be arrested before they've had the opportunity to commit their heinous acts. The Department is headed by John Anderton (Tom Cruise), a divorced man who years earlier lost his son before the arrival of the Precogs. The program having proved a rousing success in the nation's capital, it's on the verge of going national, and Danny Witwer (Colin Farrell), a representative from the Attorney General's office, has arrived for one final inspection of the process. When Anderton finds himself identified by the Precogs as a would-be assailant in a future murder, he must go on the run in an effort to clear his name of a crime he has yet to commit. In the process, he becomes privy to information that could jeopardize the future of the Precrime division while unearthing further disturbing information surrounding the project's origins.<br/><br/>Though perhaps most readily identifiable by its stunning action scenes and nearly impeccable and highly-advanced special effects, Minority Report is, at its core, a cautionary tale that, like the best of Science Fiction, incorporates ideas that may be seen as relevant today but framed within the worlds of tomorrow. Based on a story by the famed Science Fiction writer Phillip K. Dick, Minority Report tackles some hard-hitting questions about not only one possible future of the American justice system, but also the impact of highly-advanced technologies on personal liberties. Is the future set? Is there no personal choice? Is one possible outcome of an as- of-yet physically unrealized future event enough to accuse, convict, and punish a man for a crime that ultimately went uncommitted? Spielberg, through the prism of Dick's story, manages to mesh a brilliant philosophical undertone with a big-budget special effects extravaganza, the film is a rare movie going experience that manages to be both very smart and a lot of fun at the same time.<br/><br/>Indeed, Minority Report's invigoratingly deep and incredibly well-integrated thematic structure only helps in making the picture a complete experience that delivers everything the modern movie going audience could hope for in a film such as this. The tale of the hunter becoming the hunted and suddenly forced to more personally understand what it is he's done to others and experience firsthand how the system he heretofore so enthusiastically embraced can fail when forced to look at it while on the other side of the law lends yet another added layer of tension and purpose to the film, further accentuating the questions raised throughout the story. Featuring a quality cast, Minority Report still isn't a movie that's sold by its stars. Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, and Max von Sydow don't disappear into their roles, but they do embrace them wholeheartedly and all deliver convincing performances that, again, only accentuate both the heavier themes and exciting action pieces that define the movie. Cruise is Cruise, his character not all that different than other roles he's played (his John Anderton seems at least partially reminiscent of Ethan Hunt), but the actor manages to capture the feel of the movie superbly and convey enough raw emotion in conjunction with his abilities as an Action star to play the part very well in each of its several layers of complexity. Just as importantly, the picture's special effects are not only seamless, they're cool; and in conjunction with the wonderfully-choreographed action pieces and Composer John Williams' (Star Wars) heart-racing score, Minority Report proves a wonderful movie when examined from every angle."

"moviesleuth2","9","0","1","28 November 2009"," A tense and absorbing thriller
","Movies are only effective if they involve the viewer; we can't enjoy someone's story if we don't care about what happens to them. In general, the best way to do this (at least for a mainstream movie) is to present a strong story. Based on the short story by Philip K. Dick, ""Minority Report"" is a tense thriller that poses a number of intriguing ethical questions.<br/><br/>Welcome to the era of PreCrime: a world without murder. Three special people, known as the PreCogs, are about to predict murders before they happen. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) works for the PreCrime division, and is passionate that it works. But when the PreCogs predict that he is going to commit a murder, Anderton has to find out why before he is caught.<br/><br/>If you could see into the future, does that mean that what you saw is really going to happen? Can someone change their mind at the last minute? Is it right to arrest someone for a crime that they were going to commit, but hadn't done it yet? These questions lie at the heart of ""Minority Report,"" and fortunately they are not mentioned then disregarded; the whole storyline revolves around answering them.<br/><br/>Despite his bizarre off-screen antics, Tom Cruise is a good actor. This is certainly one of his best performances. Anderton is a man who uses this opportunity to battle personal demons, although it only partly works. He is deeply troubled by his past, and that conflict makes Anderton an almost tragic figure. Cruise plays the part perfectly, and we never stop rooting for him. Colin Farrell is effective in his breakout role as Danny Witwer, the agent from the Judicial System who begins snooping around PreCrime, perhaps to take over John's job. Max von Sydow brings a deep note of class to the film as PreCrime's director, and John's mentor, Lamar Burgess. It's an effective performance, and for a man who could easily play an elderly man, von Sydow is certainly an arresting figure. Samantha Morton has the most difficult part as Agatha, one of the PreCogs. She's bizarre, acting as if she's on some sort of a drug. But Morton allows us to peek beneath to see her lucidity. Kathryn Morris, the always wonderful Lois Smith, and Mike Binder are good in bit parts, while Tim Blake Nelson and Peter Stormare steal scenes in terrifically loopy performances.<br/><br/>This is Steven Spielberg's best film since ""Saving Private Ryan."" He keeps the pace up, and shows us that he's still a director, and not just a name on a marquee. Spielberg has a vivid imagination and brings everything to life. This is a science fiction film, but it is grounded in reality enough that it is plausible that everything that happens in this film could be real in the near future. The film is well-paced and put together; it's a complex plot, and deals with some serious ethical questions, but it's never confusing. Special note goes to his music selection. Spielberg mixes some classical music into the film very effectively, and the soundtrack by John Williams represents some of his best work.<br/><br/>The only problem I have with the film is that in one scene, it breaks the rules the film functions by for its own convenience. That being said, most people won't notice (or care).<br/><br/>Note: while the action sequences are pretty standard stuff (albeit well-shot and choreographed), the flashbacks of murders are pretty graphic. This really pushes the boundaries of PG-13."

","Recap: John Anderton is the chief officer at Pre Cog DC, a department that with the aid of three clairvoyant humans stop and arrest murderers before they have their crime. As a result of this, murders are virtually extinct in the capital, and the system is now beginning to go nationwide. Before this, the FBI want to investigate the system and sends agent Danny Witwer. Witwer and Anderton come at odds from the beginning and it turns catastrophically worse when the Pre Cogs see a now rare premeditated murder, where the perpetrator is John Anderton. Now he is a fugitive and need to find out why he will murder a man he has never met.<br/><br/>Comments: Another of these high budget, special effects filled blockbusters based on a Philip K Dick novel. And in my mind his novels need a high budget and it need to be packed with special effects. Because Minority Report, like many of Dick's novel, is set in the future and is highly speculative in both science and fantasy. To visualize these ideas that you need a lot of CGI.<br/><br/>But those ideas, those effects are what make Minority Report entertaining. And it is very entertaining. It manages to balance this immense load of special effects with just an immense philosophical question. It all goes down to if there is free will or not. Are we able to really choose for ourselves, or are we just imagining that we can but are ultimately controlled by ""fate"". For Anderton, and hence for us, this question is really put to the edge. Is he able to avoid committing the crime, and the police, or is he destined for a fate worse than death. To find that out Anderton takes us on a wild, entertaining ride.<br/><br/>Basically, when you sit down to watch this movie you have a choice, well if you believe in that. You can either just lean back and enjoy the ride, or you can be active and ponder the philosophical question the is the foundation of the movie. Or, and this is what make this movie special, you can actually do both.<br/><br/>As a bonus you have a few cameos and a small but hilarious (at least for us Swedes) role for Peter Stormare.<br/><br/>A movie to really enjoy, both when you watch it and afterwards when it almost is inevitable to think about it.<br/><br/>8/10"
"Reef-Shark","9","0","1","6 July 2009"," One of the best sci-fi films of all time
","Minority Report, I would say, is one of the best science fiction films to be released over the past twenty-five years, and that is certainly no small feat given some of the competing films released over that time-span. Minority Report obviously had a lot of effort put into it by both the filmmakers and its actors and the result is a brilliant thriller. In the past decade I would call it Spielberg's best, ranking among his other great thrillers, 'Raiders of the Lost Ark', and 'Jaws'.<br/><br/>The movies is based on a short story by the late sci-fi master Philip K. Dick (Blade Runner, Total Recall, A Scanner Darkly) and it ranks up with Blade Runner as the greatest adaptations of his work. John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is the Chief of the Pre-Crime division in the District of Columbia. What exactly is his job? To use the unusual psychic abilities of three beings – known as ""Pre-Cogs""- it is his job to analyze future crime scenes and prevent murder from happening. For ten years this system works without a flaw and they are close to taking the program national, only there's one problemJohn's name has been called for the future-murder of Leo Crow –a man he has never once before met. On the run Anderton must evade the highly controlled security of the future United States capital all while trying to prove his innocence, and in so doing unraveling the secrets of the system- secrets that would destroy everything the organization has worked so hard to achieve.<br/><br/>What really makes this movie stand out is not the visual effects (though, they certainly are amazing), but it is the human aspect of this film that makes it a memorable experience for the audience. The film manages to cater to all human emotions contained within the plot, from the fear of loss, obsession, greed, fear, insecurity, and many more. All the characters are found to be believable, as none of them come across as being cardboard, as so many other action films do.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise pulls a very believable performance and I consider this one of the best of his ""Average Joe"" performances. By this I mean like in 'War of the Worlds' he doesn't come across as being a superhero, as he was in the 'Mission Impossible' franchise. He is perfectly believable as a sad soul who only wishes to make up for his past mistakes and punish the criminals of the world. Haunted by tragedy of the past we can't help but sympathize for his loss, because we can believe him. This isn't a straight-forward ""tragic"" character, such as Kurt Russell's Colonel O'Neil in 'Stargate' (1994). John Anderton is suffering, but he hides it well, going on with his job. In fact his loss is his drive in his work, so naturally he can't believe it when the system turns against him. It's the compelling characters and performances from the actors that make the difference between a good movie and a great movie. Special effects have nothing to do with the quality of the human element of the story (sorry, Michael Bay).<br/><br/>The special effects of this film are amazing, providing a believable, yet still fascinating view of the future. Unlike visions presented in Blade Runner, and to a certain degree Total Recall, this is a very clean, well kept design for the future. All the buildings shine and all vehicles appear to be in tip-top condition, but like those other Dick based films the underlying structure of society is as corrupt as ever. How the effect crew for this film was skipped over by the Academy I will never understand, because even two years after I first saw the film many of the visuals remain stuck in my mind.<br/><br/>You should not miss Minority Report, because in my opinion it is one of the best films ever made, let alone one of the best science fiction films ever made. For a thrilling, emotional, and mentally stimulating movie experience I can't recommend Minority Report strongly enough to give the film credit, for it goes above and beyond what so many other films have done. So, if you want excitement and brain stimulating ideas forget the garbage of the current theater's films, such as ""Transformers,"" and do yourself a favor: forget that an action movie is not supposed to be dominated by pure special effects and action, go out, buy a copy of Minority Report, put it in your DVD player, sit down, and enjoy a non-stop thrill ride of a movie."
"walsh-22","9","0","1","1 July 2009"," Edge of the seat action
","Minority Report is one of the best sci-fi/action film that I have seen in a while, it is in the same vein as Blade Runner.<br/><br/>The story is a very interesting one. In the future, they can predict murders before they happen (who will be the murderer and who the victim) but as the film proves it doesn't matter how perfect the system looks, it still has flaws and can be used unscrupulously by someone with a bad agenda which happens in the case of John Cruise's character John Anderton. He lost his son and he believes in the system and even enforces it but it isn't till it is used against him that he realises it is not a perfect system.<br/><br/>The special effects are amazing and the action really does have you on the edge of your seat. I like that the film is very unpredictable, you really don't know how it will end especially when Anderton is faced with the man he thinks took his son and you wonder if he will really kill the man. Also, you wonder how Anderton will get out of the situation when everything is against him and you are really left wondering right up to the end of the film how it will be resolved and how Max Von Sydow (Lemar) will be brought to justice, I really enjoyed the twist at the end."

Cruise is very effective as the elite D.C. cop, who is haunting by the troubled memories of his past. Two-Time Oscar Winner Janusz Kaminski's cinematography is visually arresting with Alex McDowell's (The Crow, Dark City, The Lawnmover Man) great production designs. Also the Oscar-winning visual effects company Industrial, Light and Magic (ILM) are superb.<br/><br/>The two disc set of ""Minority Report"" offers some fine special features (Which are mostly featurettes). Disc one has an sharp anamorphic Widescreen (2.35:1) transfer and an strong Dolby Digital 5.1 Surround Sound (Also in DTS Surround Sound). Disc two offers some fascinating behind the scenes featurettes with interviews from the cast and crew & more. The movie has some great action sequences and as well for fascinating story ideas. Samantha Morton is memorable as the strongest of the three PreCogs Agatha. ""Minority Report"" is no doubt entertaining but it's a bit too long. Since it's Spielberg's first film noir set in the future is quite harsh. One of the highlights is Five-Time Oscar Winner John Williams' (Star Wars Series, Empire of the Sun, War of the Worlds ""2005"") excellent music score.

","This movie has a smart plot and good performances. Tom Cruise is very good as the Chief John Anderton. The strength of the film is that it put in doubt that people's fate is already written and can't be changed.<br/><br/>Even though I liked ""Minority Report"" I still think that it could have been much better in a more entertaining way, I am not saying that this is a boring movie, not at all, I mean that its biggest problem is that it last too much (145 minutes), because of that there are certain parts that are a little boring. I think that 2 hours would have been perfect. Other thing I didn't like was the lack of colors of the shots, they look too dark.<br/><br/>The plot is about Chief John Anderton who catches future killers before they murder thanks to 3 people who see the murders in their dreams before they are done , but one day John Anderton see in their dreams that he is one of the killers who will commit a murder.

","Minority Report is set in 2054 nine years after the PreCrime program was implemented in Washington D.C., a pilot program in which mutant psychics known as PreCogs foresee murders & PreCrime officers arrest the future murderer on grounds of intent. There hasn't been a murder in Washington state for over six years & the program has a 100% success record. Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise) runs the PreCrime unit but is shocked when the PreCogs predict he will kill a man named Leon Crow in less than a day, a man Anderton has never even met. The PreCogs have never been wrong so Anderton goes on the run in an attempt to discover who set him up, why, how & change his future...<br/><br/>Directed by Steven Spielberg & based on a short story by sci-fi author Philip K. Dick this dark & gritty big budget sci-fi action film can be considered amongst Spielberg's best, definitely not Spielberg's very best but not too far off it. The script by Jon Cohen & Scott Frank isn't typical Spielberg, there is a real edge to it with the leading hero a drug addict, a subplot involving child abduction & a vision of the not too distant future where murder can be predicted & those deemed responsible are put away for life without actually doing anything. The film makes the point that the future isn't set, that we choose our own destiny's & there's a strong anti technology message too. The film warns that technology is only as good & as reliable as those operating &/or controlling it, that there will always be human error or those who use the technology for their own advantage & that everything has at least one flaw. Minority Report is an intelligent sci-fi film with plenty of thoughtful themes, concepts, ideas & interesting parallels to the way our own society is going. The character's are good although Colin Farrell's FBI agent is almost totally wasted in a minor role. The mystery elements are good, the twists work well & make sense & there's a clever ending in which it is revealed how someone can commit a murder with the PreCrime system about. The future world in Minority Report seems very plausible, the story & plot are very good & the script has intelligence but if I was to criticise the film I would say that at well over two hours in length it's just too long.<br/><br/>The film looks wonderful throughout & the picture it paints of a future world is pretty convincing, from the constant bombardment of adverts which specifically target an individual to eye transplants to the way computers, cars & furniture looks. I would say a lot of time, effort & money was spent on the look of Minority Report & it show's, unfortunately while the sets, futuristic production design & props are superb Spielberg films everything in very muted sterile bland colours, everything has a pale blue, grey, white or black tone to it & I must admit it started to get on my nerves after a while. As I have already said Minority Report has a strong story but Spielberg also gives the audience some spectacular set-pieces including Anderton jumping from speeding car to speeding car, an exciting fight on a car assembly production line, a chase involving Anderton & some flying PreCrime cops to the visually stylish scene set in an apartment building where tiny mechanical spider go from room to room scanning the occupants eyes where Spielberg places his camera above the rooms & in one continuous shot pans across them looking down. The violence is fairly low, there are some fights & shoot-outs plus a couple of surgically removed eyeballs in a plastic bag.<br/><br/>With a budget exceeding $100,000,000 Minority Report looks fabulous as one would hope & expect, Spielberg know's how to turn in a great film & it show's here in an almost perfectly judged sci-fi action thriller that actually makes you think. The CGI computer effects are superb & some of the best out there, they actually add to the story as well as the look & the feel of the film. The acting is good, Cruise puts in a good performance (although I am not sure he was worth his reported $25,000,000+ salary) as does veteran actor Max von Sydow.<br/><br/>Minority Report is an excellent sci-fi thriller with plenty of spectacular action & a very absorbing & fairly intelligent script, add all that to a little Steven Spielberg magic & you have a great film. My only real problem with it is the length & once you have seen it & know the twists I am not sure how much replay value it has, I doubt I will want to see it again anytime soon."
"bobsgrock","9","0","1","31 May 2008"," One of the best of Spielberg.
","This is what Artificial Intelligence was supposed to be; a well-crafted, interesting and thought-provoking film about the near future and what it might be like. While Spielberg didn't completely fulfill that in his previous film, he remains unable to fail twice as Minority Report succeeds in all aspects. Of course, knowing Spielberg is at the helm and ILM is behind the scenes, this film is visually stunning in every single scene. The futuristic look of Washington DC very cool and sets the tone and mood of this story about a branch of the police force, the PreCrime Unit, that is able to stop crime before it happens. This occurs because of three ""PreCogs,"" which are essentially three people that live in a pool of mineral water and see images of the future constantly. The tables turn, however, when Chief John Anderton of the PreCrime unit (Tom Cruise) is accused of a future murder. He goes on a mission to find out the truth, believing he is innocent, and discovers more than he ever hoped for.<br/><br/>All plot points aside, this is definitely one of the best science fiction films of the last 25 years. Despite it being visually stunning, it still has characters of great depth and a storyline that covers a lot of ground. The acting is terrific with Cruise giving one of his best performances as the hunter who becomes the hunted. Colin Farrell is strong as a young federal agent dispatched to observe the PreCrime squad, and Max von Sydow is great to watch as the wise old man of this futuristic age. Everything works for this film. The story is intriguing, the acting is believable, and most important, it has the look and feel a near-future society where technology is a huge part of life, but not so much that it becomes ridiculous. As a suspense thriller, as an action film, and as a sci-fi look into the future, Minority Report succeeds and deserves to be called one of the best works of Steven Spielberg."
"vip_ebriega","10","0","1","28 May 2008"," Summer sci-fi attraction... with a brain.
","My Take: Another instant Spielberg thrill-a-minute classic is born. <br/><br/>How does Steven Spielberg do it? He creates one motion picture blockbuster after another, each one one of the best ones there are. Either it's a JURASSIC PARK or an E.T., or it's a next Best Picture Oscar contender as SHINDLER'S LIST, Spielberg is one hit-maker that doesn't seem to run out of gas. MINORITY REPORT is 2002's latest model, it's also one of Spielberg's finest. Not only is it an expensive summer attraction, MINORITY REPORT is also a clever, inventive ideal sci-fi movie with neat plot twists, intelligent plotting and some very inventive imaginations-come-to-life. This is more than just another special effects extravaganza that let your eyes feast upon. This time, your brain can enjoy it too.<br/><br/>Spielberg's view of the future isn't just a video game-inspired metropolis with nothing much happening but a lot of running and chasing. This one actually grows a plot and a brain. Taking place in 2054, the futuristic Washington D.C. lessens from crime and injustice thanks to an advanced system called ""Pre-crime"", an advanced computer system which makes use of Pre-cogs, three genetically altered humans who identify criminals before they commit their crimes. Futuristic cop John Anderton (Tom Cruise, out for another mission impossible) is one of the ""Pre-crime"" cops, but when he himself is framed for committing a murder (using his long grudge for the loss of his son), the tables have been turned, making Anderton the latest target of the perfect system he helped put up.<br/><br/>Visually, MINORITY REPORT is a blast of visual achievements. Special effects created by Industrial Light & Magic matched with Alex McDowell's imaginative production design provide a terrific amount of imaginative craftsmanship. The special effects here show how far we have come when it comes to effects craftsmanship, as well as how far our imaginations have advanced. But the movie isn't all special effects and flash, MINORITY REPORT is also a brilliantly plotted mystery thriller which delivers both the mystery and the thrills. The plot, based on Phillip K. Dick's story, is impressively put on screen without showing the little sense of stupidity. Spielberg doesn't dumb it down for the sake of special effects. He values the plot, characters and suspense as much, if not more, than the expensive effects and sets. This is sheer proof that Spielberg still knows the Hollywood film-making enterprise, and MINORITY REPORT is still one of his best contributions to the genre.<br/><br/>Rating: ***** out of 5."

And I also liked the storyline, which is where in the future, crimes are always prevented by using things called Pre-Cogs, which can show a crime before it happens. So, in a crime-less world, the police officer (Cruise) later learns that he will commit a murder and now, he must prevent it from happening.<br/><br/>The moral of the movie is, we all are tempted to murder someone. We all are tempted to do something bad. It's just, can we make the choice to act on it or not? And that's what makes it good."

","In the year 2054, John Anderton is an expert in the field of Pre-Crime, an experimental system in which three pre-cognitive savants can foresee murders and project their visions onto a screen, and the authorities can arrest the perpetrator before the crime has happened. All is well until John's next case shows him as the murderer. Is it true ? Has someone hacked the system ? He must escape and find out the truth ...<br/><br/>This is a great mix of cerebral science-fiction concept, police conspiracy thriller and blockbuster action movie. Apparently the script had a troubled gestation period featuring umpteen writers and producers, but the end result is a gripping, witty, biting storyline full of ironic twists - after a fight on a car production line our hero finds himself in a newly-made escape vehicle, when he's on the run the iris-recognition software in every store and electronic billboard shouts out his name as he passes, the ambitious detective unwittingly hands a killer the means with which to dispose of him, and the minority report of the title doesn't even exist in Anderton's case. It's also an eye-popping visual futurist's picture, with lots of interesting ideas - I love the wall-hugging cars and those nifty spider-ID machines, although the virtual-reality plasma screen that Cruise uses to push the pre-cogs' visualisations around is a bit silly. The big cast is impressive, with the three leads all strong and amusing performances by Stormare and Nelson particularly, but there are lots of rather anonymous characters as well. I also find the tone of this movie a bit uneven; the first two-thirds are quite escapist, with funny moments like the bit where Cruise chases his own eyeballs down the corridor, but the last forty minutes are rather gloomy, albeit intensely so. It's a great science-fiction film but it's very grey, and I think I would like it more if it were either epic fantasy, like Dune or The Fifth Element, or highly stylised, like Brazil or Blade Runner. It's still terrific entertainment though, made by a master of this genre, with a great hare-brained plot that just hurtles along and fabulous imagery throughout. Based on a short story by Philip K. Dick."

","Minority Report Science Fiction Action/Adventure <br/><br/>Spielberg. What do you think of when you hear that name? Whatever it is, you typically, eventually, think of Hollywood heavyweights. This is that guy that can direct anything he wants. He's on top of the world, and his pedestal is Hollywood. And yet, this is the first time I've ever reviewed one of his films. Guess I've been lingering around the crappy underground horror section too much at my local DVD haunts<br/><br/>Like most everything Spielberg has done since Schindler's List, this is another bleak, mildly depressing and somber film coupled with intense action and amazing visuals. The story revolves around Tom Cruise's character as ""the main guy"" in charge of a division of the Washington DC police department in charge of preventing future ""Pre-Crime"" crimesnamely murders. He got into it, of course, to prevent future horrors like kidnappingwhich is how he lost his son. Pretty quickly, a wild story is woven into the folds of this film as he is framed for the pre-murder of a man he's never met and uncovers disturbing secrets all around. All of this is flung around fantastic imagery and excellent special effects showing us the wild world of America, 2054.<br/><br/>Here's the breakdown:<br/><br/>The Good:<br/><br/>--The real stars of this film are the vast quantities of amazing special effects and imagery. Okay, sure, the special effects are simply computer-graphics for the most part, and overall, they're really quite good. There are moments of somewhat lackluster CGmostly in the animated living plants we see during one scene in the movie, but aside from that, top notch.<br/><br/>--Fantastic, intense action, fun to watchespecially with those great visuals.<br/><br/>--One of the better ""visions of the future"" we have.<br/><br/>--That, I think it's a Lexus, that with which Tom Cruise drives away from car's factory. That's a damn nice car. Lexus actually built it for the movieone wonders why they don't make 'em that cool now<br/><br/>--The acting is really well done, and the story is quite nice. It takes full advantage of the futuristic Science Fiction setting.<br/><br/>--Excellent Cinematography. Interesting use of blue hues and sheens throughout the entirety of the filmit adds a depressing, almost smothering feel to the film. Often, it's almost like a black and white movie, and very stark.<br/><br/>--Good music.<br/><br/>Didn't Hurt It, Didn't Help:<br/><br/>--One wonders what happened to the day when Spielberg made movies that weren't so damn dark and bleak. This is still a fun film, but no where near as fun as, say, an Indiana Jones flick. And the future does not look like a happy place. Seems it's more popular to make visions of the future as depressing and uninviting as possible. Still, it carries along the atmosphere quite well.<br/><br/>--Like I said, occasionally some of the CGmostly just on the ""living plants""seems kind of sloppy.<br/><br/>The Bad:<br/><br/>--Really, nothing I could say here that ruined the film.<br/><br/>The Ugly:<br/><br/>--Tom's dinner after his, uh, eye surgery.<br/><br/>Memorable Scene: --The jet-pack enhanced chase scene.<br/><br/>Acting: 9/10 Story: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10 Cinematography: 10/10 Character Development: 9/10 Special Effects/Make-up: 9/10 Nudity/Sexuality: 1/10 (extremely brief sexual references) Violence/Gore: 6/10 (some violence, mostly action suspense) Dialogue: 8/10 Music: 8/10 Direction: 9/10 <br/><br/>Cheesiness: 0/10 (relates to the dialog problem) Crappiness: 0/10<br/><br/>Overall: 9/10<br/><br/>Spielberg and Science Fiction fans will certainly enjoy this. As well as anyone looking for a brainy action/adventure flick. Brainy because of the rampant Sci-Fi talk and imagery.<br/><br/>(www.ResidentHazard.com)"

","In the year 2054, crime has been abolished. Three cognitive people are used to predict crimes before they occur; creating a police force or Pre-Crime. Chief John Anderton is head of his divisions, scrubbing through the images seen from the Precogs. The Precogs have never been wrong, but when Danny Witwer from the Federal Bearue investigates any possibilities of problems that may arise from this new type of investigation; things go arise. The Precogs fore tell a murder; the death of a man Leo Crow. When Anderton scrubs through the images, to his shock sees he is the perpetrator. Believing his innocence and is set up, Anderton is now on the run from his own people and starts to find out the mystery behind this murder before it occurs.<br/><br/>Based upon the book by Philip K. Dick, Minority Report is a bleak and haunting view of the future. Though the premise behind Pre-Crime is creating a safer society, but there is still that force of human nature that can change and effect the future beyond any precognition. The future Steven Spielberg is a very alienating place. The steely blue, harsh white and drowning gray washes make a ghostly, unfriendly place, when it is meant to be nothing short of safe. It heightens the underbelly of society, where all the malevolent forces are still at work, in places you don't expect.<br/><br/>Minorty Report has some great intelligent fundamentals. How can people be guilty of a crime if they never committed the crime, stopping a crime doesn't erase the fact that it was going to happen, is our future already written or do we have a choice in our fate. These woven with a great mystery and some spectaculars action makes a winning combination. This is one of the most intelligent mysteries in awhile, having so many layers to the story and depth in the characters.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise, Colin Farrell, Max von Sydow and Samantha Morton all brought great performances. Tom Cruise brought so much pain and guilt to Anderton, bringing out the flaws in his tormented character. Colin Farrell also great as Danny, same to Max von Sydow as Lamar Burgess. Samantha Morton evoked so much pain and misery as Agatha, tired of seeing so much pain from the murders she foretells. Though Lois Smith's Dr. Iris Hineman and Tim Blake Nelson's Gideon were overacted, they are a minor flaw in the other wise great acting. Spielberg does another perfect job of directing. Really hitting the bulls eye making a wonderful thrilling ride of a bleak future.<br/><br/>Minority Report is a surprising intelligent mystery from a master director, a spectacular, visually mind blowing watch."

Britain is made up of four countries not just one, I wish someday idiot Americans would realise that.<br/><br/>Anyway enough of that, on with the film. The plot goes something like this. There are three Precogs, genetically enhanced humans, who predict when future murders are going to happen. The system is that they predict the murders and the police officers find the people and arrest them for murders they were going to commit. John Anderton is one of these police officers, who believed in the system, and thought it was perfect. Only when he is predicted to commit a future murder, he has to run from the system in a desperate attempt to find out who the person is he's going to murder and why he it was predicted that he would kill him.<br/><br/>A good film from a great director. Good acting throughout, Tom Cruise as usual gives an excellent performance, Collin Farell is also good. This another Stephen Spielberg classic. The story ties together nicely at the end, and it's great the way he unravels more and more of the truth while trying to hide from his former colleagues who are trying to catch him. It also raises the question of, can you arrest someone for a crime they are going to commit? This film has some good twists and turns to it, and is excellent entertainment value. I guarantee you will enjoy watching this film. Before I finish I just have to say.<br/><br/>My passport says ""The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland"", not England.

"jboothmillard","7","0","3","12 September 2005"," Minority Report
","Director Steven Spielberg (Jaws, Raiders of the Lost Ark, E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial, Schindler's List, Saving Private Ryan) returned to his science-fiction routes with A.I. Artificial Intelligence, and this one followed a year later, and it also followed the darker feel brought from his war films. Set in the year 2054, the crime in Washington D.C. has been virtually eliminated (by 90%) with the help of the squad ""Precrime"", using three genetically altered humans known as ""Precogs"" with powers to see into the future and predict crimes before they happen. Unfortunately for Precrime head Chief John Anderton (Tom Cruise), he is seen to be committing a murder, and he is now on the run trying both to escape identification and capture, and prove his innocence, as he does no know the future victim. He decides that he will need help from the key ""Precog"" Agatha (Samantha Morton), especially for his ""minority report"", i.e. what happens to him after the murder, so he kidnaps her. She knows quite a lot about future events, and when John finally gets to the man he is meant to murder, it becomes apparent that he may actually have a reason to. After he has sealed his future, John decides to trace the start of the ""Precrime"" program, and that means exposing Director Lamar Burgess (Max Von Sydow) for how it actually came to be, and in the end saving both himself and the ""Precogs"". Also starring Colin Farrell as Danny Witwer, Lois Smith as Dr. Iris Hineman, Peter Stormare as Dr. Solomon Eddie, Tim Blake Nelson as Gideon, Steve Harris as Jad, Kathryn Morris as Lara Clarke and Mike Binder as Leo Crow. Cruise is quite a good lead, but I think it is mainly the quite engaging story and fantastic special effects that make this more than just mystery thriller. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Sound Editing, and it was nominated the BAFTA for Best Special Visual Effects. Tom Cruise was number 32 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, he was also number 25 on The 100 Greatest Sex Symbols, and he was number 81 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons. Very good!"
"Farp_rock","8","0","1","31 March 2005"," Another visionary masterpiece from Spielberg
","Minority Report is possibly the most conceptually brilliant motion picture you will see. Steven Spielberg creates another masterpiece, a truly incredible visionary, he sets himself above all other filmmakers with this awe-inspiring film which truly has to be seen to be believed. Technically, this film is brilliant. Brilliantly shot, produced, scored and acted all vital components are of a tremendous standard. This film is so complicated and multi-layered, that I can't help but believe any other filmmaker would be unable to make the movie. The sheer amount of flashbacks and the visions of the pre-cogs and the conspiracy element, could potentially be confusing but Spielberg's gift of telling a story ensures this film is engaging and uses the layers as a benefit to show the sheer depth of his masterpiece.<br/><br/>Spielberg has a wonderful quality in terms of using old fashioned cinematic techniques of making a good movie. All the components at a human level have to be right; then he brings out the most incredible groundbreaking special effects, and interweaves it with the human element to make it all seamless. A true gift. <br/><br/>Tom Cruise is superb as John Anderton in this movie, a great anti-hero, a man driven by the loss of his son; he blames himself and turns to drugs to combat the problems he has. He believes fully in the pre-crime experiment as a law enforcement cop, but is forced to find the flaws of the system when the pre-cogs envisage Cruise is the next man to commit a murder. Cruise then must be on the run from the state as well as undercover the darkest secrets to the system we are told is perfect. This film is a film-noire with sci-fi, thriller qualities and a futuristic detective movie at the same time, its truly the most original and incredible film you are going to see in a long time. There are truly horrifying images which you would not necessarily expect from a Spielberg picture, the eye operation where Cruise gets his eyes removed is chilling. The image of the Spyders- these robotic spiders were ingenious as well as the futuristic mechanisms and transportation devices were awe-inspiring. And the scary thing is these devices are what the greatest minds in science currently believe the outlook of our world will be like in 50yrs time.<br/><br/>The way the film is shot while being interwoven with a provoking JOhn Williams score, the picture quality was tinted with a grainy quality a dark blue tinge, to make what you were seeing something beyond reality, it created a dark dirty outlook of the movie. If you were being extra-critical however, i felt there were slight flaws to the movie. The ending i felt dragged at the end. The ending was still good and important to the movie, but i felt it was guilty of often over-explaining at the end. The scene where Cruise is faced by Lamarr the head of everything, (guilty of conspiring against Anderton)with a gun, Cruise then proceeds to sum up and then explain what the effect shooting Cruise would be. Putting Lamarr in a quandary basically saying his actions would prove or disprove his pre-crime vision etc.I got the impression we as the audience were slapped around the face with the information. It was as if the last 10minutes were made because they believed the audience would be lost and we needed to be put up to speed. I didn't feel it was necessary, and i thought somethings could have been left unsaid and give the audience a chance to think for themselves at the end. The film was never guilty of it during the movie-why suddenly the last part? I also felt the movie could be accused of slight contradiction. SPielberg through-out the movie made a dark menacing picture effectively portraying the flaws of a society where your privacy is none existent and you are a mere pawn of the state. No matter where you go your eyes will be your source of ID to keep the state's tabs on you. This is a commentary on what is a distinct possibility to what is going to happen to us in the future. Spielberg portrays this as a detriment to society effectively. Yet, the final scene where pre-crime is abandoned, Cruise is now back with his ex-wife and shes expecting a new child and the pre-cogs are sent to a peaceful area where they can live in peace and happiness. I got the impression it was all too easy to swallow, completely different to the outlook in the movie earlier. The last scene didn't encourage you to have a sense of fear about what the future could hold (which you are encouraged to believe through-out the film) yet the ending makes it all alright again.<br/><br/>I believe the ending to be a flaw, however that is being extra-critical, on a movie basis it is a wonderful thought-provoking picture. AN astonishing peace of modern cinema. It is exciting, and brilliantly made. A groundbreaking piece of modern cinema, made by the greatest film maker of our generation."

","""Minority Report"" features the typical science fiction innovation of over-the-top technology circa Steven Spielberg's vision of 2050 America: jumping scanners, perilous highway sectors, flying and tracking robots, booster rockets, and of course, advanced PreCrime technology that enables police officers to thwart homicides before they even occur and apprehend the suspect from committing the crime ever again. This system has been proved effective (not a single murder has occurred in the greater Washington D.C. area in several years), yet just when PreCrime is about to expand its divisions nationally, something horrible and seemingly irrevocable occurs: its chief official, John Anderton (Tom Cruise) is prognosticated to be the perpetrator of the murder of a complete stranger, Leo Crow, within 24 hours. Having recently lost his son to abduction, currently depressed with drugs and sobbing away at the memory of his ""happy family"", this recent development succeeds in devastating and enraging John Anderton. Thus ensues a ruthless chase by the system to apprehend a ""certain, yet confused"" suspect. John of course is bemused and frightened at this indictment of murder, and will stop at virtually nothing, dodging his former ""allies against crime"", altering parts of his body to elude security detectors, and abducting a primal ""precog"" (humans programmed to mind censors in pools to prognosticate murders) Agatha (Samantha Morton) to escape his captors and discover the truth behind his indictment in this mysterious and baffling murder. Rife with fascinating ""who dunnit"" scenarios, classic chase sequences, and plot contortions galore, yet featuring a perplexing and somewhat unresolved conclusion, ""Minority Report"" is an exceptional, if perplexing, piece of science fiction suspense that is entertaining, inquisitive, deceiving and wildly provocative. Spielberg's direction is remarkably stirring and subtle, and is orchestrated without much of his signature regard to sentimentality, but rather, criminality. Tom Cruise is attractive and menacing as John Anderton, as an innocent, yet perturbed fugitive on the lam sorting the pieces of PreCrime together. Colin Ferrell is sharp and engaging as the ""villain"" Witwer seeking to steal Anderton's position and capture him with malice and eagerness. ""Minority Report"" is an enjoyable and fascinating, if perplexing and disjointed, science fiction thriller that is entertaining through and through and a genuine thinking man's futuristic whodunnit. *** out of ****"

","Cheesy at times, but that's about the worst thing I could possibly say about this film. It's chock-full-o'-imagination, featuring an uncountable amount of things in their futuristic state (such as cars, drugs, and of course, the law-enforcement). Deeply philosophical, and engrossing, the film tackles several issues of morality. In my opinion, the plot is absolutely intriguing, as the viewer is pulled through a series of events which leave one stunned and confused. Little by little the truth is revealed, in such a way that it is on the tip of our tongue until finally it is reaffirmed, or in most cases, we understand the truth only after Cruise thinks it up on his own. In any case, I would recommend this to anyone who has an interest in crime-drama, philosophy, action, sci-fi or simply anyone who dislikes films that drag on, scene by scene with predictability. I could watch it over and over and never get sick of it."
"Pedro_H","7","0","1","11 December 2004"," Visually dazzling film with one or two good ideas!
","Tom Cruise plays the murder squad policeman of tomorrow (2054) - here murder is prevented before the act by means of a set of ""PreCogs."" Water-bound, drugged up humans (give Amnesty International a call) with the special gift of predicting the future. Therefore the central ""murder"" doesn't actually happen - some jackbooted SWAT team bursts in through the skylight just before the act. <br/><br/>Bar the whiz-bang technology (which we will return to) we have a society a lot like today (only they don't swear as much!), where people eat, sleep and work without the need of tinfoil suits or magic pills. Cars do drive themselves though!<br/><br/>We have Steven Spielberg in his, now common, ""reluctant"" director role. Let us not get in to ""Billboard"" politics, but I don't understand the man-inside beyond his need for constant pats on the back, recognition and applause. While noted as a nice and charitous guy - and he is - that doesn't mean he doesn't also have a fair sized ego.<br/><br/>(He even helped form his own studio - Dreamworks - then he goes off to work for another! When you form/CO-form a business isn't it best to work for it rather than a competing rival? Or does show biz have another version of common-sense?)<br/><br/>The problem with industrial technology (within the film itself) is that designers do not design superfluous parts for the purpose of them looking dramatic to the casual observer. Doesn't make any sense. But when you do have nonsense don't underline it by some kind of pseudo intellectual explanation as to why coloured balls have to roll down long plastic tubes before you can announce a would-be murderer - just let it pass!<br/><br/>Minority Report is a clear example of reverse writing. Like coming up with a joke - you come up with a good punch line and work backwards to come up with a scenario that could lead you to that point. This comes up with a mixed bag of possible cliff-hanger clichés or twists to work towards - and the fact that Cruise's child has been killed (by persons unknown) sent my eyeballs a-rolling. <br/><br/>Before we know it John Anderton (Tommy Cruise) is - for reasons a child could guess at - on the run from his former pals down at Nazi Jack Boot Central: and, as further expected, he leads them a merry dance up hill and down dale. This takes up a lot of the story and to be frank, goes on at least fifteen minutes too long. As we all know flight is only any good if you have somewhere to actually run to.<br/><br/>While this is the Tom-and-tech show (the only love interest in the movie is his late son), it is good to see the Swedish veteran actor Max Von Sydow still in work after over a hundred films. Quite a few better than this and plenty made on the money this production spent on lunch.<br/><br/>Steven S's has a poor record when casting Johnny Foreigner and I was sad to see his long-standing theme of foreigners (non Americans) not being trustworthy continues. Can't say anymore - but it leaves a lasting bad taste in mouth, just as much as the visual images leave a lasting impression on the eye."

","I don't like Science Fiction movies but this is something special!!!! I believe that a Sci-Fi scenario is nothing special. Just a fantasy of a writer and nothing more. A fairy-tale from the future. Any scenario mismatch can be covered by the innovative technology of the future generations. This advanced technology allows the characters to do everything someone can imagine, and there is no limit on mechanical evolution even if it is useless. A robot standing on two legs or a flying car are not to be evoluted by reasonable scientist for everyday functions. Although this film puts all this on a secondary level. It focuses on the main characters personalities and the problems their are facing. Using Science Fiction to raise moral questions. Simply fantastic!!!!"

But I've also read the script that was used for this one; I noticed how Spielberg eliminated the pay off for the ""one eyed man being king"".<br/><br/>In our point of view, we get an arc for Colin Farrel's character.

"jaspoet","Null","0","1","4 August 2004"," An interesting futuristic film noir dealing with moral and emotional issues.
","Minority Report is an interesting tribute to film noir, sci-fi and the works of doyle, christie an hammett. But the orwellian vision created by Steven Spielberg owes as much to Kubrick's 1971 classic CLOCK WORK ORANGE as it does to the script by Frank Scott or the original short story by Philip Dick. The basic theme of ""how much are we willing to give up to exist in a safe society"" was already handled and handled brilliantly by Kubrick in 1971. This film tackles it in a more conventional (commercial) way and works on many levels. The acting is first rate, the plot is involving and intelligent, the atmosphere is haunting and the emotional center is held together by Tom Cruise who does his best to draw us into his world and share his peril. I enjoyed the film, especially Samantha Morton's portrayal of the lead pre-cog, Agatha. She is always mysteriously intriguing and completely balances the pain and sadness of her role. I was especially thrilled to see the visual tributes to CLOCKWORK ORANGE that spielberg laced into the film. Overall the third act does border on melodrama but I found it effective nonetheless. Minority Report is highly recommended for those who want to wrestle with the moral dilemma of solving crimes before they happen and the challenges of keeping a good concept and system honest, in the face of corruption. It also raises the question of how to rationalize the murder of one person for the benefit of the many, all topics that should draw discussion after the end credits fade."

","Coming off of the depressing, and reprehensible bomb AI: Artificial Intelligence, it is no wonder why Spielberg made another more positive movie set in the future. If you did not like AI because of the future-enoir feel then you will love this cheery more positive and though-provoking look at fate, destiny and metaphysics.<br/><br/>Overlooked by the Oscars and Golden Globes, this movie is in a class by itself. This movie is perhaps the greatest visual and audio edited masterpiece of all times. The great Polish Cinematographer Janus Kaminski goes into abstract form in this class Sci-Fi movie, no wonder why Spielberg hires him for every film.<br/><br/>Colin Ferrell proves that he is one of Hollywood's A-list actors and gives a superb performance in a really overlooked role. Tom Cruise himself was great in this role, breaking out of his blockbuster shell. The support cast of Neal McDonough, Steve Harris, Patrick Kilpatrick and Kathryn Morris do great jobs too. But it's the roles played by Samantha Morton and Max Von Sydow, the great Swedish actor, who capture the intensity of this picture, which is not really about ""some dude running from enemies.""<br/><br/>This movies is a combination of ""1984"" mixed with ""Mission: Impossible"" and then it adds another element of deeply philosophical context. If you are into different and uniquely styled films or if you appreciate new innovations in sound and picture technology then pick this gem up and I think you will agree that it was the most overlooked film of the past years.<br/><br/>Mark"

","First of all, let me say I write this comment, because I think the last one was unfair for the movie.<br/><br/>I saw it again last night, and despite the fact that I knew the ending, I realized why I liked it. It's a sci-fi thriller, but it is not based entirely on special effects. It has a whole story behind it, that keeps you until the very end. Most of the users in here, can't stop mentioning plot holes (one said something about a date in 2054!!!), or predictability (another had foresaw the bad guy halfway through the film), and staff like that. But what I would like to outline, is the performance of Samantha Morton. She is just perfect in the role of Agatha and she has some of the finest scenes in the movie, not to mention that terrific look she has when that gadget guy won't believe she is a precogn. She makes you feel so sorry for her, because you see she feels great pain, every time she sees a murder. She is excellent. If I had to mention something that bothered me, that would be the duration of the film. I think it's over 2 hours, but at least there's nothing useless there, what you see is necessary for the plot. The effects look like they are indeed from the year 2054, the action scenes are decent enough and the photography is very good.     <br/><br/>Overall, a very enjoyable, mind-teasing film.

I must say, I was spellbound.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around the Washington, D.C. area ""Precrime Initiative."" Three ""precognitives,"" psychics of extraordinary ability, are connected to machines that monitor their neural patterns. This system gives the D.C. police the ability to see murders before they happen, and stop them.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise gives an excellent performance. One believes him throughout the film, and he brings it a very human face. Through the course of the film, the viewer also meets some truly unique characters, from Iris Hineman, the co-creator of the Precrime system, who has a very unique exposition role, to Gideon, the slightly macabre sentry of Precrime's containment system.<br/><br/>Of course, one could hardly have a movie without a plot, and Minority Report delivers a great one. The movie is a great twist on a murder mystery, and it keeps you breathless until the end. On repeat viewings, too, you'll probably catch even more of the plot, since this is a very pleasantly complex movie.<br/><br/>Of course, I would be remiss if I didn't mention the special effects and the action. They are some of the most convincing I've ever seen in a movie. In a sense, though, they're so great that you forget they're there! The camera doesn't pull huge establishing shots to make you say ""wow."" You just do, because it's so seamless, and nobody in the film seems overawed at the technology around them. The action is exciting and intense. There are well-choreographed fights and some other amazing action. The movie is breathtaking.<br/><br/>Give Minority Report a spin. I think you'll be as impressed as I was."

","I loved this movie. I was about ten minutes into the movie before I knew that it was going to be a great movie. It does a great job of explaining the technology in the beginning. This is a movie that deserves to go down in movie history. <br/><br/>One interesting thing about the movie, that I saw, was the likeness it has to Mission Impossible. I mean I kept expecting people to call Tom Cruises character Ethan instead of John. The two plots are amazingly similar. I mean this guy is a good guy, but then he gets set up by someone on the inside. Then he has to get proof that he was set up and all that. Then the dramatic plot twist at the end. If you look at it right you'll see the two movies have basically the same plot line.<br/><br/>Another thing I found funny about the film was John last name was Anderton. It would have just made the movie that much funnier if Hugo Weaving had popped out at some point in time and said something like, ""Mr. Anderton, welcome back."" <br/><br/>The last thing I really liked about it was how at one point it seemed like the movie was going to end, but then it went on for another half an hour or so. That just made the movie a classic for me. <br/><br/>All in all I think this movie has just everything that is needed to make a good movie. I would give it a 10/10."

You could just tell Farrell was having fun breaking Cruise's balls...At least I hope he was....It's always a pleasure to see Max Von Sydow, a consumate professional. Samantha Morton was good in her role as the 'pre-cog'. I haven't read the source material this movie was based on so as far as that goes I have no idea how faithful it was, not that I really care. Whether the movie is good or bad has nothing to do with it's source material. If the movie's good, then it's good. As I said, this is fun escapist, easily forgotten fluff.

The idea of watching the movie was stuck in my head for quite a while. Then, I finally rented it and watched it.<br/><br/>It starts off exciting and leads the viewer right into the action (not surprising with Cruise). Almost immediately you learn about the future world and how cool it really is. There are upside down highways, plants that practically kill people, and those guys who can take out your eyes for $1000. Yes, that's right, $1000 dollars. You even get to see what it looks like, too. <br/><br/>I was impressed with Cruise's role and the way he took it on. The same goes for Max von Sydow, and Colin Farrell. Together, all three made this movie what its potential was and it showed.<br/><br/>What really saves this movie in the end, though, is the eye change. I was surprised when the movie was finished of how much I enjoyed it. It is truly one of Tom Cruise's classics and everybody who loves Sci-Fi movies should watch this. It is defiantly worth while."

","I don't have much to add to what others have already said as far as praise, but I would like to offer a rebuttal to the reviewers who say it is filled with plot-holes. This isn't a movie for the casual movie fan--one must pay pretty close attention to catch everything. I think they call this style an intellectual thriller? I've watched the movie several times and the more familiar I become with the film, I see fewer and fewer holes if any. I'd say it has more plot-twists than plot-holes. If you search for the holes, you will find them, yes, but I find it to be very believable for the most part. Most ""problems"" with the plot can be attributed to human error. ""They forgot to cut off Anderton's access??"" Yeah, I can believe that. I doubt they honestly expected him to be able to get that close to them anyway. Hey, and if he doesn't get access, well then we don't have much of a movie then, do we? Other ""holes"" I'd rather not delve into here, but with any of them, I'm able to see a counterargument, and thus acknowledge the plot as possible. As with any sci-fi movie, it's best to maintain an open-mind and not try to count things as impossible before really considering them. Top-notch movie with many surprises."

","Tom Cruise's character is perhaps my favorite thing about this thought-provoking Spielberg film. I honestly cannot easily think of a hero who is much more flawed than he is. This is a drug-addict with a short temper, who looks to the new pre-crime unit for hope after his six-year-old son was abducted.<br/><br/>Now, to make a movie about arresting criminals before they have committed the act, the protagonist has to find himself incriminated, right? And so that's exactly what happens. Enter Colin Farrell, just before people really knew who Colin Farrell was. He plays a representative of the Justice Department, overseeing the pre-crime activities to decide if the system is fit to go national. When Cruise goes on the lam, he's the man who goes after him. In one of the movie's better scenes, the two men duke it out inside a Lexus factory. The ageless Max von Sydow plays the veteran police man who has climbed to the top as an entrepreneur in crime, overseeing every facet of pre-crime, and doing everything in his power to keep the system his own. Academy-Award Nominee Samantha Morton is Agatha, the most gifted of the pre-cogs, who has a mysterious past that keeps being echoed in her memory of the murder of a heroin junkie. Peter Stormare makes a colorful cameo as a black-market surgeon, Tim Blake Nelson shows up as the warden of the would-be murderer prison where all inmates captured via Pre-Crime, are put. The fact that Spielberg films the entire movie using white filters to bleach out color helps give the film an atmospheric touch. However, it may not translate so well to the mainstream audiences who don't always appreciate some artistic style."

","We quite often give sole credit to the director of a good movie, and while this is deserved, we must also recognize the individual that envisioned and created the basis for the movie in the first place - the writer.  I have been impressed with quite a bit of Spielberg's work (save that of A.I.) but have not until Minority Report paid attention to where the ideas came from. The reason I did so with this movie was that the plot was so fantastic and bursting with creativity that I was almost compelled to investigate this source of its genius, Philip K. Dick.  <br/><br/>Spielberg made this literary gem into a feast for the eyes.  No stone seems to go unturned in creating a realistic world of the future.  From cars to advertising to appliances, Spielberg assembles it all.  And to garner some of the best that Hollywood has to offer, he enlists the services of Tom Cruise.  Cruise plays the protagonist, Detective John Anderton, in a futuristic tale of a world where a crime can been predicted.  A ""precrime"" bureau is assembled to stop that which hasn't happened yet - future murder. Anderton's embrace of precrime is due to the loss of his only child, who was abducted.  When Anderton stumbles upon a flaw in the precrime system, he is setup and hunted down by his own agency.  The story begs the question that if you knew the future, is it predestined that you would still make the same choices, despite your knowledge of what was about to happen?  Can you change the course of events to come?<br/><br/>Detective Anderton discovers that not everything in life, now or in the future, is merely black and white and that no looking-glass ball is perfect. For a wild roller-coaster ride of a movie that has some of the most creative and plausible ideas of the future, I highly recommend you watch Minority Report."

If you have read any of my other reviews you will probably notice that i love the actor Peter Stormare, and he is, like always, great in this movie. But the thing that struck me while watching this on dvd was: I had the subtitles on so i wouldn't miss any of the dialog, but when Dr. Solomon Eddie talks with his wife the subtitles said: *speaks Russian* It should be pretty obvious that it is Swedish and not Russian he is speaking... Some of my friends doesn't like Tom Cruise as an actor but i am always telling them that that is because they only watch his poor movies. He is pretty good in this movie, as Detective Jon Anderton.

The system in question consists of three precogs who can see the future. The murderer therefore never commits the crime, but is still sentenced.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise plays John Anderton who is responsible for stopping the murders based on the information provided by the precogs. Whilst this isn't Spielberg's finest hour he still demonstrates his undoubted craft. Overall 8/10"

"sgt_pinback","6","0","1","12 December 2003"," Not great, but not bad either
","Minor potential spoilers ahead.<br/><br/>Having read the original short story I was naturally curious about the film adaptation.  The premise is identical in both: some time in the future the police is able to virtually eliminate murders by using ""precogs"", mutant humans with the ability to foretell the future, to predict the crime, and arresting the perpetrator before he can carry it out.<br/><br/>From this sci-fi setting, a number of interesting questions arise - is it justifiable to arrest someone who has not actually committed a crime yet? Is the future fixed, or are there alternate paths, leaving individuals a choice whether to actually go through with the crime?  The short story explores some of the issues through a neat little paradox: the head of police is accused of future murder of a man he has never heard of; we follow his actions until the paradox is cleverly resolved in the end.<br/><br/>The movie quickly diverges from the events in the short story; apparently the writers thought it would not fill a two-hour movie.  Sadly, one gets the feeling that the script has been rewritten once too often; it has a tendency to meander aimlessly, unable to decide what the central issue should be and how it should be resolved.  The plot twists and turns, but it is not entirely consistent.  Some plotholes are obvious, e.g. letting a wanted criminal wander into the police headquarters and give his identity without having him stopped by anyone.  One of the more subtle oddities that result from the storyline engineering is that no actual minority report is of any significance in the film (although for a brief period we are led to believe that it might be).<br/><br/>""Minority Report"" also fails to decide what kind of movie it wants to be. It establishes a setting in the future, aided by CGI visuals that are competent, but do not convey a sense of novelty - it's all been done before. We are shown some action scenes that feel rather isolated and do not advance the plot, and there is a good deal of exploration of the central character's personal history.  In the end, however, it settles on a ""whodunnit"" mystery (with a rather timeworn ending).  The sci-fi setting becomes incidental as the short story's elegant paradox is thrown overboard and replaced with something that is effectively no more than a contrivance (i.e. the ""echoes"" concept).<br/><br/>It is to the movie's credit that it addresses the issue of the treatment of the three precogs, who are effectively kept like animals - a problem entirely ignored by the short story.  The strongest character here actually turns out to be Agatha, the leader of the three.<br/><br/>On the whole, this is an entertaining way to spend 2 hours and a bit, but the movie does not achieve its full potential."

","Well, Speilberg has done it again. Created an original and entertaining sci-fi movie, that works on many different levels. Instead of taking successful elements from recent popular action or sci-fi movies, Speilberg draws inspiration from classic sci-fi work and uses it to create his own masterpiece that stands on its own.<br/><br/>This is much more cohesive and entertaining than his last try (A.I.) and it's definitely one of the best movies Cruise or Speilberg has done in a while. And sadly, aside from perhaps Tigerland, this is probably one of the only great performances we'll ever see from Colin Farrell.<br/><br/>Minority Report has a great noir feel with some good action/mystery/thriller elements thrown in.

I enjoyed the slant on Anderton's son, and the emotion Tom Cruise put into the character.  Do we ever have an action hero who is also a dope head?  This is one of Tom Cruise's best performances.<br/><br/>The movie should have been darker during the action sequences.  When Colin Farrell's character is chasing Cruise through the apartment building and auto production plant, I just found the music to be happy and Spielberg was trying to be comical.  The movie reaches it's climax about 30 minutes before it ends.  I would have preferred if the movie ended with Anderton actually finding out what happened to his son.

","Wow...I really couldn't react any other way when I saw this futuristic masterpiece a little over a year ago. Now that it's been that long since its initial release (and after I purchased and viewed the DVD many times) I'm not really surprised now that it had such a big impact on me. After all, the fact that it was a Steven Spielberg film (starring Tom Cruise, no less!) heightened my expectations and certainly had me expecting to see some more high-quality, first-rate filmmaking similar to that of his last film before that, ""A.I. - Artificial Intelligence"", another favourite of mine. Naturally, of course, I got a whole lot more than I bargained for with this rich, sophisticated thriller.<br/><br/>First off, I'd like to congratulate all who were involved - particularly the special effects/production design teams who did a fantastic job of creating the convincing picture of our world around 50 years from now. I would also like to praise Spielberg for once again using whom I think is a wonderful cinematographer. That man is Janusz Kaminski. I LOVE the grainy, smudgy, washed-out look he brought to this film, with its gloomy dark-blue tints and cold, cruel feel. I think he brings terrific style to Spielberg's current films (this, ""A.I."", and ""Catch Me If You Can"") and I hope he continues to contribute to future projects in this manner.<br/><br/>In a summer that, for me, was full of cinematic disappointments, ""Minority Report"" managed to (not surprisingly) rise above the turmoil and stand on its own as a real triumph. Solid in virtually every aspect from acting to writing to music. A beautiful and refreshingly intelligent portrait of society that's full of heavy, challenging issues/themes to wrap one's head around. A perfect work in my eyes."
"x111b3825","10","0","1","10 August 2003"," This is what Sci-fi is all about...
","There's an overabundence of abuse of this here and quite frankly, the only reason I'm not shocked is because opinions are like...oh, well, you get the picture...<br/><br/>There is no doubt Spielberg is a talented filmmaker and though a lot of people dog him, Cruise is a pretty darn talented actor.  Want to rate him against other leading men today, all you have to do is take a look at one emotionless Keanu Reeves performance or Ben Affleck (though I think Affleck is better than Reeves) and then try to put them into Cruise' shoes in ""Born on the Fourth of July"" or Minority report and think for a minute.  Not a chance.<br/><br/>So what is it, fault Spielberg because he didn't satisfy your vision of whatever tripe you had in your head or Cruise, because he's flying the Jet you've only known in fantasy?  People love to hate and show contempt when the majority of us have no foundation upon which to stand other than ""I liked it,"" or ""I didn't.""  Reviewers like ""tedg,"" who apparently seem to be professors, still have only cinematic license to critique based on formulaic visions for what is, should be and how they might have changed it etc. etc.<br/><br/>While the majority of films for example are supposed to stick to non-filmmaker Syd Field's three act recommendation, some of the better works through time follow their own conventions and paths, not those set out before writers by non artists, who have never made more than the crap in their drawers.<br/><br/>Of course this is all garbage ultimately too, since the analysis of another's art, commercial or otherwise is simply opinion.  Though it's nice for guys like Spielberg to consider the audience and commercially succeed, as well as being a requirement for continued work in this field (unless you fully finance everything you do), I think he probably wants to do movies he will like, regardless of what others think.  Of course that's just my opinion.  With opportunity to satisfy himself as well as others, and make lots and lots of money, well that can't be all that bad.<br/><br/>
So why do I bother reviewing myself, one might ask? Because credit should sometimes be given where credit is due.  As a big fan of Science Fiction or Fantasy, there is so little worthy of praise and a greater tendency toward cheese than in the Troma horror ""classics.""  Just the sheer magnitude of a work does not make it worthy or watchable, and people seem to expect a better movie for the money, for example ""Waterworld,"" which at its time was perhaps the most expensive work ever done, and never lived up to expectations...versus ""Cube,"" done on a comparative shoe string with unknowns and a truly interesting story.<br/><br/>Minority Report on its hand is both ambitious and lived up to my expectations.  For this reason, I choose to critique the critics rather than film.  Many more labels of trash are accompanied by no explanation than are those praiseworthy.<br/><br/>Lest I go on...I am typing here simply because I had not before and it's hardly worth missing a warm meal to gripe for or against this amidst the masses.<br/><br/>Definitely some interesting ""aspects"" here.  Of course who goes to the movies to examine ""aspects?""  I go to be entertained and I loved this flick. Good job Gollywood!"

","Two of the most mediocre names in Hollywood team up to give us a slicked-up, big money blockbuster that is boring, amateurish, and predictable, and may be the most overrated movie in decades.<br/><br/>I felt like I was watching AI all over again, and as bad as that movie was, it was, like, ten-times better than this worthless junk.  It looks almost exactly the same, has the same plodding narrative, lack of credible characterization, predictability, unimaginative dialogue, half-baked and poorly-realized ideas about the future, etc.  AI did have better acting for the most part.  That's a big problem here, since the movie relies almost exclusively on Cruise, who flubbs it.  Every time I see Tom Cruise on screen, he looks like he's trying too hard.  Consequently, he is rarely convincing (Born on the 4th of July being the glaring exception).  He's at his worst here, due to the effects-laden, heavy-handed direction of Spielberg.<br/><br/>On another level, this movie completely misconstrues the essence of Phillip K. Dick, who is likely turning over in his grave right now, over and over. Dick was essentially concerned with the nature and meaning of  human-ness, with sci-fi being his story-telling vehicle.  That is where Minority Report fails large.  In spite of its massive production budget and big-name Hollywood credentials, or more likely because of it, Minority Report is utterly lacking in humanity, unoriginal and heartless, unmoving, unwatchable.  All surface and no substance.  It's below-average work by small-minded, overambitious egotists, hyped-up and overwrought to gargantuan proportions, to where it becomes an insulting, glaring failure.<br/><br/>I can hardly believe the universality of opinion on this film; it's like everybody is parroting Roger Ebert, who continues to bestow glowing endorsements to golden turds such as this.  Too bad we lost Siskel; the two had some integrity back then.  People are going into movies these days knowing exactly how they're supposed to react, thanks to reviews and massive marketing campaigns.  Regardless of how bad a movie may be, if there's enough money telling them otherwise, they tend to react as they have been told.  It's depressing.<br/><br/>Now, in keeping with the principal of balancing praise and blame, I will say that the display graphics were pretty cool, as was the flying vehicle. And Colin Farell (sp?) managed a good job with what little he had to work with. Too bad for Cruise that he shows him up in nearly every scene shared by the two actors.  I thought the idea of the precogs floating in water was interesting, but it could have been so much more.  It should have been more abstract; they should have been floating in a womb-like tank, or like three witches swimming in a cauldron, with long wispy hair, instead of lying bald and partially submerged in a giant bathtub. How not sexy.<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype. Don't waste your time. This movie will be forgotten in a few years, by everybody including those who seem to have loved it. 1/10."

Having seen it twice now, once in the theater and once on DVD, I'm pretty sure I didn't miss any of the story along the way. Even so, there's so much unexplained happenings it's absurd. I'm not the type who has to have a explanation for everything, but there's so many wild leaps and bounds in this movie it's simply outrageous at times. I'm all for sci-fi universes having their own set of rules, but Minority Report just leaves me scratching my head.<br/><br/>The whole powerball wannabe crime detection system makes so little sense it's scary. In the age of incredible technology, wooden balls are used? What? And why does everyone throw out their TV sets, and project faded blurry images against walls? Why would newspapers and cereal boxes have moving up to date data? There's no way this could be practical cost wise. Why on Earth would cops use ""stick sticks"" that makes the perpetrator throw up?! Why do the police run around like keystone cops trying to take the perps down using only said sick sticks and various other close combat techniques? Does the future have no sniper weapons? And why does Anderton Jr. run like he's one neuron short of a synapse? Okay, I'm just being mean now... but it's still true.<br/><br/>I'm just getting started... why on Earth do I want to see a closeup of fake mucus oozing from someone's nose for absolutely no reason at all. The ending, which I won't spoil, is completely unsatisfying and actually ends up just leaving me wondering if they couldn't come up with anything better. It's like they just gave up on the story and defaulted to the simplest answer they could find. So many scenes make absolutely no sense and was put in for reasons I can't understand. An old woman smoking a pipe laughing... for no reason what so ever, having nothing at all to do with the story. A kid, alone and bored, going around on a merry-go-round. Why? It's like some kinda surreal experiment gone very wrong. And these clear computers... give me a break. There's no way they could be useful to the users, and would never survive.<br/><br/>All that being said though, despite some big time flaws it's still a decent movie and it's worth watching at least once. The ending's a let down, half the story is unnecessary, and there's even two or three complete gross out scenes for no reason at all.

"JSanicki","Null","0","1","4 February 2003"," Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise pair up and the result is a nightmare!
","Minority Report is a film full of complex questions.  For instance, is it believable enough to think that by the year 2050 scientists and the law will be able to stop crimes from being committed?  One doesn't think so. However one wants to do it, crimes will be committed, there is no way in getting around it.  Once again, Mr. Spielberg has done a bang-up job on what his vision of the future is seemingly going to appear but however, it seems to me like all of his visions are patented so the look the same in film after film of his.  My only hope for Mr. Spielberg is that now that he has done about four Science-Fiction films, he can begin to turn his sights on other things, like a period historical epic or a light romantic comedy.  Has he ever done one of those yet?  I must admit the reason that I was so gung-ho on seeing this film was simply because of the pairing of Cruise and Spielberg.  Finally, I thought to myself, it's about time.  I was beginning to wonder when these two would join forces for a blockbuster, something that this film certainly has written all over it.<br/><br/>Even though this film achieved blockbuster status, its acting abilities are sorely lacking.  Tom Cruise as usual cannot act his way out of a paper bag and basically I thought of him only being there for what I like to call ""eye candy"".  If anything, the majority of the performances were weak with the standout one going to Samantha Morton as the Pre-cog Agatha (named cryptically after the great British mystery novelist Agatha Christie). Seeing how Colin Farrell has ""arrived"" by now, it is interesting to watch his portrayal in this film: it didn't stand out that much and every time he appeared on the screen I began to find his character slightly if not overtly annoying, even though he received second billing.  I give kudos for Mr. Spielberg putting in an appearance by Max Von Sydow, but even putting in big names like his can't begin to save this film.<br/><br/>This is a perfect example of a ""summer release"", it's chock-full of action, visual and special effects, but the story and the acting abilities are sorely lacking.  The film has enough twists and turns to give a viewer a very bad case of whiplash!<br/><br/>My rating: 1 and a half stars"
"Fenrir-5","Null","0","1","18 January 2003"," Terrible!
","I won't waste time on plot holes (since the screenwriter didn't). What I will focus on is the sheer shoddiness of the plot.<br/><br/>Why does Spielberg feel that his movies have to have a ""goof"" edge to them? Attempts at light comedy do not belong in a serious sci fi movie. Putting them in there is only an admission of the inadequacy of the creative team. If the story were well-written and spellbinding enough, there would be no perceived need for light comic entertainment.<br/><br/>And the bigger problem: Spielberg humor isn't funny. See the special agent's jets fry burgers in the diner as they fight! See the spiders crawling around interrupting a hilarious fight with an ethnic couple. After the spiders leave, they get right back to fighting. Oh, those ethnics! Tom Cruise is chased into a Lexus plant, falls into the machinery, and a car is assembled around him! But wait, there's more. See the perfunctory sidekick in what is supposed to be a climactic, powerful scene, cracking wise with the precog. ""Those thoughts about my cousin were just thoughts"", he says. Oh, my sides!<br/><br/>The movie falls apart because it cannot establish a flow. We shoot from effects sequence to blatant product placement (Aquafina water, The Gap, Lexus, etc) to attempt at comedy to effects sequence. The denoument - where the ""real killer"" is revealed - is perhaps a surprise to people who have never seen a movie before. There's not even a climactic effects sequence. There are two major sequences, both occur when Cruise is being chased earlier in the film. So the film staggers over the two hour mark, thinking it's the story that attracted us. Wrong ...<br/><br/>I do not understand why people mindlessly praise Spielberg. He's just phoning it in. He and George Lucas are perfect examples of how a person becomes something they weren't before. Lucas now is nothing like his younger self (his younger self would have burned the negatives of ""The Phantom Menace""). Spielberg has finally become a copy of a copy of a copy. If I hadn't known he'd been involved, I would never have figured it out. The direction is workmanlike; the effects decidedly unspectacular (they look exactly like computer FX grafted onto live action sequences).<br/><br/>But in the end, the true fault lies with the screenwriter. It's simply a poor script. The only parts that shine are from Dick's original story. The rest is just junk. Avoid at all costs."

","First off, everyone should stop mentioning Blade Runner, cause other than Phillip K. Dick's name, there is nothing similar about these two films. Blade Runner is the most overrated and worthless piece of trash. I can't believe some people rip AI for being ""boring"" and ""sappy"" yet praise BR let alone stomach it. Simply put: The FX were great for its time, Harrison and Sean Young were HUGE miscasts along with a stupid script.<br/><br/>Having said that, I will review Minority Report as this is its page. *SPOILERS AHEAD*<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie until the ending....well, the second ending. I understand Spielberg was a huge fan and friend of Kubrick, but someone should tell him his storytelling is by far superior to the late Kubrick. Furthermore, he imitated the WORST quality of Kubrick: dragging on the ending 30 minutes longer than necessary.<br/><br/>From begining to end, the film has a firm grasp of your attention. Though we know what scene we will come to at the end (due to the premonition of the precogs), when we arrive, there's a climactic surprise waiting. Now for me, this is where the movie PEAKS. After Tom Cruise makes his decision, the movie should start to wrap it up, and come to a close. Instead, there's a gratuitous plot twist where the guy isn't who he says he is, and Cruise goes on another wild goose chase for 30 minutes to find out his friend and mentor had set him up. Now even if LA Confidential and a handful of other films hadn't already used this exact twist, it would still be unnecessary for this film. It would be so much sweeter had the man actually been the murderer, and the pre-cogs premonition itself is what led Tom Cruise to this scenario where he would be given the opportunity to find closure with his dark past, and the choice on how he would do it.<br/><br/>A very good movie, which coulda been great had the writers known that a little less woulda been so much more to the story.<br/><br/>8.5/10"

The drowning scenario was a works-as-design bug, the minority report problem would imply somebody innocent was convicted before they had a chance to (not) act.  Never dealt with.  Also the philosophical implications are all implied and not dealt with by the movie. Is it ethical to keep the pre-cogs in this state to prevent horrible crime?

This time the cinematographer's limitations come to the surface and we see that bleaching out the color for his bizarre visual style is for no more purpose than bleaching out the color for his bizarre visual style. Kaminski has even made the ridiculous statement in the July 2002 issue of Am. Cinematographer, that, ""If you can't see or sense grain in the image, you're not experiencing the magic of movies."" What kind of idiotic statement is that? I think it's time he go back to Poland and work over there for awhile.

And as much as I admired the set designs and special effects, it's really just a more expensive version of ""Logans Run"". There really are no surprises in the story. In fact, we've all seen this plot before. Lots of times! I did enjoy Samantha Morton as Agatha. She's a wonderful actress. The cameos are fun and so are all the references to Kubrick and ""A Clockwork Orange"". Technically superior, but they definitely needed to spend more time on plot and story."

","In a day and age when some feller talking to a volleyball passes as a film, this was supposed to be much better.<br/><br/>As someone said, like AI but only good instead.<br/><br/>I didn't enjoy this that much and found it a bit tiresome in sections, as Cruise did an average job as the cop from the pre crime unit.<br/><br/>It was an interesting idea, but you'd have expected that Spielberg would have developed it a lot better.<br/><br/>The special effects were very good."
"mrsambarlow","Null","0","1","6 July 2002"," Lame and dumb, Dick turning in grave
","Take a tight story, elegant in the way that sci-fi short stories with a twist are, ruin the 'fun' concept by trying to expand on and explain it, then tack on some *awful* twists to spin it out an extra 30min. Try and be 'dark' and 'mature'. Get this pile of rubbish.<br/><br/>Plain awful. Some nice photography, but that alone isn't going to stop (once again) Phil Dick's name being dragged through the mud with an awful film using his name.<br/><br/>Go read UBIK, VALIS and FLOW MY TEARS, THE POLICEMAN SAID. Then next time a filmaker wants to 'do dick', you can point them in the right direction."
"CharltonBoy","9","0","1","6 July 2002"," Brilliant state of the art thriller.
","Some would say Speilberg made a bit of a Turkey with A.I , a film that i havent seen but i have seen Minority Report and having sat through over 2 hours of sheer entertainment and mind blowing sci fi brilliance the worlds most famous director does not have to worry about this being a flop.<br/><br/>Tom Cruise is perfect in the role of Pre crime Detective John Anderton although he does not have to put in a brilliant performance because the story and the special affects make this a gripping and highly watchable thriller that has twists and turns that any giant Roller Coaster would be proud of. Some film are so hyped up that when you actually go and see the film you leave dissappointed , with Monority Report BELIEVE THE HYPE!! 9 out of 10."
"Agent10","7","0","1","21 June 2002"," Interesting take on the future
","While still feeling the heat from the so-so effort of A.I., Steven Spielberg redeemed himself wit ha more constructed effort and one that was more suitable for hard-core sci-fi fans. Once again, he tackled an interesting story, one that could change the complexion of society as a whole. Only this time, he did it right, making this more of a thriller as opposed to a movie about family values. While all the action sequences could be placed in one trailer, it was still a fairly interesting story with great little insights about the technology of this future world. The only downside, proved to be Tom Cruise. Once again, his average acting style came out in full force, running through a movie with little emotion and guidance. And to make things worse, this seemed like one big commercial for companies like Ben and Jerry's, Lexus, Guinness, Pepsi, etc. I kid you not. Well, with the nit-picking aside, this was an excellent film for sci-fi fans. 7.2/10"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","0","2","1 July 2002"," An excellent movie, but very overated
","OK, I'm definatly going to say that this was better then Vanilla Sky or A.I. combined. But I think it got a little too much hype. But this movie had a lot of cool special effects. And makes you think about the future. Tom Cruise did an excellent job. Definatly one of his bests. But I think it is definatly worth a watch. <br/><br/>8/10"
"bruce-149","7","0","1","28 June 2002"," Inconsistent and heartless
","This film failed to reach out and grab me. Yes, it had amazing, seamless visuals that didn't get in the way of the story, and some wonderful cinematic -moments-. But if you look closely at the story, it is so full of holes. I'm a science fiction fanatic, and the best sci-fi suspends your disbelief. It doesn't give me time to think about why things don't make sense, such as why Andertons's access wouldn't have been shut off, or why the Dr. who he put away wouldn't have done something nasty to him, like amputating his feet (a classic ""Twilight Zone"" I've always remembered).<br/><br/>
I know Spielberg was trying to pose some big, Stanley Kubrick questions again, but Spielberg isn't  Kubrick here-he's only inserting some Kubrick -elements- into his films now. In A.I., he posed questions that made you think, and that film had more Kubrick and more heart."
"petera00","Null","0","2","28 June 2002"," perhaps spielberg's best?
","I am not a Spielberg fan, nor do I consider him the greatest filmmaker of all time.  This movie is a wonderful movie though, and I so throughly enjoyed it.  It rivals that of Schindlers list, and E.T. as perhaps Spielberg's best.  A.I. was a dissapointment to some, but this movie should change their mind.  The movie is so well constructed (except for a few parts) that it was almost disgusting.  Bravo Spielberg (the commercial jaugernaut)"

"ferguson-6","8","0","1","27 June 2002"," High-Tech LA Confidential
","Greetings again from the darkness.  I have waited a few days to write so as to make sure I write fairly. The highly anticipated Speilberg/Cruise collaboration is extradorinarily entertaining and fascinating.  I would love to give this a 9 or 10, but the overall lack of character development prevented perfection.  Speilbergs absolute best always offered full characters - if you doubt me, go see ""Jaws"" again.  My only negative for the film is the HUGE cast with only one real character (Cruise) and some brief insight provided by Tim Blake Nelson (""O Brother, Where Art Thou"") and veteran Jessica Harper as Anne Lively.  The high-tech gadgetry is eye candy and very well utilized for the story.  If anything, Speilberg held the reins on what could have been done in order to make us believe this is 50 years forward.  The opening sequence is unlike anything ever done on film. Watching Cruise and his faceless army pursue Arye Gross BEFORE he commits the murder (his wife is played by Ashley Crow - the mom in ""Little Big League"") made me nervous and uncomfortable.  Wonderful cinematography by Speilberg regular Janusz Kaminski and a subtle and powerful score by the incomparable John Williams add more dimension to the movie.  Be sure to stay for the credits and enjoy the Williams piece playing over the first half of the credits.  It is outstanding!  Overall a wonderful movie experience, I just wish there was a more human element to the script.  By the way, does anyone see the similarities to the general story structure with ""LA Confidential""?"
"mm-39","8","0","1","26 June 2002"," Cruise bounces back
","SPOILER!!!!<br/><br/>After Cruise's last 2 horrible movies, he bounces back.  Another bomb like Vanilla Sky would have destroyed his career.  Interesting sci-fi film with the issue of determinism  versus free will.  It would be scary if the future was set.  At least being human we all have free will to decide what we will do and what path one will take in life.   The film had a happy together ending which is nice considering the content of the film.  The eye ball scene is pretty gross. 8/10"
"LebowskiT1000","9","0","1","26 June 2002"," One of the best Sci-Fi movies I've seen in a while
","Steven Spielberg and Tom Cruise...need I say more?  You just can't go wrong! I have to say the story is absolutely brilliant!  I loved it from start to finish!  There are a few minor things that I was less than fond of, but they were so minor that I didn't let them really bother me.<br/><br/>The special effects are just mind-blowing and Spielberg's idea of the future is PERFECT!  A lot of times directors go overboard with their idea of the future, I think Spielberg has the perfect amount of futuristic stuff meshed with present-day stuff.<br/><br/>The acting is quite good too from all that appeared in the film.  Tom Cruise pulls off a solid performance as does Colin Farrell and Max von Sydow.  The rest of the cast is great too.<br/><br/>If you are a science fiction fan, then I think it's in your best interest to see this film!  I am very happy to see that this film has already made it into the top 250 (and currently the top 150) films on IMDB!  If you're a Tom Cruise or Steven Spielberg fan than you should definitely see this film!  I truly hope that you enjoy the film as much as I did.  Thanks for reading,<br/><br/>-Chris"
"lotus_chief","9","0","1","24 June 2002"," Very original and entertaining....
","Possible spoilers:<br/><br/>
I basically went into this movie curious as to how they were going to explain how they could arrest and punish someone before they commit a crime. Although I would've like the logic to be explained further, this film has to be the most original I have seen in a pretty good while.  I'll admit, I tend to cringe at Spielberg's films, as they can be WAY too sappy and cheezy at times.  But ""Minority Report"" is as gritty as you can get.  This has to be one of the most gratifying and refreshing movies I've seen in a theater (along with ""Insomnia"") in a good while.  Tom Cruise acted well, and the story was very gripping and entertaining all the way through.  I think the film could've been about 10-15 minutes shorter, but great nevertheless.  I doubt you'd see a more original film for a while."
"Special-K88","Null","0","1","24 June 2002"," excellent
","In the year 2054, murders are detected and arrests are made before the crime can be committed. Police chief Cruise has his life turned upside down when he learns that he's been detected to kill a man he never met. He then takes it on the lam to try and find flaws in the system and prove his innocence. Gripping, highly sophisticated thriller provides endless futuristic visuals, intriguing plot twists, and unexpected laughs. Starts off slow, but once it gets going you have to hang on as Spielberg's swift direction rarely lets up. Solid and suspenseful it keeps you guessing, though the finale is a bit protracted. An impressive, entertaining showing for first time collaborators Spielberg and Cruise. ***"
