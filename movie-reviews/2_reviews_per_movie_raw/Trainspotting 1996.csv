","After reading some of the reviews that trash this film I had to speak up.<br/><br/>This film is gritty and dirty. There is content which is not pleasant, swearing and violence amounts other things. What else would you expect a film about drug addiction to be about? Well more than that actually, it about choices and what you Choose! Never at any point did this film make drugs look at all appealing to me in any way, I never did understand why so many people thought that it did. At no point did it ever say ""Look at this, its cool."" For those who think the level of swearing in this film is too much then they clearly haven't spent any time with working class people in Britain, not just Scotland. I being one of them can say its fairly accurate in that account.<br/><br/>That being said, those things do not take anything away from the film, the quality of plot and story, or the acting which is Stunning! Robert Carlise as Begbe was excellent, and Ewan MacGregor shined. Also the character Spud was worth a mention he really was quite good.<br/><br/>This film is in my Opinion a work of Genius, that represents the book accurately."
"omophagia-2","10","366","436","25 March 2000"," One of the best films of the 1990s.
","In the aftermath of _Pulp Fiction_, much of the filmmaking of the 1990s thrived upon attempts to appear ""edgy"" within the constructs of independent films, or merely to provide empty shock value cliches. And no film ever came close to the sheer cleverness of Tarantino's masterpiece.<br/><br/>_Trainspotting_, however, somehow manages to take the excesses of the mid-90s and rise far, far above the cinematic cliches that it easily could have become. A film that tackles any hot-button social issue can, and usually does, simply become a didactic propaganda piece. Thankfully, _Trainspotting_ is vastly more intelligent in its edginess and its shock.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate _Trainspotting_ fully, the viewer must abandon any preconceptions about what defines truly great cinema, because this film defies convention at nearly every turn. And with the rapid pace of its plot, that's quite a bit of ground to cover.<br/><br/>Though a great deal of the picture's brilliance is derived from director Danny Boyle's consistent rejection of typical cinematic techniques, the most satisfying and _best_ aspect of _Trainspotting_ is that Boyle creates a film that is neither pro-drug or anti-drug. Instead, he maintains a rare objectivity throughout the film, depicting this fascinating array of complex, beautifully acted characters with an honesty that it seldom captured on film. And, given the life that each character lives, it's nearly incomprehensible that a director would refrain from influencing the viewer's impressions in any way, yet that's exactly what Boyle does.<br/><br/>The dialogue-- or at least what portions of the brogue-drenched dialogue American viewers will be able to comprehend-- is alternately hilarious, raw, and brutal. And Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle bring a remarkable compassion and depth to their portrayals of characters that could have easily lapsed into cliche.<br/><br/>Despite its sheer brilliance, _Trainspotting_ is not a film that's easy to watch. The viewer is bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort in their horror-- this movie contains two of the most graphic, horrifying scenes I've ever encountered. But, amazingly, none of these elements is used merely for shock value. Though the viewer will be mortified by some of the things that happen onscreen-- the well-documented dive into Scotland's most vile public toilet, for example-- these scenes all make _perfect sense_ within the context of a masterfully told story.<br/><br/>In order to notice all of the subtlety that also exists in _Trainspotting_, repeat viewings are necessary, primarily to reduce some of the most powerful shocks ever-so-slightly, though their effects are never lost entirely. Some of the images will likely haunt even the most cynical, jaded viewer for weeks.<br/><br/>RATING: 10 out of 10. Never patronizing and completely unpretentious, _Trainspotting_ is one of the most daring, unconventional films ever made. It inspires a level of discomfort rivaled by very few movies, because, even at its most graphic, Boyle never insults the viewer with mere shock tactics. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, with a truly rare objectivity that allows each viewer to interpret its story on his/her own terms."
"RobertF87","Null","280","347","28 February 2004"," The Greatest British Movie of All Time
","This film became almost a cultural phenomenon as soon as it was released in Britain in February 1996.<br/><br/>Adapted from the first (and best) book by Irvine Welsh, the film shows the lives of a group of Edinburgh heroin addicts.<br/><br/>The film is a black comedy, at times hilarious, tragic, surreal, brutal and uplifting.  The film is full of memorable moments such as the chase down Edinburgh's Princes Street which opens the film (I happened to be there when they were filming that scene) and Ewan McGregor diving down the ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" headfirst.<br/><br/>The film doesn't condemn drug addicts, but it is probably more effective then any amount of preachy moralising as it depicts the devastating consequences that can happen to drug users.  <br/><br/>The film is well acted by a cast who have (mostly) become pretty famous since.  Especially memorable is Robert Carlyle as the violent Begbie.<br/><br/>I have seen this film many times.  It is an instant classic.  Go check it out."
"bob the moo","Null","228","285","20 January 2004"," Hilarious, imaginative and very anti-drugs
","Renton is a heroin addict.  He is one of a group of friends who live their lives day to day and hit to hit.  When he tries to kick the habit he manages it for a while but eventually falls back into his old way.  Meanwhile his friends are as messed up as he is, whether it be Spud's pathetic addiction, Begbie's violent rages or the fact that he is sleeping with a girl who still goes to school.<br/><br/>When it came out this film was very hyped, the poster became a must-have on every student's bedroom wall and the media went nuts over it's supposed glamorisation of drug use.  The plot is very difficult to summarise, as it doesn't really have a narrative flow other than the very disjointed experience of Renton.  However it manages to be very funny and imaginative all the way, using many different tricks and touches to be funny.  The dialogue is very well written and I must admit I found it a lot funnier than the last few comedies I watched.<br/><br/>The media may have condemned this film as promoting drug use, but I can only imagine that they watched a different film from me.  Sure, the film shows drugs as being fun and enjoyable but, like Renton says, `why else would we do it?'  However the film clearly shows a massive downside where people's lives are destroyed, people OD and lives go day to day just trying to get high.  True, it does show this downside in a stylish and funny way but there is no question that the film is promoting drug use in any sense.<br/><br/>Too often I see films that are style over substance; Trainspotting gets it just perfect, stylish but not at the expense of dialogue, character or film. It is helped by a great cast.  McGregor jumped to stardom off the back of this role and he deserved it.  He keeps his character both likeable but repulsive at the same time and carries the film with surprising ease.  The support cast is excellent, even if they lack the same good character of Renton.  Whether it is the comic Bremner, the violent Carlyle or the tragic McKidd.  While not all their characters are well developed, they do all give good accounts of themselves, whether it is comic or showing the effects of heroin on their lives.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great film that is refreshing to see now without all the `cult student cool' hype or media feeding frenzy over it's supposed pro-drug approach.  It is stylish, funny, depressing and downright sobering."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","98","119","12 March 2008"," A triumphant masterpiece
","Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is a film in which everything goes the right way. Few films are fortunate to 'be' at the right time and right place and take the world by storm as ""Trainspotting"" did, but the ultimate proof of this film's greatness is that if you watched it alone or with a large group of people, in 2008 or in 1996, it has the same effect- absolute power. This film is nothing more- or less- than one of the most effective and perfect artistic works ever committed to celluloid.<br/><br/>The film follows the lives of a group of drug attics in Scotland in the late 1980's but is constructed less as a conventional narrative and more as a series of vignettes connected by characters and set to the film's dazzling soundtrack (the fact that I mention the scenes being 'set' to the soundtrack is proof of its importance in this particular film). Almost every scene is as powerful as the next, with three montages in particular being possibly the definitive examples of how to do a memorable cinematic montage.<br/><br/>Pop culture has been kind to ""Trainspotting"", remembering it as a unique and great film, especially in Britain. I certainly do not disagree with this consensus, but I feel the film has been hurt by familiarity, with even television series like ""Family Guy"" parodying the film's well-known scenes (and badly). This doesn't mean that the film's popularity is being hurt, but that it doesn't feel as fresh and original to people now as it did back in 1996. This is hardly the thing the film's reputation suffers most from however, with the significantly large number of people who claim the film supports and promotes drug use. I have to ask, and forgive my rudeness, how stupid can you possibly be? No, drug addicts in this film are not vilified, but they are consistently shown in a brutally realistic and horrifically tragic context, and just because the film doesn't go out of its way to emotionally manipulate you into completely hating its characters doesn't mean that it promotes drug use, it means that it's a knowing film careful enough not to become a sappy, melodramatic Hollywood product. <br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal, the music is terrific, the film is a pitch-perfect example of energizing editing and brilliant use of montage, and its script is one of the best ever written, alternately hilarious, horrifying, tragic, and benefiting from a rare level of depth and resonance. A British classic is what Trainspotting is recognized as, and a British classic is what it is. <br/><br/>10/10"

","I remember what a raw shock of creative energy this film was when it came out, and I still marvel at what an imaginative way the director found to tell this crazy, immoral tale. The superb cinematography; the amazing cast of young actors (who have all gone on to become hugely successful in film and tv since); the iconic soundtrack: it all just fits together perfectly. 'Trainspotting' is as hilarious as it is deeply disturbing, but most importantly (and unlike many other films concerned with addiction) it's one hell of an entertaining flick and doesn't drag for a second.<br/><br/>We all know drugs are bad. The problem is, they can also be fun - at least at the beginning, which is one of the reasons people are drawn to them. 'Trainspotting' is the first movie I remember watching that actually conveyed that seductive quality of drugs and managed to honestly portray the reckless, hedonistic lifestyle a part of my generation - the so called ""Generation X"" - fell victim to. It's an amazing achievement, in every regard; not only does it manage to be true to its serious subject matter without resorting to moralizing, it's also masterclass filmmaking and a milestone of British Cinema. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"
"MichaelMargetis","10","57","71","29 April 2005"," The Wild & Crazy Indie Smash Hit that Started My Love For Independent Film
","#1 BEST FILM OF 1996 <br/><br/>Young filmmaker Danny Boyle's film adaptation of Irvine Welsh's incredible novel, about a band of social misfits that just so happen to be sleazy heroin junkies, is the movie that got me hooked on independent flicks. One late Friday night I was cruising through the movie channels on Satellite and I stumbled upon a channel called IFC (Independent Film Channel). On it there was this film 'Trainspotting'. I watched it and immediately fell in love with it. I never really saw anything quite like it, it was stylish, cool, depressing, dark and disturbing all at the same time. After this I got hooked on IFC channel, and if it wasn't for the smash U.K. hit 'Trainspotting', I might have never watched an independent film.<br/><br/>Following the novel surprisingly closely, 'Trainspotting' revolves around a band of friends. Most are heroin junkies, one is an alcoholic psycho and the other is actually a good guy. These friends play soccer together and hang out all the time. They are led by Mark Renton (played by Ewan McGregor - Star Wars, Moulin Rouge) the central character and narrator of this macabre yet intriguing tale. We watch him as he tries to get off heroin and how this effects his friends -- Spud (Ewen Bremner - Snatch., The Acid House) a silly, naive, never-hurt-a-fly kind of heroin addict who serves as the film's oaf; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller - Dracula 2000, Hackers) a selfish, sneaky and manipulative heroin junkie obsessed with James Bond who Renton secretly despises; Tommy (Kevin McKidd - The Acid House) the only honest friend of Renton's who is drug and alcohol free; and Francis Begbie (Robert Carlyle - The Full Monty, Riff Raff) a deranged, alcoholic violent madman with a mean temper and a large knife. The story follows Renton's struggle to get off drugs and start a life while interacting with his friends and eventually arranging a drug deal with them at the end to strike it rich.<br/><br/>'Trainspotting' is a nearly perfect picture with extraordinary acting, directing and writing. The performances are nothing short of first-rate in 'Trainspotting'. Ewan McGregor gives perhaps his finest and most unfairly ignored screen performances as our hero and struggling heroin junkie. He plays the role with such authenticity and passion for the craft of acting you'd never think he wasn't a heroin junkie in real life. Ewen Bremner is funny as the film's idiot, but Jonny Lee Miller surprisingly gives an outstanding performance as Renton's slippery so-called friend. Kevin McKidd is good as Tommy and Kelly MacDonald does a fine job with her acting debut as Renton's underage lay who becomes kind of like a mentor to him as the film progresses. One of the absolute finest performances in this movie is by Robert Carlyle, most known as a British acting coach. It's hard to explain why he's so wonderful, but I'll try. He plays the bad guy in a way that it makes you uncomfortable and scared watching him. That takes talent and it's not easy to do for any actor. Danny Boyle provides us with breathtaking camera work and has some Tarantino-ish qualities, that makes him one of the most talented filmmakers working in the independent film industry. There is a scene in which the main character, Renton, is going through withdrawal and he has a hallucination of a friend's deceased infant child crawls up on his bedroom wall and spins his head all the way around in a kind of Linda Blair Exorcist style. It's a freaky scene but it's also a carefully layered and admirable scene that proves Danny Boyle's directing talents to be most impressive. John Hodge (who writes most of Boyle's films) does a phenomenal job capturing the material from Welsh's groundbreaking and provocative novel that should have won him the Oscar in the 1997 Academy Award ceremony. The cinematography is consistently amazing but the film editing is a tad choppy. But, that's not really something to get bent out of shape about, because the rest of the film is always engrossing especially the magnificent and extensive soundtrack including music from Blur, Lou Reed and Iggy Pop.<br/><br/>All in all, 'Trainspotting' is an astounding indie achievement from British filmmaker Danny Boyle who also did the highly successful indie romp 'Shallow Grave' starring Ewan McGregor and the major flop 'The Beach' starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Robert Carlyle. If you've never seen 'Trainspotting' and have a very strong stomach and an urge to see something peculiar yet brilliant, be sure to rent it your next stop at the videostore. If you've seen it and liked it enough to purchase it, be sure to get the the 2-disc special edition DVD with some excellent extras including full-length audio commentary with some insightful information. 'Trainspotting' is the film that started my love with indie cinema. Be sure you don't miss it. Grade: A<br/><br/>MADE MY TOP 300 LIST AT #27"
"Sean-M","Null","119","155","6 March 2003"," Superb
","An extremely competent look at the Scottish drug-Scene, Trainspotting is a perfect example of the potential of the UK industry to tell a story of tragedy, horror and hope in a manner that the American industry has yet to do without drifting into tired Cliche. While the manner and style of delivery are extremely funny and at times appear almost unreal, the fact remains that these characters are real. The clearly psychotic and alcoholic Begbie, played by Robert Carlyle is a supporting role that is actually of immense value to the film. Here we have character who I've met, you've met and we've all met. A man with very little to lose absorbed in a sea of alcohol and prone to violence. I choose him as example because he isnt even involved in the drug-scene in which the main characters are central. In fact his opposition is somewhat humorous when we consider his own vices make him argueably worse off and the incidences of violence he becomes involved in<br/><br/>are most definitely black humour. Considering what is actually happening isnt funny, watching it play out, aside from one major incident, is extremely funny. And that is the tone of the film throughout, as characters continually talk nonsence and sail through the lives they have chosen, making very little progress, but instead drifting downwards until an opportunity presents itself to change their ways, where upon Renton, Ewan McGregor, must make a choice between his own life or his friends. McGregor himself is excellent in the film that made him, as is Jonny Lee Miller, who surprised me in this film by having a more thought-provoking character than the script and time strictly allowed considering his relatively minimal place in the main storyline. Ewen Bremner provided some excellent and often well-needed comic relief and Carlyle as I mentioned, was outstanding. This film is both real and unreal, taking the Humour of ""Human Traffic"" and the somber tone of ""My name is Joe"" and blending them together to create an unforgettable experience vividly accompanied by strains of ""Perfect day"" and other cultural and nostalgic sounds, particularly of the place and period. Trainspotting has been accused of glamourising drug-use but I firmly believe anyone who takes this view hasnt watched it properly. The fun is equally, if not more so, matched by some nasty images and for the time it was released, provided what was a very necessary look at the growing drug industry, the loss it creates and the hope that can arise. Superb."
"irocz78","Null","21","25","13 November 2003"," Brilliantly written and played, incredible dialogue, not for morons
","There's a good reason why the imdb recommendations guide, which lists movies that those who liked Trainspotting should also like, lists some of the greatest, most critically acclaimed movies ever made. It's because this is one of them, and rightfully so. It won critical acclaim across the globe for its gritty portrayal of the unfortunate existence of a hapless group of losers and drug addicts, living the low life in Edinburgh, Scotland.<br/><br/>It is a dialogue driven movie, though, so if you don't get the lines, and don't understand the humor, which is very dry at times, and never comes in the form of a 'joke', you'll unknowingly call this movie ""slow"" or ""depressing"" or ""bad."" In a delightfully madcap exchange when Renton announces he's through with heroin, the lines ""...he's lacking in moral fiber"" ""He knows a lot about Sean Connery."" ""Thats hardly a substitute!"" sums up the writing quite well. It only works in the context of the scene itself, but the way it's played and the scene it's set in make it beyond hilarious.<br/><br/>It's one of the most powerfully written and played movies I've ever seen. Renton (Ewan McGregor), the main character, undergoes pseudo metamorphases to illustrate his own attempts at regaining his sanity. His friends, who enter the movie with static roles, illustrate their own inability to change by remaining undeveloped, only sinking deeper into their self-created abysses.<br/><br/>Tommy (Kevin McKidd), who falls victim to heroin addiction and dies from it after entering the movie as the epitome of clean, healthy living, undergoes a downward spiral which we flash into occasionally to see how he's being rapidly destroyed by drugs about which he professed ""I'm an adult, I can find out for myself.""<br/><br/>Though Renton's character is the only one which is fully explored, all of Renton's ""so called friends"" are cleanly written, well summarized, and do their part to create the air of hostility and pressure which Renton faces in his battle to rid himself of heroin.<br/><br/>Begbie, played with powerful energy by Robert Carlyle, adds much needed comic relief with his hilarious and sometimes disturbing violent outbursts, while exposing the ironic nature of his legal addiction to alcohol when played in the background of a heroin movie.<br/><br/>Diane, his love interest, simply adds to the pressure of life, using him for sex and echoing the chorus from his non-drug user friends and family members that he's destroying his life, ""poisoning [his] body with that sh!te.""<br/><br/>It gets depressing at times, as it should, to properly illustrate the horror and depravity that comes with the lifestyle. The ""carpet"" scene couldn't have been more brilliantly imagined to portray the feeling of emptiness and detachment as Renton nears death from an overdose.<br/><br/>Overall, it gets a 10. This movie can't lose when played to an audience with the intelligence, wit, and sense of humor to understand it."

","In 1996 John Hodge took Irvine Welsh's novel ""Trainspotting"" and with the help of Danny Boyle's direction created one of the most influential, modern cult classics Britain has to offer. Commonly ranked among the greatest films of the 90s; ""Trainspotting"" delivers satisfactory viewing every single time. The essential drug film.<br/><br/>The term ""trainspotting"" in this case, is not the non-drug based hobby, but has two meanings for this film. A) The act of ""trainspotting"" is UK slang for trying to find a vein to intravenously inject drugs. And B) A joke not featured in the film, but two of the characters go to a disused train station to buy drugs and say they are going ""trainspotting"".<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor stars as Mark Renton, a performance that put him on the map, a man who spends; or wastes, most of his time taking drugs with his friends in one of their apartments. Until he decides to finally pack it in and go cold turkey. We see the highs and lows of the drugs as Renton attempts to build a new life. He battles the strain and the influences of his mates; including Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) a man who stops at nothing to take all, Spud (Ewen Bremner) a fast-paced anxious performance and Francis Begbie (Robert Carylye) a frighteningly intense character who is possibly my favourite of all-time; and Renton's sex life.<br/><br/>Vibrant colour is used to exaggerate the actions to intensify the imagery on screen. This also makes it stand out from other films creating a massive impact on the viewer. Unforgettable. The soundtrack consists of the pop culture the characters themselves love and some regularly featured in real life at the time. The film captures the era perfectly.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's stylish direction is what mainly is so appealing about the film. Delivering an expertly structured adrenalin rush. The daring topic of the film was well perceived by critics and audiences to claim universal praise. But, they were still unsure if it was supporting drugs or an anti-drug film. In a way it is both.<br/><br/>We are guided through the film with Renton's narration, making it an extremely watchable viewing, one irresistible to want to experience several times. A hilarious triumph. This is movie-making at its most exhilarating.<br/><br/>9/10"

","Trainspotting is the best movie I've ever seen!  Danny Boyle did a excellent job of directing a movie based on Irvine Welsh's bestselling novel about desperate and hopeless Scottish heroin addicts.  And all the cast did a superb job acting some of the most outrageous and offensive characters I've ever seen.  The only downside of this movie is understanding those thick Scottish accents, but that also adds a bit of humor to the movie.<br/><br/>
What I liked best about Trainspotting was the characters.  They were the most unbelievable low-life, junky, sleazy, immoral, trash I've ever seen. I loved it! They'll make you both despise and pity them while loving them at the same time.<br/><br/>And the plot (which can be credited to Irvine Welsh) was unbelievable.

"sheslovinit","6","58","88","7 September 2009"," I don't see what most of the fuss is about, honestly.
","Judging by the high rating the other users of this site have bestowed on this film, I guess some people might say I'm off my rocker to rate it a mere 6, but hey...what can I say? Everyone's entitled to their own opinion. And in mine, I can't help but feel this movie is a bit overrated.<br/><br/>Let me start by saying I like movies in this sub-genre. As an ex-drug abuser myself, I find solace in watching fictional characters struggle with an affliction that was once part of my own life, and there's a sort of therapy involved there that seems to make one feel as if someone, even a fictional someone, at least understands the pain an addict goes through. I also just plain like raw, dark, and gritty movies. I'm not a ""Mary Poppins"" or ""The Sound of Music"" kind of guy, and any movie that sheds light on the seedy underbelly of society is okay in my book. Sure, the message is often bleak and depressing, but at least it's not contributing to the lie that mainstream movies try to sell, where everything is cute, life is wonderful, the bad guys always get punished, and any conflict is wrapped up with a nice little bow in the end.<br/><br/>With that being said, I went into ""Trainspotting"" fully prepared to feast on the dark nature of the film and find myself immersed in a cast of characters that I could relate to. But I was sadly disappointed. Things started off well enough: I loved Ewan McGregor's opening monologue, describing the pointless, cliché choices we as civilized humans tend to make in regards to our lives...as if we're all just drones, doing whatever society tells us we should do. I know that I can personally relate to feeling like this at many points in my life. But sadly, it was all downhill from there.<br/><br/>If I had to point out any one, main problem with the movie, it was my lack of attachment to any of the central characters. I felt unable to sympathize, or ever really care what happened to any of them. And in a movie like this, such a thing is critical. The cast was all fine and dandy, so it was nothing to do with that, but I just felt...detached. I think it might have had something to do with the fact that from the moment we are introduced to these characters, they're all already drug addicts. Part of the impact of these sort of films, for me anyway, is being able to witness the fall from grace...to see a good life gutted and destroyed by drug abuse. But as it stands, we never get a glimpse of what life was like -before- these characters were all on drugs, and to me that leaves a bit of a void.<br/><br/>And for however ""dark"" one may think the film is, I personally didn't find it all that bleak. ""Requiem for a Dream"" (my personal favorite movie about drug addiction of all time) makes this look somewhat childish in comparison. That's not to say that there aren't dark moments in the film, because there are, and when they do it hit, they leave an impact. But overall, I felt more emphasis was placed on the weirdness of the characters, and some of them were a little too much for me to handle.<br/><br/>The film is surprisingly void of any intense drama, which I sort of expected considering the subject matter. I realize this was probably intentional and done to avoid being ""cliche"", but I could have done with a little more intensity and drama.<br/><br/>This bland feeling overpowered me through most of the movie, and I found myself checking the running time to see how much time had elapsed, which is usually always a bad sign while watching any movie. I have to say the film did redeem itself in the end, and probably made me add another star to it than I normally would have. I really liked the outcome of the story, which makes it a shame that both the beginning and end caps of the film were filled with what was in between.<br/><br/>I realize I'm going against the grain here with this review, but I see no point in hailing this as some sort of modern masterpiece when personally I don't see it myself. Maybe I just have bad taste, but I feel it pays to be honest in these matters, and I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and call this a fantastic movie when I don't really believe it is. Something about it felt empty to me, and it wasn't nearly as impacting as I had hoped it would be. It's no ""Requiem for a Dream"", that's for sure."
"gcd70","7","7","8","25 March 2008"," In your face cinema
","Amazingly in your face cinema from director Danny Boyle and writer John Hodge. Adapted form Irvine Welsh's novel, this is the story of four desperate heroine addicts who chose hard drugs rather than life. Instead of the drudgery of the every day, they prefer the ecstatic rush of the heroine hit.<br/><br/>Audiences will have to ride through the early scenes that may put you off public toilets (among other things) for life. If you are even the least bit queasy, then ""Trainspotting"" is one film you should avoid. Containing much 'toilet' humour and graphic drug use scenes, this is not cinema for the faint hearted.<br/><br/>Once you've adapted to Boyle's full on style (which contains some violence too), then you can really start to appreciate the sharp, incisive script from John Hodge, with its clever, biting humour which forces you to laugh at a way of life that is as close to rock bottom as you can get. Boyle and Hodge have given their film a unique Scottish feel, and the culture and psyche of Edinburgh's down and out comes through brilliantly.<br/><br/>Of course there is the question of whether this flick glorifies drug addiction. Some aspects of the abuse of heroine are conveyed as a fantastic rush and a great escape, generally though the addicts are shown to be no-hopers headed for nothing but death and destruction.<br/><br/>The other immensely enjoyable aspect of ""Trainspotting"" is the fantastic cast. Ewan McGregor heads up the young thesps as ""Mark Renton"", the central figure in the story and the only guy we really hold out any hope for. Backing him up is Ewen Bremner as ""Spud"", the nervous young lad whose fetish for ""speed"" makes him very excitable. Jonny Lee Miller is ""Sick Boy"", another rather twisted individual whom we find has a heart beneath his deceptive, tough exterior. But the real psycho is Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a guy who wouldn't touch hard drugs and believes that those who use them are soft in the head. His violent temper and passion for brawling make him a distinctly unlikeable chap. Then there's Tommy (Kevin McKidd), straight guy and fitness freak who enjoys taping erotic encounters with long term love Liz. Finally there is young Diane, a feisty femme who proves a handful, and a surprise, for young Renton. All performances from this collective band are strong, with McGregor the shining beacon at the top.<br/><br/>Brian Tufano delivers some confronting cinematography, Masahiro Hirakubo supplies the sharp editing and the soundtrack contains a fresh collection of trendy tunes.<br/><br/>Tuesday, July 2, 1996 - Hoyts Cinema Centre Melbourne<br/><br/>Seeing Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" for a second time really helps clarify what the movie is about, and that is what a dreadful life one can have if one chooses a drug of addiction such as heroin. On the other hand, if one chooses life, it can be a very intoxicating drug, as young Renton finally discovers.<br/><br/>Standouts are still Boyle's in your face direction which leaves no aspect of the destitution of drug abuse untouched, and the performances from Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Caarlyle and Kelly McDonald which bring to life the vivid characters who live this sorry existence.<br/><br/>A groovy soundtrack accompanies Boyle's innovative film.<br/><br/>Monday, April 7, 1997 - Hoyts Croydon"

","What a great film this is. I love how they can take the lives of ordinary people and make them seem cool. The accents in this movie are more than killer I can't get enough of them. I love how the movie is shot and I love the choppy cadence of the monologues. I really want to go to Scotland now after seeing this movie. I think all the acting was amazing and the characters were great. This movie has not one, but two jamming soundtracks. It is a definite in my DVD collection, as well as my CD collection. I haven't read the book, but I really want to. With a movie as well done as this the book must be amazing. It also makes me want to say no to drugs. Heroin looks like an all around bad idea. I highly highly recommend this film. It is amazing and most certainly worth watching."

","'Trainspotting' is a bleak, powerful and harrowing indie film, which propelled then unknown British actor, Ewan McGregor, onto the world stage. Its a controversial examination of the exploits, simultaneously humorous and poignant, of a coterie of Scottish drug addicts. Amazingly enough, this is only the second directorial effort from Danny Boyle after his acclaimed debut, ""Shallow Grave""(1994). Shot entirely on location in the capital of Scotland, Edinburgh, it revolves around six key characters--Mark, Francis, Sickboy, Spud, Tommy and Diane. The film is narrated by Ewan McGregor's central character, Mark ""rent-boy"" Renton, who decides to change his self-destructive lifestyle. His struggle to quell his heroin addiction subsequently effects his relationship with his family and drug-addled friends. Some will extol the film's unsettling and harsh depiction of a gang of drug junkies whereas others will rebuke the film for glorifying and advocating drug use.<br/><br/>'Trainspotting' is like modern-day ""Clockwork Orange"" in terms of temperament and setting, as it were. There are a few scenes that are somewhat reminiscent of 'Clockwork Orange' but aren't necessarily identical. In essence, its a film about youth culture as well as drugs. and its incredibly funny. Its not easy to watch, though. Its not for the squeamish, that's for sure. There are really disturbing images that will haunt the viewer days, if not weeks, after seeing the film. I've seen a lot of great drug-themed films(ex: 'The Man With The Golden Arm', 'Drugstore Cowboy', 'Down to The Bone' and 'Requiem for A Dream' immediately come to mind), ""Trainspotting"" joins the list. I don't know if its the best one out of the bunch, but I like it the most. Its a rather strange film in the sense that there's no concrete story. A great deal happens inside the character's head and some of it is quite disturbing. Only toward the end is there a semblance of a chronological narrative. Boyle deserves credit for eschewing social realism because the film isn't as depressing as a result. Instead of basking in the depravity of the characters, he has chosen to celebrate the prosperity of life, even in the hardships of these junkies.<br/><br/>The performances are simply exceptional through and through. As the flawed yet redeemable Mark Renton, Ewan McGregor turns in an outstanding performance, probably the finest of his entire career. He reportedly went to extremes, like Christian Bale did for ""The Machinist"", to make his character look more believable as far as physical appearance was concerned. Bravo!. The great Robert Carlyle, however, owns the film as the alcoholic, violent, mercurial psychotic, Francis Begbie. He exudes a sense of danger and ominousness whenever he appears on screen. Its a shame that this brilliant, chameleon-like actor has never received an Oscar nomination. Its been long overdue after so many great performances in his career. Johnny Lee Miller, despite the brevity of his role, gives an excellent performance as the James Bond-loving heroin addict, ""Sickboy"". There are other performances well worth mentioning as well. Ewen Bremner is quite superb as the funny nitwit, ""Spud"". Kevin McKidd really shines as Tommy, a drug-free but curious athlete. Kelly MacDonald makes a stellar acting debut as the lovable ""Diane"", the voice of reason for Mark Renton. James Cosmo and Eileen Nicholas are effective as Mark Renton's parents.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is really top-notch. Besides the uniformly great performances, the film has a great script, solid screenplay by John Hodge(received Oscar nomination for Best Adapted Screenplay), clever editing, arresting cinematography, sharp and witty dialogs. The narration by Ewan McGregor is excellent and helps propel the story. The direction by Danny Boyle is truly superb. The soundtrack and innovative techniques really add to the film's drug-soaked atmosphere as well. ""Trainspotting"" is a film that will age well. After 11 years, its still as powerful and influential as ever. One of the classic chronicles of addiction. Make seeing this film a priority."

","I saw this movie last year as a friend had it on DVD from the UK and, being a Ewan McGregor fan, I thought I'd give it a shot even though it's considered an 'artsy' film. I was so shocked!  It is a fantastic movie. I watched it over & over until she made me give it back. The young Ewan gives an Oscar-worthy (why he wasn't nominated is beyond me) turn as the heroin addict trying to pull himself out and away from his addict buddies. He narrates the whole film with that rich Scot accent of his (reminds me of my Scottish grandparents) which gives even more depth to the characters and situations. The descent into the hell of addiction to the death of an innocent baby (very realistic) in their 'home', Ewan swimming through a vast sea of crap (yes, THAT kind) in a toilet, on through the entire film showing his constant struggle within himself amidst his friends to stay clean & sober is amazing. I could go on and on. It brings a memory of another film I saw years ago with a young Leo DiCaprio & David Thewlis in a little-seen movie called ""Total Eclipse"" and which is also considered an ""art"" film and really quite good. If you get a chance to see this, please do. You will not be sorry. If you happen to find it on DVD, BUY IT."
"ayrhead","10","9","12","23 April 2005"," absolutely fantastic
","This film is, to use that old cinematic cliché, a rollarcoaster. The film portrays the lives of a group of friends, most of whom are heroin addicts and the story of their seemingly relentless march towards simultaneous self destruction and discovery. Having lived in Scotland all my life the film does what few mainstream box-office smashes dare to, which is to give an accurate and truthful (if not slightly comical) portrayal of life for drug addicts and the lower classes in Scotland. This is made all the more poignant by the fact the story is set in Edinburgh, a city renound for its beauty and wealth, but which has a seedy underbelly of poverty, violence and drug abuse in the city's peripheral housing schemes (ignored by the wealthy inhabitants of the city centre). A strong plot excellent characters and a brilliant soundtrack all contribute to this masterpiece."
"cpbadgeman","9","5","6","19 November 2007"," Flawless adaptation of a groundbreaking book
","It is doubtful that there is much new that can be said at this stage about this adaptation of Irvine Welsh's triumphant 1993 novel of the same name. The film follows the misadventures of a group of extremely dysfunctional characters who are immersed in an underworld of addiction, crime, and violence. Their darkly funny antics are shortsighted, aimless, and nearly always have a tragic outcome. In this universe, the humane become casualties and only the most unprincipled have any chance of escape. Nearly all of the main protagonists are addicts of one sort or another, with heroin being the drug of choice. However, this film does not glorify drug use. The addict lifestyle and worldview is portrayed as being just as pointless and empty of meaning as the materialistic values and aspirations that are promoted by mainstream society.<br/><br/>The richness of the material allows the audience to read ""Trainspotting"" in many ways: as a scathing social commentary, a superb existential black comedy, a bleak human drama, a gritty portrayal of addiction in it's many forms, or as a meditation on the meaning of self and the nature of friendship in a brutal world. However one chooses to understand it, this film relentlessly challenges it's audience. It is by turns compelling, hilarious, and horrific. Danny Boyle's direction is truly outside-the-box in terms of his depiction of amoral characters in an amoral world. The dialogue is razor sharp and the acting is top notch. Special mention should also be given to the cinematography and set-design, and the soundtrack is flawless. This film is a classic."
"rooee","9","8","11","12 April 2010"," Choose the best British film of the nineties
","Director Danny Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge's 1996 adaptation of Irvine Welsh's 1993 debut novel was so central to young British culture at that time that it was always in danger of being forgotten as a mere curio of a bygone Britpop era. Thankfully, good comedy leads a long life, especially the black stuff. In the meanest, wittiest way, Trainspotting said ""bollocks"" to Britpop - in fact, it said ""bollocks"" to every fad and fashion going - and so it became immortal.<br/><br/>Welsh's novel is, like many of his works, essentially a series of short stories bound together by a group of amiable, self-centred protagonists who share a common interest in the procurement of a life-affirming experience - in this case heroin. Unfilmable as such, Boyle and Hodge do an astonishing job of wrapping up a majority of the best Edinburgh tales in a tight 90-minute narrative. The misadventures of Renton (Ewan McGregor), Spud (Ewen Bremner) et al is alluring because their lust for life eclipses their need for skag - the physical enjoyment is never denied, and yet neither is our heroes' desire to see above and beyond the depravity and the mundanity. The film-makers are not simply allowing us to relate to these emaciated thieves - they are necessarily ensuring it.<br/><br/>The casting is spot-on. McGregor puts in a signature performance as the amiable Mark Renton; Bremner brings the sensitive Spud hilariously to life; Robert Carlyle is unforgettable as the monstrous Francis Begbie - a man I fear we have all met and to whose jokes we have all felt obliged to laugh. Johnny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, and feature débutant Kelly Macdonald support superbly.<br/><br/>What's the point of it all? you might ask. To say its simply about capturing a moment in British pop culture would be to deny the quality of its storytelling. Trainspotting is more than a zeitgeist because, for all its swagger and the brilliance of its soundtrack, it possesses an intricate, multi-taloned narrative navigated by 3D characters, more than one of whom finds his way to an uplifting and hopeful conclusion. Trainspotting is vital."

The most disgusting moment was the toilet: an apt illustration of just what you will do for drugs. The amorality of sex with a schoolgirl is also apropos.<br/><br/>This film is funny at times, but certainly there was no glamor. It was just some sick people with their lives going in circles.<br/><br/>John Hodge's screenplay was magnificent. Danny Boyle's (Shallow Grave, 28 Days Later...) direction was super.

With its flat and ridiculous characters and romanticising of narcotics, the film to me is just mildly entertaining - if unpleasant at times - crap.<br/><br/>The book is another story altogether. I've never read anything quite like it, and was always surprised that Irvine Welsh seemed to like the film so much. The characterisation and impetus of plot and narrative are exceptional in the book, you literally can't put it down. Whilst the book cleverly deals with an underbelly of Scottish life, the film makes me cringe to be Scottish. The book lives and breathes reality, the film seems like a David Bowie video."
"hjpog","10","9","13","17 June 2017"," A mind blowing masterpiece.
","The film tells us that life is totally in our hands, the way we want it when we want it either to choose easy happiness or hard happiness, or not to choose anything at all. It could be one of the most impressive films about drug addiction. I also think it is the film that best describes the life style of the '90s, and the life of the teenager lost in this fast paced age. The best thing about the film is that, just like real life, the film can be interpreted by different people in many different formats. Nowadays, it is possible to find people who see this movie as a lifestyle. And because of youth criticism this film can be likened to Fight Club. Among the views about this movie are the comments of two groups of people who are really opposed to it. A group claims that the film is trying to spread drug use, while the other group claims that the film criticizes drug use. This certainly reveals the ability of the director and screenwriter. Because the film director is extremely neutral. Renton and his colleagues show drug addiction both in ways that ruin life and in life-changing aspects. Any comment from here is completely dependent on the locator. This neutral point of view on drugs in the film is the most important element that makes this film different from other films about drugs. Beyond everything is actually a journey story Trainspotting. Mark Renton's trainspotting, from Scotland to England, from a drug crisis, and a different kind of spiritual journey, without needing any curtains. The name Trainspotting is the name given to the act of recording the number of trains passing by on a train station, usually made by young children in England. Trainspotting characters, especially Renton, are always a move, a quest for the exact opposite of this still activity. While the whole world is still standing and watching the passers-by, Renton and his colleagues are on a journey with a head- up, a break from everything and everyone. Renton and his friends have resisted this moral, bourgeois lifestyle, all the norms set by society, and the tragic life that has been like Trainspotting, which has kept the human being motionless and killed the soul. It is a film that starts with irony and ends with irony. ""I do not want to choose life"" in response to Mark Renton's Lust for Life song, and at the end of the film, Mark tells a story with a full irony speech, It can be said that the two scenes that make the best use of irony in cinema history. To sum up, Trainspotting is the story of those who are not afraid to hit the bottom. Acceptance of life filled with short and disappointments. The story of those who chose to be hungry with the truths of life, filled with empty stories."

No preaching and that made this film wonderful.<br/><br/>The portrayal of drug use and effects of its depravity are disturbing and surreal and fresh owing to Danny Boyle's style of shaky camera movements.<br/><br/>

","I spent half the duration of this film with my eyebrow raised and occasionally wincing. This movie is rife with cursing, nudity, drug use, alcohol, disturbing images (that doesn't just mean dead bodies, although there is one in it) crudity, screaming, psychedelic flashes, crime, twisting minds, feces, pornography, knives, treachery, madness, blood, noise, you name it! The result is a movie which not only boasts incredible acting, but a tangible plot line, and a lesson that one can learn because it is immersed in such a vibrant and... eh, different plot.<br/><br/>Do not mistake this movie for something like 'Requiem for a dream'. This i s not a movie that intends to spread anti-drug propaganda. Nonetheless, that is exactly what we get out of this movie, after we see how revolted we are with the main characters, only two of whom are worth anything. In the main 5 characters, we have a drug-free, irreverent psycho with a temper to match Timur's. We have an addicted young man who tries to quit, but just can't get free of his dirty lifestyle and eventually betrays all of his friends in a scam. We have a not-quite right in the head junkie with weak bowel control (oddly enough, maybe the one most appealing character in the movie). We have a blonde addict with certain criminal tendencies and a dead baby on his mind. We have a semi-crazed addict who breaks up with his girlfriend because he lost a porno with their video in it and eventually resorts to eating cat feces (charming).<br/><br/>These five characters do things that would revolt the most twisted, demented incarcerate. One shoves drug-pills up his *** and then dives into a VERY clean toilet to get them (needless to say, this is sarcasm). One would fight/maim anything up to and including architecture. One...<br/><br/>Well, it's useless to describe the main characters and their actions. This is something that has to be seen to believed. But WARNING:...<br/><br/>This movie is not for the weak-stomached or perfectionists. Here, you will see what is possibly the worst of humanity in all of it's dirt, crudity, and viciousness. Here, you will hear cursing that would make a sailor stop chewing and cross himself (actually, only 'In Bruges' has more curse words per minute).<br/><br/>A triumph. 9/10"

It is funny and heartbreaking at the same time, anchored by Ewan MacGregor's absolutely devastating performance as Renton. Put his performance up against the Best Actor nominees in any given year and I dare you to say it doesn't belong.<br/><br/>Contrary to what others have posted, Trainspotting absolutely made an impact here in the States. That may have been to Danny Boyle's detriment as he's never quite reached the same heights since.<br/><br/>But for us, in the U.S., you have to realize that it was basically a foreign film because you can't understand about 25% of the dialogue because the accent is so thick. Begbie's dialogue is purposely opaque, I think. Not that it matters - the performance is rock solid.<br/><br/>If you haven't seen the movie, go out and get it.

We are all at once drawn to these characters lifes but also repulsed by them at the same time but importantly we care about them, which is a real testament of the writing.<br/><br/>The acting is of the highest order, Boyle's directing is the best it has been ever, has it really been matched by the global hit Slumdog, i don think so, with this he really hit a all time high. <br/><br/>Trainspotting is a charcoal blacker than black comedy of historic proportions."

","Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a film that has left me perplexed ever since the first time I viewed it as a teenager nearly a decade ago. I remember, as I finished the film, thoroughly hating it. There was something about its subject matter and characters that I immediately found off putting. It wasn't until my third or fourth viewing of the picture that I really understood what Boyle was going for.<br/><br/>It's supposed to be off putting and the characters are supposed to be unlikable. The film shows just how much of an impact heroin can have on a young individual's life. It destroys it to the point where heroin because the only that the really matters. For these young drug addicts, the only thing that gets them through the day is the anticipation of the next hit. By using over-the-top visuals (the sequence with the dead infant in the crib is one that I won't be able to shake for sometime) and a rapid MTV music video style editing, Boyle makes the film visually fascinating while showing the truth behind the life of the average drug addict.<br/><br/>If I have a problem with the film it's that it really doesn't go far enough. Less quick cutting and hyper stylized editing and more human characters would have made the film deeper and more palatable. But, maybe that wasn't what Boyle was going for. With his use of editing, he shows just how much can be lost when one is stuck in the sad world of drug addiction. That, in and of itself, makes the film something special. The film is gritty and dark, both qualities that are rarely seen in Hollywood movies today. I still think the ending doesn't work as well as it should as it feels a bit too upbeat but that's a minor quibble of an otherwise fine film."

Not to mention a bevy of superb, brave performances. <br/><br/>This study of 4 young mates in Scotland, 3 drug addicts, and one addicted to violence reminds me in some ways of Paul Thomas Anderson's ""Boogie Nights"". Both take us behind the scenes of dark, dysfunctional works (drugs, porn), but do so with a sense of humor and humanity that transcends clichés and makes us relate to these characters as human beings, not just porn stars or drug addicts. These are both films full of ideas about choices and morality, without ever feeling moralistic or judgmental, and both use their central world as metaphors for the bigger worlds around them. You might escape porn, or drugs, but you can't escape the forces that push people into them,<br/><br/>(spoiler ahead!) <br/><br/>Indeed I'm surprised to read so many reviews claiming Trainspotting's ending is optimistic. Yes Renton is walking away from drugs, but he's also stabbing his mates in the back, and joining a world that's just as obsessive about money, success, drink, sex, material things, as an addict is about drugs. To me, that's what the whole, chillingly ironic 'choose life' monologue that bookends the film is all about. Really 'choosing life' is about a lot more than just saying 'no' to drugs. Not to mention the title 'Trainspotting' which refers to the innocent, but still obsessive, humanity-disconnected hobby of noting down types and times of trains that go by. Perhaps a slower death than drugs, but a turning away from living life just the same."

The film is bookended with two pulse-pounding sequences guaranteed to have your heart hammering along to the beat of Iggy Pop's iconic 'Lust for Life' and Underworld's eerily melancholic 'Born Slippy', respectively. Trainspotting is laden with deep-seeded regret, apathy and bitterness, most of which is robotically (by design) spewed out in the form of diatribes by Ewan McGregor's Renton; a character who is very much presented as a bystander within his own life, despite often inadvertently being the catalyst for many of the film's most dramatic twists, turns and blackly-tragic/comedic moments.

There is certainly a fair bit of comic relief here, but it felt like the director was a little unsure of its delivery as a result of the heavy subject matter.

Its sad that this movie didn't get the attention that it needed but it's not too late to change that. I recommend this movie to you 100% !!!!!!!"

","This movie was positively mind-blowing, a favorite in my circle of friends after it came out. Even the soundtrack hit on so many things we all knew and loved, Lou Reed, Iggy Pop, Underworld. It pulled us in from the opening scene with a great monologue and the old school thumping of everyone's favorite punk rocker.<br/><br/>When it came out we loved it. It was brutal, it was funny, it was tragic, we hadn't seen anything like it.<br/><br/>But we were 16 when it came out and living in Chicagoland. We were a long way from the source and had never heard of Irvine Welsh. It wasn't until a few years later, when we finally got a Borders in our area that we would find out how monumental a movie this was.<br/><br/>When we did, we found Welsh, we found the book the movie was based on and that somehow made the film all the better.<br/><br/>""Loosely interpreted"" would be a very fair thing to call it, but that isn't a shame, that isn't a negative.<br/><br/>The source material was as mind-blowing as it was frustrating. Each chapter narrated by a different character and each one written in a Scottish accent.<br/><br/>You longed for Sick Boy's chapters, you could tear his apart in the blink of an eye, but Spud, Spud it took a month to translate that accent into anything near comprehensible.<br/><br/>There are more characters and, if you take the time to work through the accents, the book is a far greater prize than the film.<br/><br/>But when you read the novel, when you review the source material, you are stuck wondering how on earth could they ever turn a novel like Trainspotting into a movie? Yet they did. They not only turned it into a film, they turned it into a great film, a beautiful and funny look into the lives of addicts that is as tragic as it is hysterical.<br/><br/>They beat the odds with Trainspotting. Rarely, if ever, do you encounter such a brilliant translation of a novel that seems so monumentally difficult to turn from prose to film."
"ElMaruecan82","9","2","2","30 September 2016"," Some people never go crazy. What truly horrible lives they must lead...
","This is from ""Barfly"" which is to alcohol what ""Trainspotting"" is to heroin. This would make a helluva tag-line for the British cult-classic, but I'm not sure the feeling would last. Sepaking for myself, the worst toilet of Scotland is such a nightmarish vision it cured me from any temptation. Yes, I would keep my horrible life if it could spare me the use of laxative suppositories (I'm the type to cover the bowl with toilet paper before sitting).<br/><br/>Being less than a decade younger than most of the cast, I can say the word 'drug' belonged to my dictionary since childhood, I didn't know exactly what drugs were but that was the point, I wasn't even supposed to try to know. Even my favorite kids' magazine dared to employ the S-word to describe drugs. It came to the point that I avoided cigarettes like the plague because I thought the first one magically started the addiction. Well, it wasn't far from truth either but I wouldn't have tried to check if this also stood for drugs, well, not heroin anyway. That's just to say heroin (or cocaine) is the ultimate interrogation mark and I owe most the answers to movies. I guess ""Trainspotting"" stands in the Top 3 behind ""Requiem for a Dream"" and ""Panic in Needle Park"".<br/><br/>Things I learned about heroin from movies: there are two feelings when you're into them, one that transcends your highest perceptions of orgasm, and when the effect is over, the need for more drugs. Dependence and pleasure, that's the cycle of addiction. And having stopped smoking two years ago, I know how it feels to be dependent, you only wait for the next cigarette and everything is structured around drugs, in fact around addiction. And this is what Danny Boyle's directorial debut is about, the structuring effect of drugs in one's life and the alienating effect from the others' lives. The film sets the tone with its opening sequence featuring the three protagonists running in Edinburgh streets, why and where they run to isn't significant, it's all in Ewan McGregor's speech.<br/><br/>The opening monologue could have been delivered by Tyler Durden in ""Fight Club"", an ode to anarchic freedom devoid of greedy impulses, the independence from the diktat of fashion, consumption or the whole baloney about having a regular life, family, kids etc. The merit of this scene is double: it has the honesty to say that once you're in drugs, you don't really care for the norm, in fact, you can't care. The second is to grab the viewer from the collar and take him into this journey with a promising and catchy soundtrack that made the film one of the most emblematic of the 90's (hell, they even included Dance Music), the whole things feels exhilarating, cool and young. And you know what this immersion reminded me of? Martin Scorsese's ""Goodfellas"". <br/><br/>This is the kind of film that plunges you into an underworld with its codes, habits, or lack of, and the way their members look at the rest of the world, girls, family, law, and by the magic of the screen, make their lifestyle look almost (I say almost) appealing. Of course, organized crime has a slight edge what's with all the money, cars, suits, but in ""Trainspotting"", there's this dilettante quality, this detachment combined with a camaraderie between those 'who know'. We wouldn't want to try, but if there ever was another way to get an idea of what their lives feel like, we would. That's the mark of great films: to make you part of an experience, following protagonists from start to finish and see what lessons they or you learned. <br/><br/>And ""Trainspotting"" benefited from a an A-list of unforgettable characters, who complete each other perfectly. Mark (Ewan McGregor) is the guy under the influence, oscillating between heroin and Diane, his heroin so to speak (Kelly McDonald's debut), he talks so many times about quitting that we stopped taking his motivation as a serious factor. Spud (Ewen Bremner) is the goofiest of the bunch but also the nicest, he also tries to settle down and find a job but I'm not sure I'd try an interview under the effect of speed. Tommy (Kevin McKidd) is the clean guy with a weird habit to shoot himself while banging his girlfriend and by shooting I mean with a cam, only once he'll try with a needle, and it will be one time too many (Karma is the bitchiest of all). And there's Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) who talks about Sean Connery and overrated awards movies like a legitimate IMDb user. <br/><br/>And in the obligatory anger management department, Begbie (Robert Carlisle) pulls a Tommy De Vito in every single scene he is. Whenever you watch his pretty head, you know there's trouble coming. This is ""Trainspotting"" in a nutshell, it doesn't make drug look cool, like ""Goodfellas"", there's a moment where everything falls but it asks more questions than it provides answers. Speaking for myself (well it's a personal review what did you expect?), I spend so much time on IMDb, I love chatting about movies, sharing stuff with fellow movie geeks and reviewing that I wonder if it's not an addiction.<br/><br/>Indeed, I review whatever I see, and right now, I should be watching a film, but I've got to finish this review before, and tomorrow, I'll start the film after the review of ""Trainspotting"" etc., IMDb won't have the same effect as heroin, but after these years, I can say IMDb won and structured my life. This is why you can't expect a 'total victory' in ""Trainspotting"", only a series of new beginnings, new cycles and maybe this is the secret of its enduring appeal, when you finish it, you wouldn't mind watching it again, in case you missed something."

","""Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career... But why would I want to do a thing like that?"" Even if you haven't seen Trainspotting, you'll be aware of the opening lines of Danny Boyle's 1996 masterpiece, and those opening lines are a pure reflection of whats going to happen and why you should avoid doing whats been done in the whole movie, if you want the option to ""Choose Life. Choose a job. Choose a career...."". I saw this movie recently and in my opinion it's a masterpiece, a lot of people don't give the deserved credit to this movie simply because they've missed the point of the movie, this is not a drug appealing movie, this is a anti-drug movie. Trainspotting is brave enough to bring a humour and levity to the subject of drug abuse, without ever ignoring the accompanying and unavoidable squalor and devastation, and that's why this movie deserves so much credit, after 20 years this is still useful to reflect about life choices and drugs."
"olie2008","9","2","2","1 January 2011"," An electrically charged homage to British pop culture.
","At initial glance, Trainspotting, dealing with somewhat rather controversial issues, seems horrendously sickening. Despite this, taking Trainspotting for what it is, Danny Boyle's second venture into the world of film seems rather uplifting and invigorating despite the somewhat macabre storyline. Clearly making references and paying tribute to many independent pioneers of pop cultural ladened films, it surprised me to discover that Trainspotting is in fact based on the novel of the same name. Despite such a fresh and promising film, Trainspotting when examined under close scrutiny seems rather unextraordinary. Although performances from most of the cast are rather nice, with special praise going to Ewan McGreggor and Robert Carlyle, the storyline still seems to be rather void of any life; it instead has to rely upon it's pop cultural references and controversial themes to keep both the plot and its audience plodding along nicely. Trainspotting is ultimately a fantastic homage to all things, admittedly not the best selection, British. It's because of this, and with some rather nice camera work, that the audience deems it acceptable to look over any minor errors that stop this film from becoming a brilliant piece of British cinema."

"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","2","2","31 March 2008"," Edgy and brazen ""Trainspotting"" still holds up to current indie standards
","(This review was updated in 2016)<br/><br/>Independent cinema in the UK – and the world, frankly – has never been the same since ""Trainspotting."" The counterculture spirit of Irvine Welsh's novel was the perfect source for a film that would effectively raise a middle finger to mainstream tastes and challenge storytelling norms. Director Danny Boyle makes on a shoestring budget the type of film that studios actively try and produce in today's day and age.<br/><br/>The film follows a group of mates living in Edinburgh, Scotland, most of who are heroin junkies, and Boyle gives their story a seedy, grimy, punk aesthetic that will make proper filmgoers' skin crawl. John Hodge's script aggressively confronts anyone of ""civil tastes"" with a voice-over monologue from main character Renton (Ewan McGregor) talking about societal pressure to choose certain norms. Renton chooses heroin, and if you're not willing to hear him out, then you can go **** off.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" walks a fine line between glorifying addiction and being direct about the horrors of getting hooked on the ""shite."" On one hand, Renton and buddies Tommy (Kevin McKidd), Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) appear to have this spontaneous, invincible 20-something lifestyle, and on the other hand they're all sick and it's clear their lives are dictated by smack, either because they're slaves to it or because they're on the roller coaster of trying to get off it. Hodge's script presents the highs and the lows in equal measure and Boyle uses a combination of music and imagery to amplify them both.<br/><br/>Boyle was among those filmmakers in the '90s who absolutely set the tone for movie soundtracks (along with Quentin Tarantino, for example). These directors understood the way audiences respond and relate to pop culture, that our identities and feelings grow around them and inform how we go through the world. Such is the case for these characters who love Iggy Pop, for example, or – like Sick Boy – get philosophical about Sean Connery roles because he was the only image of Scottish masculinity at the time. Music in particular is tied to emotion, and Boyle uses it to create a range of moods for the film.<br/><br/>He also achieves so much with practical effects and set design. Renton's withdrawal hallucinations have a perfectly creepy tone using simple set design elements and camera angles, and he utilizes a number of subtle shots and effects to capture the more blissful drug highs. The ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" sequence captures the horrible realities and the strange surrealism of drug addiction in one rather unforgettable clip.<br/><br/>Although the style of ""Trainspotting"" definitely stands out more than the story, a second or closer viewing reveals that the film definitely isn't choosing style instead of substance. Renton's role as narrator really helps facilitate that, offering a means of both the character and the audience to process and reflect on the often wild and obscene events that unfold. The film's ending, for example, doesn't work without some insight into Renton's thought process and the underlying ethos.<br/><br/>To this day, Renton remains one of McGregor's best characters. His roles have gotten stiffer and more dramatic over the years (with a few exceptions) since he broke out with ""Star Wars"" and ""Moulin Rouge!"" and Renton is a nice reminder of his versatility and ability to play more of an everyman, in this case one who ping-pongs from likable to despicable to pitiable and everything in between through the short course of the film.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" contains so many contemporary indie filmmaking trademarks that it could be remade shot for shot today and it wouldn't feel the least bit dated; you'd only know that it took place in the '90s – you wouldn't guess that it was first made then too. What was once avant-garde in ""Trainspotting"" is now commonplace, yet 20 years later it still has an exciting edginess to it that will likely still connect with future generations of viewers.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Thanks for reading!

","I have to say that having read the book and watched the film, I thoroughly enjoyed both. Ewan MacGregor was excellent as Renton and Jonny Lee Miller was fantastic as Sick Boy.<br/><br/>I think for us Brits the film suffered a little from the typical over hyping of all British Films to hit the big screen but even with that it was one of the best British Films of the 90's.<br/><br/>I don't agree with the glamorising drug use argument as a reason to not watch this film, you only have to watch the scenes where Renton is going cold turkey to realise that.<br/><br/>But I can see how non scots would struggle with the dialogue at times, which is very broad, but if you can't understand the film i would not even bother trying to read the book.<br/><br/>in summary, an excellent film, great character portrayals, a must see for everyone."

It did retain a quirky, original kind of vibe all the way through; helmed by somewhat unappreciated director Danny Boyle, who has a unique approach to film-making. The 'anti-drugs' message is relatively clear: I suppose this is the embedded message within the film, asking the audience: ""Would you like to end up like these people?""

"Jacques98","7","16","34","15 November 2009"," Like the main character, I just don't care.
","If a middle-aged man were to walk outside his house right now in a chicken suit and started attacking small children, a lot of people would say he lacks maturity. Or, perhaps, that he's a pervert. If he sustained his attack long enough, he'd be on the news, and the police would come, handcuff him, and laugh in the guy's face. Lack of maturity is something that is obviously negative in out society. What I find interesting, though, is: what is labeled as immaturity in real life is labeled as sublime quirkiness on the movie screen. Sometimes. Other times, in case of shows like The Wiggles, immaturity is labeled as stupid. Other times, in case of comedies, immaturity is labeled as hilarious. Other times, in case of books like Naked Lunch, immaturity is labeled as offensive. Other times, in case of movies like Trainspotting, immaturity is just generic, boring, and I've seen this so many times I know exactly what's going to happen in five minutes, oh look! I was right.<br/><br/>I'll just get right to my point. Trainspotting is one of the most unoriginal movies I've ever seen in my life. From the opening surrealist toilet scene (which was used in everything from video games to books to artwork to cartoons long before Trainspotting was even an idea in the writer's head) to the childish DRUGS ARE REALLY, REALLY BAD!!! ending and everything between those two points.<br/><br/>The nihilistic characters are trite and safe, copy/pasted from some MTV reality show that contains 2% reality and 98% what looks cool. Their generic nihilistic actions are so safe, most eight-year-old boys would think they're lame, but, for some reason, the middle-aged crowd calls them ""intelligent"". The entire drug-addiction plot line plays out exactly like it did in that DRUGS ARE REALLY, REALLY BAD!!! video you had to watch in high school health class.<br/><br/>My point? It takes a lot more to shock people than a couple kids playing around in a toilet. There is absolutely nothing disturbing here whatsoever. Why? Because this is the pansy crap we see every single anti-drug movie ever made. It's so unabashedly unoriginal, I fail to see how anyone can even call it art, being that the definition of art is ""an original body or work"" . . .<br/><br/>The cinematography is generic, and is only even slightly inspired when it rips-off Kubrick. The acting is generic, being that I don't think it's hard for a young twenty-something to act as a young twenty-something. I don't even know why they even bothered giving the characters names, because they completely lack any sort of identity that real people have. The only identity they have is that, they're boring, flat, copy/paste characters who are addicted to heroin . . . and they do heroin . . . yeah. And even if people say this lack of identity originality is the point of the movie—which it's not—then I'll say back, Brent Easton Ellis' novel Less Than Zero did that exact thing ten years before this movie came out and seven years before Welsh's book came out, and it did it infinitely better and more realistically than either one.<br/><br/>If you liked Trainspotting, I pity you.<br/><br/>2/10"

","Oh, it's well-crafted. I'll give it that. It weaves awful things like heroin addiction and its attendant horrors into a cutesy story that ultimately paints an irresponsibly rosy picture of being a young screw- up who's addicted to heroin.<br/><br/>The movie gets its sweet taste from two things: a) sexy and talented young actors, and b) those sexy young actors hooking up with other sexy young actors. That's how it sells the crap underneath it: the idea that heroin addiction is just another (acceptable) alternative lifestyle. <br/><br/>First of all yeah, young people are usually easy on the eyes. But talk to real-life drug-addicted youths, or just watch the VICE documentaries on young heroin or Krokodil addicts, and you'll see that their lifestyles not only typically render them even less visually appealing than that one guy in Trainspotting was just before he died. You'll see that real-life youth who have lifestyles like the kids in Trainspotting are flushing their budding little lives down the toilet, rendering them uglier than any physical trait could.<br/><br/>See, real junkies are just sad and scary because they're on a slippery slope to death or getting locked up somewhere. They're also not all witty and intelligent. Trainspotting presents sordid aspects of the junkie lifestyle, but at the same time intoxicates me with these pretty people, and with the impression that everything will turn out all right for them in the end. I also think that it ignores the possibility of permanent brain, body, and psychological damage that such a lifestyle can cause."

"jpschapira","8","3","4","18 March 2008"," Choose...what?
","Choose life. What does that exactly mean? Well, to me it means a lot of things but if you want to explore what ""choose life"" doesn't mean to some people, you should experience Danny Boyle's cult classic ""Trainspotting"". In a way, all these characters seem to have chosen a way of life, but apparently see it as something closer to death. <br/><br/>Not with those exact words Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) explains the commitment of being an addict, but somehow he manages to expose his philosophy to the viewer while introducing us to his friends; some who support the philosophy, some who don't and some who don't even care. But I don't think that's ""Trainspotting's"" main point: showing how drugs can affect people. <br/><br/>For instance, there's one character, Begbie (Robert Carlyle), who doesn't consume at all but has (maybe) a bigger problem: an obsession with violence. He enjoys kicking people around and making them bleed. That's another point, another issue that affects Renton and the rest of his friends; the silly Spud (Ewen Bremmer), the unpredictable Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the lost Tommy (Kevin McKidd). <br/><br/>The real star of the film is John Hodge's screenplay, based on Irvine Welsh's novel. It contains a heavy dose of character development that can be spotted clearly among the heroin injections and delusions of his creatures. It reminded me a lot of Terry Gilliam's ""Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas"" (with the exception of character development) because, like that film that also focused on drugs, ""Trainspotting"" has no defined plot line: it's like a roller-coaster ride that finishes and starts again without you being able to get off your seat. There are two times where you clearly sense the movie's coming to an end, but suddenly Hodge and Boyle bring something new to the table. <br/><br/>Like in ""Fear"", ""Trainspotting"" has a heavy load of narration (by Renton) that helps and confuses the viewer at the same time. It helps to understand the inner feelings of someone so consumed by an addiction like Renton. There are two beautiful scenes that leave no doubt of Boyle's inventive visual style: one follows Renton to a hospital after hi faints with a dose of heroin, another shows him in his own room recovering from his problem (this meaning not having a 'hit'-an injection-for weeks). Both scenes are visually stunning in a way that I would like to detail but don't want you to miss; so I'll just say they almost border surrealism.<br/><br/>Some time before these scenes, something occurs that provokes a major change in the film. At that point, if you have gotten used to the fact that the plot is not defined and lies beyond confusion (Renton's narration is confusing because it has some contradictions and sometimes doesn't let the viewer to think by itself), you might appreciate the final moments of the movie, like when Renton goes to London and Boyle creates a ten-second take of the city's most iconic places and it looks like a tourism commercial that doesn't fit with the tone the movie is employing at the timeBut it works; because it's funny and original. <br/><br/>Unlike Ewan McGregor's performance, for example. His Renton is the kind of role that gets a Scottish actor out of Scotland and catapults him to Hollywood. It involves being 'too Scottish', fairly good-looking and very charismatic. I'm not saying it's a bad performance, I'm just saying it's not difficult to achieve, and it helped McGregor's career greatly. <br/><br/>The rest of the guys basically have to do the same, which is something I adore in a way. I adore how British writers/directors/actors or whatever deal with friendship. It's a more disinterested way; you feel like no matter what happens, they'll always be there at the end of the day. It's just a true feeling, and I'm not telling you to expect it in this film, but if that were the case; it shouldn't matter whether you choose life or any other thing."
"yaniv_ilanotv2","9","3","4","9 November 2007"," Brilliant film - very honest
","What I liked most of all in Trainspotting - above the brilliant directing, acting and storytelling - is the completely objective portrayal of heroin. I never used heroin myself and i'm not going too, but it is very nice to see once in a while a film which does not tell you ""do not do drugs, it's evil"" - but rather portray them from objective point of view - the good, and the bad. And ironically, this fact made me even more afraid of drugs, and deliver the perfect anti-drug message.<br/><br/>While the beginning might seem like it is praising heroin (""take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by 1000 and you're still nowhere near heroin...""), it proceed to a different direction, and shows, sometimes in very disgusting ways, how much the character depend on the drug. For example, the scene where Berton dives to the most disgusting toilet ever (while viewing the scene, remember - this is chocolate!) just to get his drug... The number of times a character states ""i'm out of it"", or ""this is my last shot"" is huge, yet they are having great difficulties to stand by their word.<br/><br/>Overall - the movie is entertaining, funny, and very recommended."
"Bo16","8","3","4","29 May 2007"," Enter British disturbia...
","Chronicling the lives and trends of a group of addicts, Trainspotting is a raw, deep and honest look at the pros, cons and horrors of abusiveness to addiction.<br/><br/>As Renton (Ewan McGregor) and Spud (Ewen Bremner) hurl down the street with the energy of a Duracell bunny it's apparent that there's something very powerful about Trainspotting. As the Iggy Pop's 'Lust for Life' pounds through your ears it may be difficult to realise at first. Is it this iconic choice of soundtrack? Could it be the pain that you feel along with the actors, who gurn and gasp as they push their way through the streets of Edinburgh? Or could it in fact be the startlingly stirring voice-over provided by Ewan McGregor? Yeah, that would be it, though it is important that you remember something. This is the 1996 Ewan McGregor. Before Star Wars, or Moulin Rouge! and it was well before The Island. This is Ewan McGregor when he had to dive into toilets, and dig bodies. This is Ewan McGregor who didn't have the luxury of multi-million dollar deals or stunt doubles. This is Ewan McGregor who is only a stone's throw from the drug addled character he's playing, and above everything else that shows.<br/><br/>One of the many initial criticisms of Trainspotting has been that it seems to be promoting drug use and it doesn't take long to see why. The film starts off startlingly realistically with Renton sneering that he wouldn't do drugs if he didn't enjoy it. With this, we learn at breakneck speed that the world of drug abuse that we've been taught about and steered away from is like any other addiction and that to an extent, we, the average viewer, are no better than these people. So light-hearted is the first quarter of the film, common sense seems to leave and it's not made entirely open why drugs are considered bad in society. But the enjoyable caper that you settle comfortably into doesn't last for long and soon it's apparent that director Danny Boyle is showing the good and the bad; the Heaven and the Hell. Whilst watching Trainspotting you're in junkie limbo.<br/><br/>Among the themes of drugs, there are others relating to everyone. A core idea is the Choose Life movement, a phrase repeated throughout the film to perfectly nauseating effect. ""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a career. Choose a family. Choose a f**king big television"" Both stark and hideously blunt, the truth about conformity in materialism soon sets in to make it apparent that 'choosing life' may well be exactly the opposite. On top of that, in case anybody is worried that they might not be able to relate to Renton's drug issues, addiction on other levels is explored thoroughly. A commentary on how prescription pill popping is just as damning but seen as much less crude by society is but one.<br/><br/>Considering that Trainspotting isn't quite an ensemble cast film, it's surprising to what extent most of the main characters are explored. Before the end, qualities, problems, traits and secrets of just about all the major characters are exposed and examined. There is no character that could be accused of being a strict (or even slight) cliché. Naturally, because Renton is an addict, you wouldn't really trust him if he tried to tell you his life story in the pub and so frequently, he is played off as an unreliable narrator. There are numerous times that he exclaims that he will do something, usually get off the heroin, to no avail at all mostly because he simply hasn't the power to do this. At around the 65 minute mark, you really come into a full opinion of who he is and how much control he does (or doesn't) have over himself, his life and his addiction.<br/><br/>One of the main reasons Trainspotting excels at being such a disturbing film is that it doesn't back down at the thought of having to push the envelope and employ some abstract ideas in order to truly get a message across. The most effective uses of these are without doubt when juxtaposition is used to take an innocent idea and put it in a horrifyingly grim environment. Not only does this create a spellbinding effect, but Boyle and his crew also raise the bar by taking advantage of these moments to create real suspense.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, the camera-work and cinematography are fluid, inventive and original. The music is interestingly diverse and always fitting. The story itself is nothing new but is written and executed in such a wild fashion that everything seems fresh rather than recycled. However, you can only go so far on recycled material and as the stakes are raised, the film starts to lose focus of what has throughout, felt like the most core theme of the film. Not drugs, not addiction, but friends. Despite the advertising and the views of the film-makers and the controversy the key idea of friends always being there for one another is what feels like the blood pumping throughout the body of this film to keep it moving and invigorated. After all, with who else would you be able to ramble about the trivial knowledge you've garnered of James Bond over the years, shoot dogs with air rifles, recreate the legendary Beatles album walking across a road or refer to everything via your own personal favoured pop culture?<br/><br/>Trainspotting is a film for anyone who wants to take a trip to the dark side but also see the light that keeps people there. It's a film for anyone who's not afraid to cross the line. It's a film for anyone who chooses life.<br/><br/>4/5 (8/10)"

","One of the best films in the 90's, Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is also one of the most compulsively watchable. I saw this film for the first time in a friend's house, when he purchased it, about 7 years ago. We were on school vacations, so for many days we had nothing to do. We used to just sit in his living room, going ""ohhh. So now what?"". Practically, every time the answer was: ""let's watch it again"". The first time you see this film, you are left with little but a big time fun (which is, by the way, not at all a bad thing). But this film grows enormously with every successive time you watch it. Every character gains substance, and you begin to comprehend the depth of each one of the situations portrayed. This movie achieves to entertain, with a near-perfect pace, gorgeous performances and unbelievably wit lines, and still manages to tell an actually very important story, to reflect the view of the world that most of the people of our age share deep inside: the anger towards the modern empty ideals and the futility in resisting them. Trainspotting is one of the key movies of our generation, a document of great value and a film that will stay for years to come."

","I find that the two dug depicting movies that have marked audiences the most are Requiem for a Dream and Trainspotting. After several viewings of both movies, I came to the conclusion that Requiem touches upon audiences emotions and sentiments while Trainspotting touches upon their reason. Trainspotting offers a realistic depiction of drug use, making audiences enjoy the movie and not cry at then end as Requiem quite often does. An extremely intelligent script and famous ""trippy"" scenes (notably the famous, or even infamous to some, toilet scene) all add up to this movie's uniqueness in its genre. As the protagonist Renton puts it after all there is a concrete reason for their habits which are frowned upon by society. The realistic depiction of drugs like heroin are not enough to make a movie great. It is the subtle social implications raised which bring out the idea behind Trainspotting. Here, I am referring to the first lines of the movie, and when Renton evokes his mother's ""socially accepted"" drug addictions among many others. Also, the flow of the movie is really enjoyable, as the ending leaves its impact on the audience. Nonetheless, it isn't a positive depiction of drugs. The dark colors, the apartment's constantly decaying state, the dead baby, and Renton's friend's death reveal the utter realism of drugs."

It deals with some rough subjects - hard drug use, HIV, premature death, theft, bloodshed. But the movie in a great sense is about the attempts of one main character to go straight and ""choose life"", but his 4 dastardly friends end up making that very, very difficult.<br/><br/>It starts in Edinburgh, moves to London, then back to Edinburgh. The situations and dialog generally are very well written and performed. You have to have a sick sense of humor, like I do, to appreciate this scene, but the one where he ends up in the ""worst toilet in Scotland"", then realizes he has to retrieve his suppositories, is just great!<br/><br/>You really have to appreciate British humor to like this film.

I recall a film I saw in the late 1960's that did a much better job of portraying drug addiction. I don't get the relationship between the parents of the girlfriends and the guys.

","The best British film of the '90s? That's right, Trainspotting is a hilarious, dark, weird and sometimes painful masterpiece. Based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel (Welsh appears as a dealer, by the way), it's one of the most compelling, entertaining and shocking looks at the effect drugs can have on people, and it's to director Danny Boyle's eternal credit that he doesn't depict just one side of the story: we get to see what these people enjoy about getting high, so that we can, if not forgive them, at least understand them.<br/><br/>The film takes place in Edinburgh, Scotland, home to five youngsters who hang out and cause trouble together. The team's ""moral"" leader, not to mention the movie's narrator, is Mark Renton (Ewan Mcgregor, in a career-defining role), who knows he's slowly ruining his life and tries to kick the habit several times. That he'd rather have sex with an underage girl (Kelly MacDonald) than give his decision any serious thought doesn't speak very well on his part. His mates, in sanity order, are Tommy (Kevin McKidd), who's sane enough to stay away from heroin (he shoots DIY sex tapes instead), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a James Bond-obsessed pervert (ironic, since the actor's grandfather, Bernard Lee, played M in the Connery and Moore era), Spud (Ewen Bremner), so lost in an everlasting high he can't speak properly, and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), whose personal drug consists of beating up people, especially when they're not Scottish.<br/><br/>What gives the film a bit more edge compared to most dramas about drug addicts is its unrelented, anarchic energy, evident from the beginning, when Renton and Spud are running away from the police, with Iggy Pop's ""Lust For Life"" blaring on the soundtrack and the narration imposing itself with the famous ""Choose life"" monologue, arguably the best sample of junky philosophy in the entire movie. Boyle never stops for one second, but continues to jump between funny and tragic, real and imaginary, cheeky and serious, using Scorsese-worthy camera angles and movements and state-of-the-art dream sequences to grant us a rare view of the addict's mind and soul.<br/><br/>The double aspect is present in the performances as well: Miller and Bremner play it for laughs most of the time, therefore lightening the tone whenever Carlyle's madness or other external events threaten to make the picture too bleak. And then there's McGregor, the one caught in the middle between hilarity and darkness (literally, in the case of the terrifying overdose scene), who tells the story with the right combination of earnestness and irony.<br/><br/>Trainspotting isn't a lecture: it shows the ""fun"" part of doing drugs (the toilet dive) and the downside of it. It's not Ken Loach, it's Danny Boyle, which means it's one of the coolest, edgiest pictures of the '90s. A masterwork. It's also got the catchiest music of the decade, after Pulp Fiction, that is."

","Trainspotting is a 1996 drama British film, directed by Danny Boyle and based on the book of the writer Irvine Welsh. The film tells the story of a group of young heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland.
At the begining of the movie, the speech of a character says: ""choose life, choose a job, choose a career, a family..."" with this initial speech in the film we can also understand the idea of the search for control and something standardized about life. The essence of the narrative emphasizes an existencial emptiness that motivates individuals to perpetrate in a world where misery and social conventions can not supposedly achieve: drugs. However, as we perceive (as listeners to dialogue with the respective character), this refuge is expensive. We are taken to the gutter of ostracism, where the fissure reigns for one more dose at the expense of morality. The custom of choosing a career, family, care, etc, in the speech of this character, refers to us to the concept of a safe and stabilized life, where everything is in its place. Form this idea, we realize that the film tries to bring another reality of life, sends a message about the different about a group of young boys who want to get out of the anguish of ""normality"" and find something different."

"Kubris","9","2","3","24 November 2012"," Charm, culture and subtlety: but who needs that when you've got heroin?
","After more than 100 film reviews, I've decided that 9's or above are for films that knock me out in one way or another and completely immerse me in their world. Typically, it's incredible actors in their characters, or an atmosphere that bleeds out of the screen, epic scenes or wonderful music. <br/><br/>Trainspotting defies this rule: it just raises its hand in class, says ""Here"" in a thick Scottish accent, then begins. Trainspotting is superb and subtle, impossibly charming and quirky, with just the necessary amount of serious to remind you that drugs are no joke. Danny Boyle's direction is genius; he knows exactly what to show, for how long, and keeps the film concise.<br/><br/>Interestingly, Trainspotting, a film about heroin addiction, doesn't spend an hour and a half shaking its accusative fist at heroin, saying ""Bad! Bad!"" Unlike Requiem for a Dream, which is 100% damning of the drug, Trainspotting is more about the heroin users than the drug itself. And as Renton, the charismatic, slacker protagonist says early, they wouldn't do heroin if it was all bad. Because it's a recreational drug, it makes you feel good, and then you get addicted. To the lifestyle. To the people. Your ""friends"".<br/><br/>Trainspotting establishes a very unique identity by fully embracing its Scottish 'pride', not that Renton would agree. There are Beatles references, Sick Boy can't go a scene without talking about Sean Connery, and the club scene is copy-pasted with love from A Clockwork Orange. Hearing Begbie speak, or the now- nostalgia inducing soundtrack with Iggy Pop and Underworld forces a smile on your face. Even though the film's about heroin and has some sick, sick images.<br/><br/>Everything about the film is honest. Renton is honest. Mostly. All the characters have issues, and we love them. Even Spud. The acting is just what it needs to be, not serious philosophical looks at the human condition but some 20-somethings who make weak attempts to quit Junk. If anything I wish we saw more of the supporting cast: though the film's pace is incredibly fast, it would've been nice to see a little more of Tommy and Dianne, who get much less time on screen than I remembered from my first viewing. To add credibility to this: True Romance features the most magnetic character Gary Oldman has ever played, a trash pimp. Even though he has no purpose but to ****spoilers* die *end**** his one scene is extended and it's the best scene in the film. <br/><br/>An issue with drug films is that no matter how well they are made, the message is always the same, and it's a no-brainer. Drugs are bad. So I tried to find something else watching Trainspotting, and I came up with this: the film is a metaphor, saying ""quit screwing around with excuses and do something with yourself"", using the most powerful addictive substance as the vessel to convey this. If there's something you want to change about yourself, you won't escape it by staying in the same environment. Peer pressure ensures this. Perhaps those ""friends"" aren't really your friends after all. <br/><br/>I remember being 13 seeing this for the first time. I enjoyed its plot, though I couldn't understand any of the dialogue or any of the subtle symbols or literary devices. Ironically now, the one I saw it with didn't get the message, and now, years later, he's ""trainspotting"". Trainspotting is an amazing film that holds you dear. 9.4/10"

","In Britain, during the 90s clubbing was at a high, literally and drug abuse was a regular problem concerning the government. Pop culture was pushing the limits and changing the way many people on the drug scene were used too. The problems were being told through the news, the radio and the newspapers frequently. Then in 1996 an independent British film hit cinema, causing uproar, controversy, worldwide success, critical acclaim and even government mention, this film was called Trainspotting.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is based on a novel by Irvine Welsh which charts the life of a bunch of non- existent losers who're living their lives to their ""supposed"" full on the Edinburgh drug scene. The film charts the issues of poverty, crime and anti-social behavior that are still alive in Britain today and shows the horrifying problems of drug abuse that the public-eye attempts to be unaware of. The film exposes the bunch of nasty, yet somewhat hilarious group of stoner's lives and how Renton (Ewan McGregor) attempts to find a true meaning to his chaotic and miserable life.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is not a film that will appeal to everyone; it's graphic, nasty and harrowing. Yet, it retains from wanting the viewer to stop watching and manages to hold you throughout the entire running time. A film's content can, in some cases occupy the film's story and make you lose any pity, affection or remorse for the characters. Trainspotting manages to disgust, while still informing the viewers of the problems from drugs.<br/><br/>For a film that is so startlingly daring and distressing at times you'd be surprised that it manages to make its point so clear and authoritative. A factor that caused controversy on release was that the film is not afraid to say ""drugs are good at first"", but then the film goes on to saying ""but it's not worth it because the side effects will screw you up forever"". It's an excellent message and one that alerts any viewer not to ever go near drugs, yet people have ignored the true meaning of the film which is held within some of the horrific imagery and experiences. If there is one that film that will make you never want to take drugs its Trainspotting. It really will make you think twice and also help you understand why people do such repulsive and then why drug abuse is wrong. Trainspotting is not a film that is preachy, it says you have one life which you should use with care and how you should realize the consequences of your actions. So at heart Trainspotting is an unforgettable and mesmerizing study of wasted life. It succeeds in making its viewers come out learning and understanding one of the world's many unpleasant problems.<br/><br/>If you didn't see these characters going through such disturbing events the film would not have such a poignant message and one that shows so many devastating outcomes of the drug abuse. Trainspotting has many iconic and memorable characters that're acted out with the utmost sincerity, yet some remain oddly charming. The characters are hysterical at times and for a film full such shameful people you still manage to hold pity for their decaying lives as they spiral into a living hell. The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.<br/><br/>A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialog is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.<br/><br/>It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why."

","This is my first review, before it I used IMDb only for voting (not that anyone would care, votes were for me to plainly compare movies) and movie list.<br/><br/>Now Trainspotting here deserves some words. I wouldn't say I enjoyed the movie from begging to the end, maybe not my type of movie, I don't know. But there's something strange about the name this movie has. I didn't read the novel, but I do know in which context trainspotting was mentioned, and words at he end of movie gives a big allusion to main idea (yeah, I like to act like captain obvious): regular life, having TV, family is just like trainspotting - nothing fancy, but OK if you actually do enjoy it. And the life these guys live is nothing like spotting, it's more like riding train at full speed. Not that it's a better way to get to the destination(if such exist), but it's different, it's hardcore, and this ride most likely end with a fast death. If it's your choice, then go, ride it, but don't kill and upset innocent passengers.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I wouldn't call movie a masterpiece, and it's not your regular drama/action movie, but very well watchable and recommendable"

","'Trainspotting' is about a young group of people who are drug addicts. It is a very powerful and enjoyable, sometimes comical film. I would call this one of my favourite films of all times, it is a great Drama and you can be emotional sometimes. It is also a kind of horror with some parts of the film yet very disturbing, especially when the baby is found dead. It does make you feel sad for the people who are taking the drugs but some of the stuff they do is largely hilarious. The main aspect of this film is for the viewers to understand what it is like if taking drugs, I would recommend this film to anyone who is into discovering more about drugs and life's of drug addicts."

","This movie is the funniest, most entertaining and informative efforts to give insight on and discourage drug use. Although most of the movie shows the main characters in the depravity of drug use, the message and plot development don't glorify it but present the consequences. The dialogue of this movie makes almost all scenes hilarious. The sporadic nature of the speech, as well as the different pronunciations of words, prove to make the conversations interesting.<br/><br/>There isn't much that I don't like about this movie. I can honestly say that I wasn't thrilled at the two dick shots in the movie and a few scenes were pretty disgusting, but I think they were presented for the purpose of showing how disgusting and desperate the main characters lifestyle was.<br/><br/>In comparison to other movies about drugs, I believe that Trainspotting has a much better message or at least presents the story in way that shows the consequences of drug use. For instance, I believe the overall message of Pineapple Express is that one should always befriend their drug dealer, especially if they're James Franco. Don't get me wrong, I thought the movie was hilarious and I also realize that marijuana is not a hard drug like heroin, but I think I make my point. Trainspotting is a hilarious movie, and also the most disgusting, messed up, and honest version of an anti-drug message that there is."

"metalrules31","10","2","3","21 October 2008"," Choose Life, Choose Trainspotting
","Whenever we meet someone new, or want to have a conversation with someone we don't know that much, we constantly rely on hobbies. People ask questions like ""What do you do on your free time?"" or ""What is your favorite song?"". But the toughest question to ask somebody is what their favorite movie is. A non-regular movie-goer might not have a bad time answering. A girl might go for The Notebook or Titanic, while a male might chose Lord of the Rings, Star Wars or any action flick. I personally have trouble deciding among Clockwork Orange or Pulp Fiction, but my favorite movie of all time must be Trainspotting. Trainspotting is a Scottish movie, based on a book by the same name and starting Ewan McGregor as Renton. Although he is the movie's main focus, we meet other characters who enrich the cinematic experience. Sickboy, Spud, Swanney, Tommy, Diane, and Begby. Most of these guys with a little problem, they're heroin addicts. Some try to quit and others join in the process. The movie clearly portrays all the risks and disadvantages of being involved in this world and the negative things it eventually leads to, but, at the same time, the characters never deny the satisfaction that this vice gives to them. ""Take the best orgasm you've ever had... multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it"", Renton narrates at some point in the movie. The real reason why this is my favorite movie is simply because your average friend can watch it and know for certain that he has seen an excellent movie. He will not be confused by Pulp Fiction, or distressed by A Clockwork Orange. Certainly it is a movie you should see if you still haven't. It gets you glued to your sit until the fabulous ending. The soundtrack is also a highlight, featuring songs from artists such as Blur, Brian Eno, Pulp, Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and of course Underworld, with its memorable song, Born Slippy, all placed in perfect timing with the movie's screening. So next time you go to your video rental, ""Choose Life"", choose Trainspotting."

You can't prove anything by frightening. This movie on the other hand shows good and bad side of drugs and it is also very optimistic because it shows that even if you are addicted, this isn't the end of the world, you still can come back to a normal life if you really try. According to requiem for a dream, once you are addicted you are damned. When i was a kid they invariably were showing these kind of movies in school, but they didn't influenced me. Now this movie is something you'l remember. The characters were portrayed so well that they remind me some people i've met in real life, it seems that all this happened for real.

","Trainspotting was very well received in Australia. And with good reason.<br/><br/>The film was very original and insightful, with good comical overtones and magnificent performances. But what won me over in this film more than any other was the fact that it was made by europeans.<br/><br/>European film-makers generally make slow paced films that work on the characters - their eccentricities, their behaviour, their emotional contrasts and develop their ""being"". The insightful and often candid portrayal of the characters allows the story to delve into the deepest pockets of human emotion, making it moving and intriguing, irrespective of whether you identify with the characters.<br/><br/>I always can pick a grand film such as this by the fact that the plot can be explained in one line, but the film is what it is because of the work put into developing and opening up the characters to the camera.<br/><br/>For instance, Trainspotting is basically about a long term battling heroin addict who finally breaks free of his addiction and friends and starts over. Similarly, another European film like Paris, Texas is simply about a guy who wonders out of the desert one day and reconciles with the life he left behind.<br/><br/>The plot and story isn't the focus of these sorts of films. The characters are and it provides a richness and intrigue that is often lacking in over-acted and overdone films such as American Beauty (which had a convoluted and absurd story line). <br/><br/>Anyway - back to trainspotting. This film is really a metaphor for moving on with life and abandoning a lifestyle and relationships/friendships that seem to hold us back or otherwise keep us moving in a circle. In many respects, heroin plays a less important role than most people think. It's simply a representation of a vice (or vices) that young generations now have to overcome before moving onto the next stage of their life. However, it could be substituted for just about any hurdle we eventually have to face (usually in our 20s). <br/><br/>The title of the film, Trainspotting, is an activity that some old lonely men engage in. They go to train stations and simply note down which trains are arriving/departing and at what times. This is a repetitve and ultimately pointless exercise that keeps them occupied as time passes on. Very fitting title, wouldn't you agree?"

"Flagrant-Baronessa","8","2","3","8 October 2006"," Locks you into its world  a staggering achievement
","For Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his mates in Edinburgh's working class there are only two ways to get through life  to be high or to try to get high. But what happens when one junkie in the gang decides to quit?<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's raw, energetic, sprawling surge into the drug-world zooms in on a running triumvirate of heroin-junkies escaping from the cops in the first scene of the film, Iggy Pop's ""Lust For Life"" playing vibrantly in the background. Cut to Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) and his mates shooting up on the carpet of their seedy flat, discussing the merits of James Bond like it is the most natural thing in the world. ""Trainspotting"" revolves almost circularly (it lacks a bit of focus, it needs to be said) around this group of Scottish junkies. They are living from hit to hit, robbing tourists, shooting up, beating, trashing  and although they are our heroes, we feel so, so sorry for them and their nightmarish existence.<br/><br/>Pity is exactly the reason why this is an anti-drug film. It was mistakenly condemned by conservative viewers for promoting drug use but here it is clear that it does everything but. If anyone has the slightest desire to use any kind of drug afterward they should see a shrink. The film is incredibly brutal and brave in its exploration of the darker sides of drug addiction; it takes an unflinching look at the after-effects on addicts, the loss of the 'drug camaraderie' and the desperate circumstances that surround a junkie like Renton. In doing this, the film clearly transcends the viewer's comfort zone. There are disturbing images of a baby crawling in the seedy junkie flat among needles and f uck-ups, shots of McGregor literally swimming in a vast murky pool of faeces, McGregor getting high and having sex with a 14-year-old girl and gritty shots of violence. It is not for the faint of heart.<br/><br/>But its greatest accomplishment is not its graphic portrayal  although this part is certainly captivating  but the raw adrenaline-pumping energy that Boyle applies to several scenes in the film. Even when Renton is strapped down on the bed to quit heroin, descending further into nightmarish illusion and becoming increasingly apathetic about his condition, the film never tips over into despair; it never loses itself in darkness. The twinge of energy and the dark humour are always there; Trainspotting keeps the sparkle in the eye.<br/><br/>8 out of 10"

","i cannot say enough about the importance of this film. it has everything one could ask for in a good British druggie film. its got dark humor, and actually gives a surprising twist to the argument of using heroin. unlike films like requiem for a dream, a film that has you scared senseless into never so much as looking at a syringe, trainspotting shows some of the decent pros of being a junkie. now this is not to say it promotes it, because we do see on several occasions of heroin wrecks lives in various horrifying ways. what trainspotting does is go deeper into why a person does it, having valid reasons, and seeing what is intriguing about heroin. on another note, the actors could not have been been more better suited for the roles they played. renton (ewan mcgregor) is the wonderfully likable and respectable main character, who we see going through an emotional roller-coaster throughout the film. the supporting cast is excellent as well. there's a variety of junkies, from those trying to clean up, to those who actually seem to want to continue to live this lifestyle, to my personal favorite, sickboy, the sean connery enthusiast. brilliant! i couldn't have asked for more from a film! ten out of ten!"

","Trainspotting is one of the few movies that dares to be graphically real and not afraid of controversy to the point that they not only show the process of injecting heroin, but the state that an addict goes through when they withdrawal from heroin.<br/><br/>Not only does Trainspotting have a penchant for controversy and brazenness, it also has a cast of characters that, despite your best intentions, do grow on you. Such is the case with the violent psychopath Begbie (played with ferocious conviction by Robert Carlyle). Leading this talented cast of characters is Renton (played convincingly by Ewan McGregor). Renton is a heroin addict who shows just how desperate an addict is to get high in any way, even if that means diving through what could be classified as ""The Worst Toilet in Scotland"" to receive, um... ""misplaced"" drugs.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is definitely not for all tastes.

","Irvine Welsh's cult novel 'Trainspotting' is the grim, irreverent and defiant story of Edinburgh's drug-addled counter-culture, told in a fierce Edinburgh patois.  The achievement of Danny Boyle's film is its reinterpretation of what is a decidedly literary accomplishment in a cinematic form while nonetheless staying true to the spirit of the book. Ewan McGregor is excellent is a lead role that grants no glamour to its star, while Robert Carlyle is hilarious as his psychopathic 'friend'. Indeed, the easy way in which the film combines humour and the lowest depths of the junkie life is very impressive, although (perhaps inevitably) the overall tone is slightly less grim (and somewhat more crowd-pleasing) than that of the original.  Incidentally, while the true nature of its enigmatic title, 'Trainspotting', lurks in an excised chapter of the novel, those of a mountain-spotting persuasion will recognise an appearance by Leum Uillam in a minor role."
"Peaches311","Null","2","3","2 January 2003"," Disturbing Yet Worth Watching
","***Spoiler Alert in this Review***<br/><br/>
Trainspotting is one of the most disturbing films I have ever seen, probably because it is one of the most realistic.  This film hit me on a personal level because a good friend of mine is a recovering heroin addict and in a lot of ways the movie mirrored things that she told me about her experience.<br/><br/>
To me, the hardest scene to watch in this movie is the one where they find the baby dead in her crib.  Being a mother myself, this horrified me. It's hard to believe that someone could be so high that they will neglect a baby for days and days until the baby dies.  But these things do happen, which makes the scene even harder to watch.<br/><br/>I think that this is a brilliant movie, though, and I think that it is one that young people should see.  Yes, it is very gritty and there is a lot of bad language and things along those lines.  But I think that this movie will definitely dissuade young people from trying drugs.  Anyone who sees Trainspotting and then decides to try heroin is a complete idiot, in my humble opinion.<br/><br/>The accents are a little hard to take at first, but once you get involved in the story, they get easier to understand.  The version I saw on HBO had subtitles in one scene, I don't know if it's always like that, but they definitely did help.<br/><br/>All in all, I think this movie is worth watching, hard as some of the scenes are to take.  It gives the viewer a glimpse into a very horrifying world that is, unfortunately, very real."

With a strong cast to back up the tongue in cheek dialogue, this film takes on another view of friendship unlike his previous work, Shallow Grave. Ewan McGregor was excellent as the troubled and weak Renton, giving us both a tragic hero, yet one with vices that tend to control him. Overall, I felt the story was very strong, and the other actors (Ewan Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd and Kelly MacDonald) brought in a rather quirky and dysfunctional backdrop to Renton's troubles. One of the best anti-drug movies of all time, hopefully this is one which will be remembered for years to come."

","I know what you're thinking  disgusting, heroin chic movie; I also know you're wrong. Trainspotting can be disgusting (dead zombie babies, the worst toilet in Scotland, Begbie going psycho on some innocents, but that's it)) but if you're sensitive why are you watching a film about a bunch of junkies?  If you're American the shots that show the needle being inserted are cut out (or so IMDB claims)!!! Heroin chic? Now that is wrong! Everything that these bunch of junkie loser scum touch turns to dust. There is almost nothing cool about Renton, Spud or Sick Boy. Some of the characters dialogue (Take your best orgasm multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near [the highs of heroin]' for example) could be construed as to be glorifying heroin but they aren't; they're explaining why they take heroin. Anyway just watching them or seeing what heroin turns previously nice-guy Tommy into is enough to turn you off heroin. Forever. For a film to be able to do that it has to be powerful and that is exactly what Trainspotting is. The acting is of such a high calibre that someone deserved an Oscar. No, Trainspotting deserves ALL the Oscars, the soundtrack, the screenplay, the supporting actors, the supporting actresses, everything is perfect. What deserves especial praise is the fact that it is funny. Black humour is rampant throughout the film; the philosophical dog/park/airgun scene is typically Trainspotting  disgusting and hilarious. Trainspotting will never get mentioned in the same breath as Casablanca, Citizen Kane and Sound Of Music, even though it should, because of its subject matter and that makes me sad. So what are you waiting for? Go and watch it!!! Oh you don't like needles do you? Never mind then"
"CinemaCocoa","9","1","1","13 April 2017"," One of the most influential films for the British film industry.
","One of the most influential films in recent memory for the British film industry, skyrocketing the careers of Ewan McGregor and Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>Set in contemporary 1996 Scotland, Trainspotting follows a small group of youths trapped in the grip of heroin abuse. One of them, Mark Renton, looks to better himself but finds the task monumentally difficult, not only because of the addiction but also because of the losers he decided to call friends.<br/><br/>Trainspotting made colossal waves in the mid-1990s. Director Danny Boyle (now famous for Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours) would become a household name in the United Kingdom as one of the great contemporary British directors with this stylish, low-budget black comedy based off of Irvine Welsh's novel of the same name. Watching it now, over twenty years later, not only do I feel old but Trainspotting is a time capsule; a resoundingly 90s movie! This is mostly due to Danny Boyle's music choices, which would become a trademark of his movies (with exceptions like sci-fi flick Sunshine) and here is a tremendous example of his skill at picking and choosing his soundtrack. Perhaps the other nostalgic element, and most famous, is Ewan McGregor's voice-over ""Chose Life""; single- handedly challenging society while also making great observational comedy. Of course, Trainspotting is also a deeply uncomfortable experience. Much of its fame is controversy; the shiny, bright and well off society of 1990s Britain being shown with drug-addled youths, lost generations and death. All from the perspective of these unhinged people ""living life"", a cold contradiction that they and those around them suffer yet they seem casually unfazed by it all. Jovial even! Indeed, the film goes to some dark places, and all within the first half! Within twenty minutes we have Ewan McGregor on a drug-fueled diarrhea trip, impossibly climbing into a toilet head first to reclaim lost suppositories. What!?!<br/><br/>It feels at times like a British answer to Quentin Tarantino. Irvine Welsh's writing coming through the screenplay with wit and banter, at times long ranting monologues (one of my favourites coming from Renton while in the middle of a Scottish moor) the film is as quotable and memorable as it is brutal and nihilistic. Then there is Robert Carlyle as Begbie, the only one who isn't a drug addict and he is more terrifying than any of them!<br/><br/>Trainspotting is a hard film to like, but an easy film to respect. An absolute must for anyone studying film (its screenplay was nominated for an Academy Award) and film history; it inspired many budding British filmmakers. Personally I can see the demented love, fun and confidence that the cast and crew poured into the film, and while I cannot relate at all, its rebellious and almost perceptive nature makes it rewarding regardless of the dark pit that it resides."

","Movies about drugs are always interesting to me. Being a pretty straight up person I've had little dealings with them in my life, and so find the subject matter quite fascinating. My favourite film to this day is 'Requiem for a Dream'. 'Trainspotting' is quite different to that film in a lot of ways, it's a comedy for one, but it also bears a lot of similarities. In fact almost every drug-based film seems to carry the same message (at least to me) and that is stay the hell away from them.<br/><br/>The film works on two levels. Firstly, as a comedy. It is genuinely funny and had me in hysterics in two particular scenes. It is rare for a film to do this to me once, let alone twice. Also it works as a drama. The subject matter is heavy (at times very much so) and a brilliant acting display from the entire cast makes it work perfectly. As someone pointed out, and I tend to agree with, it never really feels like a movie. It feels like you are just a fly on the wall watching some very messed up people go about their lives.<br/><br/>A sequel to this film has just come out and I will be very interested to see it. The film has a very open ending, that you would almost never see in cinema anymore, which will make it very interesting to see where things go to in the sequel. 'Trainspotting' is a very good film that hasn't aged badly at all, and in fact would put most modern films to shame with the class it is made with."

All are horrified, especially Sick Boy, who is implied to have secretly been Dawn's father."

","So, I see the T2 trailer and first prayed to the holy film god of Hitchcock that it wasn't a remake of Terminator 2 with Woody Allen as the T-1000, Then after realising it was indeed a sequel to the excellent Trainspotting, I thought: Well, lets re watch Trainspotting (To be known as TS from now on) again to get me in the mood. <br/><br/>It is one of the defining films of the 90's and the message within resonates today. I think the film is good how it allows the viewer to make up their own minds on drug, rather than pushing an anti drug/pro drug agenda. There are some sad parts to the film, but in general the message I got was 'do what thy wilt- but choose life if possible'. <br/><br/>A kind of Crowley-Esq modern take if you will. <br/><br/>TS has so much going for it still, wonderfully shot and written - with superb acting from all of the cast. I don't need to go on about how good it is anyway as it's reputation precedes it. What I would like to add though is that in regards to T2- I REALLY REALLY REALLY hope that Danny Boyle doesn't do a JJ Abrams on it and basically re does the first film (A new Hope) and sell it as something original (The Farce awakens), because judging by the trailer - he might unfortunately do just that."

","Since the trailer for Trainspotting 2 was released last week, I thought it could be a good idea to watch the first film again, and write my own review on it.<br/><br/>At this point, Trainspotting has become a indisputable cult film, full of sketchy, shambolic characters, each one unique in his own way. The drastic representation of those people and of the dark world of drug consumption is worryingly realistic. This flick, directed by Academy Awards winner Danny Boyle, does not only show a one-way street in the drug consumption - as usual - but also the oncoming traffic once you're in. It goes purely into the addiction, then out of it, and then it comes back. When the director wants to show something, he does it by putting the perfect words into the actors mouths. The film strikes with original and memorable scenes which didn't take a lot of space in the original novel by Irvine Welsh. You'll probably never forget the scene with excrement flying around during breakfast, or the dive into Scotland's most insipid toilet (the water looks, however, strikingly clear). Every single actor sends out cool vibes, even in the least cool moments. The young Ewan McGregor impresses with his main role throughout the whole movie.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Trainspotting I didn't watch it in English though, and only after watching it again in the native tongue I saw how much of a difference the local patriotism and thick Scottish accent made, giving it another layer of cultural references. The main cast doesn't consist of five friends in a desperate situation, but rather five random guys who lost the lottery of life. They steal from each other, lie to each other and always pull themselves into the swamp that is drug addiction. The only thing that keeps them together is their desire for money. 9/10"

","The U.K. smash hit ""Trainspotting"" was potent and lively entertainment for this viewer, a stylish look at the underground drug scene in Edinburgh, Scotland. It shows both the horror and the humor of this day to day reality for these unfortunate souls. Screenwriter John Hodge (adapting the novel by Irvine Welsh) and director Danny Boyle give us a rich variety of moments throughout: some comical, some serious, some downright uncomfortable, and even some that are wonderfully surreal. The acting is solid all the way down the line, the soundtrack is impeccable (with Iggy Pops' ""Lust for Life"" getting us off to a good start), and the pacing always efficient.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor plays Mark Renton, one of a group of junkies who's deeply immersed in this world, but still has the ability to be perceptive, and ponder their sorry condition. He would like to leave the life behind, but the allure of drugs and loyalty to his mates is usually too strong. His best attempts to go straight are most often thwarted in one way or another.<br/><br/>Sometimes ""Trainspotting"" is a little violent, even hilariously disgusting in one key comic sequence, but it successfully walks a line between its various tones. Boyle draws you in right from the start, giving you a real eyeful of characters and their environs. At no point are the filmmakers ever condoning drugs (which was the mistaken assumption in the North American market), and they never glamorize or overly sentimentalize anything that's going on.<br/><br/>McGregor is rock solid in the lead. You like Renton and root for him, and the witty, funny dialogue flows from the lips of him and his castmates with ease. Jonny Lee Miller plays Sean Connery expert ""Sick Boy"", Ewen Bremner the affable ""Spud"", Kevin McKidd the earnest Tommy, Kelly Macdonald the underage girl Diane, and Peter Mullan the drug dealing Swanney. Robert Carlyle tends to steal the show whenever he's on screen, playing the hot tempered Begbie.<br/><br/>This is remarkable entertainment that may get fairly grim but never loses its sense of hope for our protagonist.<br/><br/>Eight out of 10."

","Comedic and stylish, Trainspotting manages to tell stories of heroin addicts in a highly energetic way. Trainspotting, directed by Danny Boyle, uses different cinematic techniques, music, and comedic timing every five minutes, if it were any other film the movie would have been completely incoherent, but the varying use of techniques does not hinder the movie's pacing but instead establishes the tone of the chaotic life of a heroin addict. <br/><br/>The comedic timing in this movie is on par with most, if not every joke seemed to hit it's mark, and sometimes the humour came from the most unexpected places. Every minute the movie could make you giggle at heroin addicts, AIDS, a dead baby and the absurdity of all. Moreover since they are using touchy subjects as a point of humour they could also make commentaries while giving the audience a honest laugh.<br/><br/>The performances were all top notch but the obvious standout was Robert Caryle who played the psychotic Bigsby. Everything from his posture to his varying emotions shows that he and his knife were a force to be reckoned with. Jonny Lee Miller playing Sick Boy, while not as grandiose, was on the same level as Caryle. Using his wit he effectively brought charisma to Sickboy. Because of these two actors, Ewan Macgregor's Renton seems to falter at times but because he played Renton in such a reserved way there was a greater juxtaposition with his highly volatile emotional self which made for a great comparison.<br/><br/>My only complaint about the movie were the thick Scottish accents which made it impossible for me to understand until I turned on the subtitles. However it is hard to call that a flaw as most of the actors even though they are not Scottish, managed to pull off the heavy handed dialect with a very authentic voice. So while my ears would have liked less accents I know that if the actors spoke with the audience's ears in mind they would have not been able to pull off a genuine performance such as this.<br/><br/>With that Trainspotting was a solid movie that's able to show the comedic part of being addicted and the tragedy of being sober."
"jackhardiman86","10","1","1","30 June 2016"," An All-Time Favourite
","I'll start off by saying that this is my favourite film of all time, so if you're looking for anything other than reasons to watch it, you should probably move on.<br/><br/>Though the subject matter of 'Trainspotting' is dark, gritty, and somewhat disgusting, the movie itself is uniquely charming. It's an objective view on drug addiction and the culture which surrounds it, and it still manages to be engaging, intriguing, and often hilarious. There seems to be a lot of criticism that this film simply glorifies the use of heroin, but that's definitely not the message here. The perspective of the viewer allows us to see the effects of the drug, without being ham-fisted in an attempt to dissuade from the use of it.<br/><br/>As a film, it's fantastic. Every shot is artful and beautifully arranged, even when the scene involves something like fishing through a public toilet for lost opium suppositories. The acting is also brilliant, with Ewan McGregor and (most notably) Robert Carlyle both giving the performances of their careers, and creating captivating characters in Rents and Begbie.<br/><br/>This is only scratching the surface of the successes of 'Trainspotting', though, as the soundtrack, pacing, dialogue, and lighting are all practically flawless. Everything in this film works well together to create a very grimy - yet beautiful - masterpiece."

","""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your future. But why would anyone want to do a thing like that?""<br/><br/>I have no idea what Trainspotting actually means, but this 1996 Danny Boyle film is truly an entertaining cinematic experience. It's about a group of friends in a small Scottish town who spend their lives getting stoned and having fun. The film isn't afraid to show how exciting their world is when getting high, but at the same time it shows the devastating effects that drugs have on them. It is this balance that Boyle manages to achieve, between the brutal portrayal of drug addiction and the fun and relaxed life these friends seem to be experiencing, what has made audiences worldwide enjoy this film for decades. The energetic 80's soundtrack, the great performances from McGregor, Miller, Carlyle, Bremner, and McKidd, the clever screenplay adaptation by John Hodge from Welsh's novel, and the visual style that Boyle uses is what have turned Trainspotting into such a classic and memorable film. There isn't much going on plot wise in the sense that the film focuses on these five friends who spend pretty much every day getting high and partying, but at the same time there are so many engaging and funny moments that allow for the viewer to relate to these characters. Some of the best moments are the simple ones where we see these characters interact with each other speaking about what toxoplasmosis is, how important it is for them to mess up their job interviews, what their favorite James Bond films are, and what the unifying theory of life actually means. There are so many entertaining moments in the simple dialogues that an actual plot isn't really needed.<br/><br/>The film takes place sometime during the late 80's in a small Scottish town named Edinburgh where five friends spend most of their time getting stoned and having no other cares in the world. Renton (Ewan McGregor) seems content with his life the way it's going despite his parents concern for him to get clean and give up his heroin habit. He realizes it's about time for him to try getting himself together and so he decides to quit his addiction. This decision won't have a lasting effect because he still surrounds himself with his friends: the naive and sincere Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) who's obsessed with James Bond, the jock Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Tommy and Begbie aren't junkies, but Renton's closest friends (Spud and Sick Boy) share his addiction. Despite wanting to clean up, Renton doesn't want to abandon his friends which ultimately lead him back to his addiction. Renton also happens to fall in love with a girl he meets at a club. After spending a night with Diane (Kelly Macdonald) he realizes the next morning she's only fourteen. Trainspotting is about the struggle Renton faces to quit his addiction while trying to maintain his relationship with his friends and not letting them affect him.<br/><br/>For some people Trainspotting has a little too much fun with drug addiction, but I would have to disagree. There are some very brutal and terrifying scenes about the effects of heroin and Boyle manages to balance both these elements. It may not be as dark as Requiem for a Dream, but it does feel more authentic and real in its treatment of drug abuse. It shows the pleasure that the drug gives at first, but the devastating consequences it has after the effect is over. These guys have to get involved in criminal activities in order to fund their addictions and neglect pretty much everyone around them. Their only ambition in life is to get stoned and they could care less about anything else. The film is also pretty sincere in its portrayal of how difficult it is to give up the habit. Through some stylized visuals and a great performance from McGregor we see how devastating and depressing it can be to get cleaned up. Ultimately drugs destroy their lives and the pleasure lasted for only a moment. Trainspotting is authentic and realistic in its portrayal while at the same time never ceasing to entertain the audience. A lot of credit has to be given to a relatively unknown then, Danny Boyle, and to the breakout performance from Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting boosted their careers and deservingly so."

","Danny Boyle's Trainspotting showed what a counter culture film set in the drug dens of Edingurgh could do. It's combination of humour, shock and tale of one man's struggle for a better life makes this film almost impossible to criticise (apart from the occasional glorification of drug use). This is the film that demonstrated how music and film should work together from the iconic opening chase scene to Renton's hallucinogenic efforts to quit.<br/><br/>Trainspotting jump started the careers of two now well known figures, the director Danny Boyle who has gone from drug dens to Olympic opening ceremonies and Ewan MacGregor who has since played the very opposite of Renton, Obi Wan Kenobi. All this has led to the film becoming among the best British films and certainly the best Scottish film"

","Where the glamorization of drugs comes in for some reviewers I just don't get. The early scene when Renton (Ewan McGregor) dives into the 'worst toilet in Scotland' makes drug users look like the vilest and lowest form of life on the planet, and his circle of friends a caricature of all the worst examples of humanity going. You look around and see the stark, disgusting flats they inhabit and there's no way anyone would want to emulate that kind of life. Unless you're a junkie I guess, and then it doesn't matter because the next hit is the only thing that does. I won't go to a lot of pains to review this film because for me it's a one off, something worth seeing as an insight into how low a person can get before figuring out that there's no solace in a needle, only a relentless slide to doom and destruction. Even Renton's ambiguous 'good deed' theft of the drug deal money at the finale left me convinced that in a sequel, he's going to be mainlining all over again."

","Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a film about the seeming everyday life of the average heroin addict in Edinburgh, Scotland. Based on the book of the same name, written by Irvine Welsh, Trainspotting focuses in on Mark Renton, a young man who cyclically drops his heroin habit, and jumps back on. His group of friends, ranging from fellow junkies Sick Boy and Spud to a psychopathic, adrenaline-addicted Begbie, keep him tied to his old habits, whether he wants to be or not.<br/><br/>The film is as dark as one would expect the life of a junkie to be. Boyle uses dim lighting in already murky and dirty sets to denote a sense of muck. The soundtrack can only be called relevant, grabbing music from the popular UK artists of the day. The music coordinates with the scenes well, whether it be a thumping house-beat in a nightclub, or an immersive, mid-hallucination psychedelic piece. The dirt and grime in the scenes is almost tangible. Boyle works his characters into a believable world of drug abuse, petty crime, and filth.<br/><br/>The film opens with Renton and his friends fleeing from what one can only assume are police officers. Mark Renton, played by Ewan McGregor, narrates over the scene, speaking about why he and his friends choose to commit themselves to drugs, to choose whatever it is they have chosen, over what Renton calls ""life,"" which includes things such as a family, career, and a big television. Renton struggles to answer the question as to ""why?"" throughout the movie, while also struggling with the ins and outs of a junkie's life. Behind the grit and explicit material, there is a brilliant story, waiting to be cracked open."

","This is Danny Boyle's second feature film and I must admit that by the time I'd seen this one I was convinced he was Scottish. Fortunately I know better now. This one's all about drug addiction and the consequences of it. Sounds a drag, but believe me, it's one of the most entertaining films you'll ever see! But more on my thoughts later, here's a very brief summary first (summary haters please go cold turkey in the back room while I write the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Set, for the main part, in Scotland, this film tells the story of Renton and his friends, Spud, Sick Boy, Tommy and Begbie. It tells of their flirtations with heroin and all that brings. How they rip each other off, ruin each other's relationships, get high, get low, get sick, get off the drug, get back on it againÂ… it's all here. Eventually Renton decides to get off it entirely and moves to London, but that is far from the end of it. I'm going to leave it deliberately brief and vague because this is a dish best served without too much prior knowledge my friend.<br/><br/>First of all, it's a great script by John Hodge based on the novel by Irvine Welsh; add to that the directorial skill of Danny Boyle and you have a bit of a masterpiece on your hands. There are times where things do get a bit surreal, but I think it all adds to the brilliant execution of this tale. Really great performances all round, particularly from; Ewan McGregor as Renton, Ewen Bremner as Spud, Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Kevin McKidd as Tommy and Robert Carlyle as the psycho, Begbie.<br/><br/>There are scenes in this film that are quite hard to watch but I believe it is all included to show just how real the effects of drug addiction are. There is also a lot of humour in this film which, kind of, plays against the grain in a couple of places, but it didn't detract from my enjoyment too much. Over all, with an iconic soundtrack, some great performances, a tremendous script and some brilliant filmmaking, this one is very, very highly recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 9.2/10"

","A wild, freeform, Rabelaisian trip through the darkest recesses of Edinburgh low-life, focusing on Mark Renton and his attempt to give up his heroin habit, and how the latter affects his relationship with family and friends: Sean Connery wannabe Sick Boy, dimbulb Spud, psycho Begbie, 14-year-old girlfriend Diane, and clean-cut athlete Tommy, who's never touched drugs but can't help being curious about them...I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It is a shocking look at the effects drugs can have on people and the same time it poses some interesting questions about the world we live in and the youth. It has a very original screenplay and one of the most stylish directions I have ever seen. It is a energetic, imaginative, and vibrant film and at the time it came out, it must have felt very unique. I really enjoyed it but had I seen this film in 1996 ( I was too young but I'm talking hypothetically ) this film would have made a much bigger impact in me (specially the visual aspect of it) and the reason why is because the director Danny Boyle, uses certain filming techniques, and certain effects that are truly mind-blowing and make for great scenes but, as of 2009, this techniques are now fairly common and have been used by several directors. And again, I think Trainspotting is great but had I not seen such films as Requiem For A Dream(2000) and Garden State(2004) just to name a few, I would definitely think more of this one. Anyway, the film balances extremely well, humorous moments with the more disturbing scenes, and always staying truth to itself. At times, the narrative isn't as focused as it should be but this is a minor flaw. Of all the actors two deserve being mentioned, first, Robert Carlyle who plays Begbie, one of the so called mates of Mark Renton, a very unlikable character but extremely well played by the actor, and second, Ewan Mcgregor who's terrific as the lead character, Renton, and delivers probably, the best performance of his career so far. The soundtrack is great as well and fits perfectly with the crazy and chaotic scenes of the film. Trainspotting is definitely a must-see for any movie-lover.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Trainspotting is about Mark Renton, proud heroin addict, and his friends. When they're not getting into trouble, they're shooting up or just talking. There's no real story; the movie is more of a look into the lives of these junkies than anything else.<br/><br/>One of the main strengths of Trainspotting is that it only shows. It doesn't judge these people or the drug, it simply shows their lives and is careful not to take a side. But it doesn't pull any punches, either, so quite a few people won't want to watch the graphic heroin injections. The movie also goes too far at several points, showing both Renton taking a dump and a dead baby, just to disgust and shock the audience, it seems.<br/><br/>It's not an easy movie to sit through because of its graphic nature, but it can be likable as well. Despite obvious reasons to dislike the character, Ewan McGregor's performance as Renton makes him at least a little appealing. His witty and clever narration is very enjoyable, and the best part of the movie. A few chuckles are hidden here and there, and director Danny Boyle makes Trainspotting visually striking, particularly with creative hallucinations and fantasies.<br/><br/>But it's also rushed. Renton and his friends are barely established before things go wrong and change, while the third act seems to belong in another movie. As a whole, though, it's a picture that has quite a few things to enjoy, but not everyone will be able to sit through because of its content."

Danny Boyle gives the film the same boundless energy the characters live with, and the actors give appropriately energetic performances. Ewan McGregor stands out especially, as he gives his character ore depth the any of the others. The film's style evokes Quentin Tarantino and Guy Ritchie, though Boyle is not as flashy as either of the aforementioned two, and this film puts more emphasis on the actual story than the style or dialogue. The depiction of drug use in the film is graphic, though it is not distracting or overly gratuitous.

","Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is a brave attempt on showing the destructive lifestyles that drug addicts lead and its disturbing consequences on both them and society. What makes this movie different is its fashionable way of unfolding itself which really deviates from conventional film-making. Instead of looking from a viewpoint of a non-addict, it taps into the head of a drug addict and shows the audience the bizarre world of such individual. The disturbing images blended with psychedelic music create such a world effortlessly. <br/><br/>The movie which is based upon a popular novel by Irvin Welsh is a about a group of drug addicts played energetically by a gifted cast. ""Renton"" played by Ewan McGregor can be identified as the protagonist, who narrates the story and someone who will have no problem in diving down a filthy toilet in order to recover lost drugs. His fellow drug addicts include ""Spud"" who is seeing as the ideal naive bloke who ""hurts nobody"" but screws everything up; ""Sick Boy"" who brags about theories and philosophies of life, but never follows them; ""Tommy"" who was a newbie for the whole drug routine finds himself taking drugs too many and finally ""Begbie"" who doesn't use drugs but is a screw up who bubbles with rage and cause havoc wherever he goes. They do drugs in an old warehouse, sleep wherever they can and then come up with ways to find money (preferably robbing, which is their only option) to score the next hit of drugs in order to cease the impending effects of heroine. Funnily enough, they even consider quitting and to find them doing even more drugs all over again. <br/><br/>This movie is well made with memorable scenes, but it is not without its flaws. It sometimes gets caught up in the situation of dragging itself too much without engaging in something new. However this is not to say that it is dull or dreary, far from it, it is filled with memorable dialogues and performances which makes this a refreshing mind bender to any movie goer."

The film develops it's characters extremely fast and with precision. We are drawn to them and feel an affinity with them for a variety of reasons, even though they are all in one way or another, degenerates. But we pull for them to beat their habits, to get out of their miserable conditions. But we never pity them, because despite their predicament, they manage to live it up and live life, and feel emotion and express their desires.

The film has heart and soul and set a new standard in it's way. It is such an original work of art, with many memorable scenes.

It remains hip and edgy to this day, and he manages to create visual representations of the characters inner experiences in ways that are completely original.<br/><br/>The acting is superb, with a cast that has not a single weak member.<br/><br/>The story is tight and compelling. It caries you away into a world that you have probably never seen.<br/><br/>Above all, this is a modern masterpiece because it is intelligent as well as entertaining. Far too films are even close to this good."

","This movie was about partying like there was no tomorrow. I didn't understand a word of it though. I loved the music and I'm 51 years old. Usually I don't like music that pumps out noise like that but for this film it was a piece of work. That boy Ranton sure got himself in a heap of trouble. I'll bet if they did a sequel to this film he would've been strung up by his jewels and beaten to a bloody pulp. And funny to. Damn I was laughing like crazy when he went swimming in that toilet. But that baby part was freaky. I really think the guy who wrote this movie had to have had some personal experience with the junk that they were doing. How else would he know what happens when people do the things they do. I went and bought this one after I saw it because I wanted to see how the guys that made the movie did what they did. I watch it about once a month. Can't get enough of it. Gave it a 9."

It was extremely creative and provided a great look at the life of a Scottish heroine addict Ewan McGregor played a stunning account of Renton, the main character.Well...I shouldn't say that he was the main character because every character played an extravagant roll in whatever place they were in. I especially loved the opening scene, the ""Worst Toilet in Scotland"" scene, the bar scene where no one goes home alone, and the scene in which Renton goes home to his parents. I could only find this video on the internet for sale but I loved it so much. I was eventually able to find it for sale at some small convenient store. they had it marked up to about 150% of what it should have been but I bought it any way. I probably watch it once a month.

The film is built up to explain the effects of the drug, people living in disgraceful flats, not caring about anything else but ""hero"".

","Superb... Ingenious... Hilarious... Three words I'd use to describe TRAINSPOTTING. It is a complete gem. However, if your an American this could be SO different. The humour and the rawness just wouldn't suit the majority of US people In My Opinion.<br/><br/>On the storyline, some people have said that it glamourises drug use but nothing could be further from the truth. It shows just how well, CRAP, their lifes actually are. There is nothing glamourous about their actions or how we see them.

","having never seen a film or anything in my own accent, it took me a while to get over the novelty of this and the fact that the dialogue sounds a bit laboured to me.  Getting over that, this is an excellent film, getting across no points other than the quality of danny boyle and 'dont touch smack'. The mixture of the hard reality of ""intravenous injecting of hard drugs"" and surreal alice in wonderland scenes such as renton climbing down a toilet. The scene where his mum and dad lock mark renton in his room is sheer genious.  Everybody's felt fevered like it, but to have it discribed so acurately is unnerving to say the least. A wee note on the side, you know the bit when renton is trying to get away from his parents and his friends to get another hit, and he jumps off the wall. The next shot is of him landing at mother superiour's place like a cat.  Beautiful"
"the amorphousmachine","10","1","1","18 July 2002"," One of my all-time favorites!
","I saw 'Trainspotting' when it was first released. The reason I saw it was because I was a huge fan of Danny Boyle's 'Shallow Grave' and boy was I in for a surprise. At the time, I had never read the book by Irvene Welsh so I didn't know what too expect. Nevertheless, I was blown away with end results!<br/><br/>What an amazing stylistic film with excellent performances and interesting if not unlikable characters! I liked Ewan McGregor in 'Shallow Grave', but he was outstanding as Renton- the drug-addled Scot who keeps trying to give up smack. The supporting performances were also great, 'Trainspotting' introduced me to Jonny Lee Miller as Sick Boy, Robert Carlyle as Begbie, Kelly McDonald as Renton's love interest in Diane and Ewan Bremmer as Spud. All are fairly well-known now, and all were great in 'Trainspotting' but Carlyle here shined as the angry and volatile Begbie!<br/><br/>I've watched 'Trainspotting' numerous times, and it's still funny, stylistic, cool, intriguing and sad, but most of all, it shows the depravity of hard-core drug addiction. It's is certainly anti-drug in my mind, as I walked away from the movie vowing to never touch smack! 'Trainspotting' is not everybody but it certainly doesn't glamourise drugs- so if you don't mind films with drugs, this one is worth a look. 'Trainspotting' is an amazing and memorable film where the Scottish dialect is simple to understand if you listen. Heck, most DVDS have a subtitle option anyway. Highly recommended to people who like unusual cinema/video and, in my opinion, it's one of the best films of the 1996 and one of my personal favorites! 'Trainspotting' gets full points!<br/><br/>***** out of *****!"

","I must admit I was skeptical about this movie but after hearing so many great things about it I had to see it.  I wasn't disappointed. Trainspotting is absolutely the best and now one of my favorite movies. Ewan McGregor is adorable as Renton.  The characters all seemed alive like people that you might meet in a club or a bar or out on the street.  I would recommend Trainspotting to anyone who needs a good laugh or a cry all at once."
"V Hanna","8","1","1","26 August 1999"," Ride unlike many others!!
","Trainspotting is truly a wild ride down a path that thankfully many of us don't see. We all know how the overuse and dependency of drugs can destroy a life, the gripping struggle many endure to pull themselves out of that toilet, and the ruin they can bring to others around them. But Trainspotting is a movie that shows more than just the dark travails of this ugly trip as the movie 'Basketball Diaries' does to excruciating detail. It reaffirms why life, as is wonderfully described in a Dylan like way by Ewan McGregor in the beginning of the movie, is worth living. What separates this movie and elevates it from other movies that cover this same tone and subject material is that the main character is not totally destroyed and left in a dark hopeless state at the end just to emphasize the why you shouldn't do drugs lesson. The movie ends with great hope and answers McGregor's own opening question of why choose life. And I will say emphatically again it is one hell of a ride. We follow McGregor and his excellently casted mates through all the stages of drug abuse and the Alice in Wonderland like adventures that follow it. Robert Carlye played the volatile Francis Begbie to an Oscar like perfection. His outburst struck me like a dark comedy where you almost hate to laugh but your true honesty leaves you no choice. Definitely one of the most memorable characters from a movie in the 90's.  From drug dens to night clubs the cast mixes so well. The humor bounces wildly off the wall like something you get out of a gum ball machine. You never know when it will jump out in front of you so be ready. Danny Boyle deserves a great nod and a raise of the glass for a directing job well done. He chooses shots from great angles and adds all kinds of perfectly captured perks as well. One of my favorite scenes is the shot from the floor as McGregor has just taken a large hit of heroin. He proceeds to sink into a large red rug right through the floor. Every proceeding shot is from this unusual point of view until he is brought out of his dazed state at a local hospital. For someone who has never done heroin (and doesn't particularly plan to) this is one of the feelings I can imagine the drug delivering me to as I watch McGregor dip into the floor. That folks is a sign of a good director. When you have a camera in your hands and you want to have the audience truly feel what something is like why just tell them? Too easy and makes for a dull movie. Which is an incurable disease eighty percent of filmmakers have today. Show them dammit!! Use your imagination and create uniqueness. Make your movie stand out. The soundtrack compliments Trainspotting to a tee and adds to the movie's slick electric settings and rich cinematography. The only slight problem with the movie is that at times some of the Scottish accents get as thick as something out of a broken espresso machine. You will find yourself trying to understand what the hell is being said but just pay attention to what is going on within the scene and you will make it through with flying colors. This movie was not what I expected. It thrilled me in many different ways and added new life to subject material that I am sure hasn't seen the last foot tracks come its way."
"merijalo","10","1","1","12 July 1999"," Long live Scottish humour
","The film that made me love Scotland! The language, the atmosphere, the humour - not the drugs. Touching, sometimes disgusting, very human. The Worst Toilet of Scotland -scene is surrealistic, almost beautiful - but - return to the real world. A good story and wonderful actors. My favourite character is Spud, but I still became an Ewan McGregor fan.<br/><br/>The book by Irvine Welsh is worth of reading, and I've seen Trainspotting on stage, too. Three marvellous, but totally different experiences!"
"BratBoy-2","Null","1","1","9 July 1999"," Movement is key
","I love Trainspotting because of the way it attacks your sense and plays with the conventions of moviemaking. This movie flows fast and furious from beginning to end with a killer soundtrack that perfectly compliments the movie. Though it's about drug addiction, I don't think Trainspotting glorifies the use of heroin at all. True, it may paint a more realistic picture, but it does show you the horrors of withdrawal. Trainspotting is so vibrant, so alive, that even when the Scottish accents are a bit hard to understand, you still get a sense of what's going on. The dialogue is hysterical at times and the way the Irvine Welsh's novel was adopted for the screen was well done, in my opinion. Trainspotting assaults you from beginning to end with non-stop images, intriguing characters, and some great lines."
"gazelle","9","1","1","30 May 1999"," Whoa!
","This movie deals with some of the most frightening and disgusting subjects imaginable; it has sex, rock, and especially drugs and yet is wonderful. While other films try desperately to interject youth and cutting-edge displays of bad taste, this movie is wonderfully alive even while its subjects are killing themselves.  ""Objectionable material,"" which I certainly was turned off by at first, turns out to be nothing more than an intimate and realistic portrayal of the sad and sometimes exciting lives of those Scottish youth. Thought-provoking in every way and extremely enjoyable in others, it brings us characters that we would rather not deal with and makes us feel for them in a way no other film can.  All the performances were wonderful, especially (as is often commented on, and rightly so) Mr. McGregor's fantastic work. It is only a testament to his prowess that I saw Trainspotting (and him) the very day before I went to see him as Obi-Wan Kenobi in The Phantom Menace and was not uniquely distracted."
"vinniex","10","1","1","6 May 1999"," Provocative, amusing, and profoundly disturbing
","This is a film that grabs you by the short hairs and makes you sit up and take notice.  No matter where you personally come down on the issue of drug abuse; it gives you plenty to ponder.  An interesting thing about this film to me is that you can enjoy from the standpoint of just watching it for fun, or you can watch it from the standpoint of someone watching it to grapple with philosophical issues.  True, the protagonists in this flick are a motley crew, but even in the depths of despair and degradation hope comes through.  Albeit often in morose ways.  Sick Boy's agony over the babies death for example shows even the most craven usurious junkie has a basic element of human decency.  The heroin scam, while an angst filled undertaking, is an act of hope on their part that can be likened to the hope of degenerate gamblers trying for that big win.  The musical score is a superb fit for the movie, too.  It is a drug movie and quite arguably the best one ever made at that."

The truly great dialogues, the never-ending black humor, the fine Scottish accent and some fantastic acting makes this movie stay with you for a long time.<br/><br/>To explain the title (as requested by snow-15): <br/><br/>1) Trainspotting is regarded to by junkies as searching for the best point of entry to insert a needle in ones train (arm).<br/><br/>2) Trainspotting (as in watching trains passing stations for a hobby) is as stupid and pointless as doing drugs."

","Trainspotting, a film that earned almost instantaneous cult masterpiece status, expertly depicts the multi-faceted heroin experience of author Irvine Welsh's excellent novel.  The Shallow Grave team of Andrew MacDonald, John Hodge, and Danny Boyle go for the throat, and deliver a deliriously cinematic jewel that is equal parts fantasy, comedy, and harrowing drama.<br/><br/>Superb use of music and eye-opening set pieces (like the ""filthiest toilet in Scotland"") never upstage the colorful characters -- people who behave despicably and deplorably, shamefully and amorally, and yet endear themselves to viewers who find their wicked wit and charming smiles irresistible.  Lothario Sick Boy, hapless Spud, psychotic Begbie, and wise-beyond-her-years schoolgirl Diane are unforgettable, but it is Ewan McGregor's exhilarating and incredible turn as Renton that commands the greatest attention and leaves audiences invigorated and begging for more."

It has everything I love in a film: a great, flawed protangonist who lacks obnoxious self-pity and who is so easy to like it's eerie; a crackling script that refuses to get weighed down as films such as ""Clockers"" do; and the movie has incredible guts (consider baby Dawn and such things like dirty sheets at breakfast--where have you ever seen anything like that?

One of the few movies i am ALWAYS pleased to see is on the tube!"
"DelightedSenses","Null","1","1","3 September 2001"," Still As Brill As The Day It Was First Released.....
","What can I say..? What a movie indeed. First off, I will mention the cast who are brilliant all through out the film. With out a doubt. Ewan McGregor, a great actor made his acting name in this movie, playing ""Mark Renton"", the heroin addicted no good. Ewan's performance is always strong and it never fails. Trainspotting made him a start. So if you are a fan of him, this is a must because quite simply he plays this character with his eyes closed, to perfection.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle even manages to let us see his wide range of acting skills by playing the extremely violent vicious character ""Begbie"". All though a small role for Carlyle a very rememorable one at that. A scary performance that will leave you thinking I can't believe he's just done that...<br/><br/>Others main people in the film are British actor Jonny Lee Miller as the heroin user turned pimp ""Sick Boy"" who likes to sell other people's passports to dodgy dealers and who knows a lot about Sean Connery. And the dumb, but stupidly nice ""Spud"", who can't help getting himself into all sorts of trouble here and there. Then there's ""Diane"", the girl who's got an old head on some young shoulders you might say.<br/><br/>Even when you've seen this movie over 10 times, you will then start to connect with them in someway or other. The characters are solid, and you never get tired of watching them on screen. One of the best scenes is right at the end, when Renton is walking over the bridge smiling. That just great, for some reason it's hard to put your finger on it. It just gives you a feeling of release now that Renton has become a good person again.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliant, probably the best British film of the last decade, for everything, script, scenes, filming, soundtrack (which including really great tunes from the likes of Underworld, Blur, Pulp, Leftfield, Lou Reed and not forgetting the infamous Iggy Pop) and the humour. Definitely one to watch, but not when you are sad. Watch it because you never forget it!"

Its stylistic exuberance,its visual inventiveness, its sheer energy is unbelievable.It mixed despondency with humour,bleakness with wit,bitter realism with surrealistic fantasy. Poignant,hilarious,harrowing,upbeat in turns,it did what no other drug movie has achieved:to present us with believable, rounded characters we can identify with, instead of the one sided caricatures other drug movies portray.These are people like us, they could be us;they laugh,they cry, they suffer,they try to make sense of their lives and the fucked-up world that surrounds them, they analyse their own cosmotheories, they get depressed, they grieve, they try to find a way out of the debris that surround them.OK, they are also addicted to smack, but isn't their addiction a reflection(on a bigger scale) of our own little ""domestic, socially acceptable"" addictions,be it nicotine,caffeine,reality shows,tv quizzes,mobile phones, designer clothes,carreerism...This film enraged many people,cause it refused to fall back on old clichees and easy answers,namely that ""we"" are respectable citizens and ""they"" are freaks and scum.

The only comment I have is that it is imperative everyone watches this film."
"Dodger-9","Null","1","1","8 January 2001"," Addictive stuff
","Hard to believe it's five years since Danny Boyle's classic film Trainspotting took the world by storm but while you ask yourself what has happened since it opened on March 8, 1996, just reflect on the movie's legacy for a minute.<br/><br/>Just about every firm in the UK borrowed its ad campaign; Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller and Kelly MacDonald became huge stars while Boyle himself went on to make the sublime A Life Less Ordinary and current video release, The Beach.<br/><br/>As for the soundtrack? Iggy Pop, Leftfield, Blur and Pulp helped turn it into one of the biggest sellers of the year.<br/><br/>In case you didn't know it, the movie was based on a cult novel by Irvine Welsh who writes largely in broad Scots and makes an appearance as drug dealer, Mother Superior. <br/><br/>`He's called that on account of the length of his habit,' remarks Renton (McGregor). While the movie was seen by many sniping critics to be glorifying drug culture, what it actually did was far more clever than any `Just Say No' ad campaign by the cast of Grange Hill. <br/><br/>By taking the (at the time) radical viewpoint that the drug culture exists, the film-makers didn't judge. Instead, Trainspotting depicted the squalid lives of its inhabitants and the ultimately fatal consequences of being a heroin addict.<br/><br/>Boyle, producer Andrew MacDonald and writer John Hodge amazed the British film-making community when they made such a hit movie on home turf.<br/><br/>Even before their outstanding debut, Shallow Grave, was released, producer Scott (The Firm) Rudin was offering them $250,000 to make any big screen project they wanted.<br/><br/>Most people expected them to upstumps and set up camp in America, like so many film-types lured to the States by the big bucks.<br/><br/>The cash may be great in la la land but creative freedom? Not a chance. Had Trainspotting been shot across the pond, there's a good chance it would have been made as a comedy vehicle for Jim Carrey - or whoever else was big at the time. The drug element would have been removed completely and the addiction would have probably been something safe like chocolate or coffee.<br/><br/>As for the ambiguous title? Forget that.<br/><br/>Thankfully, Danny and company stayed put and delivered one of the best British films of the last decade. A biting, shocking satire which goes for the jugular and stays in the mind no matter how much you'd like to forget it.<br/><br/>The sight of a baby crawling along the ceiling of Renton's bedroom remains one of the most shocking dream sequences I've ever seen. Three days later it kept returning like an unwanted guest that just won't leave.<br/><br/>No movie is created in a vacuum and the Trainspotting crew borrowed heavily from another cult flick for their inspiration: A Clockwork Orange.<br/><br/>The near inaudible scene in the Volcano nightclub is almost a carbon copy of the Velocet Milk Bar from that Stanley Kubrick classic and in a fine in-joke, even features a track by Heaven 17 (who took their moniker from the same controversial movie.)<br/><br/>If you only see five minutes, don't miss Renton attempting to seduce Diane as his libido returns with a vengeance. Aside from boasting one of the best shots in the movie as they leave the club, it also features Kelly MacDonald delivering some delicious dialogue."

There really is no story per se and I don't think that this movie could ever match up to the likes of Snatch and Requiem for a dream. Quite simply its a movie about a bunch of people who do drugs and then hallucinate through half the movie. The rest of the movie is about the main protagonist (Renton) if you could call him that going from one hallucination to another until his parents shut him up in a room to help him get over the habit. Thereafter he steals from his 'friends' and elopes with a lot of money. Between that and the beginning nothing much happens. There are a bunch of other characters I did not feel much for.. Of note is Robert Carlyle's portrayal of Begbie. In the scenes that he appears he steals the limelight and those are about the only scenes that to me were tolerable. So there's not much of a story, a sh!tload of 'bollocks' and somehow this movie is in the IMDb top 250. I suppose you will tell me that it has a cult following.. who are these 'cults', tell them to stay away from sites like IMDb. No sir, trainspotting does not deserve 8.2 stars, money wasted, time wasted.

"kergillian","8","4","9","4 June 2001"," Well done, but short of its potential...
","An excellent creative team, fabulous cast, great story...so what went wrong? A bit of a loaded question, because the film was still fantastic, even though it missed its mark. What went wrong is that the film could never compare to the book...and although I'm probably a bit biased due to an adoration of Irvine Welsh's writing (well...most of it;), the film really screwed a bit up too much to be forgiven. Having the original screenplay, I admit that it was partially due to time constraints...they cut a lot of scenes out that would have improved the film. But there was a lot that just shouldn't have been done.<br/><br/>Let's start with Diane. Diane is unforgivable, as she's actually two characters combined into one. In the book Dianne was the high school girl Rents ended up sleeping with, but the girl he ended up with, who wrote to him in London, was another girl completely (Kelly?) And the way he ended up with Dianne was different, she was much less sharp tongued and much more naive, and the whole breakfast and post-breakfast scene was completely different.<br/><br/>The second major beef I had was with the ending. In the book Rents stole the money with no qualms and no regrets. He didn't leave a cent for Spud and he didn't plan on giving up the skag and turning clean. He was going to heave off to France and live in a heroin paradise; not working and reverting to drugs.<br/><br/>Thirdly, Tommy was much more bitter and dejected; he blamed Renton for his AIDS and was never able to deal with it properly.<br/><br/>Finally, the entire reason for the title was dropped. The whole 'Trainspotting' scene has not even a mention in the film, not even a mention of Begbie's father...<br/><br/>And then there's Rents' brother, who barely rates a glance in the film...<br/><br/>A gripe I have about the film itself, is that some scenes are overdone, even useless. The scene where Renton kicks is horrid; the whole baby crawling across the ceiling/Spud in chains/Tommy as a haggard AIDS victim (though we don't even know he has it at that point) is just too much. And a waste of time. Definitely one scene that could have been sacrifice; or at least they could have found a better way to do it.<br/><br/>And a lot of scenes were sloppy...much of the information that is essential to the story is given in passing, or we find out facts after they've been displayed. I think this is because of the shape the original script took, and the cuts seem to have harmed the story in a way that should have been repaired.<br/><br/>But all that aside, the film was cast perfectly (Dianne aside, who shouldn't have really been as important to the film as she was, even). Jonny Lee Miller is the absolute perfect Sick Boy, and MacGregor is brilliant as Rents. Ewen Bremner is hilarious as Spud, especially in the job scene (the Renton half of that scene, which is missing from the film, is even more amusing;) and he also makes an appearance in the other Irvine Welsh film, The Acid House, which anyone who liked this film should go out and watch... Top off that cast with Robert Carlyle as an amazing Begbie, and Irvine Welsh himself popping in as Mikey, and we're all set.<br/><br/>Overall: The errors and changes in the film don't really ruin it, but fans of the book may be disappointed somewhat. This film doesn't come close to Danny Boyle and John Hodge's previous effort, Shallow Grave, but it's still a fabulous film. Anyone who hasn't read the book will appreciate the film even more, and who could ask for a better cast?? All gripes aside, I still rate this an easy 8/10."

","It's a slightly sardonic slice-of-life story sent as a super-speedy shot-to-the-veins, a hyperactively eclectic look at four vigorously degenerate, disenchanted and desperately destitute individuals who each navigate through what they've come to call their lives and somehow like it, only occasionally glimpsing it through a lens that allows them to see the filth in which they lay and the perceived perfection of the greener grass on which most others make their beds, but though the simple thing would be for the flick to focus upon the negativities of the protagonists' chosen lifestyle and to portray the quote unquote 'outside world' as the drug-free and consequently utopian society so many pictures of the kind seem to do so, it instead chooses to place the audience within the headspace of its characters no matter how misguided it may be and allow them to decide whether they agree with the actions taken as opposed to spoon feeding them the easy answers so many may crave; it's in this ambiguity that the film finds both its nuances and its entertainment factor for though it is at times an affectingly tough and even teeth-clenching experience, one which never shies away from true darkness and even some disturbingly surrealist horror, it is also an enjoyable and funny flick which finds humour even in the 'blackest' of situations, but this may also contribute to its general sense of aimlessness which does sour the piece ever so slightly. 7/10"

"dfa120374","9","2","4","24 September 2014"," Hard-Hitting & Disgustingly Funny
","Disgusting. Disturbing. Funny. Emotional. Riveting. Breathtaking. Just a few words I'd use to describe Trainspotting.<br/><br/>I first saw this movie when it was released way back in 1995, and I honestly didn't know what to make of it. After watching it again, almost 20 years later, I've come to the conclusion that it is indeed a true classic.<br/><br/>Now, a good few people will think (and will try and tell you) that this movie glamourises drugs & crime. In brutal honesty, though, those people don't know what they are talking about because this movie does anything BUT glamourise that lifestyle. The only thing it ""glamourises"" is the actual supposed high you get from taking these drugs, but that is fleeting because it quickly brings you down to earth with a massive bang. From showing you the squalor that these people live in for the majority of the time, the mishaps that they get into, and what happens to some of them, if this is ""glamourising"" then I'd hate to see what a movie that is against drugs & crime is like.<br/><br/>For me this movie tells you one basic message - if you take drugs and live a life of crime then this is what your life will end up being like. The acting and performances are nothing short of fantastic and the actors will make you feel less & less sympathetic (if you have any in the first place) towards any of their characters. Renton - very likable & you always hope that he beats his habit; Spud - again, is likable and you end up feeling sorry for him as he's just one of those lemming-type's of people that follows his ""friends""; Sickboy - just purely selfish and uncaring; Begbie - a really vicious b***ard, always looking for an excuse to fight, and you always hope he get's his comeuppance; Tommy - the sensible one of the bunch (or is he?).<br/><br/>This is a really powerful movie, and is not really for the feint of heart as it's pretty disturbing (as well as gross) in a good few scenes. In saying that, though, it most definitely makes for compelling viewing.<br/><br/>Definitely recommended."
"KnightsofNi11","9","2","4","2 June 2011"," A disturbed masterpiece
","Prepare to be shocked, horrified, disgusted, appalled, and entertained all at the same time by this electrifying film. Danny Boyle's sophomore film is, without a doubt, one of his best. It's a darkly comic story of depravity, depression, and heroin. It follows Renton, a young heroin addict who is constantly trying to kick his habit but is only drawn back in every time by his friends and his edgy lifestyle. The film chronicles a multitude of different events that happen in Renton's life in a kind of free form method, all involving sex and drugs. The film doesn't hold itself back on the disgust and shock it so easily elicits, making it incredibly memorable in the most hilariously deranged way possible.<br/><br/>From the opening shot of this film we get a nice feel for what is in store for us. We open with Renton and his friends running through town, jumping over cars as Renton narrates about life and normality, setting the stage for the overall motif of this film. Renton observes a normal life and he recognizes it, but he just doesn't see the use in it when he has heroin. After listing off a plethora of ""normal life"" things in his monologue he ends it by saying, ""I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"" And that is how the entire film flows. Renton tries to get rid of the habit but then the allure just draws him back in, each time drawing him in deeper, causing his despondency to grow worse and worse.<br/><br/>But Renton isn't the only reason why this film is great. The rest of the characters are fantastic. The supporting cast of this film is incredible and they really drive the story to its greatest heights while Renton keeps it moving so we never get bored. Each character shares the same problems in one way or another and then some are just insane. There's Sick Boy and Spud, Renton's junkie friends who cause more problems than solutions in Renton's life, but he can't escape them. There's Tommy, the clean friend who chooses not to pollute his body with heroin and yet still has problems of his own. Then of course there is Bigbie, played to perfection by Robert Carlyle. Bigbie is the definition of insane. He is a man who will kill you as soon as look at you. He is a violent, angry, and unpredictable man whose every moves make you uncomfortable. All of his scenes are hilarious, yet at the same time so disturbing. He perfectly fits the film's feeling of over-the-top insanity mixed with a harsh biting realistic element that allows you to connect and be fascinated by these characters.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is a disturbed masterpiece. It's characters drive the story so powerfully and so electrically. And when you couple that with Danny Boyle's rough and rugged direction and an brilliantly witty script it makes the film that much better. It is hard to comprehend what you are supposed to take away from this film, but by the end you know you obviously took something away because of how strikingly incredible the film is. It's sporadic insanity drills itself into your mind, leaving you with so many scenes that you just can't shake. Trainspotting is brutally hilarious. It is one big oxymoron of greatness and you'll never see anything else quite like it."
"bradleyadita","8","2","4","3 November 2007"," Anti-Slogan Sloganeering
","What today may now be more popularly recognized as the film that launched the career of adolescent Obi-Wan Kenobi to become; was once a touchstone for the neo-punk-rave-hardcore-dance subcultural amalgam of the English-speaking world during the mid 90s. Yet the anti-slogan sloganeering of the film's opening sequence (later reprinted on bedroom and dorm-wall decorative posters, ""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a _______""... (spoken with a Scottish accent) (...inverting the Talking Heads' Once in a Lifetime)) marked yet another moment of self-conscious subversion on behalf of the underground; pre-dating and possibly foreshadowing the release of the UK anarcho-punk band Chumbawamba's single ""Tubthumping,"" a year later. Both the film and the song ironically castigate the excesses of hedonistic drug culture and again, both have similarly been championed by the very people against whom their creators railed.<br/><br/>Post-Pulp Fiction, the cringe/revolting factor seems to have been ratcheted up a few notches; potential viewers should certainly be ready to be disturbed. Where Trainspotting shined, however, was in its delivery of these disturbances. In contrast to other drug films and the setting for many scenes (run down hotel rooms, decrepit squats, and especially ""the worst bathroom in Scotland""), Trainspotting presents a polished clean image. The stylized gleam is reminiscent of Stanley Kubrick's cult favorite, A Clockwork Orange (1971). Trainspotting's heightened nasty(vomiting)/immaculate(Donald Judd!) dichotomy would later be used (and even elaborated on) in Aronofsky's Requiem for a Dream (2000). As a result, the film looks great, but unfortunately for its inhabitants, it depicts the human condition in only the bleakest terms. Despite this, Trainspotting, is none the less a skillfully constructed feature with definite entertainment value."

He knew it was bad, but he didn't care, and neither did I. 4 years clean now.. I've seen the film a few times sober, and its still an excellent film. I'm glad I wasn't just in a drug-haze and thought the film was good. If you've ever been an addict, you'll love this film. If you've never been an addict, well you might like it anyways if you enjoy a good film. Trust me, this film doesn't promote drug use at all. If anything it shows you what its like to be a drug addict. It is a movie, so there's always gonna be some stuff that is obviously strictly movie stuff. However the dirty grimy, straight up nature of this film and the way it portrays drug culture is pretty accurate. Hell I even love the ""big drug deal"" at the end, I always had friends (myself included) trying to get that big ""score"" that was gonna make you rich. People always think they are the shite too, but I love how Renton sums it up when he says the buyer knew they were just some dumb fools who got lucky. Because chances are if you ever meet one of these fools trying to get that ""big score"" thats the only way they are ever gonna get it. Dumb Luck."

This you will enjoy. Now for a critical analysis of the movie. Initially, Danny Boyle did a fantastic job here, some beautiful shots and a energetic vicious pace. The characters were very believable with notable credit to be given to General Franco Begbie. When watching this film i do note the strength of the soundtrack which melts nicely into the brain and carries the viewer back to the times effortlessly.

","Trainspotting follows the lives of five 'friends' who navigate heroin addiction in 90s Scotland. Pretty heavy stuff and as you'd expect this film is deeply depressing, sombre and shocking in parts. Despite this, somehow Boyle also manages to bring a moments of levity to this film, with some excellently executed dark humour.<br/><br/>This is in my opinion Boyle's best film. The whole film just fits so well together, with the script, performances, camera work, and soundtrack blending together perfectly. Boyle captured the absolute worst of drug addiction but also managed to find some semblance of hope. The flow of the film was seamless and, given the context, this film could have been a huge swing and a miss. The plot of Trainspotting is very solid and there was so much potential that Boyle squeezed out to its full extent. The fact that Boyle managed to make a story of addiction so artistic, rich and energetic is astounding - a true celebration of British film making.<br/><br/>The standout of Trainspotting really is the cast. Ewan McGregor was exceptional, and really carried the film as a powerful lead. His representation of a man's relationship with drugs, fighting addiction and trying to piece together his life was heart breaking and so well done. Johnny Lee Miller, Robert Carlisle, Ewen Bremmer and Kevin McKidd were all fantastic. The chemistry between them was so toxic yet so believable at the same time. Their relationship simultaneously made no sense and perfect sense, which the actors all expressed well. You can tell that the actors had a great amount of trust in Boyle and were all in on making Trainspotting.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is oft regarded as a classic and its easy to see why. Clearly Boyle's best film which delivers a shock to the system, some laughs and some hope at the same time. A must watch!"

"The-Sarkologist","8","0","0","11 February 2017"," Misguided Friendships
","Well, twenty years after it was released I have finally got around to actually watching this film, though I suspect that it had something to do with the sequel hitting the cinemas shortly. Mind you, after finally watching this film I sort of wonder whether a sequel is actually warranted – sure, it might be interesting to see what happened to the guys, and I'm sure Begby is one who is definitely going to be holding a grudge, however a part of me feels that this film pretty much covered everything that needed to be covered and we simply could have gone on without the need for a sequel to be produced, unless of course it is to encourage us to actually get around to watching the original film.<br/><br/>The one thing that had stood out about this film was that despite its name it had nothing to do with trains. Well, there are a couple of trains in the film, but I was wondering why a film about heroin addicts would get the title 'Trainspotting'. It turns out that it is a reference from the book, and also that addicts would hang around an abandoned train station, using it as an injecting room, and whenever they were going there they would say that there were doing 'a bit of trainspotting'. This reference appears in the book, but unfortunately doesn't make it into the film. I guess that is actually one of the biggest flaws in the film and that is that there are a lot of things that come out of the book, and unless you have read the book you might not entirely understand what was going on. For instance – how did the baby die? Okay, that is fairly obvious, but it is things like this, that are mentioned in the book but not so much in the film.<br/><br/>One of the themes that seems to run through this film is that you are who your friends are. The thing is that once you have a group of friends you eventually pick up their bad habits, and the thing is that it is really, really hard to actually break away from these friends because you are either on your own, or these friends will eventually hunt you down. Further, when you have a group for friends who have some really bad habits, then quite possibily you will eventually pick up this bad habits – as Tommy did – and then find yourself in a situation where you can't actually get away from them, and these habits.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is incredibly confronting, and while I have never touched heroin, I have met a couple in my time and have seen how destructive the lifestyle can be. Actually, my encounters have been more with speed, and I have seen houses where the mothers live in a pigsty and are more concerned about their next hit than feeding their child. However, the scary thing is that many of these addictions start out pretty innocently but have the tendency to slowly dominate your life. Sure, I have heard stories of heroin addicts holding down successful jobs, but the stories you don't hear are the stories of those who have thrown away their careers, their lives, and their families to pursue these desires.<br/><br/>Another theme about the film is that of choice, and the choices that we make, but it seems that there are only two, both of them quite horrible. We have the choice where we succumb to our desires and need for pleasure, though which heroin is a symbol of that pursuit of pleasure, while the other pursuit is that of 'life', which in part is enslavement to the system though debt, through employment, through being an acceptable member of society. In a way it seems to be one of those loose, loose situations. Mind you, there is something more fulfilling living a clean life with a respectable job, but the problem is that sometimes the choices that we made in our past, like those of our friends, eventually come back to haunt us."

","Trainspotting is still a brilliant movie that left an indelible impression on me over 20 years ago. Everything was brilliant about it including the casting, the story, the soundtrack, the crackling dialogue, and Danny Boyle's top notch direction. There's no disputing the fact that it is not for everyone, and there are plenty of scenes that are not for the faint hearted or squeamish. Trainspotting has earned a well deserved spot as one of the best movies of the 90's.<br/><br/>Trainspotting focuses on heroin addict Mark Renton (Ewen McGregor) and his circle of misfit friends including con artist Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), the dim-witted but good-hearted Spud (Ewen Bremner), the athletic and soccer loving Tommy (Kevin McKidd), and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) who is violently unstable and gets a thrill from picking fights with others. Renton and his circle of friends are deeply engrossed in the Scottish drug scene. Renton's fortunes start to change when he undergoes treatment for withdrawal of heroin following a near fatal incident and his strong desire to escape the drug scene and make a fresh start.<br/><br/>The cast, namely Ewen McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller and Robert Carlyle are just brilliant. It was also fantastic to see this movie as a big stepping stone for all four actors have gone onto bigger and better things in Hollywood. Kelly McDonald, who makes her cinematic debut as the schoolgirl Diane who hooks up with Renton, has also gone onto bigger and better things with roles in such movies No Country for Old Men (2007) and TV series Boardwalk Empire.<br/><br/>For a black comedy that is about drug use, Trainspotting is a realistic anti drug movie that in no way glamorises nor does it glorify drug use. The movie shows the various horrific consequences of drug use and how it affects the user and others around them including family and friends. <br/><br/>Trainspotting was a sleeper hit in 1996 that came out of nowhere and surprised everyone with its memorable story and terrific acting. Trainspotting deserved its acclaim from critics and audiences alike. To this day, Trainspotting is still a very popular movie and for me personally has cemented a permanent spot as one of my favourite movies of all time.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the sequel T2 Trainspotting hit the cinemas in February 2017 and seeing the original cast reunite again.<br/><br/>A well deserved 10/10."

","Due to the much-antipated release of T2 Trainspotting this weekend, this throwback Thursday called for a re-watch (and review) of the original motion picture.<br/><br/>Trainspotting was undoubtedly huge; launching director Danny Boyle and the lead cast into stardom shortly after its release - in particular, Ewan McGregor, who went on to perform high-profile roles in films such as Moulin Rouge, Star Wars and Black Hawk Down. Trainspotting was iconic in so many ways; the acting, soundtrack and honest scripting all left their mark on everyone that watched.<br/><br/>Most memorable of all must be Rentons' (McGregor) ""Choose Life"" speech during the opening scenes, which was not only reprised throughout the movie but brought to life once more in the trailer for its' sequel: T2 Trainspotting. The entirety of the film is filled with moments like this - fast-paced, raw and utterly glorious.<br/><br/>The plot doesn't shield from the harsh realities of the characters' lives; Trainspotting is critical in its storytelling - following Renton and his heroin-addicted lifestyle with his so-called ""mates"" Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), Begbie (Robert Carlyle) and Tommy (Kevin McKidd), all portrayed excellently authentic. Scenes like 'the worst toilet in Scotland' provides a great example of how Trainspotting does not care just how disgusted or distressed the viewer may be; it simply shows what it needs to to get the point across.<br/><br/>What is the point though? How did Trainspotting tell such a story of desperate criminal activity whilst still managing to be relatable and enjoyable? The answer lies in its' scripting, casting and uninspiring set. The characters and environment are designed to be as incredibly ordinary as possible, of no real interest and deliberately bland. Characters we love to hate and hate to love and identify with even though we differ greatly. That's the magic of Trainspotting entirely.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is daring and rife with idiosyncrasy; a movie that you can respect while you watch it. Many filmmakers can only dream of recreating what Trainspotting achieved, and in trying only convey an air of pretentiousness. The film still holds up today, is still seemingly somewhat relevant, and the acting is still wonderful even by modern-day standards. I can only hope the sequel can live up to expectation: the bar is set very, very high."

","With the sequel coming out very soon I knew I had to watch trainspotting and this is a truly fantastic unique film. The premise of the film sees a guy try to get clean from drugs which is proved hard due to his addiction and his bad influence friends. This was the film that truly put Ewan McGregor on the map as he is truly amazing in this film, he gives some truly memorable monologues that will stick with you as the film goes on and after it as well. He has the best character development in this film and he is the guy we root for even though he does some questionable things in this film. Robert Carlyle plastic begdbie in this film and he is really fun to watch as he clearly shows his anger problems in pretty funny if not disturbing ways. The characters of spud and sick boy aren't given loads of time to develop but they are fun to watch and the chemistry between all the characters is really good and easy to watch. The story has a good journey of McGregor's character as he develops throughout the film as you see his character progression. However,there are some pointless story arcs in this film such as McGregor's romance that ends up not being resolved and comes across as a bit of a waste of time. The script is absolutely fantastic with some brilliant dialogue and character interactions that make these characters really interesting and fun to watch. The style of this film is very unique and a bit bizarre at times but it works for this film. The style has a really low budget but it works as Danny Boyle uses Evey trick he has to make this film as memorable as possible. Overall this is a fantastic film that does make me excited for the sequel."

tragic, we hadn't seen anything like it.<br/><br/>But we were 16 when it came out and living in Chicagoland. We were a

chapter narrated by a different character and each one written in a
Scottish accent.<br/><br/>You longed for Sick Boy's chapters, you could tear his apart in the

","Trainspotting was labelled as both anti and pro drug when it was first released. The latter is somewhat baffling but I'm sure some of it must come from Ewan McGregor's enthusiastic opening and closing mantra which bookends the film. The funny thing is the abruptness of the tone of this short monologue and how it has shifted over an hour and a half. The film's soundtrack is like background club music, constantly pulsing and pumping as these Scottish addicts go about their aimless lives. That's how Renton sees this safe, domestic path of life - aimless, boring. Then at the end he has the same words, and I'm sure that he feels the same way too. But there's no longer that spitting derision that he once had. There's a resignation to his voice; this way may be boring and uneventful, but at least it is not life-threatening. <br/><br/>Much has been made of Boyle's breakneck, irreverent style - the way the camera seems to be always rushing to the next hit like the gang is, the rough, offbeat performances, the brooding, ominous way the walls of their den have been colour-coded. Boyle never seems to really want to slow down, and here is where he hits somewhat of a snag. While the gang are deep into their addiction this style is hard-hitting, perfectly mimicking the wild world of the addict and their twisted logic. Their eccentricities are blown up in a hilarious sequence which cuts across each of their sexual encounters on one night. And then this makes it all the more appropriate and shocking when Dawn is found dead due to neglect - the walls cave in on them, the discovery creeps up on them like it does for us. But even as Renton goes clean (and the mis-en-scene is suddenly a lot cleaner, a lot brighter, a lot less grimy) the film still goes ahead at breakneck speed and is still setting up the punchlines. It is as if Renton cannot escape his dreaded past. <br/><br/>Going clean seems a little easy for Renton. As if to note this, the script keeps pointing and nudging his way towards heroin once again. A big deal for all the product they could ever want to last them a lifetime, and guess who has to test its quality. But it isn't really presented as a mountain sized temptation and challenge, but more of an inconvenience. It's funny when he stacks up the piles of cans and nails himself into a room to quit once and for all (we sense this is a regular routine), and mildly horrifying when Boyle goes surreal as Renton, bedridden, pleads for just one more hit. For all the subject matter it feels a little safe, a little content to hide behind the stylistic touches that gives the film much of its energy - using a flurry of cuts for mundane occurrences like drinking milkshakes, throwing in dutch angles that flip around to reveal reflections, dollying along the nightmarish elongated room (or prison). <br/><br/>What Boyle does nail is the youth culture of these Scots - there is no un-turned stone, no missed opportunity to make this lifestyle as frenetic and attractive as it can be. They inhabit dreary, run-down shacks, they beat up posh Americans in bar bathrooms, their bodies are withered and eyes darting. The dialogue, with its thick, Scottish dialect, is perhaps the film's greatest and restrictive trait - by not cutting down on any of these character's personalities and eccentricities (some moments even have subtitles) we view and experience the world in the same twisted way they do; the botched interviews, the way the mind warps toilets into filthy experiences, the way they cheer like juveniles when they deal with forces much larger than they are and get away with a small fortune. It's almost too convincing, which is why it seems a little strange when Renton quietly slips out the back."

","I watched this after watching Requiem For A Dream and I must say this is one step ahead of it, all thanks to Ewan McGregor, the bold script & screenplay.<br/><br/>Starting off with rock music & a chase scene, the narrative begins to induce the story. Lives of drug addicts shown brilliantly in less than 90 minutes, Trainspotting talks substance & it talks truth. The harsh reality comes when death touches the plot for the first time & that is the single sequence why this is worth a watch. Completing what it started is another thing the makers have done beautifully, along with the message of life. Wonderful!<br/><br/>Although, the cast is significantly responsible for the smart screenplay & portrayal of deep characters, I found few sequences unrelated & unworthy. It kinda detaches from the main theme, but yes it deals with multiple themes, if pondered carefully. Music is good enough while editing is fine. Cinematography is brilliant.<br/><br/>Direction is smart & the writing is fresh with plausible humor & references. Yeah, the characters discuss movie & everything hears fine.<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended for people who love theme-driven movies. But, sensitive people should think twice because it has crime, sex, porn & drugs involved in great amounts. 8.7/10 for the classic!<br/><br/>Can be watched with a typical Indian family?

Sure, the script is well written and injects a fair amount of humour into the film, but it stunts the character development and the audience winds up not caring enough for any of the characters or what happens to them.<br/><br/>That said, the film delivers a flood of unforgettable events, brilliant dry wit, and the loyalty displayed by Renton to his boys is also quite endearing.<br/><br/>Give it a watch, it may just wind up being your favourite film."

To me this is a generational classic. The comedic moments are brilliant. There are great scenes illustrating drug use that are simply surreal and wonderful, and sometimes disgusting. <br/><br/>This movie is mostly about a young man coming of age, while him and his friends struggle with an addiction to heroine, and its effects on life. As I said there are some hilarious comedic moments, but there is also a lot of dreary darkside of life drama as well.

I will admit that upon the first viewing, like many others who have reviewed it here, I did not like the film that much. I could see where it was going for laughs but I couldn't get too far past my visceral reaction to seeing people shoot up heroin. Plus, I'll admit I had some difficulty following it with the thick Scottish brogue.<br/><br/>However, upon a second viewing,I picked many more things up and it got to be much more humorous and clever, albeit still quite dark. It's not for the faint of heart, but if you can get yourself to look at it the right way, then the language and even the sex doesn't seem gratuitous but even integral to the movie.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle is great as Begbie (I love the scene in the bar where he's recounting his game of pool with Tommy). It's really hard to believe that this is the same actor who played Renard in the The World is Not Enough just two years later. Ewan MacGregor simultaneously plays repulsive and engaging very well. Kelly Macdonald's speech outside the nightclub to him is also one of the film's better moments.<br/><br/>In all, it gets richer and richer with successive viewings.

"arthera09","9","0","0","17 January 2010"," classic from Danny Boyle
","I am not sure if I want to give this a 8, or 9 because honestly it is hard to tell what they are saying more than once. So there is fantastic dialog, but if I cannot understand what they are saying it is not good. This goes hand in hand with the narration. I love Ewan McGregor in this, but since I had to focus trying to figure out what he was saying that I missed what was happening on screen sometimes. The reason that I give this a 9 though is because I love this movie. I really love how the direction reflects the tone of the film and what is happening on the screen. The introduction of the characters at the beginning with the narration gives so much information that is an overload honestly, but I think that is the point. I love how during his kicking of the habit after his overdose how there was no continuity between shots and it was as frenetic as possible. The music was awesome and I really loved some of the soundtrack choices. All of the acting was top notch and to pick out any of the cast as a stand out is hard because they all played it out perfectly. I think the most successful part of the film is that Boyle never makes you want to do heroine, but definitely is able to demonstrate why these people are hooked. As soon as you might think that you want to try some he just hits you in the right way so you DO NOT want to ever try it. I love how Renton at the end just says that I am a bad person and that there was no real hero here and the fact that we were rooting for those terrible human beings says a lot about the film. One of my favorite scenes is when Spudd is messing up with job interview and with Renton right before that trying to explain how to mess it up, but not too badly. Then Boyle takes two different cameras which from the shot differently and just cut between the two without disturbing the flow of the dialog at all. It really was a great scene and very simple trick that added to the feel of the scene and actually added a bit to the character. Great movie and it is great to see Boyle come into his own and create his own voice."

","The biggie: the one that made the world sit up and take notice (if only of the box office receipts). Trainspotting proved a real shot in the arm, not only for the UK film biz but also the music, fashion and advertising industries - a huge coup for Film4 and an early example of modern 'packaged' cinema.<br/><br/>Sporting outlandish visuals and an achingly trendy soundtrack, it colluded with its target audience in a way few British films had done before, utilising already established scenes - such as those surrounding Britpop (then privately mired in smack habits), ecstasy culture, and heroin chic - to add a synthetic veneer of cultish cred. Not bad going for an adaptation of a novel encompassing urban sectarianism and smack, and written in the broadest of brogues.<br/><br/>But Trainspotting the film was a very different beast from the book: it was selling a lifestyle. Controversy has dogged Boyle from The Beach to Slumdog Millionaire, but until the latter's release, it would remain Boyle's most talked-about and scandalised achievement."

The narration by Mark Renton, played by Ewen McGregor, throughout the film brings a depth to the film, which is balanced by the antics of the Mark's friends, who are a larger than life group of drug takers and deviants. The 'Choose Life' speech at the start of the film is one example of interesting social commentary narrated over scenes of drug taking, thieving, football and fighting.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner, Kevin McKidd, and Kelly McDonald provide the main supporting roles. There seems to be a good camaraderie amongst this group of mates that makes for a dynamic film, which is just as well because there isn't much of a story, just a tale about friendships and how to break free from the past to make a brighter future for yourself.<br/><br/>Not sure why 'Trainspotting' - trains really have no part in this film at all except as background objects.

","Danny Boyle's film masterpiece ""Trainspotting"" is a vibrant jolt of life (however constantly drugged-out its characters may be) that transports the viewer into the shocking minds of low-middle-class people with the common dream of success and happiness which they think will be obtained by a constant intake of incredibly powerful drugs.<br/><br/>""It's better than sex,"" the characters agree as they continuously inject their worn-out veins with the drugs, subsequently dropping almost unconsciously to the floor in a vivid and electric dream of heavenly perfection. This is what life is about: joy, ecstatic happiness and a constant state of perfection. ""Drugs provide this for us"", they realize, and if this is the dream every human longs for then it should justify their pillaging and plundering around Scotland to obtain it.<br/><br/>The film follows a junkie (Ewan McGregor) as he alternately muses about the low state of human beings and the difficulty it is for him to live, and the utter paradise it is to consume the drugs that account for everything even remotely pleasant in his life. His best friends which include a loser yet humble and lovable junkie (Ewen Bremner), a pretty boy/Sean Connery know-it-all with a high image of himself (Jonny Lee Miller) and a drug-hater violent psycho (Robert Carlyle) all emphasize the alternately revered and reviled state drugs induce them into.<br/><br/>Our principal character, the McGregor junkie, dreams of someday actually managing to quit drugs and getting himself a nice lifestyle like 'normal people' while recognizing and embracing the wicked jerk he actually is. The film follows him in a hilariously amusing odyssey into 'normalcy' and the missteps he encounters that are triggered by his friends' reappearance in his life.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is very good, as a matter of fact, but what really makes this movie an absolute masterpiece is the artistry behind its every area. The music is psychedelically absorbing, the editing is simply perfect, and the cinematography is, well, electrically vibrant, hysterical, spot-on and artistic. The screen writing follows no ordinary pattern, but involves images, music and colour to exude the feeling of the movie.<br/><br/>It's a perfect comedy, really.

Renton goes through phases of being addicted and withdrawal of heroin. The characters are unable to say away from the pull of heroin. The characters in the film also act like normal men, they go out drinking and clubbing, playing football and having sex. However throughout the film the character lives start to fall apart, including prison, death and sickness. They end up going into a life of organised crime.<br/><br/>To me Trainspotting is one of the Best British films ever made. Some people have criticised the film to be glamouring drug-use, but if you see the film it does anything but. It tackles a lot of issues and isn't afraid going head-on. The film is well-written, and is based on a novel by Irvine Walsh. I admit I haven't read it but I know some of the easter-eggs like the Hiberan poster in the background. This is Danny Boyle's best film as a director and shows his talent to the full. The acting is also top-notch and many of the actors have become successful, especially Ewan MacGregor, Kelly Macdonald and Robert Carlyle. The film also have a very good soundtrack, with songs like Lust for Life by Iggy Pop, Born Slippy by Underworld and the drugs song Perfect Day.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is an excellent film. If you like this film then you will like Requiem for a Dream and vice versa."

","A lot of times a Judge a movie by two things. The costumes and the soundtrack. This movie gets an A-Plus. The sound track is amazing featuring some choice iggy-pop tracks and you really can't beat the punk style wardrobe. The guys look good in there tight jeans and tight t-shirts. Sick boy strays away with his formal ware, but he still looks killer. Not only does this move have great tunes and slamming outfits it actually has a decent plot and great acting. The story is about misfit junkies creating ruckus around Edinburgh and doing anything they can to pay for they drugs and then having small bursts of trying to get clean. All the characters work well to create a smorgasbord of crazy enjoyable characters. This movie really takes boys will be boys to the extreme. The cast is lovable, and they all do a great job along with the director and cinematographer of making what is essence a simple story into a really memorable well done move. It is totally worth watching. I've probably seen it ten times!"

","Trainspotting is a really great movie. I like the way it is shot, and I also like the voice over. I've never read the book, but hearing the voice over makes me want to. I like all the characters in this movie. I think spud is really fun. He seems almost like a cartoon. I mean pooping in a significant others bed, that is probably the most embarrassing thing I can think of. I love the club scene it is so 90's and I like how alienated Ewan feels because; I think that's how clubs are. They are such weird places and you really never know where you stand because it's dark and you are most likely a little drunk or at least everyone else is so no one is really a great judge of character. I think they do a really good job of portraying that awkward club feeling. I like the friendships between the guys. They seem very realistic. The whole movie has a very real feel to it. It is a look into everyday life in Scotland. The spend a lot of time drinking and shooting the crap around and the weather does some pretty dreary, for the most part they seem like the get along alright despite there drug problems!"

","Probably the most disgusting thing I can image doing is swimming through a dirty toilet, in search of a pill I had just put up my own anus. Good thing Trainspotting took care of showing me that on the silver screen. Despite how disgusting that scene is, the film is a master piece. The costumes are great each character sort of has a style that embodies their personality. Ewan McGregor looks great in his tight skinny jeans with his shaved head. I love the character of spud he is so funny. Everything he does in this movie makes me laugh, and his accent is intense. I can't understand him, but I like him. I got kind of mad when they shot the dog in the ass because I'm an animal lover, but the dialogue they had during that scene was great. The music in this film was great, so great in fact that there are two jamming sound tracks! I have theme on cassette tape because I am just that cool and old school. If you haven't seen this masterpiece do yourself a favor pop some corn sit back and enjoy these crazy Scottish clowns get themselves into a lot of trouble!"

","Trainspotting is a really well crafted film. The cinematography is great. The script is solid, and for once the voice over actually works. A lot of times I hate voice over, but it works really well in this film. The acting is great. The guy who played spud most likely deserves an Oscar for the scene where he does a job interview on speed. I couldn't understand a word he was saying but it cracked me up. Having the tourniquet and needle in the heel of the shoe was pretty cool looking. Though I frown upon elicit drug use. I love when they bring a bag of beers to go hiking. It seems so funny the drinking culture in the UK. In almost every scene at least someone is drinking a beer. The parents are concerned about their children's drug habits, yet they all seem to be alcoholics. I love the club scene. Why they put Ewan McGregor in a mid-drift t-shirt I don't know, but I loved it. This movie takes having for all intensive purpose crappy life and makes it seem OK. The characters are fascinating and you just like them so much you want to know what they are up to even though it's most likely screwing their lives up even more. I love this movie and I highly recommend everyone watch it."

","I've never thought about doing heroin before, but it is weird how this movie almost makes it seem like it is OK. I guess it is because the story of the characters is so endearing you don't really think about it is about a pack of virtually useless junkies. I think the acting is great. The toilet scene with Ewan McGregor is classic. It is probably one of the most disgusting things I have ever scene on screen. The scene where the two guys are talking about their girlfriends and the two girls are talking about their boyfriends at the same time is really well done. There are a lot of little nuances that make this film great. The baby is the worst part. Every time I watch that part I hate it, I always want to fast-forward through it. The music in the film is great. A soundtrack I can definitely rock out to. I think Scottish accents sound really crazy. I can't even begin to imitate it. When spud has his job interview I can't understand a word he is saying. I notice something new every time I watch this movie, it's always enjoyable and it always makes me say no to drugs!"

","Quite frankly a bloody brilliant British film. And after the trash talking I've seen from some of the reviews, I'm appalled.<br/><br/>Sure there may have been an excess of swearing but in all honesty I don't think it was unnecessary or laying it on a bit thick - people do talk like that. More importantly, people do talk with Scottish accents. I've been confused in real life by Scottish accents but this film was a doodle to understand (with the exception of Carlyle, but really the whole point of him was to be a maniac so it went hand-in-hand). It's about culture people, different accents and dialects do exist.<br/><br/>The film may have been sickening at points, like the discovery of the dead baby and the later withdrawal of Renton but really, that's the point. It's not meant to glamorise drugs, it's not heroin-chique it's about trying to strip away the veneer of drug using and show it for something repulsive. And sometimes you have to be repulsive to show that.<br/><br/>It tried to show you what happened, even why it happened but that in the end it destroyed lives and people. In my opinion? It did that excellently."

","When I was still in high school, this came out in the theater, and I remember desperately wanting to see it. My mom saw it, told me it was ""too depressing"" and so I didn't.<br/><br/>A few years later, I found a good reason to slap my mom when I remembered the film and rented it on a whim.<br/><br/>This is comedy and drama as beautifully blended as I've ever seen on film.<br/><br/>I was shocked at how brilliantly this movie flowed from the first moment of it. The opening monologue voiced over a foot chase scene was unforgettable, as Mark Renton rifled off in meth-juiced prose his reason for becoming a drug addict - his revulsion for choosing life as others saw fit, ending in a characteristically dry punchline to echo his whimsical understanding of his otherwise dour seeming situation.<br/><br/>The movie immediately plunges you into the world of the druggie, crawling along the floor of a heroin house as people pass out all around. You get to meet some of Renton's friends - all deep characters in their own rights.<br/><br/>One of this movie's biggest strengths is the depth of the characters from their very introduction. You get to know them all as if they were your own friends, each with their own strengths and weaknesses, played upon expertly by Irvine Welsh's scripting throughout the film.<br/><br/>It balances brilliantly the duality between straight people, drug addicts, and alcoholics with a holier than thou attitude toward illegal addicts, touching in depth upon the stresses of a druggie lifestyle, while never falling too far away from the whimsical nature of the film to make a joke out of place.<br/><br/>If you've ever had an angry moment, you'll love Francis Begbie. His raw, inappropriate rage is comical because you get to see it from the outside.<br/><br/>If you've ever had a moment of doubt, you'll love Mark Renton. He's the perennial introspective psychologist, keenly aware of his condition, struggling with whether he wants his lifestyle, always laughingly dry about it.<br/><br/>If you've ever had a 'bad' friend, you'll love Sick Boy. He's pushy, disloyal, always right, always wrong, but you can't get away from him.<br/><br/>If you've ever had a naive friend, you'll love Spud. His weakness makes him ever funnier as the movie goes on, particularly in the speed addled job interview scene, which is a comedic gem.<br/><br/>This movie pushes you to new places, and you'll beg to keep going. It's raw, witty, and undeniably compelling. Don't even bother renting it. Buy it."

","Not only have the actors from Trainspotting become more famous but the songs in the soundtrack have become all but standards.

And, so is the soundtrack.<br/><br/>If you have not seen this movie yet then you are in for a cinematic treat. I would recommend that you buckle your seatbelt and button your chinstrap before watching.<br/><br/>It is also refreshing to see that there are still real actors out there like Ewen MacGregor. Trainspotting was my introduction to him. For most people, Ewen MacGregor is the young Obewan Kanobie and that's just fine. For those introduced to him as young Obewan will be vastly impressed by his portrayal of Renton. This is a classic, a cult film, and a must see movie for anyone that has even smoked a joint or even thought about what heroin is like. Even Bill Clinton would like it!"

","Trainspotting is my kind of movie, it reflects both the feelings of the characters but at the same time the exact situation that many, many, young adolescents live today everywhere in the world. Great acting, great angles, perspectives, colors, camera movement... The plot of this movie could be summarized very simply: A man who wants to get out of heroine addiction.<br/><br/>I must admit that the baby scene was very horrifying and touching. I almost felt high at some point, and I felt tired and patience-less and horrified when he is trying to sleep with that need for heroine. I believe that TRainspotting is a piece of art you can't miss... this are the movies I want people to rent, I want people to pay for, so society knows that still some are against drugs... Though for some people this movie may represent at some points a good face of drugs, the message of it is absolutely anti-drugs.

","Cinema has had its fair share of morally questionable heroes, but Ewan McGregor's character is probably the most fun we've ever seen. What do we take from a guy who feels very despicable about sleeping with a minor yet steals money from his friends because, ""Well, the truth is I'm a bad person?"" We get an interesting character, that's what. One surrounded by references to other nonconformist or antiheroic characters of visual past... the Beatles' Abbey Road cover, a bar set to look (somewhat obviously) like the milk bar from Clockwork Orange, the amusingly cheeky art of Andy Warhol... all to provide a background for a guy who takes drugs, quits, steals, and each time does it with different results and to different levels and with no really strict 3/5 act story design.<br/><br/>This is a movie that simultaneously has a very disturbing death and a very cute one. It's a movie that has winners and losers, though we're never fully sure which are which. It has a guy who hates junkies and spends all of his free time befriending them, that flippantly rejects mainstream ideas of life and material happiness but chooses to end that way, and gets blamed for glorifying drugs while still containing scenes creepy enough to make anybody swear of junk forever... like they do a hundred times...<br/><br/>What more could you ask for? Well, I guess it's worth noting that this is done by the same guy who's done 28 Days Later... and Millions. Everyone already knows that, but come on... Danny Boyle definitely has something going for him, and I think he still has a lot more to offer us. I personally can't wait.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"laurenslattery","10","0","0","31 March 2006"," A story about changing times and friendship
","Trainspotting is a wonderfully brilliant movie that everyone should see! The story follows a young Mark Renton as he tries to find his place in a world that is ever changing. It is a story ultimately about friendship- with childhood mates (all of whom are classically different), girlfriends, and... of course... drugs. It is a story that almost all can relate to in some way because we have all found ourselves at one point teetering between the two realms of growing up and moving on with that of the comforts of old habits, places and people. It is a brilliant look at the trials of lost souls- how they live in and function in the world- and what it was like to be young and Scottish during a period of dramatic change. From the charming Sick Boy to the shy Mark Renton, the world of Trainspotting provides a character for everybody. Even though Mark is, in a way, an anti-hero, he is charming and captivating enough that can't help but root for him and ultimately fall in love as you watch him and the story unfold on screen. Ewan Mc Gregor as Mark Renton perhaps gives one of his best performances of his career... and the rest of the cast is stunning as well. It is a movie that never gets old and is always in my DVD player. Really, it's a must see!!"

The whole movie was based on drugs and its terrible effects, and after watching this movie, one can only feel sickened with the thought of drugs. Walking away from this movie, I was impressed with the filming techniques as well as the brilliant acting, but the story was just a little too much to handle.

","I discovered the work of Danny Boyle when I watched Trainspotting (1996) with my friend in his apartment, about two years ago. We could relate to its themes (friendship, growing apart, heroin-addiction etc.), since my friend and I were in fact heroin-addicts ourselves back then (thank God, I'm clean now!). Film-critics have criticized Trainspotting for glamorizing drugs - I don't agree. Trainspotting is supposed to be almost a journey in the life of an addict, and although we do see the good times of heroin-use, we certainly also see the bad ones. Portraying heroin-addiction in any other way would be looking down upon the film's audience.<br/><br/>""People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that sh*t which is not to be ignored, but what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not f**king stupid. At least, we're not that f**king stupid."" - Mark Renton, Trainspotting<br/><br/>Trainspotting is pure cinematic art. It has a unique visual style (play with distinctive colors red/green in rooms, several surrealistic scenes etc.), a great rock/80's-pop/classical/electronica score by artists such as Iggy Pop (with David Bowie), Lou Reed, Underworld and Mozart and fabulous method-acting (especially by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle). It's very artistic, avant garde-ish and at the same commercially. This in itself is one of Trainspotting's great strengths.<br/><br/>Trainspotting can't be described. Like for instance Lars Von Trier's Europa (1991) it's one of those movies that has to been seen - not discussed. This is pure cinematic art! 10/10"

","Trainspotting is a laid back drama about a man named Renton, who is deeply involved with drugs and tries to clean his act by staying away from it for as long as he can. For him it is hard, since he cannot stay three feet away from it and his friends have a big impact on it, which he cannot stay away from either. This is the third Danny Boyle film I have seen and the last I've seen of his for a long time. Trainspotting is funny on most counts such as the bb gun shot to the dog who attacks its owner and the toilet scene. The characters in the movie were good and this movie shot up McGregor's career a bunch, which lead to The Phantom Menace for him. I knew this film was about drugs, but most drug scenes were quite disturbing and let off a complete distraction which reminded me of Requiem of a Dream in some ways. Most of these scenes pretty much explain why you should not take drugs. Anyways, the soundtrack was good and the cinematography was perfect as well. With a couple flaws here and there, overall, it was a good film with entertainment spread all around it. I recommend it.<br/><br/>Hedeen's Outlook: 7.5/10 *** B-"

It features great acting, superb background visuals, and some of the most bizarre & disturbing moments ever shown on a movie screen.<br/><br/>The story focuses on the many drug-filled misadventures of Renton(played by Ewan McGregor) as he tries to figure out if he wants to really ""choose life"". He also faces a challenge in which he has to decide on his friendship with his bungling buddies: The braindead Spud, the suave Sick Boy, the psychotic Begbie, the truthful Tommy, and his under-aged girlfriend Diane (played by the adorable Kelly Macdonald). All along the way, heroine and music are saturated in the story.<br/><br/>The characters stick to their characterizations so well that it actually works. Renton is very honest about himself, but also dishonest in some situations. The character of Spud is a doped-out as he can get. Sick Boy is a sociopathic James Bond copy. Begbie is crazy and villainous. And Diane acts very mature for her age (which is just like most teenage girls nowadays). Tommy is a little too regular for his own good, especially since he is living among his deranged and unusual friends.<br/><br/>There are some scenes that are very bizarre, disgusting, and disturbing. These scenes include Renton swimming in a toilet, Renton having sex with the much-younger Diane, and Renton's deadly ""withdrawal from drugs"" scene. These scenes may be disturbing & gross for many people, but it shows how unusual life can really get (I must point out that all these scenes feature Renton as the main character. This is a great thing, since it keeps the viewer's attention fixed to Renton when needed).<br/><br/>The music featured in the movie is pretty good. You will hear some groovy tunes from Iggy Pop, as well as some nice dance tunes from Underworld and other gods of dance & techno music.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was excellent and sticks to its story very firmly. It's also based on a book that I haven't read yet. Upon watching this movie, I have an urge to read the book that inspired this movie.

","You can often judge a movie by the degree of extremes when it comes to people's responses. And judging by the way people either love or hate this movie -- nothing in between -- this is a brilliant one.<br/><br/>When this movie first came out in the 1990's it played a major role in shaping the cultural landscape that was to follow. It's right up there with Pulp Fiction and Nirvana's Smells like Teen Spirit. It was that good.<br/><br/>The plot follows a group of ne'er-do-wells who make it their primary goal in life to get high on heroine. They sacrifice jobs, relationships, family. Some even die. The movie doesn't make any bones about portraying the life of a junkie in the hardest, grittiest way possible. It doesn't sugarcoat it or whitewash the experience. Basically, the movie gives each and every inch of the heroine user's experience its due, from the highest of the highs to the lowest of the lows, from the the cravings, the mania, and high jinx, and along the way a compelling portrait of the types of personalities who frequent the bars, bathrooms and slums where heroine users shoot up, to the fear and depression and despair that come from getting off the stuff or trying to score and coming up short. In this way the movie is totally compelling and I highly recommend it. Beyond all this is a funny cast of characters. I'd say it has everything, and makes a typical story arc out of all of the important events in a junkie's life. The cinematography and editing all flow in seamlessly. Close-ups and quick cuts give a visceral sense of running from the police (Ewan McGregor almost gets run over by a car in the process, and rather than lament the fact, he stops and laughs at the car as one more turn on the roller coaster), and the pacing of the movie slows to a crawl when Ewan McGregor goes dry.<br/><br/>Too many times ensemble casts are wasted on movies that pretend to high drama in the ordinary lives of ordinary people, but end up coming off as ordinary.

","STAR RATING:*****Unmissable****Very Good***Okay**You Could Go Out For A Meal Instead*Avoid At All Costs <br/><br/>Renton (Ewan McGregor) is a heroin addict who's making one last ditch,final attempt to kick himself into gear for good.The film basically follows the fortunes and mis-fortunes of himself,his friends Spud (Ewen Bremner),non-drug user Tommy (Kevin McKidd),Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the psychotic Begbie (Robert Carlyle) as they venture from triumpth to tragedy,before the ending rolls by determining whether they really will decide to settle down and 'choose life.' <br/><br/>It's funny,because the last film I reviewed,yesterday,Mean Streets was also a film that launched some actors to super-stardom,and this did exactly the same for some fine Scottish talents.Ewan McGregor's a big star in Hollywood now,but never has he delivered a performance as heartfelt and honest as he does in the lead role here.He no doubt looks back nowaday and thinks so himself.He carries the film perfectly,but all the supporting cast do a tremendous job of things as well,especially Miller as the well-spoken and thoroughly engaging Sick Boy and Carlyle in mesmerizing debut form as the psychotic,ultra violent,knife wielding thug Begbie,a performance he contrasted well with his much calmer,more reserved approach in coming roles.<br/><br/>The film is set in Edinburgh,the drug capital of the UK,and catches well the social depravity and decay running rampant in certain areas there that allowed it to get this way.But this film's major achievement is portraying the pleasant and dreamy social isolation of the heroin addict in relation to the rest of society going on around them.It also brilliantly contrasts the life of the heroin addict with the supposedly conformist,non-questioning,ultra-boring existence of the average joe.As the film says,choose life,but why would you want to do a thing like that?But it's also careful to show the devastating downside of drug mis-use,none more powerfully than watching the Tommy character's orderly,well-kept house (in relation to the squalid existence of the others!) deteriorate pretty rapidly from his first experimentation with heroin into a dead-aired,stripped,dark tomb,not to mention his horrifying physical decline from a healthy,athletic football player into a slumping,pale wreck.This is most noticeable,but McGregor also delivers a chilling cold turkey scene in his bedroom,showing hallucinations involving his so-called mates and dead babies crawling across his ceiling.In fact,there's a scene involving a dead baby which in itself is fairly nasty.It also benefits from a great soundtrack,from artists as diverse as Iggy Pop to Ice MC,which is well used to compliment each scene the given track is allocated to.<br/><br/>The 90s was the decade in which the British Film Industry really found it's feet and took off (despite some of the crocks of sh*t it tends to release nowadays!) and Trainspotting played a big part,along with the likes of Secrets and Lies and The Full Monty,in doing this.And so it should have.*****"

","This film is nothing short of breath-taking, not because of beautiful scenery, choreography etc...but because it is such a powerful film in a comic and emotional sense. Rarely does a film actually change me but this did, with a perspective not only on drugs but on life in general I had not considered before. All the characters have both likable but with flaws as with anyone you'd meet in real-life, and to look upon such a controversial subject with such conviction, imagination and a comic touch deserves real credit.<br/><br/>All the main acting performances are top-notch and hit the right note every time, and with a wonderful soundtrack to back the film up (Underworld - Born Slippy is the greatest track of all time) its no surprise that this gem is recognised as a classic.<br/><br/>As long as you're not too fragile, this is a must-see."

","This film along with Requiem For a Dream was quite controversial due to the subject matter. Anybody that likes Rom Com films or other eye candy would be best advised to steer clear of this. For people who want a serious insight into the world of drugs then this is a very good movie. Whilst some people would argue that it glorifies drugs, I would argue that it does the opposite. At times the film is funny, at times depressing, at times optimistic, but at all time engaging.<br/><br/>This is McGregor's finest hour to date at Renton and oh what a shame he couldn't instill the same amount of energy into his Star Wars role. The film itself follows the exploits of a group of scottish friends who are mostly addicted to drugs or violence or both. The whole cast are good and the direction is excellent for what must be the best British movie of modern times."

","The Edinburgh drug scene, 1990s, five pals hanging out constantly, two of them are clean, but eventually one of the remaining two can't resist the temptation. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is the main character who attempts to get rid of his heroin addiction but fails. Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller) is a huge admirer of Sean Connery's and rather the cleverest of the five. Spud (Ewen Bremner) never thinks of hurting others, Tommy (Kevin McKidd) is a sports fan who in the end suffers tremendously from heroin and Begbie (Robert Carlyle) is the one who gets into fights all the time and who always stays clean. Diane (Kelly Macdonald) is Renton's under age girlfriend whom he meets at a pub. Renton is stunned by Diane's impressive audacity.<br/><br/>After a near-death experience Renton's parents are determined to help their son to get clean and when they have succeeded Renton shifts to London to get his one-time pals behind his back, starts a new life and finds a job. Very soon, his 'friends' track him down and they want to talk him into a deal. The ending suggests that Renton eventually chooses 'life'.<br/><br/>The scenes that deals with illusions are presented beautifully, with a cool soundtrack and brilliant ensemble performance. Every moment of the film is gripping and never leaves you tired. We see drug addiction, violence, crime, struggle, sex and betrayal portrayed in a very creative way. This is definitely a classic."

","I love this movie very much. I saw it for the first time in 1996, in Dublin. The film was just released in Britain and in Ireland -where I was living. I remember a huge crowd for buying tickets and a packed cinema! At that time nobody thought ""Trainspotting"" would have become a cult movie. And nobody thought that all the people involved in the film would begin an extraordinary career -for them ""Trainspotting"" was the starting point, actually. See what Danny Boyle, Ewan McGregor, Robert Carlyle, Johnny Lee Miller, Ewan Bremner and the others have done so far... !<br/><br/>Apart from that, this is an excellent sarcastic description of junkie life. Without falling in flashiness -very typical in Quentin Tarantino's movies- ""Trainspotting"" has no mercy in showing squalor in life and in human relationships. We can laugh a lot for many situations, but we also think a lot (for example during the overdose scene, where nobody takes care of you even you are risking to die; we have another emblematic sequence when Ewan McGregor goes away with all the drug money and chooses to begin a new life with it).<br/><br/>The film is also very imaginative from a visual aspect -sequences are caricatural and symbolic, they translate the thoughts of the main charachter. The soundtrack is also fantastic."

The heroin addicts in this film are scumbags, liars, cheats and violent to boot but they are played so charmingly by Mcgregor and co that we grow to love them, all of them besides Robert Carlyle's menacing Begbie. This is a film that is completely anti-drugs but instead of preaching the message that they are wrong we see that they are wrong through the experiences of the gang and we almost understand why they are addicted to this life ruining drug.

"pompaj","Null","0","0","17 July 2003"," Creative and Raw
","There aren't many movies that both aren't afraid and also strive for intelligence with every move. Happiness was one. Trainspotting is another. It combines an intense desire to not hold anything back with an amazing world of characters who have analyzed life and chosen not to live it. The plot might be as simple, in the abstract, as a character continually trying to kick his heroin habit, but this movie draws that out with tons of humourous scenes and lively characters. Ewan McGregor stars as Marc Renton, the only character who is half rational. We need someone like that to bring us into this world and his voice over which runs throughout the film is a big help to understanding how he feels at various moments. The direction by John Hodge is gutsy and creative. There's one scene, for example, where Renton gets so high, he sinks into the rug and stays there, even when he's in the street, the car, and at the hospital. He doesn't come out of the rug until he comes off of the drugs. This movie does not make drugs look good at all, but at the same time it isn't filled with depression. How can you make a movie about the horrors of drug addiction and not make it sad? It has something to do with throwing intelligent humor into the mix as often as possible. This movie is a masterpiece. It takes so many chances and rocks every one of them."

How is it that a movie mainly about drugs can have such an equal mix of humor with such disturbing material as well. The scene where Renton is locked in his room going through withdrawl is the most accurate depiction of the symptoms I have ever scene.  More so than the Basketball diaries and much more so, than Requiem for a Dream (both are fantastic movies).  I have gone through an experience such as Renton did in this scene, and I was literally squirming on my couch watching this reminded of the pain of the experience.  The lines where he said too ill to sleep and too tired to stay awake couldn't have been put any better.  Great dialogue, and great movie."

","Trainspotting follows the destructable endeavers of Mark (rent-boy) Renton(Ewn McGregor) to get himself off Heroin. But with the inevitable one-last-hit always standing in his way, he seems doomed to waste his life with fellow comrades Spud, Sick-Boy Tom and the almost psychotic Begbie.<br/><br/>We go on a hallucogenic journey through the Edinborough underworld, while visiting the most disgusting toilet in Scotland, and the realm of Mother Superior.<br/><br/>However the beauty of the movie goes to the characters who are almost lovable in their mentally incompetant demeaners. So for everyone who enjoy the seedier side of life, or for parents who want to turn their children off Heroin, please come and enjoy the rigours of Trainspotting, it is sure to shock and offend, but as well it will intruige and leave a mark never to be wiped clean."

"Bureacrat85","Null","0","0","31 March 2003"," A wild, fun, intelligent, yet somewhat touching masterpiece
","Unlike most creative films, this film doesn't get its greatness from its provocative nature or boldness. Instead it comes from its unique intelligence and beautiful message on life that is made clear in the end of the film. The story is narrated by Mark, the Scottish heroin addict who is really a classic and beautiful protagonist underneath his wild and shocking style. Despite his aloof attitude, his rather reasonable yet dismal outlook on life, and a lack of living prudently, Mark is still a good person who wants to escape the stupidity of a normal life by immersing himself in a world revolving around heroin. He and his friends are more than fine with this sort life until all the problems of their addictions catch up with them. This leaves Mark to make the decision he never wanted to face, to leave the life he had chosen or make another choice by living the type of life he had condemned. If he chooses the wild and amazing life of heroin he will have to stay with the world which caused trauma and shock for him and his friends and held them back from reality. If he goes with the life of he never wanted he would be free from the drug that controls him and from all the chaos that came with it. But he would never be able to escape the ugliness of the real world and will never experience the glory of heroin again. So he chooses life over the beloved heroin with the help of his parents and support from his very young , schoolgirl lover. But  his past haunts him again as he tries to make a new life in London. His friends come back and Mark's test comes back again, the tempting life of his past versus the annoyingly bare yet reasonable life of responsibility. Instead of spoiling the end I'll wait for the reader to watch the film (if he or she hasn't done so already). It is a magnificent film that is hilarious, enticing, and speaks to the intelligent and the thoughtful. It's not hard to understand why Mark and his friends loved the drug. Considering the pressure, injustice, hurt, and shallow nonsense of the world, sometimes we need to create our own world that makes us feel safer, more faithful, warmer, and most of all happier. The only problem is that this leads people away from truth and reality, which is never a good thing. Mark realizes this and chooses reality and decides to ""Choose life. Choose a job. Choose a starter home. Choose dental insurance, leisure wear and matching luggage. Choose your [his] future.""  The main problem is whether he'll stay with it."

","There are very few movies that I believe are worth something, and Trainspotting is one of them.  I had gotten many recommendations to watch this movie, so I watched it for the first time.  Before watching it I was feeling indifferent because it didn't sound like a very good movie, but I was way wrong.  My first viewing was difficult because I didn't understand the Scottish dialect, but I still managed to tell my friend that it was significant (which is a good thing because I could probably count the number of significant movies I have seen on one hand).<br/><br/>A few months passed by and I kept thinking about the movie, and one day when that same friend of mine wanted to rent a movie I said, ""If you get anything, get Trainspotting.""  So we did and the second time I saw it I knew that it was definitely on my list of favorite movies of all time.<br/><br/>I ended up buying the DVD because I might as well not even have a collection without Trainspotting.  I watched it over and over and loved every minute of it.  I would have loved to see a sequel to it, but it wouldn't be appropriate so I tried figuring out what it is I wanted out of this movie. I watched it so many times because I wanted to re-live the experience over and over again, and then it hit me.  I wanted to BE Mark Renton.  I wanted and still want to live the life of a Scottish junky like the characters in this film.  That is the effect the movie had on me.  This wasn't a film that showed me the scum and destruction of this world, it showed me that skinny sickly slackers with nothing to lose are awesome!  I would love to live a rebellious day in the life of one of these characters.  I may not want to become a heroin junky in the future but I would love to live in Scotland and be part of that culture.<br/><br/>The best line in the movie-->""So why did I do it?

For some strange reason, I had problems with keeping up with Scottish slang.  Second time I saw it was a year ago.  I fell in love with it.  Ewan McGregor does a great job acting as a heroin junkie.  I also loved Johnny Lee Miller, for doing deceitful yet charming Sick Boy.<br/><br/>The movie gave me a new vision on the drugs and Scotland, yet I can't help thinking that the movie wasn't harsh enough in its portrayal of heroin.  I guess it shows the 'up-side' if there is such a thing in drug usage.<br/><br/>
However, if you like European movies, have not problem with Scots, and want to see something new, this is the right movie for you.  It's very bleak with the imagery, yet I can't stop laughing at all the jokes.  Just one thing, it's almost nothing like the book."

","One of the truly unique and creative flicks of the last twenty years; a ""Pulp Fiction"" for the very un-fictive AIDS plague that resulted from the salad days of Edinburgh's heroin revival. Ironically, like Quentin Tarantino, director Danny Boyle has since embarrassed himself with soft-minded disasters, e.g. ""The Beach"", with its even softer-headed heart-throb, DiCaprio. Maybe there was a hint of this already in the soundtrack with its heavy dose of early smack bards like Iggy Pop and Lou Reed. But the wit and grit, the great writing, the heroin-induced hallucination sequences, the sheer filth of it all, and oh, the performances.

","Danny Boyle's ""Trainspotting"" is great on many levels.  First, it is a powerful anti-drug film, showing the horrors of heroin addiction.  Next, a hilarious look at a group of friends and their adventures in Scotland. Finally, it is a serious study of how drugs, greed and death can tear them apart.<br/><br/>   Ewan McGreggor is in top form as our hero, Renton.  He is the most responsible out of the bunch, but his world is about to collapse from problems all related to his addiction. There is a lot of homage to Stanely Kubrick's ""A Clockwork Orange"" like little things like the writing on the wall of a club resmbling that of the ""milkbar"" Alex and his droogs hang out at, but also the ""fire vs. fire"" approach to its anti-drug message. <br/><br/>    ""Trainspotting"" is a great film about looking for a way out."

Also featuring a great script that adds enough dark humor to keep the audience entertained but not allowing the film become a parody of itself. Ewen McGregor gives his hands down best performance as a heroine addict that is trying his hardest to quite but just can't seem to bring himself to do it due to the pressures that surround him. Robert Carlyle is also top notch as a short tempered thug who doesn't take any bull and Ewen Bremner is often hilarious as an the absent minded member the group who gets one of the movies funniest scenes when he goes to a job interview on speed. This movie runs sort of like a surreal music video and is nothing that should be taken lightly.

","A good number of personal acquaintances condemned _Trainspotting_ on the grounds that it glorifies drug use.  Any engaged viewing of this film, however, cannot bear out this comment.  Equally, I don't believe you can say that this is an anti-drug film.<br/><br/>_Trainspotting_ merely presents the raw facts of addiction, leaving judgements of value to the viewer.  In doing so, however, it also poses questions regarding the social construction of harm with reference to drug use - what constitutes a ""good"" and a ""bad"" drug.  Most obviously, the most unstable and openly violent characters depicted are alcohol users; other more subtle comments include the importance of the health system in the procuring of drugs for uses deemed illegitimate by society and the almost constant presence of another legal drug - that is, tobacco.<br/><br/>At times, _Trainspotting_ portrays people and events that are exceedingly ugly.  This in and of itself turns many viewers away.  However, despite many grim scenes, I don't see this movie as depressing.  The ending, certainly, is upbeat, and the film, taken as a whole, is an affirmation.  A great cinematic experience."

While most anti-drug movies (shall I daresay 'New Jack City'?) just spend two hours showing anything and everything horrific about substance abuse, Trainspotting shows every aspect of the drug scene: The flood and flush of money, the highs and lows of addiction, the social fabric woven by heroin junkies; after seeing this movie I had little interest in heroin whatsoever, because this film showed me EVERYTHING I needed to know.  Rather than using scare tactics, Trainspotting using clever plot execution and some very creative effects.

Aside from the obvious Ewan McGregor, (this is really his breakthrough film) Robert Carlyle (The Full Monty) plays an astoundingly violent alcoholic Begbie without remorse.

","Trainspotting (TS) is an example of the kind of film that makes a big splash in the USA but could never be made by Hollywood. Easily one of the best movies of the 1990s, TS captures a sense of realism that eludes big American studios. Most Americans choose to see the movie as a cautionary tale about heroin and drug use but this view misses the mark. All the heroin excesses of the movie's central characters, Renton, Spud, Sick-Boy, Tommy, etc., pale when compared to the alcoholic pyschopath Begbie. Trainspotting is really a very hard look at the shallowness and purposelessness of life in the `post-industrial' world. Using the old Scottish capital, Edinburgh, as its principal backdrop, TS touches on all aspects of post-Thatcher Britain, from unemployment, urban decay, welfare, Aids, to drugs, sex, and pornography, as seen in the lives of a group of Scottish youths. The movie is about surviving in the late 20th Century world.<br/><br/>The performances by all are superb. Ewan MacGregor is spectacular as the movie's chief protagonist, and even the smallest roles are well acted. Throughout TS, the use of music, locales, flash-backs, and voice-over narration, is well conceived and creates a gritty pace. The extreme realism is achieved by a surrealistic use of shock, humor, and mood. There are both truly shocking and very funny moments in this movie. But more than just a mirror on decayed modern society, Trainspotting is a story of ultimate triumph. Don't miss this one!"

","I'm not sure if Danny Boyle, John Hodge, and Andrew MacDonald can make a movie again that has the perfect balance of sick humor, surreal imagery, grunge, drama and truth like TRAINSPOTTING again. From the likes of A LIFE LESS ORDINARY, it's a tough call.<br/><br/>It doesn't matter if you can't get through the thick Scottish accents, you get the main idea as the film, based on the Irvine Welsh novel, goes up and down the downward spiral (like a toilet bowl?).<br/><br/>I don't consider this a pro- or anti- drug movie. It just shows the reasons behind and consequences of heroin abuse, and that is that. Ewan McGregor is such a charming presence here, even as he goes through danky Scotland, stealing money for drugs or drugs from the hospital to trade in for money to get more drugs. Heroin is, it seems, a delictable favorite. But only because the high is so extraordinary, you don't want to come down, so you go back and forth. Addicted to it.<br/><br/>McGregor's Renton is the flawed hero of the movie who can't get off the smack habit no matter how PAINFULLY hard he tries. He's in great company of lowlifes. The equally charismatic Johnny Lee Miller plays Sick Boy, a suave James Bond fan who puts money over his friends any time. Robert Carlyle as Begbie, a beer-swilling hothead who gets high on violence rather than heroin (he's an echo of Alex from A CLOCKWORK ORANGE). Ewen Bremner as Spud, the nerdy follower who is the most luckless of the clan. Kevin McKidd as Tommy, the clean jock-type who strange enough hangs with this group of misfits even though he doesn't do drugs. Kelly MacDonald (in her first movie role) as a temptress schoolgirl who falls for Renton and is as smart as she is unusually mature.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle gives us some very funny and psychedelic moments in this cult fave, all under thumping beats of techno and new wave British pop music. But at the same time he raises some poignant thoughts. Renton tells us to choose life, a job, a big television, washing machines, a big couch to sit on and watch mindnumbing, spirit-crushing game shows. That might not be as satisfying of a life as you wished you had, but it's much better than being forced into slavery with a needle in your arm."

Director Danny Boyle has created a modern masterpiece that will change the way people look at a syringe. <br/><br/>There are great performances by Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle, and the soundtrack is excellent in rapidly creating and changing the scene.

","Trainspotting is one of the truly inspirational movies out there about life; especially life in Edinburgh Scotland. Danny Boyle and John Hodge utilize a lot of visual humor and tricks to condense Irvine Welsh's story. Yet despite its obvious and successful attempts at humor, Trainspotting is a serious movie about friends and the types of friends you hang on to, growing up Scottish as a Heroin junkie, and the life of the lower middleclass. In Mark Renton's case, Sickboy (a Sean Connery wannabe), Spud (a quiet but baffled man), Begbie (over-aggressive warmonger)are the problem. The issue of drugs is the counterpoint to that problem brought to light by his friends. With friends like his, he could never be more than what they were -drug addicts and remorseless street trash. Ultimately his attempts to quit Heroin, stay clean, get a job, and lead a normal life are dashed by his mates until he comes up with a plan: The Last Hit, so to speak. This movie is extremely quotable and inspirational."

Others may see it as simply a depressing film for those characters that do not redeem themselves or worse. There is nothing glamorous about heroin, and this film makes every effort to demonstrate the harsh, brutal reality of the life of an addict, and in that, its purpose can be drawn.

This is a film that divides people in 2 categories; they either love or hate it. You certainly need to have a good sense of humour in order to like this film. It has certain images in it that might shock a sensitive person if not watched with an open mind. So to all you serious people out there: you have been warned!<br/><br/>Everyone must know what the story is all about by now. But just for the repetition; Trainspotting tells a story about Scottish Mark Renton and his friends. Together they form a group of junkies who are addicted to any drug there is. It's a sad story about life's losers and their difficulties to ""choose life"". But this is not the thing that makes it so great. The best thing about it is it's continuous sarcasm and the fact that this is a film you really can't watch without feeling nausea and amusement at the same time. It makes fun of the serious things that people usually don't talk about and that's definitely one of it's best sides. The atmosphere of the film has been created very commonplace so it's quite easy to identify with the characters. The hilarious dialogues alone make this film worth seeing. Added to all this there's really great music that makes Trainspotting a cult movie for good! The book's not nearly as good as the film.<br/><br/>ATTENTION all you Trainspotting fans out there!

Now, I'd like to say a few words about the soundtrack.<br/><br/>The music makes or breaks the film.  The best films have had the best music. Legends, such as ""Casablanca"", ""Citizen Kane"", and ""Gone With the Wind"", have had equally legendary music and music scores.  Hitchcock realized the fundamental importance of music as the augmentor of moods and emotions, in a countless number of his works.  Martin Scorsese, the master of soundtrack selection, realized the same.  Last year, two seperate films, ""The Thin Red Line"" and ""Pi"", worked extremely well thanks partly to their music scores from composers who couldn't be more different:  Hans Zimmer and Massive Attack.  Danny Boyle's music selection, with work from Brian Eno, Iggy Pop and Lou Reed, is irreproachable.  Each song serves a scene and aids in creating moods:  fear, desperation, happiness, hopefulness, and depression. I particularly like ""Lust For Life"", which plays over the titles, and ""A Perfect Day"", for the sequence in which Renton overdoses and must be taken to the hospital.  There are many things to like about this movie, and the soundtrack is one."

","Director Danny Boyle along with writers Irvine Welsh and John Hodge have created for us a powerful, funny and harrowing yarn about the Edinburgh drug scene. I can watch this movie many times and still enjoy it just as much. It is original and daring, with many scenes causing immense controversy after the film's release. I have no knowledge of the elements that the film is based on, yet I know enough to tell that Trainspotting is quite realistic - many say it praises drugs, but I view it does the very opposite and shows all the troubles the one goes through when in a situation like that of Mark Renton (McGregor). As a bonus, Trainspotting has a great soundtrack and the acting is superb all round. Check this one out, it won't appeal to everyone but nevertheless a great film."

","WOW!!!!! The last movie I saw that came anywhere near captivating me as much as this one did was ""A Clockwork Orange."" This movie is absolutely wondrous: beautiful, stylish, heartbreaking, thought-provoking, hilarious, obscene, terrifying, arousing, and extremely quotable. It also has a fantastic soundtrack. This was the star-maker for Ewan McGregor, and very deservingly so. He's nothing short of splendid. It is a rare actor who can do with this role what he did. He is truly unforgettable. All of the other characters were wonderfully developed, with all concerned doing a marvelous job. The editing, direction, sets, etc. were all fabulous. Begbie's creeping menace was scarier than hell! Sick Boy was poignant, funny, and devious all at the same time. Diane was likable because she's a teenage girl who knows what she wants- a rarity in movies. I've never been so close to puking while still laughing as I was during the Spud-in-his-girlfriend's-kitchen scene. My roommate cried her eyes out at baby Dawn's unhappy fate. That's about it: we laughed, we cried, we hurled. A movie quite beyond compare, and one that I suggest to anyone wanting to see what a true tour-de-force looks like."

Highly controversial on its release, Trainspotting was accused of glamorising the use of drugs when it clearly doesn't instead showing how they can get out of control and totally destroy lives. The story centres around heroin addict Renton (McGregor  in a career launching role) and his loser pals, Sickboy (Jonny Lee Miller  Hackers), Tommy (Kevin McKidd  Small Faces), Spud (Ewen Bremner  Snatch) and Begbie (Robert Carlyle  Plunkett and McLane). Renton narrates his way through his struggle to beat his habit and change his awful life for the better.

This of course leads to a ton of trouble as they can't exactly trust each other.  This movie is indeed a porthole into a world which is fascinating, yet no one would ever actually want to visit.

","Years go by, and Trainspotting is still my favorite movie, and as a matter of fact, I believe people that speak against this film, is just because they didn't understand it as a whole.<br/><br/>First, as it has been said before, it does not praise drugs; just because through the movie the cast show how they like or need heroin, that doesn't mean that the entire context doesn't show where does drug abuse can take you.<br/><br/>Second, at first time it may seem to want some cheap shocks, but if you think about the style the story is told, whether in the book or in the movie (hyper realistic), it just needs to be shown that way, because those things happen in real life; if you do not deal with drug addicts, you may not understand what happens to them, or what could they do, so you may think the movie doesn't make sense.<br/><br/>Third, I've never been in Europe, but the acting was convincing enough, to make me believe that it was real enough, maybe too much, specially that brutal little b*****d Begbie.<br/><br/>Fourth, and very important, something that may be not quite clear, since I've rarely seen any comment about it, but the topics of social denounces are not just about drugs; anyone can correct me if I'm wrong, but as far as I know, it is very hard in the U.K. to escalate social classes, which means that if you were born a working-class child, so you will be as an adult, and without that kind of chances, it is very normal to see people doing drugs; although somewhat superficial, some other topics include dysfunctional families, the obsession with the mass media, the early awakening of sexuality, etc.<br/><br/>And last but not least, that soundtrack is a goldmine, if you're mad fer british music, so it didn't hurt me.<br/><br/>Overall, a pic to show you how life could truly be in the 90's, shown in an uneasy, but funny, tragic and very clever way."

There is Sick Boy who everyone calls Sick Boy because he is, well, sick. There is Begbie who everyone is afraid off because he is the sort of person who will bite your head off for brushing up against him in a crowded pub. There is also Diane who's choice wardrobe for success is moderately skimpy little dress and a school girl outfit. There is also Spud who's brains one finds themselves pondering over and Tommy who is all good and proper but ends up dyeing (must not be hard enough for the tough existence). So there's the gang, and this gang goes on an adventure of sorts all though which Renton can not make up his mind whether to `choose life' or `choose heroin'.

There is a great soundtrack (Iggy Pop, Blur, Underworld...) and there are some great actors, especially Robert Carlyle performing the choleric Francis Begbie. This film is not a conventional drama with the typical moral that sounds like ""Keep your hands away from drugs!"", it is more a very grotesque comedy: ""Trainspotting"" shows the everyday life of junkies in Scotland, but not in a dramatic or pitiful way. When Mark Renton and his friends shoot heroin, deal with drugs, become criminals or try to make their best wretched existence it seems to be so cool and funny that you won´t believe that they are social outsiders. This film shouldn´t be threaten as a social study, it is more a movie about the way of life of generation X.

"jhclues","8","0","0","12 March 2001"," Tough Film To Watch
","The effect of heroin addiction on a young man and his closest friends is explored in the hard-hitting drama, `Trainspotting,' directed by Danny Boyle.  Set in Scotland, Ewan McGregor stars as Renton, a young man to whom drugs have become a way of life; in fact, more than a `way of' life, they have `become' his life.  And a more filthy, degrading lifestyle one would be hard put to imagine.  Renton has arrived at a point wherein absolutely nothing means anything to him:  Family, friends, job, nothing.  All that matters is the next fix.  And to get it, he will do whatever it takes, including robbing, stealing or even betraying his mates.  It's a hard life, but to `Rents' the high-- even with the total loss of self esteem-- makes it all worth it; and he'll get it any way he can:  Snorting, shooting up or using suppositories.  Eventually, however, Renton's bad life gets even worse, and as he emerges on morning from has drug-induced haze, he realizes things are going to have to change.  The question is, can he do it?  Or will he even want to. 	The film is a hard look at the depths to which an addict will descend and what one will do to get that fix.  To illustrate the point, there is one graphic scene (almost too hard to watch), in which Renton, losing a couple of suppositories (they had yet to melt) through a sudden act of nature, proceeds upon realizing it to turn around and fish for them in the `filthiest toilet in Scotland.'  The scene is almost unbearable, but what an example of what it means to be in thrall to drugs.  In another scene, not quite as graphic but powerful nonetheless, Renton's parents lock him in his room and he is forced to go `cold turkey.'  And although, after the aforementioned scene this is a bit easier to watch, it is still unpleasant, but delivers a succinct message about the nature of drug addiction.	 	McGregor is well cast as Renton, as he brings a clean-cut look to the part that seems so contradictory to the lifestyle embraced by the character.  The perfect choice of all the characters through which to tell the story, Renton has a look and an attitude that convey a life that holds such promise; here is a lad with a future.  And therein lies a message in itself:  When drugs are involved, never judge a book by it's cover, for addiction is never discerning.  Most importantly, McGregor's performance is believable and he has a charismatic screen presence that makes Renton someone with whom the audience will readily be able to identify, which is necessary for the film to work.  Without that connection, much of the message of this film would be lost, but thanks to McGregor, as well as some bold moments courtesy of director Boyle, it is not. 	The supporting cast includes Ewen Bremmer (Spud), Jonny Lee Miller (Sick Boy), Kevin McKidd (Tommy), Robert Carlyle (Begbie), Kelly Macdonald (Diane) and Peter Mullan (Swanney).  One of the best anti-drug films in memory, `Trainspotting' will affect even the most jaded abuser of controlled substances, for it puts the situation into perspective and gives it context, while keeping it at (still an uncomfortable) arm's length.  It may be tough to watch, but there are lessons to be learned from it that are invaluable. A great companion feature to the more recent `Traffic,' this is a film that will no doubt have a dramatic affect on those who see it, for the images it presents will not easily be forgotten. And if this film will save even one person from learning about drugs the hard way, then it will have made the endeavor entirely worthwhile.  Be advised, this film is more educational than entertaining, and definitely an experience.  I rate this one 8/10."

","I am glad that I finally broke down and viewed Trainspotting.  Since its release in 1996, the only comments I have heard about it include terms like ""weird"", ""bizarre"", ""out-there"", and ""demented"".  Nobody really advocated it one way or the other. I thought that it might be on par with cult ""classics"" like Liquid Sky, which is easily on my 10-worst list.  I will admit that many sequences in Trainspotting appear whimsically unusual, but nothing ever deviates from the film's strong, central thrust.  Both the glamour and gore of heroin addiction are born out and inflated in such ways that the viewer can truly appreciate the characters' desperate plights--I will never forget Ewan McGregor's ""skin diving"" experience nor his withdrawal episode involving a deceased toddler.  Director Danny Boyle can be commended for his poignant use of hyperbole and caricature to drive home the extremes being experienced by this group of people and the fact that there is a glimmer of hope for them (""choose life..."")."

","This is a great adaptation of Irvine Welsh's fantastic novel.

The actors do a great job of capturing their characters and the inherent wit shines through the tense, shady and disturbing situations. Great adaptation of a stellar piece of writing. As for the book, American readers may have initial difficulty with the book as it is written in vernacular--don't let that dissuade you from finishing it, though.

Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) is a twenty-something heroin addict in Scotland. His whole philosophy is you can choose life and have to work for something impure and unfulfilling, or you can choose something else-- addiction, which in his mind is more enjoyable. He is totally ambiguous to the ones around him, which translates to a perfect ending of the film (no spoilers, don't worry).<br/><br/>He finds himself stealing, robbing, and screwing his own parents over to get every hit, but as Renton says himself ""it's never good enough"". So, it drives him into a ""full time business"".<br/><br/>Excellent acting by Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremer, Johnny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle, accompanied by a winning script by John Hodge (an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's book), and brilliant direction by Danny Boyle (paying homage to Stanely Kubrick) makes this one genius film of a film.<br/><br/>A"

","One of the most brilliant, funny and shocking movies I have ever seen. This brilliantly written movie shows the life of several junkies in a realistic yet incredibly dark humoristic way.<br/><br/>From the beginning until the end it grabs you and doesn't let go. Almost every scene could be a short movie on its own. The main character Rent is almost heroic despite the fact that he's junkie, who steals from his parents to support his drug habbit. The movie however does not glorify drug use, it gives a very grim picture of it. At some moments you actually feel like your on drugs yourself.<br/><br/>If you look at the various story lines you might conclude that it is a very sad picture that is being painted of people and life in general. And it is, it varies from drug abuse, betraying friends and family and death. However this is not the feeling that you are left with at the end of the movie. Because the themes are brought in such a sarcastic way that you can't help but see the humor in all of this.<br/><br/>As a viewer you are overwhelmed by the clever use of camera and also the music score, which guides you from sixties until today. A constant bombardement of clever dialogue, in extremely hard to follow scottish, makes this a movie that you have to see several times before you grasp all the little nuances.<br/><br/>A real must see for people who enjoy dark humor and a different look at life and who are bored with the usual hollywood no brainers!"

The truth is that this movie makes the already rather tainted world of drugs look even more unappealing and dismal. Despite its necessary gloominess, the movie is smart and moves well, although it does seem a bit long.

","Danny Boyle has made some of the best movies of the 90's with great movies like Shallow Grave, A Life Less Ordinary and this one. Trainspotting is a movie about drugs and drug-users. This is a difficult subject, mostly because it's hard to talk about it without moralizing, but this movie achieves it with class. First of all, Ewan McGregor is excellent as Rent-Boy. But the rest of the cast also shines. Robert Carlyle is great as the deranged Begbie, Jonny Lee Miller, an actor which I had never heard of before, is excellent as Sick-Boy and Ewan Bremner(another actor I had never heard of before) is perfect for the role of Spuds. And let's not forget Kevin McKidd(yet another actor I had never heard from) which gives a very sensible performance as Tommy. The dialogue is always believable(although I lost a little bit of it when I first head Begbie's accent). The movie has found the perfect balance between harsh realism and fantasy, but also the perfect balance between drama and comedy. Because, even if this movie could have been a potential downer, it is not one. It takes it subject seriously, but at the same time, who could find a movie where a man plunges into a toilet and finds himself swimming in it can be absolutely depressing? Boyle's directing is a pure pleasure, creative and dynamic, but it never goes into MTV territories, which many less talented directors would have been to with this subject and such an... amazing soundtrack. Yes, even the soundtrack is excellent(which is not really a surprise, since this is a Danny Boyle movie) and includes music by Underworld, Iggy Pop, Blur and many others. One of the few problems this movie has is that I find that it doesn't talk enough about Renton's relationship with Diane. Apart from that it's a twisted, well-acted, intelligent, sensible and at the same time energizing movie. I highly recommend it(along with Shallow Grave and A Life Less Ordinary).<br/><br/>89%"

You'll see this and much more in this film about sad and impossible to like guys. And that is why I simply hated the film.

","One of the cult-movies made in the nineties, often compared (a bit wrongly) to ""A Clockwork Orange"" (1971), ""Trainspotting "" is the revelation of a new talented director: Danny Boyle. If his previous movie ""Shallow Grave"" (1994) was not accepted unanimously, ""Trainspotting"" was critically praised and made a beautiful commercial way, notably in Great-Britain.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle's opus is served by a galaxy of actors who are all outstanding (Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle at head) and whose characters are well-rounded. Moreover, McGregor's voice-over makes the movie more thrilling. It is to be noted that if Boyle perfectly used this device in ""Trainspotting"" it will not be the case four years later with Leonardo Di Caprio in ""The Beach"" (2000).<br/><br/>Then, we deal with a dramatic story, it is indisputable but it is told on a comedy tone so as to avoid the movie to fall in absolute horror and the sordid and of course, this is often black humor that prevails.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" confirms Boyle's master of the directing too. Nevertheless, it includes faults that spoil somewhat the movie. For example, this one, by moments evokes a clip. Besides, in connection with music, there is an excellent original soundtrack even if sometimes we feel that its constant and discreet use surcharges the movie. On another hand, through Mark's trouble with heroin, this is a realistic vision of a British society undermined by unemployment in the eighties. Even if the last movie is full of optimism, it nonetheless remains ambiguous. Indeed, as Mark walks on the bridge and enumerates the things he will know, the picture becomes increasingly blurred. It probably means that Mark's future will not probably be bright...<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" is a vivid, sometimes raw movie (the sequences that involves heroin) but never boring.

","Trainspotting remains in style faithful to the book by Irvine Welsh, but sometimes deviates from it. For example the end is very different because here Renton comes out clean and 'normal' but in the book he stays on to be a junkie. The movie has the same punk-like edgy form as the book and is well translated to screen: Fast edited sequences, it radiates energy, breaks its own form (fantasy elements), cultural landscapes changing and even a balanced view on drugs. The many excrement scenes are not for everybody's taste, but shows only the filth sometimes associated with drug use.<br/><br/>The characters are rather unbelievable as junkies. Here they remain clean-shaven, relatively fresh-looking, social and to an extent trustworthy people, where real users have the opposite characteristics. And the sometimes beautiful, long sentences coming out of the mouths of some characters being linguistically deprived are not very believable either. But the ""Choose Life""-voice over narration in the beginning is still great.<br/><br/>It has intelligent storytelling, for example how AIDS is first introduced by means of the quiz and the fact that Renton in one scene already puts his passport in a locker.

The film has them giddily robbing people of their possessions – but a lot of addicts also sell their bodies (maybe several times a day) to get their drug money.

I had known about this film for a while, thinking it was something akin to other 1990s crime comedies like Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels or The Big Lebowski. In retrospect I suppose that was a bit naive. Trainspotting is often described as a comedy but while it has comedic elements to it the film felt much more like a drama/surreal fever dream. While such imagery would usually remind me of David Lynch the aforementioned comedic elements and the presence of illicit drugs reminded me more of Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas. Francis Bacon in particular was cited as an influence and it makes sense. Dealing with the harsh realities of drug addiction the film certainly wasn't pleasant and kind of hard to watch in parts. But these aren't appealing themes. Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) our protagonist narrates to us his difficulties with social pressure (to get off drugs), shots of the Edinburgh drug scene into which he is immersed, the degradation of his life on drugs, his unreliable friends, and the perceived mediocrity and boredom of life without drugs. As a result, while I can't relate to many of Renton's issues I can still empathize, even though he makes plenty of bad decisions that continue to drive him into a hole. Marking down an opinion then is difficult. While more gritty (and even depressing) than I expected it to be Trainspotting is still enjoyable and you can't say it's not a good movie."

And I ended up enjoying the style of the movie.<br/><br/>The script follows the marginal trajectory of a group of young people from the Scottish suburbs. Everyone, in one way or another, is linked to heavy drug use and crime. And everyone, one way or another, pays for it. Thought of as a light film, it is more serious than it looks and addresses strong themes in an innovative and intelligent way. Contrary to popular belief, the film is not a comedy at all, nor is it a favorable view of the drug world. Quite the opposite. The movie is much more serious, there are truly tragic moments (such as the dying baby, almost symbolizing all innocents, suffering and indirect victims of the drug, by the hands of those who get involved and addicted to the drug) and a clear anti-drug message. drugs by showing how each young person suffers the consequences: years in prison, death ... Although drug use is clearly shown to be recreational in the movie, and the characters take pleasure in the drugs, the movie also shows how their lives (and those of people who love them) are ruined by addiction.<br/><br/>The characters are complex and intense. Each has its own characteristics and psychological profile. The dialogues are excellent and the use of a Scottish accent carried by Scottish actors gives it some authenticity and originality. Ewan McGregor got his springboard here for well-deserved stardom, and he might not have been the renowned actor he is today if he had not participated in this movie. With a controversial and unpleasant character, he is the star of the movie. Along with him, a number of actors who each had their own opportunity and talent to shine: Ewen Bremner, Robert Carlyle, Kevin McKidd, Kelly Macdonald, Jonny Lee Miller ... there's room for each to stand out at the right times, and I believe that their careers have taken full advantage of this.<br/><br/>Technically, the movie is flawless.

","As someone who has never done drugs, I have no way to know what the experience of being high on heroin or cocaine is like. Fortunately, I don't have to do these drugs to get an understanding of the sensation. In the early years of film, most movies about drugs were usually cautionary tales (as was the case for Reefer Madness (1936)). By the ""free-loving"" decades of the 1960's and 1970's, drugs were more acceptable but often were seen in a comedic context (a la ""Cheech & Chong"").<br/><br/>The societal excess of the 1980's and 1990's beget an epedemic of harder drugs like heroin and cocaine. Consequently, we started to see more films that would glamorize drug use, but would still show the consequences of extended use of these harder drugs. Perhaps the most famous film that fits in this category is the hard-to-watch Requiem for a Dream (2000), which really played up the ""consequences"" part. A few years before this film, though, was Trainspotting (1996).<br/><br/>While Trainspotting was less intense than Requiem for a Dream, they both had stunning visuals to help the audience understand the drug experience. Sure, there are similarly horrifying elements of Trainspotting, including the worst toilet in Scotland and a ceiling-crawling baby, but they are mostly cancelled out by the more ""fun"" sequences. At the very least, Trainspotting seems to succeed via its main protagonist Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor, in an early role) putting forth the effort to get clean instead of always succumbing to his heroin addiction. That's not to say the film doesn't glamorize these drugs by adding in the counterpoints of sex and rock and roll, but at least there's an effort to have a bit of a moral at the end.<br/><br/>An entertaining look into the experiences of drug addicts, I give Trainspotting 4.0 stars out of 5."

That something as simple as heroin could, allegedly, replace any conventional pursuit of dopamine and higher purpose; the job, the car, the family, the greater good.
Heroin is just simplifying human pursuits and endeavors down to the single point of a needle, the needle we have been looking for in the haystack, the basic chemical that compels human activity and purpose; drug addict Mark Renton asks why we should complicate that pursuit.<br/><br/>""I chose not to choose life. I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?""<br/><br/>The very title of the film ""Trainspotting"" confronts the fact that human life and fulfillment could be seen as entirely subjective, i.e. the seemingly pointless and mind-numbing hobby of train spotting: Those who are ""trainspotters"" make an effort to ""spot"" all of a certain type of rolling stock. This might be a particular class of locomotive, a particular type of carriage or all the rolling stock of a particular company. To this end, they collect and exchange detailed information about the movements of locomotives and other equipment on the railway network, and become very knowledgeable about its operations.

They chose their life, the needle and they don't regret it. The film does not glorify drugs in any way, most of the viewers will find many scenes disturbing, dirty and not pleasant at all. It won't be easy to watch, but it's not meant to shock, the scenes make perfect sense in context of the story, showing life of day to day heroin addicts.<br/><br/>Without any certain plot development and chaotic storytelling, the film still takes you along the rollercoaster ride of Edinburghs aesthetics and terrifying truth of drug addiction with the help of Mark Rentons narration and portrayal of that times youth. The decision to become clean and get rid of the addiction was not an easy one for Renton, but how much your surroundings, so-called friends(basically, the only thing in common between them was heroin) can affect you sometimes and get back on the path you just rejected.<br/><br/>The structure of the film makes a circular plot. In the beginning Renton denies choosing life, being a normal person, he chooses not to choose, he chooses heroin.

","This movie has a reputation as an unpleasant experience. And I'd have to say for a reason. Yet what often goes unmentioned is the fact that this movie is quite often classified as a black comedy. Again, for a reason.<br/><br/>The story tells of a group of Scottish youngsters struggling through life despite their crippling addiction to heroin and other hard substances. We see them throughout the course of a perhaps a few years. Their highs and their frequent lows. Yet despite all this misery in their lives, they retain a surprisingly chipper attitude about life. They crack jokes, they talk in their thick Scottish accents, they have parties. Yet just beneath the surface, the heroin tightens its grip.<br/><br/>And it's not like director Danny Boyle wants to glorify or romanticize drug use. No, it's still clear that these people have ruined their lives and those around them through their awful life choices. But the movie argues the point that these people are not stupid. There's a reason why people use drugs. Quite often they are the symptom of a life gone wrong rather than the cause.<br/><br/>Very much a movie not for everyone. But, if you can stomach all those nasty scenes, the movie does have a story to tell. A good one and one excellently told."

I had a level of misunderstanding when watching this film, half of that being my complete ignorance to the drug world and the other half being my inability to understand thick Scottish accents when it counts.
Not to say these are flaws of the film, by no means, however I did feel that the full effect of the film as a result was lost on me.

","In the aftermath of ""Pulp Fiction"", much of the filmmaking of the 1990s thrived upon attempts to appear ""edgy"" within the constructs of independent films, or merely to provide empty shock value clichés. And no film ever came close to the sheer cleverness of Tarantino's masterpiece.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"", however, somehow manages to take the excesses of the mid-90s and rise far, far above the cinematic clichés that it easily could have become. A film that tackles any hot-button social issue can, and usually does, simply become a didactic propaganda piece. Thankfully, ""Trainspotting"" is vastly more intelligent in its edginess and its shock.<br/><br/>In order to appreciate ""Trainspotting"" fully, the viewer must abandon any preconceptions about what defines truly great cinema, because this film defies convention at nearly every turn. And with the rapid pace of its plot, that's quite a bit of ground to cover.<br/><br/>Though a great deal of the picture's brilliance is derived from director Danny Boyle's consistent rejection of typical cinematic techniques, the most satisfying and ""best"" aspect of ""Trainspotting"" is that Boyle creates a film that is neither pro-drug or anti-drug. Instead, he maintains a rare objectivity throughout the film, depicting this fascinating array of complex, beautifully acted characters with an honesty that it seldom captured on film. And, given the life that each character lives, it's nearly incomprehensible that a director would refrain from influencing the viewer's impressions in any way, yet that's exactly what Boyle does.<br/><br/>The dialogue-- or at least what portions of the brogue-drenched dialogue American viewers will be able to comprehend-- is alternately hilarious, raw, and brutal. And Ewan McGregor, Jonny Lee Miller, and Robert Carlyle bring a remarkable compassion and depth to their portrayals of characters that could have easily lapsed into cliché.<br/><br/>Despite its sheer brilliance, Trainspotting is not a film that's easy to watch. The viewer is bombarded with images that transcend visceral discomfort in their horror-- this movie contains two of the most graphic, horrifying scenes. But, amazingly, none of these elements is used merely for shock value. Though the viewer will be mortified by some of the things that happen on screen-- the well-documented dive into Scotland's most vile public toilet, for example-- these scenes all make ""perfect sense"" within the context of a masterfully told story.<br/><br/>In order to notice all of the subtlety that also exists in Trainspotting, repeat viewings are necessary, primarily to reduce some of the most powerful shocks ever-so-slightly, though their effects are never lost entirely. Some of the images will likely haunt even the most cynical, jaded viewer for weeks.<br/><br/>Never patronizing and completely unpretentious, Trainspotting is one of the most daring, unconventional films ever made. It inspires a level of discomfort rivaled by very few movies, because, even at its most graphic, Boyle never insults the viewer with mere shock tactics. Brilliantly acted, directed, and written, with a truly rare objectivity that allows each viewer to interpret its story on his/her own terms.<br/><br/>Excerpt from ""Movies that Moved with Prakash Silwal https://www.facebook.com/ektafilmsnp/"

","This film is a milestone in the lives of many people. For those of that 'Chemical Generation' as we were dubbed back then, this film had a huge impact in so many ways that current generations will find it hard to understand. This was before the internet boom, we went to stores to buy records and books.<br/><br/>This film was a shot in the arm for British culture building on a high with the indie Britpop cultural phenomenon, and this film just slotted in perfectly. It is a story of a group of young hedonistic heroin addicts plus a sociopath, centring around Ewan McGregor's character Renton. All are selfish in their own ways, but in their cul-de-sac, they are trapped in their personal hells, and heroin is their only escape as well as a trap.<br/><br/>Unlike the book, which I've read, this film is clearly anti-heroin, but it doesn't force it down your throat like some corny government advice advert. This film shows the grim reality of their world, but also shines the torch to show the humanity and humour too. As a viewer, despite any repulsion, you will actually begin to empathise with some of the characters regardless of whether they are truly loathsome or not to you.<br/><br/>The underlying themes are what gives it all gravitas. Do the 'friends' really trust each other, are they really their own enemies? Despite desires to escape the vicious heroin circles, do those attempting to do so actually want to? The film reflects on blue-collar life, perceived hopelessness, depression and fear, but also fantasy, love and hope.<br/><br/>These are all themes when you are young and still developing that really come to the fore. This film captures these emotions brilliantly, with an incredible soundtrack that has stayed with me for life. To the average Briton from the 1990's, the soundtrack to this film is as much a stamp on those times as Oasis and Blur.<br/><br/>I'm writing this having just watched the sequel, and rewatched the original. The whole film still stands up now, but as I'm older it has still a great power and hold, and different themes come out to me. I'm admittedly a major Trainspotting devotee, having read all the Trainspotting books to date, and just re-read the original after 20 years. It all still holds up brilliantly, and the film still works its magic.<br/><br/>For Scots this film has huge resonance, and it is only now after so many years that you can feel the impact that a certain rant in the film by the main character had on the country. It also brought Scottish culture to the fore, which at the time was going through a renaissance with some great writing, film work and music being generated. The influence culturally from this film has been great, and there are many parts of the film that Scots will recognise most keenly. <br/><br/>I would heartily recommend this film to anyone, especially teenagers and those in their early 20s. Read the books too, this film got youth back into reading again. Hugely influential.<br/><br/>You'll learn a lot, and you'll revisit this film. It will always be in the hearts first and foremost of the 'Chemical Generation' but I hope it will also touch the hearts and minds of following generations too.<br/><br/>Give it a go, it will give you a Lust for Life."

","""Trainspotting"" – The knockabout 1996 heroin-addict ensemble piece which put Danny Boyle and Ewan McGregor on the map, immortalised Irvine Welsh's bestselling novel and proved a shot in the arm for 1990's British Cinema and it's greatest creation.<br/><br/>It is the 1996 British black comedy-drama film which starred Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle, and Kelly Macdonald. A classic which underwent the direction of Danny Boyle, the narration of Ewan McGregor and a screenplay by John Hodge based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh — resulting in an unexpected pop culture phenomenon, defining not only the 90's generation but setting the future tone for British Film Institute as well. It's a film that made British cinema seem exciting again and restored its golden period rather than a fusty factory of period dramas which was ongoing for half a decade. And it became a classic that is still being talked about today, with a sequel finally on the way in less than a month. It is often described as black comedy, but I would liken it more to a drama with a crude, dark sense of humour. Trainspotting is the rare drug addiction-tale to tackle serious material without taking itself too seriously.<br/><br/>Although set in Edinburgh, almost all of the film was shot in Glasgow, apart from the opening scenes, which were shot in Edinburgh, and the final scenes which were shot in London. The film showcases the misadventures of mainly five young men in Edinburgh trying to find their way out of joblessness, aimlessness to aimless relationships and relentless drug addiction. Some are successful, while others hopelessly are not. The title, ""Trainspotting"" is a metaphor. The ""Trans- Potters"" are people playing a kind of game is to watch the trains go all day and record their numbers. This game is synonymous with boredom and from all forms of addictive or compulsive activity, so you can make a comparison with the drug. But the metaphor can also represent, as Renton sees trains to take, opportunities to stop the drugs and leave his friends, but he does nothing, except at the end where he took his chance and chose the train (of life). The film's story-line eventually divulges into an epic tale of struggle with both addiction and poverty through the lives of these young drug users or heroin addicts, trying to make their own journeys.<br/><br/>Renton, a pro heroin-addict, played by McGregor is the main protagonist. He is also the narrator as the film centres around his life and the scuffles he undergoes with addiction. Although he eventually wants to change his life and quit heroin. But his willpower gets caught in between his junk habit and his never-ending lust for one final shot before he'd quit or can finally quit. He believes: when you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring. Human relationships and all the other things really don't matter when you've got a sincere and truthful junk habit.<br/><br/>All the characters in this film, apart from Renton are also well defined and have very specific characteristics. However, they share the same idea: to escape society's rules by taking drugs, each in his own way. They refuse to integrate the universal mode and the consumer society, much more despaired than they are. This aversion is clearly shown by the image of the parents of Renton, leading a sordid life and bouffant of entertainment in their pathetic homes. Mark, Spud and Sick Boy choose drugs to touch the bottom, that is to say, the sense of life.<br/><br/>McGregor is more than ably abetted by a superb supporting cast, including Jonny Lee Miller as suave, Byronesque sociopath Sick Boy, Robert Carlyle as snarling, repressed, hard-drinking psychopath Begbie, and Ewen Bremner as the endearingly inept Spud. Their behaviour towards one another is often deplorable, but the film is propelled by an underlying sense of camaraderie. As critic Roger Ebert so astutely observed at the time: ""The reason there is a fierce joy in Trainspotting, despite the appalling things that happen in it, is that it's basically about friends in need.""<br/><br/>The actual theme of the film was rather simple. Friends are your companions through bad times and good times as they say but with Renton's situation, these friends are actually an option. Would you take them or not? Being comfortable and at ease with your friends is good as long as we know our limitations because friends can't always prank you on what's on their minds."

","T1 (if the sequel is called T2, than it's logical to call it that, no?) is now 21 years old. Even in America it's allowed to do anything in any state. Then again with the president they have at the moment anything is possible anyway. But back to this, which is as raw, tough and mental as you may remember it.<br/><br/>I still haven't read the book this is based on, but the movie really lives up to the hype. If you haven't seen it yet, I reckon a double bill with the sequel is about to happen. It's actually something you should treat yourself with. And I'm saying this a day before going into the second movie, but anticipations could not be much higher. Than again, riffing on ""Terminator"" with the T2 title shortening is a rather clever marketing plot. It also tells us: we will deliver a great sequel. And I believe they will. Will they be able to shock as they did with a couple of scenes in this one? That will be hard, especially a scene with a baby, the infamous toilet scene and much more is tough to beat ... which makes this such a great movie. A must see, if you don't mind anarchic over the top stories. That are aware of their moral obligations, but not preaching too much"

","This is one of, if not my favourite film of all time. Set in Edinburgh in Scotland, the movie hits close to home as I was born nearby in a city called Glasgow, so any and all landmarks mentioned in this film I have a personal attachment to. Given the sensitive nature of the main conflict in the film, and the fact that the aforementioned issue was a real life, and rather large issue in Edinburgh and Glasgow, and throughout Scotland during the 1980's and 1990's, it sends a really strong message about what abuse can do to a person and their relationships. This, mixed in with a fair dose of both light and dark humour make it one of the best films of all time in my humble opinion."

","Dear Danny Boyle, <br/><br/>you did a great job adapting Irvine Welsh's book. Welsh himself was very happy with your film. He remarked that he did not want a film that only a few bores would want to watch. And that it had to be made in a certain way and you understood this. The film incorporated nearly every single character in the book. Except for Second Prize of course. <br/><br/>The editing deserves special mention. Especially the part where the amatory exertions of the three couples are interwoven together. You managed to say a large chunk of the story in a few minutes through some great cutting. I also loved the way you used music to move the story forward. The film began with a bang with the three junkies running to Iggy Pop's Lust for Life. The use of Perfect Day by Lou Reed during Renton's breakdown was also brilliant. <br/><br/>The performances were extraordinary. Did you notice that Woody Allen cast Ewen Mcgregor, Ewen Bremmer and John Lee Miller in his movies after Trainspotting released? Robert Carlyle, Kelly McDonald, Peter Mullan and Kevin McKidd deserve special mention. <br/><br/>It is one of those films where you feel like the characters are your best friends. You feel sad when the film ends. You got everything right, Danny. Looking forward to Porno now. <br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin. <br/><br/>(10/10)"

","Trainspotting opens with the main character, Mark Renton, running away from the cops and it doesn't let up from there. The motif here is that the film begins with Mark Renton (literally) running away from responsibility, and that is practically what he is doing for the rest of the film. His (and his friends') way of doing this is by using heroin. At first, the film shows us the good parts of using the drug and describes why one would use it (""Take the best orgasm you've ever had and multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it), but the film progressively gets darker to show us the consequences of the drug, but without ever losing its energy and dark sense of humor. <br/><br/>Most of the main characters in the film are not by any means good people, and they know they are not good people, but they are people regardless and each character is well rounded and believable. They are also incredibly well played by everyone in the cast, the most impressive performance obviously being Ewan Mcgregor's performance as Mark Renton. They know what they are doing to themselves when they use the drug, yet they still use it because of the good parts of the drug, which is why the film is so effective in showing the viewer why he or she shouldn't use the drug, even once.<br/><br/>This is a very stylish film, but it isn't stylish without a purpose. The film uses its camera work and editing to put the viewer in the mind of a character that is on drugs, and to great effect. The soundtrack is worth noting as well; every song is used perfectly in its context, my favorite moment being when Mark overdoses and ""Perfect Day"" by Louis Reef begins playing to show Mark's relationship to heroin, even in his lowest moment (also, the editing and camera work from Mark's point of view in that scene was perfect, you'll know what I'm talking about if you've seen it).<br/><br/>Trainspotting is gross, sad, and dirty, while it is simultaneously energetic, entertaining, and funny. Pretty much all of the characters are bad people but they're also incredibly fun to watch. So if you're looking for a movie to watch, I have 2 words for you: choose Trainspotting"

Overall this movie was pretty good, but my expectations were higher. Little tip: don't watch this movie with your family, or better, if you want to (or have to) watch it with them, just pay attention to how this movie shows the negative side of drugs, which in my opinion isn't something every movie shows.

I like the book, but I like how the movie was able to distill it into a linear narrative (it's still a bit episodic, but they did a great job). The casting is a miracle--every one of the principles went from complete unknowns to big projects. I especially like the dialog full of slang and regional quirks. I have sought out everything by the Irvine Welsh, and enjoyed all his books. This is exactly my sense of humor. I appreciate how they take things to the extreme.

","The quintessential British film, perfectly depicting the mundane, inner city lives of a group of addicts as they struggle with their addictions and the fear of surrendering to a normal existence. Both the grimness and the perks of heroin are captured exquisitely by Boyle, as he shows the ups and the terrible downs of an unshakable addiction. Trainspotting is truly unforgettable, with 5 characters that will stick in your mind. You want to spend time and get to know Sick Boy and Begbie despite them being utter scumbags, which is one of the film's main triumphs. This film is sure to go down as one of Britain's best, and Danny Boyle's finest work. It's just too bad Ewan McGregor's never better this role."

He chases after Diane Coulston (Kelly Macdonald) from the club but he finds out that she's underage after sleeping with her. The guys go back to doing heroin. Even Tommy starts doing it after dumped by his girlfriend for losing the sex tape.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle gives a flashy, densely-packed, dark and hilarious vision of the drug life.

I don't know if I know how to react to it, but I can tell you this much, as disturbing as this movie is, with all the disturbing themes it tackles, it also has behind it, a wonderful central performance from Ewan McGregor, brilliant direction, a tightly tied together plot which does not drag, and brilliant music choices.<br/><br/>The best scene in the movie is Ewan McGregor locked in a room, detoxing as he sees visions around him, it's well done with brilliant music supported by brilliant acting and directing.<br/><br/>Is it disgusting? I think it is. But I think beyond it's disgusting veneer lies a beautiful film which explores admirably the themes of being an addict, and how that affects you, and just how hard it is breaking out.<br/><br/>If you really like trains though and actually indulge in actual 'trainspotting' (which is a real hobbie), don't expect any of that in this movie, but what you do get is quite brilliant."

With ""Requiem For a Dream"", the end was clearly against heroin. Here, it is a bit more ambiguous, because the characters have so much fun.

"brando647","8","1","2","26 June 2014"," I Can See Why TRAINSPOTTING is a Modern Classic
","I've found that, the more I watch Danny Boyle's TRAINSPOTTING, the more I enjoy it. I'll admit that I wasn't blown away when I first watched it, but I imagine that's because it became a victim of its own hype. Boyle's sophomore directing effort has got a major cult following and I've heard plenty of praise from some of my more film- obsessed friends. I didn't actually see it until a month or so ago and, while I enjoyed it, I wasn't sure why it was such a big deal. So I gave it some time to sink in, then went back and rewatched it again recently and fared a little better. Maybe it was the thick Scottish accents making dialogue difficult to follow at times or the retro nineties vibe, but it didn't sit well originally and a second viewing let me get past all that and enjoy it. TRAINSPOTTING follows some Edinburgh hood-rats living the junkie life and going where it takes them. There's Renton (Ewan McGregor), persistently on the verge of going clean and giving up his hedonist lifestyle; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a schemer and troublemaker with an encyclopedic knowledge of 007; Spud (Ewen Bremner), dopey and loyal to his mates; Tommy (Kevin McKidd), the smart one who seems capable of maintaining a (mostly) mature relationship and knows enough to keep away from the heroin habit his friends have sunken into; and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a drunken psychopath who abhors his friends' love for heroin but doesn't mind putting a glass mug through some poor random pub patron's face.<br/><br/>Poor Ewan McGregor. The first thought that comes to mind when his name is mentioned is the unfortunate STAR WARS prequels, foregoing the fact that the man obviously has loads more talent. His character, Renton, is the film's closest thing to a protagonist. We follow him from the depths of addiction through the struggle of going clean and trying to lead a normal life. Sure, he makes some stupid choices over the course of the film but you can't help but cheer him on. The kid's got charisma. Most of them do actually, despite being somewhat despicable human beings. I found myself feeling sort of sorry for Spud. He didn't strike me as the sharpest knife in the drawer but he was loyal to a fault. He was the only one in the crew that didn't seem to have an ounce of trouble in him (that wasn't injected intravenously anyway). Begbie's a royal trip. Carlyle is absolutely great, when you can understand him. I needed subtitles at times to get through the thick Scot accent but he was funniest part of the movie. The man's a powder keg and it doesn't take much to light his fuse. Sure, he hates heroin and gives his friends (rightfully) a hard time for their addiction but he's got more than enough flaws himself. He's violent, over-confidant, and possibly compensating for something. Sick Boy's the bad apple in the bunch. He's a man who relishes the junkie life and has little regard for those around him. And, finally, there's Tommy. Tommy doesn't fit well within the rest of the crew, as he seems to have some humanity in him. Tommy's character in the movie seems to exist solely to remind the audience that, as funny as the movie may be at times, heroin addiction is no joke and he serves as an example in his fall from ""normal"" to, well, that'd be a spoiler.<br/><br/>TRAINSPOTTING may be a comedy (and a dark one, at that) but it doesn't shy away from its subject matter. Heroin is a plague in the world and it's claiming new victims all the time. The laughs from the crew's heroin-fueled antics are often interrupted with reality checks to serve as a reminder of the consequences. A junkie mother pays the ultimate price for her obsession. Spud serves time after a little harmless shoplifting with his buddies to feed their habit. Renton discovers the full extent of the withdrawal experience. And Tommy, well, just watch the movie if you've never seen it. TRAINSPOTTING is right up there with Darren Aronofsky's REQIUEM FOR A DREAM as a movie that serves to dissuade any fools out there from finding glamour in the life of drug addiction. Despite the laughs, it's an effective PSA about the dangers of heroin abuse.<br/><br/>I've seen the movie a few times now and I'm still ready to back for more. I've come to understand why TRAINSPOTTING has got the reputation it does as a ""must-see"" film. It's equal parts fun and cringe inducing. It's a solid character film that established Boyle as a major cinematic talent and led McGregor down the dark path to something far worse than heroin: George Lucas' STAR WARS prequels. Kidding, of course. Heroin sucks."

As others have said this is about humanity and endeavour rising above inequality and hardship. The setting and circumstance provides the background but this is about human well being and aspiration. It is both depressing in parts but overall quite uplifting. A morality story overall.<br/><br/>Everything about the film shines be it the acting, the character dynamics, the story line etc. I apologise to my American friends, but only the British can do this stuff really well, the Godfather trilogy excepted. Trainspotting, along with Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and In Bruges should be in every collectors DVD collection. And as I said, Ewan McGregor is trffic."

","To me, there is nothing I have seen that comes closer to a perfect film as Trainspotting does. Not a single scene is wasted, which is a difficult task when you're telling a story about character first and plot second. No other film mixes substance and style so effectively. In fact, there is no real line between the two.<br/><br/>Above all, we are made to sympathize with Renton. He's an addict, a liar, and a person whose lifestyle results in the death of innocents. He's also smart as they come and, perhaps ironically, the moral centre of the story. Lots is currently being made of the literary ""anti- hero"", but I'm sure Danny Boyle and certainly Irvine Welsh had no formal conception of this Americanized creature. Mark Renton is compelling because he is the best we've got. In the story's universe of tragically early burnouts and psychopaths, can you imagine anyone better?"

"Desertman84","10","1","2","19 October 2012"," The Horrors Of Drug Use
","Trainspotting is a British black comedy film directed by Danny Boyle based on the novel of the same title by Irvine Welsh, who played hapless drug dealer Mikey Forrester, and starring Ewan McGregor, Ewen Bremner, Jonny Lee Miller, Kevin McKidd, Robert Carlyle and Kelly Macdonald. The story follows a group of heroin addicts in a late 1980's economically depressed area of Edinburgh and their passage through life. The Academy Award nominated screenplay, by John Hodge, was adapted from Welsh's novel. Beyond drug addiction, other concurrent themes in the film are exploration of the urban poverty and squalor in ""culturally rich"" Edinburgh.<br/><br/>Mark Renton, a young man with few prospects and fewer ambitions, lives in economically depressed Edinburgh. Like most of his friends, Renton is a heroin addict who loves the drug's blissful nothingness; financing his habit also provides excitement and challenges that his life otherwise lacks. Renton's two best friends are also junkies: Sick Boy, a snappy dresser obsessed with James Bond, and Spud, a guileless nerd who suggests Pee Wee Herman's debauched cousin. Renton and his pals also hang out with Begbie, a borderline psychotic who loathes junkies even though he drinks like a fish. After one too many brushes with the law, Renton kicks heroin and moves to London, where he finds a job, a flat, and something close to peace of mind. However, Sick Boy, Begbie, and Spud all arrive at his doorstep on the trail of a big score, leading Renton back into drugs and crime.<br/><br/>THE experience of watching Trainspotting -- the electric, nasty and slick descent into the milieu of young Scottish junkies -- is a little like speeding through the digestive tract of some voracious beast.It has been attacked as pro-drug and defended as anti-drug, but actually it is simply pragmatic. It knows that addiction leads to an unmanageable, exhausting, intensely uncomfortable daily routine, and it knows that only two things make it bearable.A brutal, often times funny, other times terrifying portrayal of drug addiction in Edinburgh. Not for the faint of heart, but well worth viewing as a realistic and entertaining reminder of the horrors of drug use."
"aalok-joshi123","10","1","2","15 June 2012"," Brilliant!
","As I watched the first 40 minutes of Trainspotting ... I was disgusted and rightfully so. This movie is dirty, sad and disgusting. It gets to the nitty gritty of drug addiction. Now I cant say whether Heroin addiction is really like that or not but the way it was portrayed truly showed how horrible an addiction like that can be. The camera work in this movie is excellent but the true winning part of the movie comes at the end. The end scene is one of the most suspenseful scenes I have ever seen in my life. That one scene turns around a primarily sad and dirty movie and makes this movie worth the wait.<br/><br/>My advice would be not to give up on this movie halfway or a quarter through. Watch the whole thing! As mentioned before the camera work is excellent and the acting is out of this world. The way that heroin addicts are portrayed in acting is nothing short of extraordinary! Ewan McGregor shows us with his body how his character is struggling with his addiction Overall this movie is a must watch for anybody who can take a dirty and gloomy movie and is ready to wait for the brilliant end!"

","'Trainspotting' is a bold and audacious film by British director Danny Boyle which launched the career of then unknown actor Ewan McGregor. The day-to-day struggle of a group pf heroin addicts in Edinburgh could never be told so stylishly and clever, equipped with both big laughs and horrific images. It doesn't judge it's characters and their addictions, just portrays them as what they are: young people without a clue as to what direction they're heading down in life. There's no good guys and bag guys, it doesn't play out like a PSA, and each character is well developed and multy-dimensional.

"Red_Identity","Null","1","2","12 May 2011"," Extremely ambitious but hard to watch....
","Trainspotting is a fast-paced, uncomfortable, and very ambitious film about the heroin addiction of Mark Renton.<br/><br/>Boyle is a great director and I have thought that of him for some time now. His films 28 Days Later, Slumdog Millionaire, and 127 Hours' strengths lie on his ability to conjure up real excitement and passion, and it always comes across perfectly. His direction is needed in this fast-paced script. The dialogue is pretty brilliant, and there is a lot of it, so a lot of it may pass over you without even knowing it. However, it's pace allows it to always be entertaining. The film is darkly funny, but it also disturbed me and made me feel uncomfortable in a way, especially in the most brutal scenes. <br/><br/>I am noting that this is actually not an actual review, but at at this moment I don't have enough strength in me to write an actual review of the film. I don't think anything should really be talked about in terms of plot, and in a way time will be needed for me to fully grasp it. Surely recommended."
"brandon_5303","10","1","2","9 April 2011"," Not Just a ""Drug Movie""
","I don't much care for drug movies. The majority of them are far too extreme toward one side or the other: glorifying or demonizing drugs. Take for example ""Scarface"" (drugs will give you the strength to take on an entire army of would-be assassins before a coward finally gets you from behind) or ""Requiem For a Dream"" (drugs will make you lose your arm, go to prison, wind up in a mental hospital, and/or perform carnal acts to satisfy your heroin addiction). That being said, I consider ""Trainspotting"" to be the first of these so-called ""drug movie"" to find moderation. Yes, Renton and friends do find themselves in drug filled euphoria in some scenes, but for every good time, there is also bad. The characters go through changes and are hardly recognizable by the end. All in all Danny Boyle did a magnificent job directing this film, John Hodge did the same adapting it, and Ewan McGregor and co. did amazingly portraying it. 10/10"
"Red-Barracuda","10","1","2","4 February 2011"," Choose Trainspotting....
","The novel from which Trainspotting was adapted is one of the most exhilarating reads I have ever had. Savage, hilarious, disgusting, authentic and wise, Irvine Welsh's book was almost a cultural phenomenon in itself back in the day. It didn't seem like the kind of novel that could be transferred to the screen though seeing as its fragmented narrative was essentially a collection of short stories, albeit interconnected ones. We needn't have worried though as the film version of Trainspotting was a dynamic instant classic and one of the best British films for years.<br/><br/>The story is about the goings on surrounding a group of Edinburgh youths. Most of them exist in the heroin scene which was deeply prevalent in the city back in the 1980's. In might seem hard to believe now but back in those days Edinburgh was known as the Aids Capital of Europe as a result of the problems caused by the widespread heroin use. So the book Trainspotting evolved from a very real place. Where the novel itself is very much no-holds barred in its approach, the film most certainly presents events in a far more palatable light, although it does retain the spirit and the humour. Nevertheless, the film version is hardly a tame film itself; there are a number of pretty heavy scenes and it can be very uncompromising.<br/><br/>Director Danny Boyle and screen-writer John Hodge have to be given enormous credit for the success of this feature. Where Hodge selected material from Welsh's terrific prose exceptionally skilfully, Boyle then tied it altogether in a fast-paced movie that he has ensured has a real inertia from start to finish. Happily the film-making approach taken isn't the sadly predictable one all too often taken by British film-makers: gritty social-realism. No, Trainspotting takes an altogether more stylized approach and one that uses the cinematic medium a lot more interestingly, and it's all the better for it. The acting is universally exceptional, with particular stand-out turns from Ewan Macgregor, Jonny Lee Miller, Ewen Bremner and Robert Carlyle. It looks terrific too, and the soundtrack perfectly captures the mood with its clever selection of songs from the likes of Iggy Pop, Lou Reed and Underworld.<br/><br/>This surely is a must see movie and one I really can only highly recommend."
"JakePFC","10","1","2","19 January 2011"," Simply brilliant
","The more I think about Trainspotting, the more I consider it as close to perfection as I've seen. I was probably 17 when I watched it, and it captivated me until the very end.<br/><br/>It's possibly the only film I've ever watched that has truly shocked me, where my heart has genuinely stopped at certain revelations in the film. It somehow balances the truly dark and gritty nature of its subject matter with a peculiarly upbeat feel.<br/><br/>There's a reality about this film and its characters that makes it totally believable. For example, everybody is at least aware of someone as unpleasant as Begbie, and it's uncomfortable to watch his callous behaviour throughout. To me, that's how it should be.<br/><br/>It goes without saying that McGregor is fantastic, and Boyle's trademark of a superb soundtrack is as present in this film as any other. It's a classic that, for those of us who never really experienced the drug subculture of that time, is still a fascinating and incredible film."

","the film Trainspotting has been argued by critics to be 'glamourising' drug use and being a bad influence on teenagers, however, being a 16 year old teenager myself, i did not find myself wanting to go out and start taking heroin, in fact, this film made me realise i never want to be involved in drug use. the film shows the taking of drugs as what it really is; dirty, dangerous and illegal. however don't think this film is completely depressing, it is also very comical and entertaining because we sympathise with the main character and laugh and moan at his mistakes as the film progresses. all in all a very good film well worth watching but also a very thought provoking film."
"teardrop-diamond","Null","1","2","8 November 2010"," 'Living like this is a full-time business.'
","Irvine Welsh's Trainspotting is a novel born of the dirt and grit it depicts. Disturbing and violent at times and explicit on all counts, it would have been a tough story to film had Danny Boyle not gotten a hold of the project himself and delivered one of the most stunning films in history, his official debut to the film world and the public at large.<br/><br/>This is a story about choice, the story is so timeless that it's almost hard to believe that a film with such intense and seemingly vile subject matter can be made so accessible to any viewer.<br/><br/>This is a film that needs to be seen plain and simple. It is not 'drug propaganda' as some nuts will tell you. Those people have not even bothered to see the film, and there is nothing more annoying than false assumption. The film is not a glamorised account of the sad, pathetic lives and times of the junkies—never is it once made appealing or even ideal—for how can it be so?. How many of you are actually enticed by soiling the bed (and an entire kitchen) with faeces? How many of you are willing to take a nasty, surreal dive into what is perhaps the most vile, unkempt public toilet in all of Scotland? <br/><br/>Trainspotting is a story that manages to be both sweet and humorous, as well as gripping and horrifying. Most of all, it is profound and honest. There are as many sick moments as there are funny ones, and Welsh's novel is so brilliantly transferred into a finely crafted screenplay that it fully explores the different sides of the lives of all of these characters with an apt ease and most importantly (some might say shockingly) a sense of respect; there is as much pain as there is joy, and there is as much filth as there is cleanliness—or at the very least, an attempt at it.<br/><br/>The story is realistic and the accounts are accurate. The characters are all distinct and memorable that it is impossible to watch this and not have them touch you, humour you or disgust you in such different ways, for this is not a story about sympathy. It is a tale of life and of choice, of celebration even under the darkest of circumstances, and of journeys in and out of the abyss that may or may not be successful or worth it—worth the time, worth the money, worth the effort, worth the pain.<br/><br/>The uncertainties of life are so beautifully captured that it makes one feel that no one but Boyle could have handled such challenging material themselves.<br/><br/>Trainspotting will never lose its place in my heart or in the public consciousness. It has often been hailed as a classic, and deservedly so, as it is one of the best films to come out of 1990s."

","I have not read the novel, though I might consider it. This is one of the best British films made, as well as one of the best about drug use. It is not for everyone; if you can't watch a movie that depicts addiction if it doesn't only show the negatives(and, let's be honest, most of those ridiculously exaggerate them) of it without screaming ""this glorifies the use of *insert name of narcotic here*!"", you are not in the target audience. Guess what? That approach doesn't work, it doesn't deter, lying in order to scare kids away from things you don't want them messing with costs you credibility and does not, in fact, always prevent them from pursuing whatever you were trying to get them to steer clear of. I would also like to point out that this is rather unapologetically disgusting, and you'll want to not eat for a while before or after your viewing. And if you're still interested in this after those two pieces of information, then I would suggest you give this a chance. It's engaging from start to finish; frankly, I could not take my eyes off it. Even if you've never seen a junkie, you can get into this. It gives you an unforgettable peek at the environment. The characters are well-developed, credible and fully fleshed out. While you may not like them, you can't keep from having a reaction to them; you can't tell yourself ""there's no one like that in the real world"". There is marvelous social commentary and satire in this. This is hilarious, the humor is immensely sharp and well-delivered, almost no joke or gag falls flat, and it does not try too hard. The music is magnificent. Boyle directs this in a stylish(*not* to be confused with ""flashy"") and experimental manner, and every moment of it is treated to excellent camera-work and editing, leading to numerous unique sequences. There is a lot of strong language, a little sex, brief nudity, quite a bit of disturbing content and some violence in this. The DVD comes with a couple of interviews, well worth the time.

"johnnyboyz","8","1","2","1 October 2008"," Very good film that relies on visual style over narrative but delivers an anti-drug message, amongst other things, all the same.
","A film like Trainspotting can split your opinion right down the middle; a split more akin to the sort of opinion you might take away from a horror film. This split decision revolves around two things; firstly the gross content. Any film that makes you feel uneasy or quite sick at what's going on on screen could automatically plant a negative opinion within your mind but this idea battles with the effectiveness of the film in the sense; if a film is so nasty in its content and unravelling of events that it evokes a definite reaction from the viewer, it could be deemed a success because the filmmakers have succeeded in what they set out to do.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is one of those films. Like I mentioned, horror films usually have this effect. An example could be Wolf Creek or Hostel; two films that gave me a distinct feeling of unpleasantness but some other recent horror films, such as The Descent or Miike's One Missed Call can leave me without any feeling at all as they meander along to their inevitable conclusions; throwing in plenty of blood-soaked action or dull jumps along the way. Are Wolf Creek and Hostel 'better' than these two because I had more of a reaction to them? Or are The Descent and One Missed Call 'better' because they didn't gross me out.<br/><br/>Trainspotting isn't a horror film, but it borders on being a horrible film and I mean that in the nicest possible way. The film is so vile and disgusting in its visuals and establishing of certain situations (one in a public toilet springs to mind) that you just can't help but admire what they've done effect-wise but feel a little uneasy all the same. It's this emotional juxtaposition that director Danny Boyle pulls off here and I think it's this that makes Trainspotting the film it is, especially given the fact it is not particularly plot driven. Obviously you hear and take in a lot of what's already been said about a film as well known as Trainspotting and a film as 'accepted' as Trainspotting but it's more than a mere flavour of the month for a certain generation.<br/><br/>At the time when this was made, the British crime genre (and later the gangster genre) could be seen as genres in a state of transition. Two years previously, with Paul W. S. Anderson's 'Shopping', there was a film that revolved around Britain's youth as they get up to youth orientated activities to do with crime. Then came Boyle's own Shallow Grave before this, a story about lowlifes doing low brow things always connected to crime. But it isn't the demonising of ram raiding and joyriding as seen in Shopping that is being studied here, more so the frequent use of the class A drug heroin. The film revolves around Renton (McGregor) and his cronies, all of whom are introduced somewhat perfectly at the very beginning echoing a tactic the godfather of British crime films Brighton Rock used at the very beginning of that film and something Guy Ritchie's 'Snatch.' would later re-use.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is told from a second person point of view, that is the narrator is involved in the events he is telling us of. It's easy to miss but Renton actually comes off heroin on two occasions, from memory, in this film with the final time adding to the film's overall final twist. As an anti-hero, Renton fits the bill quite well. Whilst utterly despicable in his casualness at talking about and taking heroin, scenes that will no doubt have you winching if needles are not your bag, he sort of redeems himself when he talks about wanting to come off it and is put across as a social person who does seem to have certain hobbies and interests outside of being a junkie; namely talking about actors, films and Academy Awards.<br/><br/>As with all youth orientated films, youth orientated activity plays a big role. Since the principal study here is the damning of heroin, secondary studies like casual sex and the over consumption of alcohol can be wrapped up in double quick time and take nothing away from the film. In fact the film can deliver these moral messages in more ways than one and actually turn them into entertaining scenes without ever feeling like a lecture or lesson. The scene where Renton tries to pick up a young girl at a club only to find out she was underage is one demonisation; Begbie's (Carlyle) incident with a cross dresser in an ever changing world he is in ignorance of is another incident and on another occasion a character and his partner wish to watch a previously recorded sex session as they commit the act once again; only the guy accidentally lent the tape to someone else thinking it was another video. Panic ensures when they assume it to be back at the video rental store.<br/><br/>So while Trainspotting is a thrill ride that conflicts pleasantries with your filmic mind and that lust for a good, effective film; it holds up. There is a switch between realism (in general) and surrealism when he ventures down a toilet to find drugs and comes home wet to the eerie 'rehab-at-home' scene in which an apparent ghost of a previously dead baby climbs the walls and terrorises our hero as his friends and family slip in and out of the bed with him. Trainspotting is fast, furious and unrelenting in its content that can be funny; suspenseful; quite scary and downright disgusting Â– it's one of those film viewing experiences you don't forget in a hurry."

I like the story, I like how it is shot, and the acting is great. There are definitely a couple of nasty moments, but you can always fast forward. I like when Ewan's character is setting up to go through detox and he has a bag full of random food and tools he thinks he will need to get him of drugs. The girl who Ewan goes home with is such a bad ass and her dress was really cool. Though I'm not so sure about the twist with her being underage played out. I found it a bit creepy.

It seems as though in real life it might be a pretty miserable existence, but the characters in this film make it seem sort of enthralling. The acting is really great and each charter adds their own particular layer to the dynamic of the group. With a kicking soundtrack and killer wardrobe this is a film that I quickly made a member of my DVD collection. There are a lot of really cool shots in this film.

Ewan MacGregor turns in a career best as the lead Renton (or as Begbie calls him rent-boy). For such a low budget film it has so much energy, visual flair & great ideas, a film that has got vomit, excrement, sex(with a minor) violence & a dead baby & let's not forget ""the worst toilet in Scotland"" with all those elements the film does NOT glamorise drugs it just shows it as it is, & it lets the characters get on with it. I just hope if they ever make Porno- Irvine Welsh follow up to Trainspotting that the original cast & director jump on board."

","i love this film, it really shows the cream of British film making. i hope they make the sequel 'porno'.<br/><br/>when you see trainspotting you truly can appreciate the talent in the film industry.The realistic feel and emotions mixed with the serial elements is superb and make the movie all the more mind blowing.<br/><br/>as for critics of the film, all i can say is that you have to have an open mind and you probably did not understand the impact and the fantastic directing and you should stick to you basic chick flicks.<br/><br/>I would defiantly say this has to be the best British film of all time (so far) and it a true inspiration to independent film makes."

","If you haven't seen Trainspotting, here be SPOILERS, so I wouldn't read on.<br/><br/>I wanted to see this film for ages and the first time I saw it I thought: It's alright, but i think I was just in shock. Mostly from the bit were the baby dies, though I had been warned. Then I watched it again- this time prepared, and I thought it was AMAZING! I managed to laugh a lot more because I knew what happened.<br/><br/>The main characters are acted brilliantly and convincingly by Ewan McGregor and crew. Though I do feel sorry for the characters (bar Begbie who gets whats coming to him- though well done Robert Carlyle: he is great in it) when Renton takes the money. (Poor Jonny Lee Miller hardly ever seems to get a good ending.) I've read the book too and even though loads is missed out (understandably) it still has the effect and power of the novel.<br/><br/>Overall it's a great film with great characters and dialogue. And as for glamorising drugs- if you still want heroin after this film I certainly wouldn't know why. In the words of Renton: Choose Life."

"The_Sandheaver","10","1","2","30 June 2006"," The Best British Movie of recent times
","I can safely say without a doubt that this is the Best British Movie of recent times, definitely the best film of 1996. It is amazing how the story can focus on such a controversial story and contain an incredible amount of humour, as well as intense sadness and fear. It is all those elements that stimulate the soul that makes this such a compelling and wonderful film.<br/><br/>Set in Leith and Edinburgh, this film focuses on a young Scotsman called Renton (The charismatic Ewan McGregor), his addiction to heroin, and his relationship with his friends, who are all different in their personality, yet all unified by their old friendships. However, it is Renton's realisation at the life of horror that he is living that gradually threatens to destroy the relationships he has with his so-called mates, and makes him review his views on life, which he lays out in the funny yet shocking opening monologue.<br/><br/>This film explores with genuine success how drugs in modern culture is viewed by many different people who live in a place which is notorious for the activity of drug addicts. It tells how the addicts live with it, how they try to keep it, how they view life, and how others view them. The reason for it being controversial is that it both seems to glorify drug use but it more than balances out with the shocking consequences that come of its use.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor gives his most charismatic, enduring and humorous performances to date as the troubled Renton, who deals with the series of events unfolding around him. But, McGregor is not alone with his amazing portrayal. The performance of Robert Carlyle as the psychotic Begbie is flawless as is Kelly MacDonald's portrayal of the charismatic Dianne. You won't see any of the actors giving a better performance than they do in this outstanding film.<br/><br/>Based on Irvine Welsh's incredible book of the same name, this film deserves to be given praise for the issues it raises, the awareness it brings with it, and it's relevance to modern culture even now as it reaches its 10 year mark. Embued with wonderful performances, a perfect Soundtrack and humour that will make you laugh and cringe at the same time, this is a film that simply must be seen before you die. One warning, this isn't for the light-hearted."

","Trainspotting, the best British movie ever made, I really mean it. A movie, adapted from a very outstanding Irvine Welsh's masterpiece. I still remembers the first time i saw this movie back in 1996. I was very amazed by how this movie left a very strong impression in my memory, and i just bought the DVD about a week ago and honestly it still has the same fun and thrill. <br/><br/>Even though, it's been like a 9 years, the movie still deserves my attention. The way it brings out the characters' personality with a perfect pace and flow make this movie really fun to watch.<br/><br/>Renton, with his drug addiction. Spud, with his stupid behaviour. Begbie, unforgettable with his rageous emotion. Sick Boy, really fits his name. tommy, the tragic one.<br/><br/>these characters really live in this movie. they look very real and unforgettable. thanks to irvine welsh who made these characters born in the first place.<br/><br/>but the most amazing part of the movie is the creative idea in the cinematic way. there are lots of unforgettable scenes and what makes it more perfect is soundtrack that provides the mood which i think was the best motion picture soundtrack ever. it really illustrates the mood of this movie.<br/><br/>trust me one thing, when you watch this movie just don't ever get up from your seat. don't you miss even a single bit of it, cause the fun starts from the very first beginning of the movie.<br/><br/>and let's just hope for the sequel"

","This movie is excellent. I never thought I would like a movie that was all about drug addicts but this movie takes the cake. It is superbly rendered and so realistic (even the hallucinating scenes of the high junkies) that it feels as if I am there. Only watch if you have a strong stomach, though... and you may not want to eat. The acting is stupendous but that accents are so thick, it is hard to understand every word and the characters talk about 100 miles a minute. It'll probably take a couple of viewings to catch every word but I assure you that it is worth the many times you see it. Be prepared for morbid humor and lots of blood. Despite the fact that it is about drugs and addicts, I think it has a sort of feel good ending, in a strange way. Ewan McGregor carries off Renton like he WAS the man. I urge any and all people to watch this movie. It is so worth it and you are missing a great moment in cinema."

The movie shows what some drug addicts go through in their daily lives.<br/><br/>The actors do a very good job bringing their characters to life. Ewan McGregor is very good as the center of attention for the movie, but the other actors are great as well. Especially, Jonny Lee Miller as a fellow heroin addict who is obsessed with Sean Connery. Also, Robert Carlyle as their pretty much psychotic friend who doesn't touch the stuff. They have other friends who are just as good, but they don't appear as much as those three in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie is also presented is a visually provocative way. You can probably credit Danny Boyle for that. There are two very memorable scenes that take place in ""the worst toilet in Scotland,"" and when Ewan's parents try to help him get off the junk.<br/><br/>Don't be put off by it just because it's foreign or because it's about drugs.

"bananaman572","10","1","2","7 January 2005"," Perhaps the best British film since Brief Encounter!
","I watched Trainspotting under the recommendation of my dad. He actually bought it for me for my 15th birthday, telling me that he thought it should be shown at schools as anti-drugs education. Now, after several viewings, I believe he was wrong; not about the undeniable quality of the film, but over the idea that it was anti-drugs.<br/><br/>More on that later. The film itself is a powerful piece of work, a recipe of equal parts comedy, tragedy and plain disgusting. The director Danny Boyle leaves his mark all over this film; bright colours stand out in an otherwise bleak landscape. The soundtrack is perhaps one of the best compilations ever assembled, tracks such as Born Slippy and Perfect Day in particular. But what perhaps makes these tracks all the more powerful is the incredible editing. Editors often do not get the recognition they deserve, in Trainspotting this has never been more obvious. At the start, when he gets his first hit while he gets knocked down in the football match is fantastic, just one example of an amazing performance from the unsung member of the cast.<br/><br/>And a very good cast it is too. No one stands out as a dud, even Irvine Welsh (author of the novel Trainspotting) as Mikey Forrester. Robert Carlyle is at his psychotic best, Jonny Lee Miller debuts as Sick Boy and Ewan McGregor is fantastic, playing the part of Renton to perfection.<br/><br/>Back to my dad. Kinda. Trainspotting is most definitely not an anti-drugs film. it throws you in a very personal situation with Renton, without making judgements on the drug use. Of course it shows the terrible effects of a drug addiction, the baby dies, Tommy dies; and yet he openly admits just how good the hit is. We end the film with Renton out of the addiction, without the same scars that we see in a more moralistic, more graphic without being as emotionally affecting, film such as Requiem for a Dream. (which somehow finds itself in the top 60, although thankfully not in the top 50!) Trainspotting is clearly a better film as a result, because it is actually a FILM, with a real story to tell, rather than using heavy-handed scare tactics. Cinema should be about entertaining primarily, and while one way to entertain is intellectually by making you think about the subject matter, this should never overtake the enjoyment of the film for the viewer.<br/><br/>The film itself excels in managing to balance dark humour with the weighty subject matter, and still have an uplifting ending, reminiscent stylisticly of A Clockwork Orange, (a film whose influence we see in the club scene a la Milk Bar). It is endlessly watchable, you get something new from it every time you see it. A fantastic film, rather than a replica of the book (equally good), which i would recommend to any film lover."

He is an absolute Psycho, but is performed brilliantly by Carlyle. Ewan McGregor definitely makes his mark here, surely this is the film that made him most noticed around the world. But it really is a Carlyle film all the way. If you want to see a film about good characters than this is it. Its one hell of an amazing Masterpiece that will never be matched for its gore images, and its consistent use of the word,c**t. A film that all film critics must see. Don't' miss it."
"dee.reid","10","1","2","20 October 2004"," Choose life or choose heroin?
","1996's ""Trainspotting,"" an adaptation of Irvine Welsh's cult novel about heroin addicts in Edinburgh, Scotland, is a deliriously funny and imaginative ride through the pitfalls of addiction. However, the movie never glorifies addiction; if it did, we wouldn't see the grim aftermath of so many instances that are otherwise avoidable if its characters chose to remain sober.<br/><br/>The film wastes no time in establishing that the main characters are addicts, each of them shooting up in a rundown apartment. They are a loose group of fellows, with Renton (Ewan McGregor), violent drunk Begbie (Robert Carlyle), Sean Connery-enthusiast Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), the nerd-like Spud (Ewen Bremner), and life-chooser Tommy (Kevin McKidd).<br/><br/>What we get for 90 minutes is unrepentant drug use from the leads and the resulting depravity. We watch the funny/grim aftermath of wild sex romps for each of the main characters while some time down the road, we're treated to visions of dead babies and the inevitable overdose or death.<br/><br/>But despite all these grim underpinnings, there is a faint glimmer of hope, and that hope rests within our emotional connection to Renton, who knows he has a problem and tries to correct it, despite the influence of his friends.<br/><br/>We watch as Renton painfully goes through withdrawal, the horror that he witnesses, and the aforementioned dead baby crawling on the ceiling.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" is an intricate and funny masterpiece of what it's like to be an addict and on the loose. It's no wonder this movie was such a hit here in the United States.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Never have I seen a film that doesn't glamourise and doesn't shy away from the bad elements of living with a drug addiction. ""One bucket for feces, one for urine and one for vomit"" I know many people who have tried it this way. Americans tried to show this in a similar light with ""rules of attraction"" but it didn't have the same impact because it wasn't really dealing with the issues of addiction, issues that seem to be more and more prominent as time passes. Its a brilliant film that shows, for some people, for the first time that Scotland is all hills and lochs and big green monsters called nessie, it shows what were really like, vulnerable, sick, and as weird as anyone else out there.

","I've only drank alcohol and never even smoked so much as cigarette or cigar, I will never do drugs and never understand addicts. I'm a pharmacist and deal with these ""scum"" on a daily basis. It comes with the job. This being said, I truly enjoyed Trainspotting. It's a well acted, well directed story about addicts and why they do it. It's almost a documentary following the lives of some heroin addict friends narrarated by the main character played by Ewan McGregor. His performance alone is worth watching but the movie has its merits too. If you don't understand addicts or their world, this is the movie to see. It paints a realistic and very gloomy portrayal of their lives and worlds. It's not pro-drug or anti-drug. It just tells a story about drugs and their addicts (Trust me, the drugs own the addict and not the other way around). If anything, it should convince you not to do drugs unless you think what they go through is somehow glamorous. If you do, you're sick. I don't recommend eating during this movie (like I did) due to some of the graphic content. Otherwise, watch and learn."
"SheBear","Null","1","2","1 September 2004"," The Agony and the Ecstasy
","Trainspotting is a quintessentially British film filled with thick Scottish accents and dark wit. It is highly stylized and brims with color and manic energy. It is appropriately dark at times and vibrant at others. The balance is always right.<br/><br/>This was most people's introduction to Ewan McGregor and he is terrific as Renton. His speech about why Scotland is shite is a classic. No role he has played since has given him as good an opportunity to show off his acting chops.<br/><br/>Ewen Bremner is hysterical as Spud. How come this guy doesn't get more work? Robert Carlyle is intense and fabulous as always.<br/><br/>Trainspotting doesn't beat you over the head with an anti drug message. Perhaps it is more honest than most drug films because it explores the pleasurable side of drug taking. But the negative effects are clearly shown too and each character must decide if the benefits outweigh the risks. The ending is somewhat ambiguous and the film is all the better for that."

","Instant classic movie, from the soundtrack to the cinematography. It's already a cult flick and quite deservingly so.<br/><br/>The film depicts the life of a few Glaswegians with a heroine habit. Pretty serious stuff. With the scenes of the injections to the tragedy in the middle, the topic covered are quite heavy and not something to take lightly. But that is precisely what Danny Boyle and the author Irwin Welsh has done. The art is to take a serious subject and without making it trivial, make the subject approachable and thereby reach out the message.<br/><br/>The casting was quite brilliant and from Ewan MacGregor to Robert Carlisle to Johnny Lee Miller; these are real actors. <br/><br/>The question is what do you remember after the movie is over. I, for one, remember the humour first and then afterwards, the awful state of affairs.<br/><br/>The film does not glamourise drugs or the culture.

","This movie is a mold breaker. Movies like ""Punch Drunk Love"", ""Trainspotting"", and other such films just break the mold from what we have come to expect from typical movies. This movie uses a lot of music and camera scenes to set the tone and pace of the story. The story is straight forward, not complicated, but yet realistic and sincere. Young Renten is stuck in a life he really doesn't want or enjoy, but he has no other alternatives until, finally, through a series of disasters, he is forced escape to London, where he begins to change his views...on life, drugs, his friends, and what paths he will end up taking. The movie is wholly charming, witty, and also quite tongue-in-cheek. It can be disturbing and even upsetting at times, but only to further the story itself.

"useless365","Null","1","2","27 June 2004"," praising paragraphs of the movie's style, actors, and story
","Trainspotting is a wonderful movie, and one of my all-time favorites. The use of music, humor, and even the use of color enhance this film and make it a pleasure to the eye as well as the mind.<br/><br/>Renton, the main character, guides you through a series of events happening all around him, on account of his life-style and his choices. This character was portrayed very skillfully by actor Ewan McGregor. He really stole my heart in this movie. You can't help but pity him, yet there is an undeniable urge to help and comfort him. Other characters that shone were Sick Boy, played by Jonny Lee Miller, whose main obsession in life, other than the obvious, is Sean Connery and the plethora of Bond movies. This, among some other very funny conversations and situations, is particularly amusing. It took me a few times watching it to realize that it is included in almost every ""Sick Boy conversation"".<br/><br/>The use of color in this film, though perhaps subtle, really adds to the overall feel of it. Though it has the potential to be a very drab, gritty film - and the potential to be preachy - the simple use of bright colors gives it a vibrant look and a somewhat upbeat feel. The use of vivid reds, blues, and greens (lighting mainly at Mother Superior's)tends to give it a surreal look.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this movie and have watched it several times. I even got the Collector's Edition DVD, I was very pleased with the bonus features and have yet to watch them all. Another entertaining film with a similar ""feel"", I thought, was Spun. <br/><br/>Anyways, those were my opinions and thoughts, hope you enjoyed them."

","Danny Boyle and his crew crafted a wonderful piece of story telling that escaped the bounds of a simple ""drug"" movie. It's disturbing, violent, and sick, yet manages to understand at its heart what the problems are with drugs in reality. In many ways it is very much like Pulp Fiction (though not as well written) but has the underlying morality. Through all of the sickness and disgust, the protagonist knows what is wrong and is trying to fix it.<br/><br/>Apart from Shallow Grave, I haven't really appreciated much Boyle has done, but Trainspotting lands high on my list as great pieces of work of the last century. <br/><br/>Trainspotting isn't for everyone, but it is a wonderful example of shoe-sting filmmaking.<br/><br/>***.5/****"

","This film is a pulls-no-punches tale of a group of friends in Edinburgh circa 1993 trying to kick heroin, find love, and get rich quick. Based on the 1993 Irvine Welsh novel of the same name, this film shows us the world according to Mark Renton, the anti-hero of anti-hero's. Funny, poignant, disturbing, and completely un-sugarcoated, Trainspotting shows us life as it truly is: often depressing, frightening, dangerous, and sadly way too short. Definitely the polar opposite of those 90's ""teen"" films that show life as all beautiful people who, in the end, go on to great things and are always successful. There is no beauty here. Just life at its most raw and ugly state. In other words, IT IS REAL. If you haven't seen this film and have a strong stomach, I highly recommend it. If you haven't read the book... what the hell's wrong with you??? As great as Trainspotting the film is, the book is far better, and paints a clearer picture of the sordid characters who make it all happen. 10/10 stars I have loved this film since i first saw it 7 years ago and continue to read everything Irvine Welsh publishes.

Each scene has it's own delights and are all very different. From shocking(the dead baby scene),to unreal(the toilet scene with Mark)to absolutely hilarious(the scene in which Spud wakes in his girlfriends house).<br/><br/>The movie is accompanied by a great soundtrack which is not for decoration like a lot of soundtracks but really gives an extra dimension to each scene.For example,when Mark goes to London to get away from drugs you hear this commercial house song by Ice MC and when Mark is in his room and goes into the Junkie limbo(my favorite scene) you hear a dark pounding song by Underworld.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor and Robert Carlyle are the highlights actingwise,But each actor gives a great performance.<br/><br/>Overall,this is the best film I have ever seen and it really gets up to the level of the novel by Irvine Welsh,my favorite modern writer(read Acid House!). 10/10"

","Well, first, it might be said that I've both read the book and watched the movie and the first is a lot better. But the movie is awesome. The script is a cool excerpt from the book and it even gives some new situations that make it richer. As a movie it doesn't allow you to blink, from beginning to end keeps you at the edge and that's hard to find. It is well packed with a superb soundtrack, the likes of Lou Reed, Pulp, etc. just as in the book, which gives music a great importance, as if the writer was dreaming of the soundtrack. Director Danny Boyle, with great actors, have managed to bring the best of this awesome script. All the scenes are well cut and fixed, the cinematography is so cool you just have to watch every single scene with close attention to understand it all. Many people tempted to see it as a lesson not to be on heroine but I see it as a party on it, more a movie about friendship and true people,and that´s what matters. Will become a classic."

","I can say many things about this movie:<br/><br/>1. Danny Boyle (director) did perhaps, the best direction of his career 2. The script is a 5 star novel by Irvin Welsh 3. This movie has to be seen many times, because every time you see it, the understanding of it will be different. 4. Too good to be RECOGNIZED by everyone. 5. Obvously too good for an Oscar 6. The cast couldn't be better, leading EWAN McGREGOR that plays the confused Mark Reton, then ROBERT CARLYLE the astonishing performance of the neo-ultraviolent hooligan Begbie,... 7. Bunch of highly sick people put together, the camera shots are unusual, the sound editing, and of course, the soundtrack. 8. The soundtrack of SOUNDTRACKS, music by LOU REED, IGGY POP, BLUR, UNDERWORLD, ETC..<br/><br/>This is the one of 2 movies that are a-temporal of its time, a movie that gives you that feeling of weird greatness, THAT YOU KNOW THAT YOU'VE SEEN JUST ANOTHER KIND OF MOVIE, THAT LEAVES YOU SHOCKED.

They immediately say ""i can't understand that"". I've lived in the States for 8 months now and it does get frustrating when i know i'm speaking perfectly clear English and i get met with furrowed brows and odd looks as if i'm speaking in a foreign language.

They also showed the pleasurable aspects of it, which no one can seriously deny, especially with experience.

When one chooses to use songs like 'Perfect day' (Lou Reed as you will all know) or songs by artists like Iggy Pop, one should be very careful not to abuse them. In this movie they used these evergreen's in the way the were meant to be (in my opinion). It also shows that a good movie is made by a great plot and great actors instead of a lot of money.

It IS a good, fun romp through through low-life land with a really good soundtrack, a few laughs, lots of Iggy Pop reference and a naughty sex scene. <br/><br/>But parents be warned! This is NOT an anti-drug movie! Yes there are those awful consequences but these are not the WORST consequences and judging by how the movie portrays dingy, low-rent apartments as 'cool' while Renton and crew load up on the good old H coupled with the relatively happy ending, this movie is very likely to insight a few copy cats who don't know any better."

","A couple of weeks ago, the British Film Institute (B.F.I.) ranked ""Trainspotting"" in number ten (10) in a list of the one hundred best British movies. I found this rating exaggerated and decided to see this movie again for my personal reevaluation. The politically incorrect story of the Scottish heroine addicted Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) and his supposed friends Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), the athletic Tommy (Kevin McKidd) and the violent Begbie (Robert Carlyle) has a very original screenplay. In spite of having many disgusting and sick scenes, many moments of apology to heroine and a very amoral conclusion, the plot is not bad. But I would never list this flick among the IMDb Top 250 or rank it as the tenth best British movie ever. My vote is seven.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Trainspotting  Sem Limites"" (""Trainspotting  Without Limits"")"
"andrewburgereviews","7","1","3","7 July 2019"," ""Who need reasons when you've got heroin?""
","As you can see, I love the narration in Danny Boyle's """"Trainspotting"". This is a film which understands the nature of drug addiction. The introductory voice-over by the needle-hopper Renton (Ewan McGregor) is surprisingly argumentative and intellectual. You get to understand and even relate to the victims of the needle. Not that I encourage drug consumption--absolutely not! Stay in school, kids!<br/><br/>""People think it's all about misery and desperation and death [...] but what they forget is the pleasure of it"". This film is not pro-drug, but it is not anti-drug either. This is an unbiased, unpretentious, unpolished look at what is, in the end, an addiction like any other. ""Trainspotting"" does not bother with the classical moral mumbo-jumbo, it understands there is no point in arguing with a drug addict from a societal point of view. They become programmed, lost on emotions, completely overwhelmed by hitting the needle once again.<br/><br/>Renton, though, tries to get out of the lifestyle, and we are shown how he methodically prepares himself by locking himself in a room and barring the door. Not soon enough, that fails. No spoiler, come on, you didn't actually think it's going to be that easy. His deadbeat friends include the naive Spud (Ewen Bremmer), the ""intellectual"" Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller) and the short-tempered Begbie (Robert Carlyle). Renton always seems like he is more than them--he denotes a certain maturity but, because of his addiction, this is the best he can get.<br/><br/>Despite this raggedness and realism, ""Trainspotting"" has a few frustrating scenes, mostly the surreal ones. Take the scene in which Renton is in desperate need of number 2, so he finds a public bathroom in a bar. The disgusting way in which the bathroom is presented feels sensationalized and patronizing. I felt my stomach turning and there really was no need to push it even more (those that saw the film know what I'm talking about). Boyle then attempts an art-house surreal scene when Renton is locked in a room in his parents' house later in the film. Boyle is too much of a down-to-earth filmmaker to make surrealism stick here and the scene feels like a drag.<br/><br/>From a screenwriting point of view, Renton throws motives and justifications on why he needs drugs. It's easy--first because of curiosity, then because it feels good and now because he is addicted. Hearing the Scorsesian narration going along the lines of ""we would have injected Vitamin C if only they'd made it illegal"" nullifies all his initial reasoning. This didn't bother me that much, not as much as the last thirty minutes, anyway. Nothing really happens after this point except, of course, that nail-biting ending. That gave the film a sweet taste after watching it.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" is a good film. Despite its occasional flaws, I respect it for its non-judgmental approach. Danny Boyle always knew how to relate to people struggling in life, whether they got to their lowest point by their own hands, or by fate. By keeping it unpolished, he made this one of the most effective examples."

The characters are fun and painfully real, they have their needs,. wants and dislikes and a life philosophy. Even tho we follow the main character, we aren't always rooting for him, he ruins life for everyone around him, and even when he tries to be better he does it still. the story and characters besides, if i were to watch this movie on mute i'd still enjoy my time, because the camerawork and scenes are a pleasure to look at, the film has fun with its visuals where it can, making many very memorable scenes have that extra touch to make them even more memorable.

","Despite an offshoot of moral crusaders berating 'Trainspotting' in 1995 for allegedly 'glorifying heroin' there seem to be few who can doubt the greatness of such a cult classic.<br/><br/>Yes, it is about a band of horrible, nasty people, but - most importantly - it does NOT glorify any form of drugs. On the contrary, it would recommend that this film is shown to youngsters as a way of showing just how wretched and awful people's lives can be when they're hooked on substance abuse.<br/><br/>Ignoring 'Shallow Grave' this could be considered as Ewan McGregor's 'breakthrough' performance and, although he does steal the show in every scene, the whole 'ensemble' cast should not be forgotten - special mention to Robert Carlyle as 'Begbie' who is a truly terrifying on-screen psycho.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine there are too many people who don't like Trainspotting. It's a great British film which catapulted many of those involved into mainstream stardom. Some people say that it's quite bleak and, although the subject matter is pretty dark, the cast handle it with enough wit and charm to have us - sort of - rooting for them (or at least Ewan McGregor's 'anti-hero' - Renton). Yes, it can be a bit dark and disturbing at times, but the real life 'horror' of the 'junkie lifestyle' has to be shown in all its glory if its really going to portray it accurately.<br/><br/>So, if you're any way interested in popular culture the Trainspotting perfectly sums up the nineties. Even if you're not, it's one of those films that you really should see before you die - if nothing else then sooner or later you'll find yourself in a situation when all those around you are talking about it and you really don't want to be left out!"

","You'll have to have a cast-iron stomach and few inhibitions to truly enjoy this tour-De-force anti-heroin melodrama. ""Shallow Grave"" director Danny Boyle and co-scenarist John Hodge distilled Irvine Welsh's atmosphere Scottish novel about the perils of addiction. This shameless consumers nightmare satire depicts the addiction that several people share, among them Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), and Spud (Ewen Bremner) as well as their non-junkie friends, particularly Francis Begbie (Robert Caryle) in Edinburgh, Scotland. Half-funny, half-tragic, ""Trainspotting"" isn't a movie that you will forget. Some of its memorable scenes verge on the surreal. Renton plunges into the worst toilet in Scotland to retrieve two opium suppositories. Later, when Renton is going cold turkey on heroin, he imagines that Begbie is under the sheets with him and that a dead baby is crawling across the ceiling. In another scene, Mark shoots heroine and imagines that he has sunk through the carpet; the heroin dealer Mother Superior hauls his body into the street and summons a cab to take him to the hospital. Throughout these scenes, Mark's perspective is looking up and out of a box with carpet on both sides. Interestingly enough, Renton's room at his parents' house is plastered with wallpaper of locomotives. Robert Caryle plays the one character who doesn't thrive on heroine. Instead of heroine, Begbie gets off on ""his own sensory addiction."" He likes to brandish his knife, boast loudly, and start fights. He amounts to the U.K. equivalent o Robert De Niro.

"ytserman","10","1","3","12 February 2013"," Trainspotting is strong, realistic and highly enjoyable peek into rather grey Mondays in 1980s Scotland
","Based on a novel of same name by Irwin Welsh, Trainspotting is a satirical film about a pack of Edinburghians (is that a word?) who have burned all bridges behind them and chosen something completely else. They've chosen heroin.<br/><br/>Main character of the plot is Mark ""Rents"" Renton (Ewan McGregor) whose self-observing mentality and lust for life lifts him momentarily away from drug inhabited life. Dramatic, tragic and at times very comic situations ensue while Renton observes his relationship towards friends and family. Not to mention the whole world.<br/><br/>The reason for this film being one of my all-time favorites lies simply in characterization. In addition to Renton and plenty of other casting, pack includes narcissistic Begbie (Robert Carlyle), sympathetic Spud (Ewen Bremner) and egomaniac Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller). Director Danny Boyle builds steam from a grain of salt casting this movie. Don't believe it? Check for instance Renton's hallucinations inside men's room toilet, Begbie's outbursts of rage in pub or Sick Boy's obsession to Scottish icon, none else than, Sean Connery.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is strong, realistic and highly enjoyable peek into rather grey Mondays in 1980s Scotland where life has its ups under the influence of heroin, alcohol, 'fitba' (soccer) and Iggy Pop gigs. This is where life literally is seconds away from sting.<br/><br/>Review originally posted in Finnish here: www.keittopaiva.com/331/130- trainspotting"
"Manal1987","7","1","3","13 September 2011"," Hyped!
","McGregor's all-time best performance and Boyle's most hyped movie. Trainspotting precisely captures the spirit of the age through tracing the lives of four heroin-addicted Scottish friends, depicting their ups and downs, and their struggle to come clean and start a new life. The movie is highly graphic and quite shocking I have to say, but this somehow corresponds with the gravity of the experience itself that Boyle has brilliantly and vividly conveyed to the audience in fluttering stages: the absence, the denial, the realization, the struggle, the relapse... etc. The film doesn't lecture or blame; it doesn't treat drug use as an individual case but as a societal phenomena that has everything to do with the atmosphere back then. Besides McGregor's, Robert Carlyle's role as Begbie was remarkable as applause-worthy as usual."
"Lucabrasisleeps","6","1","3","21 November 2008"," Pretty good but not my kind of movie
","I had heard of this movie a couple of years ago in relation to some survey of British films(Total film, I think). This movie reportedly ended up on the 4th place. I guess that shows the inherent popularity of this movie set in Edinburgh.<br/><br/>My first reaction was that of indifference. Sure, it was entertaining but it was not as impressive as I thought it would be. But then, I really don't think it was my sort of movie at all.<br/><br/>The plot is as follows. Mark ""Rents"" Renton(Ewan MacGregor) is a drug addict who spends time injecting heroin along with his friends who can be best described as eccentric and aimless. Begbie is a psychotic man who is surprisingly not a drug addict. In the words of Renton, he gets off on starting fights with random people for no reason in bars. Spud is a guy lacking social skills and who could be described as the nicest person in the group. Sickboy is another weirdo of the group who is absolutely devoid of moral scruples whatsoever. Sick boy can be described as the charismatic face of the group and he is most interested in movies and the pop culture of the time. Tommy is another guy who is not a heroin junkie and becomes one after his girlfriend dumps him over a lost tape(this might be the saddest story of all).<br/><br/>The movie portrays the gradual change of Mark Renton from heroin junkie to respected real estate professional who tries to live the regular life. The sarcasm in this movie is evident in the way Renton describes the supposed normal way of living - a long monologue listing various home appliances and material things in a resigned, monotonous tone. This appears in the beginning and end of the movie.<br/><br/>The movie switches from dark comedy to tragedy to dark comedy again in a matter of minutes which is likely to jolt viewers a bit. There are a few scenes involving scatological references which are not likely to appeal to some people's tastes. Also the relationship of the lead character with an underaged girl may not be palatable to certain people. There is also a very shocking scene(according to me at least) involving a baby which may leave a lasting impression on the viewers.<br/><br/>The movie then deals with the struggles of Renton, who tries to go to rehab and tries to extricate himself from his poisonous friends.<br/><br/>Good points? The soundtrack and movie score is actually pretty good and is one of the high points of the movie. Another positive is the great performance of Ewan MacGregor who stars as Mark Renton. Ewen Bremner is especially noteworthy as Spud and he is the one most likely to elicit some sympathy from viewers. Robert Carlyle as Begbie has given one of the best performances on film(according to me) as the psychotic Begbie. Truly one of the most frightening performances ever. The fast moving screenplay is also one of the positive aspects of the movie.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to moviebuffs who are interested in the lives of drug addicts and also the youth culture of Edinburgh in 90's. This movie is perfect for people who have a taste for British style dark comedy.<br/><br/>Overall I wasn't so impressed overall but then it just wasn't my type of movie so that influences my opinion obviously."

The final and worst ""travel"" by Renton result of the coke is the point of the break,a splendid ""Perfect Day"" by Lou Reed serves like a bizarre guide to our antihero:""You're going to reap just what you sow"" road to the hospital,the ultimate sting showed us the time to change,after to commit a steal the quartet sleeps in a cheap hostel,Begbie so secure in himself takes care the bounty,but Renton gets the money despite the Begbie's ""safeness"",in the road to the ""choose your life"" he thinks about his already former pals:Begbie a wicked guy forever,Sickboy a doped bulk forever,but Spud was rewarded because he was only a little bit misled but capable to put straight the new path. <br/><br/>Beating us Underworld with the rushing ""Born Slippy Nuxx""(a great hit from an excellent soundtrack)Renton decides to get a normal life: wife, children, TV,car,his own house,an average job and the more stuffs of the consumer society for today;great story so many mistaken guys can wish the Renton's real craving:The redemption to oneself. A total movie of cult without unnecessary crimes and charmless slayers as bad actors(Lewis&Harrelson)like ""NBK"" and shameless of their loathly acts,so close to ""A clockwork Orange""(note in the disco the fair tribute to the ""ACO"")but Boyle is not Kubrick and there is the difference,nevertheless the movie is superb and the end delivered us a positive message of being a new person,even when we may be in disagree with cruel the society in which we live in.

It is more of a sucker punch from reality and a no-holds-barred look at what we would like to forget.<br/><br/>The director doesn't try to vilify or romanticize the addiction that the characters are faced with, instead he presents you with a realistic view and lets you draw from it what you will.

","I didn't see this film at the cinema, which was probably a mistake. I think its impact would have been all the greater on the big screen.

Is it anti-drugs? Not so you'd notice - it doesn't preach. It shows you the lives the heroin addicts live, and leaves you to draw your own conclusions.<br/><br/>Marvellous acting, centreing (of course) on Renton, although Begbie was a fascinating role, which made you think: why DO these people associate with such a nutter? Favourite character has to be Spud, wonderfully blissed-out.<br/><br/>There isn't a strong plot running through the film, it's more a succession of scenes illustrating the lives of the central characters. The sub-plot connected with the big drug deal felt a bit tacked-on and unconvincing, but that's a fairly minor quibble.<br/><br/>Not for the faint-hearted or weak-stomached, although the Worst Toilet scene goes into surreal overdrive, while Spud's 'accident' is just plain funny.<br/><br/>The additional scenes in the Green edition - rough cuts that didn't make the final edit, following the end of the film - were a welcome bonus; I felt that one or two of them would actually have made the film a bit more coherent."

"Leofwine_draca","5","2","10","14 April 2017"," Not bad, but certainly overrated
","I've never been a big fan of TRAINSPOTTING, despite the hype surrounding it and the fact that everybody else seems to absolutely love it. I find the story of the drug-addicted Scottish yokels to be pretty depressing, and certainly not to be celebrated as some kind of tragi-comedy. If you want to see an anti-drug film that's even more horrifying and hard hitting, I'd recommend REQUIEM FOR A DREAM, which is by far the better movie. Otherwise I find films like the Irish comedy ADAM & PAUL more affecting and interesting than this effort.<br/><br/>TRAINSPOTTING is well-directed, that's for sure; Danny Boyle injects a great deal of energy and incident into his fast-paced movie, so it's never a boring watch. However, the characters fail to be likable in any way, and the whole film feels like an exercise in the gross-out: the injecting scenes, the hallucination scenes, the toilet scene, the bedsheet scene, all of these moments are designed to be edgy and provocative, but I found them quite juvenile. It's an exercise in star-making, certainly, but the only actor who really shines here is the frightening Robert Carlyle, who got his Bond villain role in THE WORLD IS NOT ENOUGH on the back of this. Ewan McGregor is, as ever, overrated, just like the film as a whole."

","This is it. One of the big ones. One of the biggest films in both British cinema and culture, as well as general cinema. It took a glimpse at and captured late 90s British culture, has garnered endless praise by critics and audiences alike, has influenced many films and filmmakers since, got nominated for numerous awards and even has a cult following to boot. But after 20 years, does it still hold up?<br/><br/>The plot is Renton among his various heroin junkie friends wander around life in late 1990s Scotland and England, experiencing addiction, drug withdrawal, employment, theft and the changing culture of the time. If I'm sounding like I'm making the film look weak in terms of plot, that is how the film presents itself, and is rather the fault of the film than of my own. One of my biggest problems with the film is its utter lack of a coherent plot and/or structure. There is no overreaching story arc whatsoever throughout the entire film, sans the occasional subplot, and as such, it makes the film hard to connect with due to a lack of a strong narrative to pull the viewer in. This sort of style can work; Five Easy Pieces for example is a wonderful demonstration of how to do a wandering movie correctly.<br/><br/>However, the big difference between Five Easy Pieces and Trainspotting is that while both have major douchebags in the leads, the former's was at least sympathetic, the latter isn't. And that is my main problem with the film; the characters are too unlikable to engage with. Far too nasty, narcissistic and selfish to really attach onto. Only Spud seems like a legitimately good guy, and even he is too pathetic and easily manipulated to support. The rest of them are just horrible and self-indulgent narcissists perfectly happy to stab each other in the back when the plot serves that need, most notably Renton's betrayal of both Spud in the courtroom early on and then his ultimate back stab at the end. It doesn't make a for a bunch of likable protagonists, of which makes the viewer wonder why are they bothering to watch? <br/><br/>In comparison, someone like Five Easy Pieces' Bobby Dupea may be for many an unlikable guy (being moody, spoilt and generally selfish), but at least he is charming, and cares enough for people for people around him to make him a likable enough guy with some sense of a moral compass. Trainspotting has none of this. The characters seem to care little for one another beyond anything superficial, they have no likable character traits, and given the fact that they range from stupid losers to borderline psychopaths (hi, Begbie), they aren't pleasant people to be around either. Of which makes watching an hour and a half movie with these fools as the lead somewhat problematic, given that I don't enjoy their company at all. Meanwhile, they don't have the excuse films like Sweet Smell Of Success, Fight Club and even Boyle's own Shallow Grave do in that the characters in those movies are similarly rotten to the core, but they were also charming, had some moral compass and got their comeuppance in the end, even if it is somewhat minimal for say Fight Club, none of which happens in Trainspotting, especially given that the 'comeuppance' that happens at the end of the film is benefitting another unlikable character and making another more likable character in Spud worse off so it means nothing. And at least in those movies, when they were backstabbing one another, those affected were at least ready to take the heat and fight back as opposed to Trainspotting where innocent or unlucky victims are often in the firing line for the main characters' antics (like getting an innocent dog owner attacked by his own dog, one guy unknowingly sleeping with a minor of whom then blackmails him to keep up the relationship and pretty much everything that happens to Spud from having his job interviews messed up by friends to being sent down while friends who helped him in crime walk free). <br/><br/>So here's my underlying problem; there is no substantial enough plot to get the viewer engaged and the characters are too unlikable to make you care enough for the situation. As such, why am I watching in the first place?<br/><br/>After all this, you probably think I hate this movie, but I don't, as I think it's OK. The acting is terrific, it's very stylish and it is entertaining at the least. The film can be funny at points (especially some of movie references thrown about and narration parts) and it does have a wonderful soundtrack. The film's production values are very good for the most part (sans some embarrassingly fake effects like the crawling baby during one of Renton's hallucinations) in terms of cinematography, location shooting and editing (even on a low budget), of which helps to create Trainspotting's unique tone of both bleakness and weird sense of hope, especially towards the end and in certain scenes (like the Worst Toilet In Scotland scene). And even if it potentially dates it somewhat, I do like how it is a great reflection of late 1990s Britain, celebrating both the highs and lows of said culture, making a great historical document in that sense.<br/><br/>But despite this, I'm not a huge fan. Between the lack of a strong plot and any likable characters, Trainspotting may be an easy film to admire, but a very, very hard one to like. It may look very nice and is very well made, but unfortunately has nothing to grab the viewer in terms of anything emotionally driven, a big failing for a drama like this one. So overall, it is OK, but it doesn't hold up as well as it does over 20 years ago. Choose your future, choose life and just choose a better film to watch."

I saw it...and quite frankly I'm glad that I read it first because the movie was kinda weak. The movie bare-boned the plot, left out some of the best scenes in the book (Rents did more than just dive into a toilet in a bathroom), left a couple of pretty interesting characters out completely, and SICK BOY SHOT THE DOG!! The directing and the acting were both very good, but the script seemed to be fueled solely on heroin. The whole movie revolved around heroin, and the book didn't. Heroin was very important to the story, obviously, but that wasn't it. The book actually dealt with the ideas presented by Rents in the all-too-famous opening lines. I felt the movie worked under the assumption that drug-culture IS anti-culture. It's not. The movie irked me in the way that hippies irk me, you're not sticking it to the man by doing drugs.

","OK, so with all of the kerfuffle about ""T2 Trainspotting"" coming out I thought it was high time (no pun intended) that I watch this film.<br/><br/>As it happens, I heard interviews with Irvine Welsh (author of the novel Trainspotting) and Danny Boyle, who directed the film, just prior to writing this review. Both men are engaging interviewees and, had I heard the interviews before seeing the film, I might have had even higher expectations.<br/><br/>Sadly, my expectations were not met. There's nothing even remotely attractive to this film. The characters are not in the least sympathetic. We can't really care about their miserable, thieving lives. They are just a pitiful bunch: Renton, Spud, Sick Boy, Tommy and Begbie. Begbie is particularly odious.<br/><br/>We don't really learn much about life in post-industrial Edinburgh other than the fact that these sad characters spend their time stealing, shooting heroin and drinking in the pubs. Why are they unemployed? Why is there no work? How did they find themselves in this situation after leaving school? Where do they get the money for heroin, other than from stealing? We never find out.<br/><br/>There's a technique that the writer or director (or both) use in an attempt to make these characters likable. They make them well- spoken, using words that we would generally not hear from such low-lifes. This, I assume, is intended to persuade the viewer that they're just like us, but just fallen on hard times. Even better: give one of the characters a quirky interest that he can ramble on about at various points in the film. In this case, James Bond films and Sean Connery. ""Aww, isn't that cute"", we're supposed to think. It's not cute, it's a technique to manipulate the viewer that I despise.<br/><br/>I would hope that no one sees this film as representing a generation that came of age in the 1990's because it is not representative.<br/><br/>Watch it if you must, but be forewarned: it isn't the cultural touchstone that critics will say it is."

","Many films become a massive hit and define the decade and popular culture they are made, this 90s British film is definitely one of the best examples, based on the book by Irvine Welsh, directed by Danny Boyle (Shallow Grave, The Beach, 28 Days Later). Basically in Edinburgh, Scotland, we are introduced to heroin addict Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton (Scotland BAFTA winner Ewan McGregor) and his fellow addict friends, con artist Simon ""Sick Boy"" Williamson; slow-witted, kind-hearted Daniel ""Spud"" Murphy (Ewen Bremner); clean-cut athlete Thomas ""Tommy"" MacKenzie (Kevin McKidd) and psychopath Francis ""Franco"" Begbie (Scotland BAFTA nominated Robert Carlyle). Renton decides to quit heroin and eases the transition with opium rectal suppositories bought from dealer Mikey Forrester (Irvine Welsh), he has a final hit, and a spell of violent diarrhoea, before locking himself in a cheap hotel room to endure the withdrawal period. Renton goes with his friends to a club, his sex drive has returned, he leaves with young girl Diane (Scotland BAFTA nominated Kelly Macdonald) and they have sex, in the morning he is shocked to find out she is a 15-year- old schoolgirl, she blackmails him to stay in touch. Renton, Sick Boy and Spud start taking heroin again, Tommy begins using it as well, as his girlfriend Lizzy (Pauline Lynch) has dumped him, one day their drug taking is interrupted by friend and fellow addict Allison (Susan Vidler) discovering her infant daughter Dawn has died from neglect, all are horrified, especially Sick Boy who may secretly be the child's father. Renton and Spud are arrested after stealing from a bookshop, Spud goes to prison, while Renton is released for entering a Drug Interventions Programme, he is given methadone, but is desperate for a more substantial high, Renton almost dies of an overdose and is taken by taxi to hospital. Following this Renton's parents, Mr. Renton (James Cosmo) and Mrs. Renton (Eileen Nicholas), take him home and lock in his old bedroom to force him through withdrawal, Renton goes through the symptoms, and sees nightmarish images, including Diane singing, his friends giving him advice, the dead baby crawling on the ceiling, and his parents on a gameshow hosted by Dale Winton, with questions about HIV. Renton finally woken from his nightmares and hallucinations, his parents tell him to get tested, he tests negative, despite the years of sharing syringes with other addicts, Renton is in low spirits and depressed, he visits Tommy, who is now addicted and HIV- positive. Renton takes a job as a property letting agent, he is enjoying his life of sobriety and saving his money, while still seeing Diane, however he is annoyed when Begbie and Sick Boy move into his bedsit unannounced, Begbie has committed armed robbery, and Sick Boy is now a pimp and drug dealer. Tommy dies from toxoplasmosis, the three attend his funeral, Spud has been released from prison, Sick Boy suggests a lucrative but dangerous heroin transaction, but Renton needs to supply some of the money, and he tests the heroin for its purity. They sell the heroin to a London dealer for £16,000, they celebrate in a pub, Renton suggests to Spud stealing the money, but Spud is too scared of what Begbie will do, but Renton is finally fed up with Begbie, having seen his reaction to an accidental beer spill, he glasses and beats a man near to death. Early in the morning, as the others sleep, Renton takes the money bag from sleeping Bedbie's arms, Spud is awake and they look at each other as he watches him leave, but Spud remains silent. In the end, when the others awaken, Begbie is in a violent rage and destroys the hotel room, Sick Boy and Spud flee as the police arrive, Renton vows to stay stable, and Spud £4,000 in a locker. Also starring Peter Mullan as Swanney ""Mother Superior"", Shirley Henderson as Gail and Keith Allen as Dealer. McGregor is brilliant as the smart-aleck junkie, Carlyle is stunning as the violent, easily enraged psycho, and the other supporting stars give great performances too, Boyle's direction is stylish and intelligent, it really brings the book to life, the subjects of drug-taking and petty-crime are covered in both hilarious and hard-hitting ways, the film is not afraid to be controversial and at times bleak, but there are the lighter scenes which keep it fun, it is a true original British classic, a must see black comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Writing, Screenplay Based on Material from Another Medium, it won the BAFTA for Best Adapted Screenplay, and it was nominated for the Alexander Korda Award for Best British Film, and it won the Scotland BAFTA for Best Feature Film, and it was nominated for Best Writer. Ewan McGregor was number 9 on The 100 Greatest Movie Stars, Robert Carlyle was number 17, and McGregor number 2 on The 50 Greatest British Actors, the film was number 36 on The 100 Greatest Sexy Moments for the sex scene, it was number 1 on The 50 Greatest British Films, it was number 25 on Film 4's 50 Films You Must See Before You Die, and it was number 33 on The 100 Greatest Films.

The hallucinations and fears in Renton 's detoxification reminded me of the little confusion in Wit Prison Life, no matter how much he loves Zhiyuan, he ca n't escape the end of relapse into prison. Renton, who has successfully detoxified, lived the life of ordinary people, and the arrival of Begbie and SickBoy broke this kind of calm. The indulgence and sinking of adolescence seemed to enter the life of Renton again. The £ 16,000 transaction dramatically prompted Renton to choose the path that most people recognized.

","In my opinion, a movie is truly great when you keep thinking about it. No matter if your mind keeps coming back to a joke that made you laugh for hours, or a scene so sad that it almost had a physical impact on you. I keep thinking of 'Trainspotting', of almost every scene of this movie, and that's one of the reasons why it's a 10 from me.<br/><br/>Another reason is that it all felt so real to me. I'm not Scottish myself, hell, I have never been to Scotland, and I have never set my eyes on heroin. And yet, I could sympathize with the characters' struggle, the emotions and the pain. Also, what I loved to see was that we got morally grey, or even bad protagonists. Keep in mind, protagonist doesn't mean 'good guy', it means the main character.<br/><br/>Now, I have to talk about the main theme - drugs. Everything in this movie revolves around drugs of all kinds, and you have to be prepared for this. I have read a few reviews that condemned the movie for promoting drugs, and I don't agree with this opinion at all. I watched a lot of movies and TV shows with drugs and drug related plotlines, and yes, some of them made me think that drugs could be actually cool to try. After 'Trainspotting' I swore to myself that I will never, ever try cocaine, or heroin, or any of that crap. If someone wants to try drugs after watching this movie, I will be really surprised.<br/><br/>There's not really a plotline during the first half, and we just follow the lives of the main characters. It's not boring though, on the contrary, it's full of feelings and angst with a sprinkle of black comedy. Later in the movie there is a plot that leads to an ending, and it's just as interesting. I think it's all resolved in a fitting way, and one that stays true to the spirit. All in all, it's an emotional roller coaster and an experience that will stay with you for a long time."

","Now a quarter century old, ""Trainspotting"" stands as truly bulletproof moviemaking. Floating in an artistically liberated space vaguely shared with ""Pulp Fiction,"" Danny Boyle's master class matches Tarantino's in its spiritedness, violence, and drug-centricity, yet this 1996 dark comedy is also imbued with an eviscerating, street-level British intelligence, resulting in a legendary film with a fingerprint all its own.<br/><br/>Its structure is freeing and brilliant. ""Trainspotting"" is narrated by Mark Renton (Ewan MacGregor), a young street urchin and smack addict whose habit hasn't diluted the venom he spits at England, Scotland, and shoot-up partners Spud (Ewen Bremner) and Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller). Once they find heroin, they look to find more. But despite that unchanging end-goal, these are brilliantly sketched characters exhibiting a criminality and shiftlessness that perversely endears.<br/><br/>""Trainspotting"" showcases elite storytelling by counterpointing the dehumanization of addiction with elite and vibrant humor.

"renegadeviking-271-528568","9","0","2","29 February 2020"," Trainspotting review
","Next to Independence Day, Trainspotting may be the most hyped motion picture of the summer. Miramax Films, the distributor that saturated the market with ads for The Crying Game in 1992- 93 and Pulp Fiction in '94, has struck again. Trainspotting, which is based on Irvine Welsh's cult novel and is directed by Shallow Grave helmsman Danny Boyle, became a smash hit in the UK during its run there. Miramax, hoping for a similar reaction on this side of the Atlantic, has been shouting from the rooftops, using big, splashy print ads and chaotic TV and theatrical spots to lure in their target audience. The danger is, of course, that Trainspotting's substance will get drowned by the marketing.<br/><br/>""I chose not to choose life. I chose to choose something else,"" says the film's narrator and main character, a twenty-something Edinburgh man named Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor), near the outset of Trainspotting. In rejecting the yuppie culture of a nuclear family, material possessions, a paying job, and dental insurance, Renton is rebelling, but this isn't just the usual disaffection of youth -- it's a deeper, more pervasive dissatisfaction with a culture he views as sick and stifling.<br/><br/>Renton's escape is through drugs -- primarily heroin, but really anything he can get his hands on. He's surrounded by his ""buddies"", a group of crooks, liars, and psychos who are even more twisted than he is. There's Spud (Ewan Bremner), a shy, inoffensive junkie; Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), a vicious, duplicitous con artist who's obsessed with Sean Connery; Tommy (Kevin McKidd), a ""virtuous"" young man fighting the temptation of heroin; and Begbie (Robert Carlyle), a nutcase who gets his thrills from beating up people.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is careful not to present a one-sided view of drug use. After all, why would anyone use the stuff if all it leads to is misery and unhappiness? In Renton's words, to get an idea of what it's like using heroin, ""Take the best orgasm you've ever had, multiply by 1000, and you're still nowhere near it."" There are no worries about the problems and concerns of everyday life, just where the next hit is going to come from. The giddiness of heroin addiction is well-illustrated during some of the film's early scenes, but it's a euphoria that gives way to tragedy.<br/><br/>In the end, Trainspotting has an anti-drug message, but it presents its case through character studies, not preaching. There are a lot of gruesome images, some of which are presented in an oddly humorous context. For example, take Renton's headfirst dive into the ""worst toilet in Scotland"" or Spud's reaction when he wakes up in soiled sheets. In portraying the cycle of addiction -- using drugs, trying to get clean, then giving in again -- Trainspotting recalls Drugstore Cowboy and The Basketball Diaries. Boyle's style, however, is distinctly his own. This is a kinetic movie, where everything, including the camera, keeps moving. This isn't an examination of the Scottish drug culture from the outside looking in, it's one from the inside looking out.<br/><br/>For one hour, Trainspotting is as compelling as any motion picture to be released this year. It's exciting, energetic, thought-provoking, and never lets up. Unfortunately, during the film's last third, the focus starts to shift, and, in doing so, it blurs. Suddenly, after battling addiction for sixty minutes, Renton and his friends become Scotland's answer to Quentin Tarantino's Reservoir Dogs -- a group of inept thieves committing the ""dodgiest scam"" in a lifetime of petty crimes. There's mistrust, betrayal, and bloodshed. But, while this material has some appeal, it's debatable whether it belongs here. For a segment like this to really work, it needs more time and attention than Boyle and screenwriter John Hodge are able to give it. As such, the subplot seems almost like an afterthought, taking the film away from its darker, more compelling material and opening the door to a hopeful, if ironic, ending.<br/><br/>The overlong epilogue aside, Trainspotting is one of the summer's most arresting motion pictures, and not just because of the offbeat visual style. There's nothing new or unique about the story, but it is presented in a manner that reinforces its immediacy and impact. The film makers were determined to make this a street-level view of addiction, not some ""voyeuristic Oxbridge graduate's perception of these people"". In that goal, they have succeeded, and, while Trainspotting is not without its faults, it offers a powerful portrait that all of Miramax's overhyping cannot diminish."

","If you really watch this movie, you'll realize that it does not glorify drug use or drug addiction.

""People think it's all about misery and desperation and death and all that *****, which is not to be ignored. But what they forget is the pleasure of it. Otherwise we wouldn't do it. After all, we're not ******* stupid. At least, we're not that ******* stupid. Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand and you're still nowhere near it. When you're on junk you have only one worry: scoring."" What is it like to have one worry so strong that it consumes every waking hour? ""Because no matter how much you stash or how much you steal, you'll never have enough. No matter how often you go out and rob and **** people over, you always need to get up and do it all over again."" These quotes by Renton give some perspective. Too live this way is tragic.

","Based on the novel by Irvine Welsh, this movie shows you the story the daily lifes of Mark Renton, who is a heroin addict, and his junkie/violent friends in Edinburgh. Heroin is the real reason why they stay together, because when Mark attempts to become clean, he realises there isn't much of in his life and friends that he likes. Becoming clean isn't easy for renton, because of the negatif influence of his friends. So he only sees one way out of his missery, betrayal. <br/><br/>When I first saw this film, I was blown away by the story. I loved how every one of the group is very characterful and has his own specific features: Begbie the psycho, Sick Boy woman addicted, Tommy very honest.<br/><br/>The movie is also infamous for it's disgusting scenes. I really didn't mind these scenes because I think it gives a realistic image of how junkies really live. The movie is know for it's slogan: choose life. In the beginning Mark mocks with this because he didn't choose life, he rather chooses heroin over the daily struggles normal people have. When you have heroin, there are no problems and the only thing you care about is getting more. This is why they care so less about the bad things that happen around them, such as the death of baby dawn. <br/><br/>If you are a really big fan of this movie, I would suggest reading the book. The book features more characters and even more gruesome scenes. <br/><br/>I would highly recommend everyone to watch this movie."

"hwoold","9","0","2","13 April 2018"," Choose a big television, then watch Trainspotting on it
","Trainspotting is a film which plays a precarious balancing act. It's shocking and brutal, yet it's hilarious at the same time. The screenplay is incredibly witty and thought-provoking; the characters are well-rounded and the fast pace makes it very engaging. Its portrayal of drugs is honest, yet the film delves very much into the fantastical. 
The best thing about Trainspotting, however, is the brave soundtrack. Many of the best sequences in the film feature hard drug taking, overdoses, withdrawal symptoms and graphic violence to upbeat 90's songs. Whilst I admit that this sounds like a recipe for potential disaster, the outcome is genius. 
It makes you question basic ideas of friendship and family, staying in your mind even after you've finished watching it, like all great films should. From start to finish, it keeps you guessing as to what will happen next, playing with your expectations and delivering some serious surprises, most notably in the form of Kelly MacDonald's character. 
What I would say is don't watch this if you want a lovely, passive feel-good film. Whilst Trainspotting is funny, the level of humour is dark and the overall tone of the film is quite rightly pessimistic.
If you like this film, I highly recommend Shallow Grave for further exploration of Danny Boyle's work. If you don't, choose life and watch the Greatest Showman or Frozen and have a nice sing."

Trainspotting is set in the late 1980s in Edinburgh. It follows the day to day life of Mark Renton and his ""friends"" who are all addicted to some kind of substance wether it be heroin, speed or alcohol (if you are not okay with drug use and drugs in general then give this one a miss).<br/><br/>With it's low budget feel, electrifying soundtrack and brilliant dialouge this film ticks all the boxes for a proper british cult movie much loved by a generation and generations to come.<br/><br/>The storyline may sound poor and quite frankly disturbing but don't let it put you off if you somehow haven't seen this movie before. Because this movie hits you emotionally more than most others, it puts you into the shoes of these characters who in real life you would turn your nose up at as you walked past them on the street.

","""Trainspotting"" is a 90-minute movie from the UK and this one was released back in the 1990s. It had its 20th anniversary last year and just got a sequel even more recently. This sequel brought back all the key players from the original here, not just Oscar winner Danny Boyle, but also his writer John Hodge and all the key players from the cast including lead actor Ewan McGregor. But this is not just a very British movie, it is also a very Scottish movie, not on the level of Braveheart, but close behind. It has also become a huge cult classic over the years and I am not too surprised it is comfortably inside IMDb's Top250 as really everybody has heard the title Trainspotting and not just since the sequel. But back to this one here: It is basically the story of a heroin addict and we get to watch his attempts to get clean. At the same time we get an insight into the criminal life involving him and his friends that keep raising new obstacles in his way to a better life. So there are many subjects in here: crime, friendship, addiction, love too, although it really isn't in the middle of the action at any point.<br/><br/>I find it interesting to see how the careers of the protagonists continued in the two decades since this came out. Some made it big, starred on Star Wars or won Emmys, while for others (and not too few) this movie here is still the career-defining work. Not a surprise though given the film's status. One would be John Hodge, the writer I mentioned earlier because he scored an Oscar nomination with his screenplay here, nothing really to be taken for granted as I can see American audiences and awards bodies struggling with the material here. But I guess class prevailed. Oh yeah, I really want to mention the many James Bond references here and this film is definitely a nice little tribute to 007. I am a huge fan of the latter, so these inclusions were one reason why I liked the first 45 minutes more than the second 45 minutes overall. Sure the ending was pretty great, but before that there was a great deal of mediocrity at times sadly. This is a bit strange as there was a lot more happening in the second half than early on. The beginning was really more of an introduction to the characters and their backgrounds and I felt that story-wise there wasn't too much happening, at least not compared to the later parts of the film. Maybe it was Boyle's talent that made the film stand out when it stood out the most. I can't deny I like him. Overall, this 1996 film as well as its recent sequel were good, but not great films in my opinion. I recommend them both."

It's dirty, gritty but most importantly human. <br/><br/>Cinema should not be easy- some of the most loved and adored films are those which butt heads with the audiences morals. (e.i. Pulp fiction, Leon)<br/><br/>As a Brit it is almost a right of passage to watch this film but that may be the films downfall. A lot of the comedy and key elements are centered to British society. Then again British films never are very universal. <br/><br/>In short Trainspotting is a gift to cinema and tackles the difficult subject matter with grace and in a way which is accessible to the audience (at leas the British audience) I can not recommend this movie more, especially in the new age tidal wave of passable Hollywood movies."

The technique applied, and very well applied here by the beginning director Danny Boyle, we have a fast and fleeting assembly, alienated with a series of cuts and different plans that pass, euphoria, sadness, depression, joy and solitude, the director knows how to use in the Different scenes, as for example in the trips of Reanton, where we have several quick cuts to pass its euphoria, and open plans to pass its solitude and closes to pass the climate of its degradation, all this in a scene. Consequently we have a great mix of sound and a soundtrack that mixes from this pop to classical music, and this mix is ​​great and talks to every feeling of the montage. All the performances here, no exceptions are wonderful, all the actors seem to have been born for the role and could not be different, it would be ridiculous to quote everyone, but they all perform completely wonderful performances. The film has problems, of course, is not perfect, the lack of direction in its script is one of them, but it is a great film, which attracts generations for its aesthetics and attracted me by its direction and performances, is said young classic."

","This is the most unique film and one of my favourite films that I have ever seen! Reasons? Film contains a huge message and on the other hand there is quality humor, very remarkable quotes including first and last scene, brilliant music from the 70s rock n roll up to 90s club house and techno music, and ""easter eggs"" that are hidden in the film. I have read the book also so I like how Boyle focused on just one of the problems from the book and screened it in sort of the funny and brutally way and showed all the consequences that drug abuse brings. It is mature film but I think that because of the message of the film even younger people should see it. And remember, the world's changing. Music's changing. Even drugs are changing. So choose watching this film if you haven't by now and then watch sequel to see how the gang changed! 10/10"
"eskwarczynski","10","0","1","6 April 2017"," Vibrant, hilarious, tragic – sometimes all at once.
","Trainspotting is a strong entry from visionary filmmaker Danny Boyle.<br/><br/>Much like the drug-induced dreams of its characters, Trainspotting manages to be vibrant, colorful, hilarious, tragic, and gut-wrenching - often all at once.<br/><br/>With a slim hour and forty-five-minute runtime, the narrative rockets forward at a breakneck pace. However, in spite of the leanness and speed, no character feels shortchanged. Each arc is treated by Boyle and the writers with the necessary respect and attention - especially when it comes to Renton's (played wonderfully by a young Ewan McGregor.)<br/><br/>Not since Malcolm McDowell's Alex of Clockwork Orange has such a despicable character been so watchable or come across this - dare I say - likable.<br/><br/>Perhaps this attraction to the character is because Renton is sadly a mirror image of whom we all have been at some point. Sure, we may not be heroin junkies looking for ""one last hit."" But we have all made promises to ourselves to rid ourselves of some vice after that ""one last time."" Like it or not, Renton is us. He is a human being. Depraved and unable to ""choose life"" - no matter how much he may want to. He will always be driven by a quest for pleasure - regardless of how unsustainable or finite that pleasure may be.<br/><br/>Overall, Boyle's powerhouse directing, an incredible cast, and strong imagery make Trainspotting a unique and necessary cinematic experience."

"mistoppi","10","0","1","2 March 2017"," If I had to choose...
","...a favourite movie from the year I was born, it would definitely be Trainspotting. <br/><br/>The first novel I read by Welsh was Filth, and his writing style is absolutely fascinating. With Filth I was bored and then watched the movie and realised holy s**t, I wasn't even at the important parts yet. So I returned to the book and while I had already seen the movie it still was able to blow my mind. <br/><br/>Welsh, whose last name will never stop being amusing to me, is a really brilliant writer. One of the best things about Trainspotting is its dialogue. I haven't read Trainspotting as much as I'd want to, but I have a vague idea how much of the dialogue comes from him. The dialogue has a weird charm. It sounds real, like what you and your mates could talk about, but also makes you feel like why can't your conversations go like that. But still it's not entirely like Tarantino's dialogue, which is realistic, but also sometimes there's no point. With Trainspotting there are typical, realistic conversations about... whatever, but also there's a lot of plot related dialogue with some really witty notions here and there.<br/><br/>What seems to be typical to Welsh's style is that he takes his time. It takes a while to understand what it's about, or it takes a weirdly long time to get to the things the summary at the back cover said about the story (The bedroom secrets of master chefs). It's kind of the same with Trainspotting as a movie. It's hard to say what it's about without being vague about it. ""Oh it's about young men in Edinburgh struggling with drugs and such"". Yeah but what happens? It's easier to just know the whole thing.<br/><br/>Trainspotting's way of portraying drugs is also interesting compared to many others. Either movies are trying to praise drugs or they are trying to make them seem like devil himself invented them. In Trainspotting they tell straight out what's good about drugs while some of them try to get off it. Like drugs are obviously bad, it's not like anyone's hiding it, but they're also very clear about why it's so hard to quit, and how even after quitting you can still relapse. <br/><br/>I love surrealism in Trainspotting. Sometimes it just feels like a special effect. Sometimes it feels like it's strongly related to what's going on, how the characters are feeling. It can distressing or it can be really hilarious.<br/><br/>The soundtrack of Trainspotting is iconic! There are so many brilliant songs that reflect the time and also suit the story well, instead of being just separate sounds in the background.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is a masterpiece. It's a true cult classic and I'll be forever bitter to that one friend of a friend who claimed that Fear and Loathing portrayed drugs better but eh, she turned out to be junkie few years later, so what can you say?"
"CinematicInceptions","7","0","1","5 June 2016"," Entertaining characters in a story of the dangers of loyalty.
","More dangerous than the addiction to drugs in this film is the addiction to a lifestyle. We can see that breaking a heroin habit, while not a very easy task, is one that Renton can do with relative ease. However, he keeps going back to it for the same reason: his friends. Now I don't like to believe that you are defined by or even overly affected by the company you keep, but it certainly holds true here. While Renton sees all sorts of reasons to leave his friends he just can't seem to do it. Even when he tries moving to England, Begbie and Sick Boy are right there. He also is not the only one who has become subjected to this unhealthy loyalty, as Tommy says after relating the whole billiards episode with Begbie ""But he's a mate. So what are you gonna do?"".<br/><br/>Each of the characters is very distinctive and entertaining in their own way, though none of Renton's friends generate sympathy like he does. I found Spud the most entertaining to watch with his baffled expressions. Begbie might have been more entertaining if I could hear past his accent. The friends all stick together despite their differences, which sounds very touching on the surface, but it's actually quite sad. This is why I felt happy for Renton at the end when he steals the money from them. I don't know whether it was right, I mean stealing is not generally accepted as the right thing to do. But I think it was absolutely necessary for Renton to end his habit. He doesn't need or even really want the money, but the only way he could get away from his self-destructive lifestyle was by way of a betrayal.<br/><br/>The plot mostly consists of Renton going through cycles of trying to get clean, and getting sucked back into the world of drugs again by various means, sometimes his own and sometimes circumstantial. Throughout we get development of the mad world that he lives in and the love-hate relationship that comes with his addiction. Some of the drug scenes can be disturbing, but I was expecting much worse. I was glad that all of the three hallucinations were unpleasant experiences for Renton because that made them less disturbing. As Renton says, he and the other addicts hate the side-effects, but it's not enough to deter them from taking more.<br/><br/>The pacing keeps you interested as the scenes move fast, which might make up for the slower-moving plot. The cinematography and editing are also nice additions that improve the overall atmosphere. I thought that Danny Boyle's directing was more worthy of an Oscar nomination than the script was. Not that the script was bad, but it just wasn't amazing. The actors seem to do a nice job, but don't give very noteworthy performances.<br/><br/>I will admit that I was a bit disappointed with the overall story. It was good, but just not what I was expecting. Primarily, it's entertaining, but the ending is somewhat inspiring. Renton's bookending monologues can be life-defining if you want them to be. There seems to be a slight caution in how much one can ""choose life"" as Renton outlines some of the more excessive points of stereotypical middle-class life. If you don't like drug culture and hallucinations and such, I wouldn't worry too much about that. I hate that sort of thing and wasn't really disturbed by anything shown here. If you have an addiction that you're trying to break, this might help, but I doubt it will be miraculous. If you're just looking for something good to watch, this ought to satisfy. Overall Rating: 7.7/10."

","The movie tells us the story of Renton, who's a heroin addict, and want to quit the habit, but his will fail several times in the movie.<br/><br/>I thought this one was going to be a non-watchable-depressing- Requiem-For-A-Dream-British-movie, and I was so wrong. There was just one thing of the movie I never get, the The Worst Toilet In Scotland scene, it was masterfully disgusting, but I didn't really get the point of Renton swimming in an ocean-like toilet. I figured it was some kind of metaphor, but honestly, I didn't understand it. Might be my mistake or the movie's.<br/><br/>Anyway, when you compare this one to Requiem For A Dream, you realize there's no reason for doing it. Especially when it comes to the elements the movie use to invoke the viewer's feelings. In here, you sympathize with the characters, you expect them to climb out from their holes of addiction, and you have hope (or at least with the main character). You even, somehow, believe they (or he) don't have a problem because Rent managed to quit his habits. The movie gave me a clear message: choose your path and your actions, but considerate this movie, when the drug-use decision come.<br/><br/>Considering the message the movie wanted to give, and the message actually given, I'll score it with 9 out of 10. I feel the movie didn't go too deep into realism of the drugs use, but gave us a masterfully written and very important lesson: DON'T USE DRUGS, CHOOSE LIFE."
"sandnair87","9","0","1","4 February 2016"," 'Trainspotting' is like Speeding Through The Digestive Tract of An Insatiable Beast!
","Trainspotting is a rambling chronicle of high times in low company. By turns cheeky, surreal, exhilarating and stomach-churning, it follows assorted days in the lives of mangy Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor who is absolutely brilliant as the smart-aleck junkie) - a degenerate boil on society's backside - and the scabby crew of junkies, deadbeats, thieves, liars and nut jobs he calls friends. These characters are not duped by evil drug pushers, but consciously choose drugs over the banality of well, pretty much everything else. But these personalities, like the settings — bile green apartment walls and the blood red den of their dealer - are stylized and get a sudden and shocking reality injection straight after a catalog of hilariously catastrophic encounters. Renton tries to get his life back on the rails, but the nightmares of his past follow him even to London where he snatches despair from the very jaws of hope. Fittingly, he and his unwelcome flat-mates return briefly to their Edinburgh roots to bury another heroin statistic, before a coach trip back south for an amateurish, pathetic drug deal - selling rather than buying, for once, and for one last thrill. It all goes pear-shaped, naturally, and no one is surprised, because by now the message is sinking in: heroin is for losers!<br/><br/>But in the hands of Danny Boyle and the fantastic cast, it is possible to receive that message as an unprecedented and unrivaled piece of entertainment – it would be hard to imagine a movie about drugs, depravity, and all-around bad behavior more electrifying than Trainspotting. Though the bulk of the humor is blacker than a raven's wing at midnight, Boyle's sense of humanity persistently creeps in around the edges making the movie a singular sensation. While getting the squalor and degradation of the junkie lifestyle down to the last grotesque detail, he captures the stoned-out, gut-sickening experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity.<br/><br/>The film is peppered with harrowing sequences where you will find yourself trapped between a belly-laugh and a scream, as the characters rail, chuckle, shout and dive into darkness. Sample the scene where Renton loses some suppositories down a toilet in a squalid off-track-betting washroom and dives into the crud-encrusted porcelain after them, suddenly swimming through the clear waters of his opiated imaginings. Buoyed by a great Brit Pop soundtrack, agile cinematography and rich, earthy dialogue that gushes like a ruptured sewer, etching characters deeper than any laughter lines -''Take the best orgasm you ever had, multiply it by a thousand, and you're still nowhere near it,'' reports Renton, describing his high – such scenes make the movie a searing pop-art portrait of a lost generation blowing out its brains.<br/><br/>All in all, Danny Boyle's Trainspotting is a blast of ice-cold water across a sweaty brow where the bleak subject matter is presented as a hilariously funny walk on the wild side, with no moral stance taken or punches pulled."

","The movie Trainspotting may be single handedly, one of the most influential films to come out of the 1990's. For the artistically-inclined teens, who helped make that decade memorable, it taught a bevy of life lessons. <br/><br/>One: don't do Heroine. Two: Get HIV Tests. Three: Don't do Heroine when you have kids. Four: How to deal with quitting Heroine... i.e., why the hell did you start doing heroine---leads back to Lesson 1.<br/><br/>The following life lessons can be applied to all forms of drug use. <br/><br/>Lesson Five: There are tiers of drugs to use. (now go back and read lesson 1 and apply to all drugs, except things like caffeine*).<br/><br/>The horror of the detox and the desperation of the nature of addiction is portrayed through ever character and aspect of the film with brilliant subtleties that speak to even the most intelligent users. There is no telling how many in the US were prevented from following the same path that was later noted briefly by us as a period of disarray in Scotland itself at the time. <br/><br/>The key was the laughter. The dark humor, is like the sickly sweet oil slick on top of a cup of ill prepared Turkish Coffee. It's good and addictive, despite the filth and manner in which the viewer is subjected to the harsh realities of poverty stricken/teenagers: of UK's middle class. Subtitles may be necessary for those not formerly introduced to the highlands via other means. But if you ignore them, you won't miss a thing.<br/><br/>Th Cult Classic was often hailed as Ewan McGregor's breakthrough performance, even if he had been around a bit before then. The narration makes the movie. His fellow cast-mates often steal scenes from him. He does little, but, *eye's them accordingly. <br/><br/>-Sick or ~seck~ boy: The Linus to Charlie Brown often comes to mind. Until, his mind is gone. See lesson 1.<br/><br/>-Renton's Girl: The powerful young girl: the sparkling tin to his foiled conscience. (he himself told her to see lesson 1) After.<br/><br/>-The Abstaining Couple: Brilliant portrayals of everydayness.<br/><br/>-Renton's best friend: Still leaves me sad to this day with a single glance up, as the bag goes out: i quoth his eyes 'don't leave me'.<br/><br/>-The man who appears later also saying Scottish swear words in other films: Unintelligible hilarity, punctuated by hyperactivity which induces great fear and immediately brings to mind lesson 1.<br/><br/>-The Guy who looks almost American (blonde): Dies of HIV. See lesson 2. Then See Lesson 1 again. He showed us, even Scottish jocks were vulnerable. He transformed from Happy healthy to dead, in only a few scenes, but he was a huge key player in the normalizing of the view across the ocean. <br/><br/>There is a second storyline that draws the viewers in for the ""kill"", or allows them to become apathetic enough to receive the ""lesson"". It is also about couples, and teens and turning into twenty somethings. The hardest transition anyone has to do in their entire life, is go from home, to the unknown. A few of us made it because of this film. <br/><br/>Some complained it glorified drug use. I vehemently disagree."
"brianberta","8","0","1","27 January 2016"," A daring film which shows the highs and lows of drug use
","This movie is a reminder of the highs and the absolute lows of heroin use. It is not for the faint of heart, but it's worth viewing as it's well-acted and well-written with great characters.<br/><br/>Mark Renton is a heroin addict who loves heroin and its effects on him. After getting into another brush with the law, he tries to quit heroin as he feels like it's having too bad of an impact on him. However, he keeps on being dragged back into it as every attempt he tries, doesn't work for him. As his addiction increases for him, he and his friends experience the many horrors of drug use.<br/><br/>What makes this film special and unique is that it's a daring depiction of drug use. It is never too afraid to show the absolute highs of drug use, but it is also not afraid of showing the absolute lows. It isn't afraid to show Renton and his friends having good things happen to them as a result of drug use. However, it also isn't afraid to show the absolute lows and negatives that it brings to you. It contains many sickening images and horrifying hallucinations, especially the ""baby on the ceiling"" which is one of the most terrifying scenes I've seen in any movie before. This is a good approach to a drug film because it doesn't take any sides. In this movie, most people are in the issue of drugs in-between. To a non-addict, they will likely see the film as a strong message to them that the consequences are far more worse than the few good things they give you. To an addict, however, the consequences will always seem outweighed by the thrills and benefits that doing the drug gives to them.<br/><br/>Mark Renton is played expertly by Ewan McGregor. His performance pretty much sums up the experience and consequences of being on heroin. When he's high on heroin, he sounds like he couldn't be any happier. When he's not high, he both sounds and looks like he doesn't know what to do and he just wants to get high again. Then, when he says ""this will be the last time"", he continues to do it and the process continues. He plays his role perfectly and smoothly.<br/><br/>Also, Robert Carlyle as Begbie plays a magnificent role as well. He plays an insecure, borderline psychopath who will fight anyone who gets in his way at any chance he gets. His outbreaks in the film are realistic and unnerving and his performance never seems overly-serious and he never overacts in each one of his outbreaks. In one of the scenes near the end, it shows him beat up a man at a bar for accidentally spilling beer on him. The sense of anger on his face and his tone of voice are really unsettling and his facial expression is very haunting and it sticks with the viewer for a long time. These 2 performances stick out the most, but most other performances in the film are great as well.<br/><br/>However, what I really love about it is that it's an honest portrayal of the drug scene. People who say that it glorifies drug use are incredibly wrong and need to watch it with a more open eye. However, people who say that it is an anti-drug film are missing its point too. This isn't about the rights and wrongs of drug use. This is about the addict. He doesn't have to be someone who tells us that heroin is bad. In the movie, the drug addict never tells us that drugs are terrible. He just says that he wants to stop doing it.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this is a very memorable and a well-made drug film. It's a daring move for it to show the absolute highs and lows of drug use. Also, it has very great acting performances in it as well. I don't think it is as effective as Requiem For a Dream since that movie was mainly focused on the absolute lows and nothing else, but its daring choices are what make it such a great movie which stands out amongst most other drug films."

He and his friends decide to kick the habit, but it doesn't last long and they all soon end up going on a heroin binge. During the binge, Tommy is dumped by his girlfriend and shows his interest in starting to use drugs and a fellow drug addict and roommate of Renton and his friends finds that her infant child is dead. The shock of finding the dead baby due to the groups negligence is too much to bear and they fall deeper into their habit. Renton and Spud get caught stealing, spud is taken to jail for six months and Renton is ordered to drug detox. Renton's urge for one last hit pushes him to find his dealer for one final hit but he overdoses. Renton's parents take him from the hospital and lock him in his room where he is forced to clean up his act and shake the sickness of withdraw. Soon after Renton moves to London and starts a job but one by one all of his friends find him and drag him back into their crazy lives. Sick Boy sets up a drug lucrative drug deal but needs Renton to provide 2,000 dollars. The drug deal goes successfully but Renton realizes he has to get far away from his friends after he realizes he's outgrown them and wants nothing to do with them or drugs anymore. Renton flees town with the money but leaves 2,000 dollars in a locker for Spud. <br/><br/>The film is good, with some interesting imagery that aids in showing the depth of drug addiction and how it consumes an individuals life. For instance the scene in which Renton digs into the feces filled toilet in search for pills but end up sliding all the way in and swimming down to the bottom as if it were a lake to get the two small pills. The film also uses a lot of dark light to evoke depression. The film is much similar to Requiem for a Dream, which also highlights how addiction consumes the soul and the pursuit for better things in life.<br/><br/>""I chose not to choose life. I chose somethin' else. And the reasons? There are no reasons. Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"" - Renton"
"tomgillespie2002","9","0","1","28 September 2014"," Still one of the most important films to come out of Britain
","Has Britain ever produced a film so influential on pop culture? Whether it be the stylish posters, portraying it's various colourful characters in a manner of poses, decorated with that eye-catching use of orange and white, the use of title cards at the beginning of the film introducing us to the various junkies, thugs and pushers who inhabit the film, or that memorable soundtrack, which tapped into the underground rave culture of the 1990's, Trainspotting was the most iconic film since 1994's Pulp Fiction. But, an alarming 18 years on, does Trainspotting still maintain it's raw power and grimy hipness? The answer is yes, with a touch of no.<br/><br/>Most of the controversy surrounding the film at the time was it's unflinching, and some would say glamorous, portrayal of heroin addiction. The opening 15 minutes is a relentless, highly energetic introduction to the Edinburgh drug scene, where addict Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor) informs us of the delights of heroin, a life choice for the characters in the film as opposed to the 2 point 4 children suburban life we're all meant to be striving for, where washing machines, dental insurance, and electric tin openers are necessities. Why does he prefer to spend time shooting drugs with a bunch of low-lives, sat in the squalor of a drug dealer's house? Who needs reasons when you've got heroin, Renton tells us.<br/><br/>But the style doesn't eclipse the substance. Director Danny Boyle, making his second film after the excellent Shallow Grave (1994), is wise enough to keep focus. Renton's life is fascinating and sometimes exciting to watch, but it doesn't make us want to move to a council estate in Edinburgh and spend time with these types of people. Renton's closest 'friends' include pimp Sick Boy (Jonny Lee Miller), an expert in James Bond trivia; the speed-addled Spud (Ewen Bremner); the clean-cut, weight-lifting Tommy (Kevin McKidd); and the sovereign-wearing, utterly terrifying psychopath Begbie (Robert Carlyle). And with heroin, comes destruction. Boyle shows us an overdose beautifully scored to Lou Reed's 'Beautiful Day', and a truly ugly cold turkey scene.<br/><br/>But the film has becomes a victim of it's own stylish choices. Back in 1996, Trainspotting felt fresh, exciting, and slightly dangerous, but it's been ripped-off so many times in such a lazy and poor fashion that it has become slightly dated. Just three years ago, another Irvine Welsh adaptation, Ecstacy, adopted the same poster layout as this. Don't get me wrong, Trainspotting is still an excellent film, it has just lost some of it's youthful vigour and confrontational attitude that served it so well almost two decades ago. McGregor is excellent: a charming, charismatic, yet often repulsive narrator akin to Malcolm McDowell's Alex DeLarge in A Clockwork Orange (1971), and his mug will no doubt decorate the walls of many a student house for years to come. Still one of the most important films to come out of Britain, just a slightly damaged one.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","22 June 2014"," One of a kind cinema from Danny Boyle
","""Trainspotting"" is a British film based on the novel of the same name by Irvine Welsh (who has a bit part in the film). The story revolves around a group of heroin addicts in Edinburgh in the late 80's. While that hardly sounds like a barrel of monkeys, the movie is nevertheless primarily a comedy with dramatic overtones.<br/><br/>John Hodge's adapted screenplay won a BAFTA award and received an Oscar nomination as well. It shows both the allure of drug use for these individuals (in a word, escapism) but it also shows the stark reality of how it affects their lives for the worse. The movie has a redemptive quality (for our hero, at least) but it isn't preachy. The plot's liberal dose of comedy helps to keep things loose but, on the whole, the movie also has a satisfying dramatic arc.<br/><br/>A major part of the movie's success lies in the vivid performances of the principal actors. First and foremost, in the lead role, Ewan McGregor made a star-making turn as Renton. The actors who played his group of friends were each distinctly memorable as well. For me, Robert Carlyle is the standout of that bunch. The movie also features the introductory role of Kelly Macdonald, as Renton's love interest.<br/><br/>Of course, without Danny Boyle's direction the movie probably would not have made as much of an impact as it did. His visuals are always interesting and make the most of the attractive cinematography and production design. His choices for soundtrack selections also showed keen insight, including memorable uses of Iggy Pop's ""Lust for Life"" and Lou Reed's ""Perfect Day"" (to name just a couple of standout tracks).<br/><br/>However, despite all of the movie's pluses, I'm unsure of its widespread appeal. It can't be denied that some of the dialogue is a bit hard to follow (at least for a North American audience). That being said, I still think that anyone and everyone should see this movie for the striking visuals, cool music and absorbing story."

"david-klompas","8","0","2","24 March 2014"," Drug fueled fantasy meets Fight Club style madness
","Danny Boyle is definitely one of the more interesting directors in Hollywood; most of his filmography suggests a man struggling to deal with some kind of perverse relationship with suffering.<br/><br/>And of all his films, Trainspotting is the one which best exemplifies this strange need. Without a doubt Boyle's magnum-opus, this drug infested romp through the underbelly of Scotland takes us on a wild ride that is equal parts black comedy and plain strange and disturbing. <br/><br/>Renton (Ewan McGregor) is an Edinburgh lowlife scumbag trying desperately to throw off the rags of heroin addiction. But no matter how hard he tries, there seems to be no getting rid of the syringe. <br/><br/>McGregor gives the performance of a lifetime - he grabs us by the balls and refuses to let go until the final frame has disappeared. Trainspotting launched the actor straight up into the big time, and it isn't difficult to see why. One only wonders why there can't be more actors with the intense need to please the audience in such an intensely perverse way. <br/><br/>Trainspotting is a film that must be seen in one sitting, and that you will want to see again. The problem is that it is so disturbing, you won't really be able to watch it again. <br/><br/>And that is what makes it such an exciting film."
"kmcloone96","8","0","1","8 March 2014"," Brutally in-your-face drama
","Becoming something of a British cult-classic, Trainspotting successfully brought a relatively young Ewan McGregor into the public eye and told a gritty and realistic story about hardcore drug use. Ewan plays a young man called Renton, who is severely addicted to heroin amidst the Edinburgh drug scene. Fairly early on, Renton attempts to escape the vices which hold him by going 'cold turkey'...but fails on numerous occasions. All around him, Renton consistently sees his friends succumb to the allure of hard drugs; each with varying outcomes. It isn't till a life-threatening incident which causes Renton's parents to intervene, that a light at the end of the tunnel begins to appear. <br/><br/>There's no doubt that Trainspotting is a brutally in-your-face portrayal of what taking drugs will lead to. At no point does it advocate or glorify the abuse of substances, not too dissimilar to the incredible Requiem for a Dream. There's a single shot of the film which will now be permanently burned into my mind, and rightfully so, because to say this film is ""one-sided"" would mean condoning the use of substances, which has consistently been shown to lead to disastrous outcomes. <br/><br/>Despite all this, Trainspotting is also a slightly humorous black-comedy, with comedic moments placed throughout. That's not to say it's a laugh-a-minute film that'll have you smiling from start to finish, far from it, but certain characters such as Renton's friends Spud (Ewen Bremner) and the scarily aggressive Begbie (Robert Carlyle) occasionally provide comic relief to alleviate the very dark tone. <br/><br/>The only real problem I have with Trainspotting is that it doesn't really wrap-up as conclusively as I'd have liked it to. I expected to have some sort of conclusion to at least the main characters, but sadly that doesn't happen. The ending is far from bad, it just isn't as definitive as I would have expected it to be."
"nrocksdrums","8","0","1","24 February 2014"," Great movie overall
","Danny Boyle's 1996 film Trainspotting presents a wildly entertaining yet moderately disturbing look into the toils of living life with a drug addiction. An array of recurring patterns and themes throughout the movie present a viewer with the honest truth about drug addiction and a number of the horrors that accompany such a lifestyle. Though drug addicts are often looked down upon in society, and many will agree that they should be, Boyle's film represents a sincere and almost sympathetic point of view regarding the path down which many individuals travel in the pursuit of an unhealthy but ever powerful drug addiction. Despite the fact that the movie contains a number of disturbing scenes and scenarios, they are an attempt to force a viewer to face the reality that drug addiction is a sickness of its own that holds many captive against their will. Ultimately, it is through the use of interesting character development and subtle symbolism that the 1996 film Trainspotting presents a disturbing, yet brutally honest depiction of the horrors of drug addiction and the consequences that result from choosing such a path in life.<br/><br/>The first, and perhaps most terrifying message illustrated within the film is the idea that despite all that may result from living this particular lifestyle, a drug addict never seems to have enough. Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) highlights the lengths to which addicts will travel in order to feed the monster inside of them that is a powerful addiction. The opening scene, along with many others in the film, displays the characters robbing, fighting, and running from the police simply in an effort to pursue their next hit. One scene that caught my particular attention regarding this message is when we see Mark Renton sneaking into his parents' bedroom to steal money from under their mattress. The idea presented here is that a drug addict and a normal human being are simply incomparable in terms of moral values. Once the addiction has grown to the point that is highlighted in the film, all moral values become inexistent, and as Renton describes in his narration of the film ""Who needs reasons when you've got heroin?"" (Trainspotting 1996). This idea is the driving force behind the actions illustrated within the film, and leads to the infinitely long downward spiral that is a drug addiction. The movie also utilizes a number of symbolic scenes to highlight the fact that an addict is always chasing their last hit. After Renton procures the suppository pills that, at the time of the scene are his alleged last dose, they fall into the disgustingly dirty toilet presented in the beginning of the movie. The following scene, in which Renton climbs into the toilet to find them, is a hallucination that is very significant to this idea. As he swims through the water in this strange hallucination, the idea presented is that Renton is chasing his last hit before he will quit for good; a process that we later find out never ends for most. Although his plan to stop using for good fails, this strange scene depicts this idea perfectly. Steven Rea writes in the Philadelphia Inquirer that ""Brian Tufano's agile cinematography captures the stoned-out, gut-churning experience of hardcore addiction with hallucinogenic acuity."" which I find to be a perfect depiction of this message. Another important message that illustrates the terrors of such a horrible addiction is the theme that choosing heroin means not choosing life. Michael Wilmington of the Chicago Tribune describes Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) as a ""guided tour of a specific hell"" in his review of the movie, which is certainly an accurate representation of the lives of the characters. The movie begins with Renton's satirical narration that encourages the audience to ""choose life"" (Trainspotting 1996), as he sarcastically mocks the commodities that accompany such a decision. However, as Renton explains towards the beginning of the movie, when he is not using heroin there is simply too much to worry about. The characters are presented with a startling revelation that they are in fact human with the death of Allison's baby, yet react in a very inhumane way. As Renton stands there observing the dead baby, he explains that he cannot think of anything ""human"" (Trainspotting 1996) to say in such a situation. Instead of offering sympathy or compassion, Renton simply utters ""I'm cooking up"" (Trainspotting 1996) and offers Allison a hit as well; a symbolic representation of the fact that heroin is the only outlet they have to deal with the many stresses of living a drug-free life. In my opinion, this is one of the most startling aspects of the life of addiction: the fact that a combination of chemicals has the power to cover up the pain of life, and death in this situation. While many will argue that Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) is a groundbreaking film that will certainly be remembered as a classic, in my opinion it is simply a grotesquely honest representation of the lives of drug addicts. While Danny Boyle's character development and use of symbols throughout the movie effectively illustrate the horrors of drug addiction, Trainspotting does not do much else. As a whole, I would give Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) a rating of four out of five stars although I do not believe the individual aspects of the movie would receive such a high rating. Trainspotting (Boyle 1996) is certainly worth watching for those that are interested to learn more about the lives of drug addicts, but may not be as entertaining to those who are not."
"willcundallreview","8","0","1","24 February 2014"," A funny but dramatic piece on drug fuelled Scotsman
","Trainspotting(based on the book by Irvine Welsh) is just a Great movie and one which many consider a cult classic which blends comedy and drama, darkness and light heartedness and also show's you the perspective of the drug user and how he thinks and acts and then what a whole group of them can be like. An excellent movie with potential to rise higher and here is why I think so below.<br/><br/>We'll start with the story which is well different to many other Drama's in the sense it nearly could have a little comedy genre under it's title as some parts can be quite hilarious. The film is also very serious as well and as you will see if you watch it, part's can be hard hitting and you see the hard effect drugs have on the addicts and the one's they love as well. I loved the ending I am sure you will too as out of the bleakness some parts can be happy and in a certain way philosophical too, with Ewan McGregor's character showing us his mind and what he thinks' about life and it's adventure's.<br/><br/>Danny Boyle the director and future Oscar winner(he won for Slumdog Millionaire in 2009), does a great job here and make's the fine actors he has at his disposal even more dramatic and his artistic vision I think came off the way he wanted it too. The screenplay is fantastic and all thanks to John Hodge who is unknown in truth but this film wouldn't be what it is without it really. The film's set's are also fantastic and the heroin dens are superbly set out to make the film authentic and a strange city in Edinburgh which you really ever connect with drug addicts.<br/><br/>McGregor is great in the main role and even his voice as the voice- over is fantastic too. The supporting cast are also fabulous with particular praise going to Robert Carlyle and his fairly insane character who seriously should not be angered. There isn't really a truly clear villain in this but you could say that in the end the drugs were the villain stopping the characters from living a truly normal life and whenever any of them try to give up, they get sucked back in again.<br/><br/>If any bad come's from this film in a critical sense it is well, well, it is hard to find wrong's really but I guess at the beginning there is the humour part of it but from the middle till the end the film get's very serious. I won't write too much because it is hard to be critical, this isn't my favourite film of ALL time but nonetheless it is still hard to criticise.<br/><br/>Recommend the film for those who like a film that is drug fuelled and that makes the world seem dark then bright and then back again to being bleak. I think many won't like the drug part because it has serious drug taking and a lot of swearing so not for those who don't appreciate 18 rated films but generally if not I think anyone who like any films can love this.<br/><br/>Overall it was safely Great, it wasn't quite near being superb in my opinion but nonetheless pulls away from just being very good. It has potential to be much better but that is for you to work out, it is a film where you can sit and sit back well and just enjoy an excellent piece of Drama."

For some reason I never thought he had that in him having only watched some of his more modern films. Loved the feel of the film that had that ""This Is England"" setting to it and Danny Boyle does such a good job on a small budget, which again surprised me, having watched Slumdog and 127 hours.

I saw this movie not knowing anything about it so when they start shooting heroin in to there body that threw me off completely seeing Obi-won doing drugs why wasn't that in Star Wars.<br/><br/>The plot is about these drug addicts living in Scotland and how these guys deal with there addiction. Now this isn't depressing at all they add funny moments mixed in with intensely dark moments. The main character is played by Ewan McGregor and all he is trying to do is kick the stuff but of course it is hard because he is addicted and he has friends who don't want to kick it you know peer pressure. If you can't tell this is a character piece.<br/><br/>The characters all have there own problems, one is a psycho path and will fight and attack people for no reason at all. Others are so addicted they will land in jail or just throw away there whole life just to get one more hit. Ewan McGregor is the character you want to see get a normal life and get out of this mess so when you see him make these bad decisions or thrown in bad situations you truly root for him to get out.<br/><br/>This is directed by Danny Boyle who has made some great films such as Slumdog Millionaire and 127 Hours and this one is up there not his best but certainly nothing bad. The film is based on a book so but I never read it so I don't know if it is a accurate adaptation of the book.<br/><br/>Overall this is a great movie on the struggles of drugs and wanting a normal life.

The detox sequence is crazy; it made me never ever want to do drugs. I think this movie is definitely worth watching, but is certainly not for the faint at heart. P.S. I really love all the accents. Sean Connery isn't the only one with a sexy Scottish accent! I'm a sucker for anyone with an accent. Scottish ones are cute, they sort of sound like they are from space.

","In Britain, during the 90s clubbing was at a high, literally and drug abuse was a regular problem concerning the government. Pop culture was pushing the limits and changing the way many people on the drug scene were used too. The problems were being told through the news, the radio and the newspapers frequently. Then in 1996 an independent British film hit cinema, causing uproar, controversy, worldwide success, critical acclaim and even government mention, this film was called Trainspotting.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is based on a novel by Irvine Welsh which charts the life of a bunch of non-existent losers who're living their lives to their ""supposed"" full on the Edinburgh drug scene. The film charts the issues of poverty, crime and anti-social behaviour that are still alive in Britain today and shows the horrifying problems of drug abuse that the public-eye attempts to be unaware of. The film exposes the bunch of nasty, yet somewhat hilarious group of stoner's lives and how Renton (Ewan McGregor) attempts to find a true meaning to his chaotic and miserable life.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is not a film that will appeal to everyone; it's graphic, nasty and harrowing. Yet, it retains from wanting the viewer to stop watching and manages to hold you throughout the entire running time. A film's content can, in some cases occupy the film's story and make you lose any pity, affection or remorse for the characters. Trainspotting manages to disgust, while still informing the viewers of the problems from drugs.<br/><br/>For a film that is so startlingly daring and distressing at times you'd be surprised that it manages to make its point so clear and authoritative. A factor that caused controversy on release was that the film is not afraid to say ""drugs are good at first"", but then the film goes on to saying ""but it's not worth it because the side effects will screw you up forever"". It's an excellent message and one that alerts any viewer not to ever go near drugs, yet people have ignored the true meaning of the film which is held within some of the horrific imagery and experiences. If there is one that film that will make you never want to take drugs its Trainspotting. It really will make you think twice and also help you understand why people do such repulsive and then why drug abuse is wrong. Trainspotting is not a film that is preachy, it says you have one life which you should use with care and how you should realise the consequences of your actions. So at heart Trainspotting is an unforgettable and mesmerising study of wasted life. It succeeds in making its viewers come out learning and understanding one of the world's many unpleasant problems.<br/><br/>If you didn't see these characters going through such disturbing events the film would not have such a poignant message and one that shows so many devastating outcomes of the drug abuse. Trainspotting has many iconic and memorable characters that're acted out with the utmost sincerity, yet some remain oddly charming. The characters are hysterical at times and for a film full such shameful people you still manage to hold pity for their decaying lives as they spiral into a living hell. The characters are very complex, though at first they seem simple and you gain an indisputable understanding of every character for a film that only lasts 90 minutes. Trainspotting is a film that has been highly influential to cinema as a whole, sparking off many films to come out of the genre and some films even using the same visual delights. For example in Guy Richie's magnificent Snatch, the characters are introduced in a similar way to Trainspotting and this is just to name one of many influences. Danny Boyle is an imaginative director with a brilliant trademark style to accompany his films.<br/><br/>A film like Trainspotting is extremely exhausting because of its disturbing and what could have been an unbearable explicit nature. Because the film is at times highly amusing and visually glorious with its matchless ambiguity you'll not want to turn it off, even in the most disgusting moments. Though the film is at times flawed in the plot structure and has a few plot holes, the cinematography washes over the viewer with a somewhat mind-numbing quality. The dialogue is brilliantly paced and laced with pop culture references, studies of British social class and haunting narrative from the almighty, career-launching performance by Ewan McGregor. Trainspotting's soundtrack is another high-point and remains entertaining, quirky and also flawlessly fitting to the scenes it accompanies.<br/><br/>It's a film that truly lays bare the problems of youth and drugs, showing the genuine effects with the needed explicitly and yet remaining solid entertainment from the comedy factor. A true gem of British, 90s cinema which unflinchingly depicts the lives of the no-lives in their cruel and deceitful worlds they've climbed into. Trainspotting has heart and works as an educational roller-coaster of pure realism that still shocks and teaches viewers the horrific affects of drug abuse. Trainspotting is a film that will never leave you which is ironic considering it's about addiction and affliction. Trainspotting is a film that terrifies me and should succeed in making anyone want to keep clean. We all know drug abuse is awful, but Trainspotting succeeds in showing its viewers why."
"extravaluejotter","9","0","1","23 July 2006"," It's very good but where were the trains?
","The only criticism that can be levelled against ""Trainspotting"" is that there is only 1 train in it. I'm sure that there's a good reason why the film has this title despite its low train count but I'm too thick to ""get"" it.<br/><br/>I can only imagine what real trainspotters (that shrinking group of anoraks huddled at the end of railway station platforms with their timetables and cameras) make of a movie like this. They probably sit there in gleeful anticipation of a 2 hour-long treatise on the joys of sighting a Deltic in the sidings at Runcorn, then their faces drop as they realise they're watching a film about drugs.<br/><br/>Yes, ""Trainspotting"" is most definitely about drugs. Not only that, but about people who really enjoy taking drugs. The film's triumph is that it makes you sympathise with most of these thieving, scamming skag-heads. <br/><br/>Ewan MacGregor had already impressed us in another Danny Boyle film (""Shallow Grave"") but his performance in ""Trainspotting"" as Mark ""Rent Boy"" Renton marked him out as a true movie star. No less impressive is Robert Carlyle as the psychopathic Begbie, and the whole cast never falls below the level of ""Bloody Good"" in the acting stakes. Even variable turns like Johhny ""Sulky Pants"" Lee Miller and Kevin ""Carboard"" McKidd put in credible performances in their supporting roles. Ewen Bremner's Spud is a stand-out character and this fine Welsh actor fills the screen in every scene where he's given space to do so. Even non-acting novelist Irvine Welsh turns in a good cameo as opium suppository peddler Mikey Forrester.<br/><br/>Comic, tragic, shocking, surreal, violent and pathetic (mostly all at the same time), ""Trainspotting"" is unique. Nobody had managed to tell a story about drug taking in quite this way before, and plenty of people have fallen flat on their faces trying to borrow from its success since its release. 10 years on, I can still quote a huge chunk of Renton's ""Choose Life"" opening monologue. Me and a lot of other people, I expect. I've never been into hard drugs, but ""Trainspotting"" gives me the feeling that I know more about heroin addiction and its effects than I really ought to.<br/><br/>Shame about the lack of trains, though."

","This is a totally honest film. It does not try to shock or be confronting. It instead tries to provide us the viewer, an honest and realistic view into the average life of the average Scottish heroin-addict(s). It's all done in an unique and entertaining way and the movie is made with lots of style and humor. It doesn't make ""Trainspotting"" a terribly heavy movie to watch but more of a realistic, non-forced entertaining one.<br/><br/>Perhaps the greatest thing about the movie are its characters. All of them are unique and fun in their very own way. This was Ewan McGregor breakthrough role and he perhaps plays his very best role out of his career. He is very powerful and credible in his role. A great main- and interesting character. Robert Carlyle plays a sort of Scottish version of Joe Pesci in this movie. He has some ultra-violent outbursts at times but for the rest of the movie he at the very same time is a lovable and hilarious character, that often works as a much needed comic-relief. Other fine roles are being portrayed by Jonny Lee Miller, Kelly Macdonald and Ewen Bremner.<br/><br/>The movie does not only concentrates on what happens when you're a drug-addict but also what happens after you got clean. I love it that the movie also shows its honest and objective perspective, on this realistic story-elements. Nothing that happens in the movie feel forced or predictable and therefor everything that happens in the movie works out great and convincing.<br/><br/>But honestly the movie is more entertainment than anything else really. The pace is high, the characters are silly and some of the situations and dialog are often hilarious. ""Trainspotting"" might seem like heavy stuff on first sight and even though it does have its serious and heavier moments, it remains mostly an entertaining movie to watch throughout its entire running time but yet at the same time, the serious anti-drug message comes through and works fine.<br/><br/>Definitely a recommendable movie.<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

","The last time I watched this movie was before I left the UK for California, and that was in 1997. So it's got to be at least 8 years since I last saw it. My membership of that online movie rental company whose name I won't mention, has allowed me to track down and re-watch semi forgotten classics. A couple of weeks ago it was Cinema Paradiso, this weekend Trainspotting, and quite honestly, I'd forgotten just how good a movie it is. And now my teenage kids are old enough to watch it too, but they weren't in 1997. It's a very British movie, and after 8 years of living here, I can understand why so many of the American commentators didn't like it. Black humor and irony just don't go down well here. That's not intended to be a criticism, just a fact. Other people have said that they are ""too old"" to appreciate or understand it; well I'm 50, so I don't think that's a good enough excuse! <br/><br/>Even after all these years, it's a movie that still has the power to shock, because it's laugh out loud funny in places and horrifying in others, and it's the juxtaposition of the two that makes it work. What we see are a bunch of losers. They are selfish, asinine, scruffy and lazy no-hopers, dumb beyond belief after a British education, given to petty criminality to feed their habit, and living lives on the margin of society. They possess nothing of beauty or value as it's all been sold or pawned, they have a neglected child and live in filth and squalor. Heroin is their lives, they are utterly amoral and, as they are presumably consenting adults, we wouldn't give a toss about any of them except, of course, that they are funny in that dumb way that only total losers can be, and they might even be sleeping with our daughters and there's that baby haunting the film. And of course the worst of the lot, mad, psychotic Begbie, isn't even a junkie. ""Wouldn't touch that filth,"" he says as he downs another pint and pulls a knife on his fellow drinkers. At least I think that's what he said.....<br/><br/>When Renton, the brightest one of their number, kicks the habit with some tough love from his parents, and starts a fresh life in London, he still can't escape as the rest follow him there. He steals the proceeds of their one big deal, and finally makes off with the filthy lucre. Is it theft if you steal from thieves? I can't quite decide why I like this movie so much. Maybe because it's just so uncompromising. Maybe because it's just so British. But it's worth fighting your way past the accents and it bears repeat watching. It was also interesting to see an early performance by Kelly Macdonald who went on to give such a very good performance in Gosford Park. She should be more widely known here. Maybe 2006 will be her year?"

","The movie ""Train Spotting"" is an anti-establishment film that plunges into the reality of a serious drug addiction. The film takes its name from the leisure activity of so many Scottish youth, identifying trains and having the schedules memorized. It is a fitting metaphor for heroin addiction, something that kills time but achieves absolutely nothing. ""I chose not to choose life. I chose to choose something else,"" says the film's narrator and main character, Mark Renton (Ewan McGregor). What Renton chose was heroin. The story is about where it took him.<br/><br/>The film starts out with Renton and his four friends living in a crazy life of criminal activity and not caring about anything. The life style that is depicted early in the movie is very amusing and seems fun but when things start to go sour the bitter truth arises. When one of his friends' babies dies from neglect, Renton starts to come to grip with his problem. Although there isn't much of a story to the film, the final act does try to set up what will probably be Renton and the gang's final ""scam."" When Renton tries to go straight, he has trouble doing so. Everyone he associates with begins to hit rock bottom, Renton himself hit rock bottom when he overdoses on heroin. Broken from his addiction, he lets his family help him recover from the terrible affliction. He finally sees the destructive nature of his addiction and the friends he lost and of the lives drugs destroyed. <br/><br/>I liked the move and its one-sided view on drug use. It depicts the chaotic life style well and the film deserves two thumbs up. One thing I did not enjoy about the movie was its lack of a solid story and how fast paced it is. When I watched it I became confused with what was going on, which lead me to the similarity of the chaotic nature in the film, to the real life experience of an addiction. I also think that the movies' major flaw is its' eagerness addresses too many issues through its use of clever symbolism. I enjoyed this film because i saw it as being very real and I could relate to the ideas the director was trying to imply."

I heard that some people criticized the movie just because it glorifies the usage of drugs at some points well if you can't portray it in both ways you cannot create an art.

","Trainspotting its an excellent movie about the real hardship of drug addiction and the consequences ""Death"" and in the entire movie from the opening scene to the end you are presented with characters and the situations that are taking place at this very second, and its scary to think that the contents of the movie are actually happening which is why the brilliant book by Irvine Welsh was criticised by many (In my opinion) its due to people not wanting to realise the severity of whats happening in the world, Back to the film there's a heavy sense of dread and depravity throughout the whole set but if you consider each circumstance then the heavy theme of degradation seems light hearted and that I feel allows you to almost laugh a little at certain parts of the movie, for example I felt Begbies character was hilarious but in the book he's not he's a proper hard case even worse than the film but the scenarios Begbie gets are almost funny as you can just imagine someone doing that in a snooker hall, I know there are scenes where he acts a complete Psychopath but just down to what he says and the way he acts around his friends, Sick Boy for example on the train with the cards he forgot to bring, and Sick Boy's face just drops and he looks like a bitter child caught snooping for Christmas Presents, The way in which Begbie is able to be comfortable in being a complete Nut Case is explored into a little more depth in the book.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is not a comic take on a hard subject its an open genre take on a hard subject, its often close to the bone and in that not as much offencive more affective as everything in the film happens throughout the drug fuelled dead end lifestyles many have to endure, Its one of my favourite movies of all time and the book is my favourite book because both are strong and are real they don't turn away from the deprivation of what is life Trainspotting is a 10/10 movie that is not for the light hearted but a must see film for whenever your mature enough Peace"
"nickypz847","10","0","1","3 August 2005"," The Movie is About Outgrowing Your Friends First, Drugs Second
","I think the easy thing to do is to paint this picture with a broad brush and say it is about drugs. A more accurate thing to say would be that this movie is about a young man (Renton) outgrowing his home and his friends, leaving them behind to pursue a better life.<br/><br/>The movie got noticed in large part because there were those that said it glamorized drug use. Well, yes, drug use IS glamorous and fun, sometimes. If it wasn't people wouldn't use them, but lots of people do. Of course, with that lifestyle comes risk that can result in tragedy(Tommy), or difficult withdrawal (Renton). For many though, using drugs is just something you do as a young person, a product of having too much idle time, and no responsibilities and/or prospects, and doesn't really come with any dramatic result or end to it (as is the case with Sick Boy and Spud).<br/><br/>Ultimately though, this story is not about drugs. The main plot point of the movie is Mark Renton slowly realizing that his association with and loyalty to his loser friends is dragging him down, and that in order to cast off the limits his dead-end life in Scotland has set on him, he needs to get off drugs, move to London, and make a new life.<br/><br/>When his friends follow him there, he is faced with a choice of slipping back into mediocrity with them, or screwing them over and in the process cutting ties with them forever. He concludes he is better off without them, which he is, and steals their money, realizing full well and probably happy that it means he will never see them again if he has anything to say about it.<br/><br/>Like another movie made shortly after, ""Good Will Hunting"", this is a movie about a young man in a bad situation learning he can make something more out of his life if he goes his own way. It's not as touchy feely as GWH, but it is the same general concept."

Ewan McGregor did a very good job as Renton(my friend and I both agree he is a very underrated actor). But I must say the standout performance is Robert Carlyle who plays Begbie, a cold fiery fight picker.<br/><br/>I was so in love with the bright color scheme this film used. Especially the club scenes. The cinematography was great. The Worst Toilet in Scotland scene was so well done. The cinematography made me so claustrophobic, sick, and bewildered all at the same time. A very surreal scene. Also, GREAT MUSIC!<br/><br/>There are scenes in this film that are very scary. Trust me you will no which ones. I know a lot of people will disagree with me when I say this but I thought this was better than the very good Requiem for a Dream.<br/><br/>I know I probably should not put this in my review but I feel so strongly about this I have to. I'm sorry to say this, but if you thought this movie was pro-drugs; you are an idiot, plain and simple. If you cannot see this movie is anti-drugs, you are a very ignorant and narrow-minded person. Sorry, needed to get that off my chest.<br/><br/>The only fault I find with this film is a very awkward one. I usually complain that a movie is too long, but I think Trainspotting could have benefited from being longer than it's 94 minute running time. Oh well. Whatever.

Some of the scenes, such as the baby crawling across the ceiling, are amazing. Trainspotting also managed to launch quite a few careers. Would Ewan Mcgregor be starring alongside one of the biggest actresses in the world in Moulin Rougee without Trainspotting? I think not. What about Robert Carlyle and Johnny Lee Miller? How many of us had heard of them before Trainspotting? The film itself is about a young Scottish heroin addict, who hangs around with a group of fellow addicts. As the film progresses, Renton (Ewan Mcregor) becomes more and more dependent on the drug. After a bad experience of cold turkey, he moves down to London. Unfortunaetly he cant escape his past, and in particular one character Begby, who is, in my view, the scariest person in cinema history."

People who don't like or understand this film are probably the same stupid people who get their news from tabloids or who think Britney Spears is a talented artiste. Why do I love Trainspotting so much - it captured and still captures the absolute alienation and cynicism so many millions of people feel, living in a cold, soulless, heartless, commercial chain store-dominated state answerable to no-one, which you are forced to be part of, often against your will. It comments magnificently on the hypocrisy of society (""my mother in her own socially acceptable way is ALSO a drug addict"") and the ignorance of the ""moral majority"" towards drugs. Drugs are complex things - heroin DOES have some redeeming features - so deal with it! The serious message is offset by a very dry and intelligent humour, which still has me in stitches today - often the greatest mirth is to be found in the most profound despair - Our PC times try to deny this but it is true. This says so much about Britain and our lack of naiveté - the contrast with other European countries is starkly illustrated.. Above all though this is a profoundly moving film - which explores the sheer extremes of the human soul. For me it is up there with Casablanca, Some like it hot and Taxi Driver as one of the all time great films. Superb acting, top soundtrack Underworld ""Dark Train"" a techno classic and above all a poignant message."

We get to know the main character well enough to know his intentions and instincts. As opposed to some movies that go along with the ""Delusion over Addiction"" theme. The artistic design on this movie is no where near expressionism nor is it glamorous. its just about a guy trying to become clean from the drug scene.

","I first saw this film on a grainy, seventeen year old TV with a 14 inch screen and awful speakers - and even then I thought it was an exceptional piece of cinema. On a second viewing, this time with surround sound and a bigger screen, I was even more impressed. The film has razor-sharp casting ( Ewan McGregor as Renton and Johnny Lee Miller as Sick Boy are particularly good) and an intelligent screenplay - both of which are absolutely essential in making a film stand out from the tick the box insipid trash Hollywood oozes upon the world. However, the cinematography, editing and soundtrack are thrillingly, excitingly original, and credit for that must surely go to Danny Boyle. <br/><br/>Confusing and surreal use of colour and detail on walls (for eg the opening shot of the wall with ""Welcome to Mother Superior's"" and the door of the Volcano Bar as Diane exits) keep you involved and intrigued, while the more surreal incidents (Renton's swim in the toilet and later ""leap"" from the wall at the pub to Mother Superior's floor) give the story a fevered tinge of unreality that drags us into the heroin nightmare without detracting from the naked realism. There is also clever use of Steadicam and hand-held shots (my favourite is as the taxi pulls up at the Emergency ward.)<br/><br/>Indeed, Boyle's directorial style in this film reminded me strongly at times of Stanley Kubrick - particularly his use of swoopy Steadicam shots down corridors and through maze like doors. Unfortunately, however, this gets out of hand at the Volcano bar, with the Steadicam shot advancing slowly on Spud and Tommy sitting, legs sprawled, under the ""Moloko"" signs on the wall nodding a little too strongly to Kubrick's striking beginning of ""A Clockwork Orange"". Come to that, elements throughout Trainspotting reminded me of Clockwork Orange, from Begbie's insane acts of ""ultraviolence"" in the pub and the ""droog"" like relationship between the five main characters to Renton's comment to the judge ""Thankyou Sir, with God's help I'll beat this terrible affliction,"" and later ""I'd never been so lonely, never in all my puff,"", all of which sound straight out Kubrick's 1971 masterpiece.<br/><br/>All in all, this was a satisfying film, presenting the horror of heroin addiction without lecturing the audience (we are not invited to judge the actions of Renton and his friends, just to watch their lives ""p*** away"" to nothing.) Had I seen this film at its original release in 1996, I would have thought Boyle an exciting and highly promising new director; with the benefit of hindsight, having seen the insipid ""The Beach"" and ""28 Days Later"", which was merely adequate without being bad or excellent, I wonder instead what went wrong.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>PS Did anyone else notice the awful continuity error: When they first enter the hotel room to do the big drug deal, there is no vanity mirror and light above the sink. Later, whilst the others are sleeping, Renton looks at himself with a mirror and light that have materialised above the sink. Spooky...."

","If I was to call Trainspotting anything, it wouldn't be miserable or very powerful. It would be a whole lot of fun. This movie makes me happy all the way through it where I think Danny Boyle was going for a more powerful touchy feely vibe so it would hit its audience hard. I can see his point of showing what heroin really does to a person but to me this film would do nothing other than turn people onto the drug. A film like Requiem for a Dream, that would turn put you off Heroin and any drug that possibly exists in this world. <br/><br/>Shallow Grave was a fantastic little gem that spiralled out of nowhere to entertain us to the max whilst also putting us into a corner with these three likable characters for them to turn out to be completely different to what we had thought, well almost anyway. When I saw shallow Grave I really thought the UK had found it director to take us into the new millennium as a great country who makes exceptional films and in a way he has. Shallow Grave was great, Life Less Ordinary was odd but very good, The Beach I found entertaining and very watch able as did 28 Days Later which is Boyle's most interesting film and then Trainspotting which comes after Shallow Grave really which is a film that follows the life of a small town Scottish lad trying to get through the days with his struggle of heroin with his outcast mates. Ewan McGregor takes the lead as Renton with Johnny Le miller, Kevin Mckidd, Ewen Bremmer and Robert Carlyle who out actors everybody on the screen when his character Begbie comes into the story.<br/><br/>Overall the movie is mad to watch and fun at the same time with one or two powerful moments that may stay with you or not but to me this wasn't very powerful at all, just had a few messages to give out but that does not make this film a bad one whatsoever.

","First I should say that I saw this on a new DVD called a Collectors' edition (or something similar). Included was an option for captions, which helped a lot with the Scottish accents. This is a very grim story lightened at times with comic dialogue and situations, but the viewer carries away only a feeling of horror. Drug addiction and what it does to the lives of all it touches, including infants, is the overriding theme. At the same time one also feels the horror of day-to-day life for these young men with little faith in themselves and despair at the dead end of their young lives. Ewan McGregor is particularly fine as Renton, the man who seems to be succeeding at making a life for himself without drugs, but this is up to question at the end of the film. The rest of the cast demonstrated great skill at ensemble playing, a tribute to the director."

","We have a group of young male friends that include 2 sociopaths (Sick Boy and Begbie),a dimwit (Spud), and two fairly normal guys, Tommy, and the main protagonist, ""Rent Boy"" (McGregor). All except Begbie are heroin users, which is portrayed as an alternative to lower middle class ""normal"" life in Scotland. Tommy decides to give drugs a try and quickly comes down with AIDS. Begbie (Carlyle)is a really distasteful violent criminal with no redeeming qualities. The other characters are interesting due to the dialog rather than anything inherent in their characters. Anyone who likes dark British humor (eg, Naked) will find this entertaining, at least to a point, as I did. There is some very funny dialog, as when the boys are out on a scenic countryside walk and one exclaims that the air is so clean, and another replies that when you live in a ""shite"" country like Scotland, the clean air don't enter into it. Rent Boy tries to get clean, gets a job, but is ultimately pulled back into the crime and drug scene by his friends. Whether he ultimately escapes is anyone's guess. At the end of the film, my feeling was similar to the one I had for Requiem for a Dream-- namely, things evolve pretty much as you would expect for a group of heavy drug users. Trainspotting, however, has far better dialog than Requiem which really carries the film, although I did not find any of the characters interesting in themselves. I give this a 7 out of 10.

First of all, it is not a drug glorifying movie, as little as a somehow realistic movie about war can be war glorifying. The drug abuse is simply an outcome of the situation the people are in, the chaos of the postmodern world, which has so much to offer, or has it? Choose job, choose carrier, choose family, choose life, choose life insurance.. that's what life is about? I just read an interview with Paul McCartney, and he said that all his life, he hasn't tried anything but to escape ""real"" work. Unfortunately, no-one of the characters in the movie are anyway near as talented as McCartney, so what do they do to escape the formula their parents are stuck in? They do what they can with their limited brain capacity; party, see movies, listen to music, take drugs, party, have fun, take drugs, avoid work.

"mar_vz84","Null","0","1","29 May 2004"," Boyle's film shows us that to have a job and to consume heroin aren't compatibles.
","Trainspotting is a film based on Irvine Welsh's novel. The story takes place in Edinburgh (Scotland), one of the cities with the greatest AIDS rate in the world.<br/><br/>It told us about a group of Scottish friends life who are heroin addicts. They live obsessed with the possibility of catching AIDS virus.<br/><br/>Their addiction is a problem to find a job, the protagonist, Mark Renton, and his friend Spud try for a hotel porter's job. To calm Spud's nerves, Renton offers him a dose of speed, leading to catastrophic results at the interview. I consider it is one of the most interesting parts of the film because it shows us that to have a job and to consume heroin aren't compatibles. But it isn't the only disadvantage of consuming heroin or even other drugs, I think health problems are the most important consequence.<br/><br/>Other of the most interesting parts of the film is the recuperation of Renton, when his parents bring him home and imprison him in his room. Some time later and after some panic attacks, Renton is cured. But finally, he consumes heroin and all kind of drugs again. I consider it is a real good example of two different lives: one, when Renton consumes drugs and sinks several times into the floor because of heroin overdoses; and the other one, after his recuperation, when he gets a job and has a good life.<br/><br/>Boyle's film shows us the chaotic world of the heroin users in modern Scotland.<br/><br/>Trainspotting is in my opinion one of the best films I've ever seen."

","I find it hard to review a movie like 'Trainspotting'. The reason for this is that I can understand why people do not like it. I did like it. Actually, I think it was very good. I do not agree with people who say that this movie is pro-drugs. It has a more realistic view than most movies that deal with this subject and that fact alone makes it worth watching. After 'Trainspotting' I thought I understood a little about addiction to heroine.<br/><br/>Although it deals with a serious subject 'Trainspotting' is a comedy. I never laughed out loud very hard but with a lot of moments I found myself smiling. Especially the character Begbie (Robert Carlyle) had some great moments. He is the only one not addicted to heroine. The main character is Renton (Ewan McGregor) and he is surrounded by Spud (Ewen Bremner), Sick Boy (Johnny Lee Miller), Tommy (Kevin McKidd) and Begbie. We see how they use their heroine, how they try to stop doing that, how they do nothing at all, how they live.<br/><br/>This movie could be very boring. The actors make part of the movie work, director Danny Boyle takes care of the rest. He has made the movie into a cool video clip that lasts an hour and a half, never boring. This is probably the main reason why some people don't like the movie and I can't blame them. The style here is one you can like or hate, it is just a matter of taste. Again, I liked it."

","Trainspotting has got to be one of the best movies that I have ever seen. It had a tight story, cool characters, and awsome direction from Danny Boyle (28 Days Later, The Beach).<br/><br/>It tells the story of a group of friends who are: Renton, Begbie, Tommy, Sick Boy, and Spud. All of these guys are trying to make it in the real world on their own. Except, they are homeless and decide to crash at whatever place they can find for the evening. Plus, they're heroin addicts. And as the story follows closer with the heroin addiction, we become focused on Renton who decides he's going to give up heroin for good. Except with the influence of his friends, he'll be back to addiction in minutes. Plus, all of the guys put their heads together for a big scam with Begbie in the lead.<br/><br/>I must say that this movies bears a striking resemblance to A Clockwork Orange with the themes and characters, etc. But this movie is very electrifying, entertaining, and very very hilarious at moments.

","`Hello. I'm Irvine Welsh and I claim to know all about drugs.' That's what Irvine Welsh would say if you met him, thinking that he was all cool and clever. Well if I met him he'd probably say something different. Oh yes, he'd say something very different indeed. Actually he'd probably call security like most celebrities do, or tell me to put some clothes on. However, I wouldn't listen because I'd denounce him for the fraud that he is. Here's why:<br/><br/>In his fantasy film (because that's what it is, a fantasy! Just like Mary Poppins, The Wizard of Oz or The Patriot!), a man called Renton tries to get off drugs by locking himself in a room with some cans of soup, some porno magazines and an old mattress. Oh yeah right! <br/><br/>Thanks to stupid Virgin Airways and their overly sensitive cabin staff, I've kind of adopted this Koala. For reasons beyond my control the Koala ate about £9000 worth of crack cocaine on a flight from Australia and somehow didn't die. Well I threw it in my parent's spare room with all the required components (as per that liar Irvine's instructions) and sat back waiting for it to go cold turkey. But guess what? It didn't work!<br/><br/>What did happen was my parent's cat (who I hadn't noticed was on the bed) got all jittery and, well, the RSPCA have been onto me again. Technically I did nothing wrong and it was that little Aussie crack-head that should be going to court and not me. But apparently the police around here don't arrest marsupials, or so the community welfare officer told me. Like I believe anything she or Irvine says anymore.<br/><br/>In summary, I quite enjoyed some bits in Train Spotting', like the bit at the beginning when Renton's saying, `Buy a car, buy a house, buy some gloves, watch some TV, eat some food, lay down, learn to swim, buy some cheese...' I thought that was quite useful information, but he soon stopped saying that. There was also a bit with a baby that got stuck in a gravity well, but that's all I can think of. The bits with the drugs seem very dated and out of touch with normal people's experience of narcotics, such as mine.<br/><br/>As I understand that taking drugs can sometimes be called chasing the dragon' I will use my dragon related marking system and give it only 9 points. That's 9 points less than the excellent Pete's Dragon' but a good 2 points more than Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon'. I would also like to stress that there are NO DRAGONS IN THIS MOVIE. Hear that Ang? That's called honesty."

Painful scenes portray the widespread superficial understanding of the depth of the issues surrounding substance abuse and the devastation, despair and lack of control felt by the abusers and by those around.<br/><br/>Consequences and matters of trust are demonstrated effectively, though there is no judgement and often the brutality of the subject is seated against tragic, tender and even funny moments.<br/><br/>The focus of most of the characters' efforts are singularly related to getting kicks - whether through substances, behaviour, or sex.

This is partly a cult film with all sorts of indie shibboleths and counter-cultural references; and partly an art film, with splashy sets and studied camera work; but mostly this is a full-blown commercial seduction of contemporary youth, worthy of the talent of somebody at, say, Sony or Pepsi or even the WB.<br/><br/>The opening theme (actually voiced over) is the idea that heroin or any really demanding addiction is preferable to ordinary life, an intriguing but stale notion designed to shock the bourgeoisie. The central theme proclaims that a heroin addict is just another kind of junkie, along with your cigarette, cola, beer, sex, grease, etc. junkies. (Bingo!) Yet at the end we see, as one might discover by watching PBS, that money will out. Kinda reminds me of what Omar Khayyam asked about wine nine hundred years ago: ""I wonder...what the Vintners buy/One half so precious as the stuff they sell.""<br/><br/>Here the answer is clear: money itself. Closing theme: money triumphs over heroin; money is the power god of heroin.<br/><br/>I guess something like that is the commercially correct ""message"" of this film.<br/><br/>Ewan McGregor is excellent in the leading role as a junkie who is as cute as your brother, with fine support by Robert Carlyle, who plays a bantam who likes to cut people. The script by John Hodge is partly unintelligible, which is good; and the direction by Danny Boyle combines cartoon fantasy with stark realism, slick horror with black comedy, in a manner sure to be imitated.

My Brit friends tell me that the term ""trainspotting"" is shorthand for ""losers,"" and that is of course what these guys are. But as Renton explains throughout the film, aside from the pleasure of smack, it offers direction and purpose.

There has been a lot of hubbub about whether this film glorifies drug abuse or truthfully ""tells it as it is"", or that it even carries a stern ""don't do drugs"" message.  I think that this discussion entirely misses the point, and that Trainspotting (the film) takes neither of these three attitudes.  It simply uses a fascinating (yes, squalor on celluloid mostly IS fascinating, end of discussion!) setting to showcase several interesting and entertaining episodes, the bottom line being entertainment, as opposed to documentation, education or political statement.  There is no morality here.  War movies use a war setting, detective movies use a crime setting, and who would claim that ""American Pie"" was a truthful portrayal of American high school and college life in the early years of the third millennium?  Expecting Trainspotting to break the mould and be both brilliant entertainment and a brutally honest documentary wrapped in one is simply asking too much.

Like attracts like, therefore, when one changes, like will then be attracting dislike, or its opposite, until it likewise makes adjustments therein.<br/><br/>As the main character's female friend advised him, ""You've got to find something new"", he partially did so, but failed to cut all of the strings, resulting in more addictive-like behaviours and his submission to his conditional friend (the friend's conditions) allowing himself, his life, and his home to be victimized.<br/><br/>A key phrase in the movie was made by the star, ""For the first time in my idle life, I was almost content"".  Some valid theories on addiction are that addicts come into the world in a state of restlessness, irritability, and discontent.<br/><br/>The movie closes on a positive note with the main character's statements: ""The truth is I am a bad person.  But that's going to change.  I'm going to change.  This is the last of that sort of thing.  I'm cleaning up and I'm moving on; going straight and choosing life"".<br/><br/>An overall positive movie illustrating the difficulties some individuals have with acceptance of life in the everyday, ordinary 3-D reality."

","I thought that this movie was very good. I hate Jonny Lee Miller, but I still really liked the film. The film is very innovative with it's camera angles and storytelling, and includes great acting with a great story and a surprisingly suspenseful ending.<br/><br/>Robert Carlyle was good as always. And this film made me a big fan of Ewan McGregor, who is a mirror image of Malcolm McDowell by the way.<br/><br/>Which brings me to the only downside, which may be a big one. This movie is just like 'A Clockwork Orange.' I don't discredit anyone for making the story though, because completely new ideas are damn near impossible to come up with these days, but that is a pretty obvious problem.<br/><br/>I give this film an eight out of ten, and I think this film did the only thing it possibly could to make it better than 'A Clockwork Orange,' which was to add an exciting ending, and an official climax."

","´Trainspotting´ is my number 138 movie. ( outta 750 about ) It is a good film about some maybe 20-year-old guys that are addicted to drugs. I think Ewan McGregor does a good job in this film, while the other actors are OK or bad. Some scenes are a bit disgusting, but who cares? <br/><br/>All in all, I rated ´Trainspotting´ 8/10. If you want to compare this one to ´Kids´ ( 1995 ), Trainspotting is way better."

","Having read the book I can honestly say this is a very good translation into film - though it does provide a very commercial narrative unlike the book, which is more like a series of anecdotes.<br/><br/>A very big advance in film-making from Shallow Grave, the same team now seem to have gone backwards with The Beach - which sucks in many ways."
"Foopy-2","7","0","5","11 August 2000"," Fun but not profound
","Well, I don't know.  I was expecting the same kind of profound statements on drug use here that I found in ""Drugstore Cowboy,"" but for me it was more of a fun look at drug culture.  The visual imagery, use of color, and surrealness of the protagonist's hallucinations are superbly done and a joy to watch.  The fecal humor, on the other hand, is not.  Human excrement is about the only thing in the world that really sickens me, and there are two or three scenes in this film that never made me want to take a crap again. I think the film could've evoked that yummy fecal imagery in just as effective a way if it were left to the viewer's visual imagination instead of being thrown in our face (literally), but that's just me... I'm probably just a chicken that can't stand the sight of poop.<br/><br/>Personal problems aside, the performances are great, many of the (non-fecal) scenes are incredibly funny, and I like the fact that the film has neither a pro-drug nor anti-drug attitude.  Rather, you get equal parts of both sides, a feel of both how great and horrible it would be to be on heroin.<br/><br/>But what made this movie ""fun"" rather than ""profound"" for me was, I think, the fact that I never really got attached to any of the characters--they were all very enjoyable to watch and had interesting and extreme personalities, but they were all portrayed as caricatures rather than as three-dimensional individuals with emotional complexity.  This is partially due to the perspective through which we're watching the film--we see the world through the eyes of a heroin addict named Mark Renton.  He's always referring to his companions as his ""so-called friends,"" meaning that his friendships are ones of pure convenience.  As a result, none of the characters ever have an emotional conversation with one another, or reveal any honest emotional content at all.  The advantage of this was that I was really detached from the characters and had the ability to laugh at their misfortunes, but the downside of it was that I couldn't really relate to any of the characters at all because of it; my lifestyle and outward behavior is completely different from theirs, and I never got a chance to look into their head because they never expressed their thoughts or feelings, so I just couldn't relate.  I suppose that Renton is a possible exception to this, since the film is told through his point of view and we hear all his thoughts.<br/><br/>So, I guess my only valid complaint about the film (the poop problem is just a personal ""pet peeve"") is that I can't relate to any of the characters except Renton.  Everything else about the movie makes it really fun, but not too profound or insightful because I just can't perceive most of the characters as human beings.  Maybe that will change on a second viewing, though.  As it is, however, the film is definitely worth watching for its superb visuals, its caricature-like individuals, its humor, and its portrayal of drug culture... Though for me, it's still not as blatantly brilliant and heartfelt a statement about drug use as Gus Van Sant's ""Drugstore Cowboy."""

","If I were to elect one and only one film that truly deserves and lives up to the extreme hype that surrounded it, this is it. There is not a dull instant in this movie. The characters, the pounding music, the clever touches and the stupid, STUPID frame of mind that completely saturate every gesture and word, makes it one of the most entertaining films of the 90's.<br/><br/>Forever classic is the baby in the ceiling, the incredible half-wit Spud and his glasses, Begbie and his erratic, violent behavior and the smart and classy Diane.<br/><br/>I have never seen a better anti-drug flick: these guys are so awfully disgusting!<br/><br/>Brilliant. Just brilliant."

","Any movie that begins with Iggy Pop played really loud is OK by me. Not to mention the fact that it's the American debut of the wondrous Ewan McGregor. Imagine: He was simultaneously on screen as this doped-up heroin junkie and as a foppish dandy in Emma. Go figure.<br/><br/>But the movie, in all its bleakness, presents one of the best images of living a heroin-addicted life that I've ever seen. And it has a great soundtrack."
