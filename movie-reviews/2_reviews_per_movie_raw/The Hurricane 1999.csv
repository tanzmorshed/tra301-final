","I wasn't going to comment, but after reading some of the negative comments, I felt I must. I ""waited for the video"" for this movie because a movie about boxing didn't seem interesting. But that's just the thing. It's not about boxing. So if you're thinking you're going to see Raging Bull, you're not. There are a few boxing scenes, but they only serve to move the story along.<br/><br/>I have seen this movie more than once. The first time I was touched by the underlying theme of the movie, which was in my opinion, love conquering hate and injustice. Then I watched it again. I realized Denzel did a superb job. It WAS NOT a ""typical Denzel role."" He convincingly played Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, raised full of hate for and distrust of white people. When he goes to prison for the murder, he does an excellent performance showing the different personalities in his head, as well as showing how his inner spiritual journey transformed him. Any good movie shows the hero growing and changing. And Denzel again does this well towards the end of the movie, after befriending Lazarus and the Canadians. My favorite line which to me sums up the entire movie is when they're waiting to hear the judge's verdict and Rubin tells Lazarus, ""Hate got me in here. But love's gonna bust me out.""<br/><br/>I don't know much about the real Rubin Carter or the details of the case. What I found compelling about the movie was the fact that some people - be they white or black - can harbor such hatred for another person (I'm referring to Della Pesca's hatred toward Rubin). Another thing that got me was the friendship and love between Rubin and Lesra and the whole message of examining the higher principle of truth for which the law was meant to serve. It's just one of those movies that makes you think. Yeah, some of the writing is ""just OK"" in places, but the theme of the movie is wonderful and I think Denzel gave an Oscar worthy performance.<br/><br/>I gave this a 9 out of 10."
"fiennes1","Null","57","78","16 January 2000"," good old-fashioned entertainment
","Jewison's film is an old-fashioned biopic, complete with pivotal backstory, voiceover narration, and a character who enters the protagonist's life and changes it immeasurably.  It's one of those stand-up-and-cheer movies where everyone seems to be against the hero, but above all odds (and with more than a little help from some of his friends), he rises above The System and gets his belated due.  It's an oft-used scenario, with many scenes that could easily have been taken from Jewison's other films A SOLDIER'S STORY or IN THE HEAT OF THE NIGHT.  Yet despite the familiarity of the storyline, I'll be damned if I wasn't choking back tears of elation at the movie's triumphant conclusion.  It's a masterful piece of filmmaking that proves Norman Jewison's skill as a director, as he transcends the cliche-bound script and, with the help of Washington and company, makes it a powerful entity all its own.<br/><br/>As the Hurricane, Denzel Washington proves he is one of the best actors (if not THE best) in the business today.  He can run the gamut from cold hatred to hearty laughter like few others can. He brings dignity and class to every one of his pictures (he was the only thing worth watching in THE BONE COLLECTOR).  Here, he makes you FEEL every single thing he's feeling.  In times of righteous indignation, you feel morally outraged alongside him.  When he's at his most vulnerable, you can feel your throat constricting and your eyes watering.  He has an uncanny knack for reaching into your soul and making you part of the picture itself; it's almost as if he's channelling the viewer while acting.  Other actors delight in wowing the audience with grand theatrics and histrionics, but neglect to make the audience care; Denzel is usually soft-spoken and low-key, but always holds your attention.<br/><br/>In summary, THE HURRICANE was one of the most exhilarating motion picture experiences I've had all year.  Norman Jewison directs with a deft surehandedness reminiscent of his late 1960s/early 1970s glory years, Denzel Washington delivers perhaps the most awe-inspiring performance of the year, and the audience goes home happy and feeling good about themselves and the world.  What more could be asked for?"
"rosie-54","10","78","119","26 January 2000"," An incredible film, with superb acting
","Denzel Washington is so convincing as Rubin Carter that one forgets that he is, indeed, an actor playing a role.  From the beginning to the end, Denzel is perfect. The film made me think about how poverty and prejudice can ruin a person's life when misfortune, such as being in the wrong place at the wrong time, visits.  I didn't think that I could possibly like a movie that I already knew so much about.  With boxing in it, yet!  But when Denzel received the Golden Globe Award, I felt I had to see it.  What a moving experience!  Anyone who enjoys superb acting and a story with a rewarding, emotional ending should not miss this film."
"les6969","Null","20","29","2 August 2011"," Denzel Deserved an Oscar
","I am not going to get into details regarding how true an account this is or not. I have read a lot that seems to indicate he was guilty and others that he was innocent, both accounts seeing to contradict themselves. I guess we may never really know, but as someone who believes that racism infects a lot of society including organisations like Sporting bodies and the police I can well believe that being black would not guarantee a fair trial. However I also find it hard to believe that Mr Carter was as peaceful a person as depicted in this film. But this is down to the way the film was written and directed and in no way detracts from a truly remarkable piece of acting by Mr Denzel Washington. It seems in every part he plays, you believe that he IS that character and this film was no exception. In the boxing scenes or the prison scenes and in every scene you believe that you are watching Rubin 'The Hurricane' Carter. A truly outstanding performance."
"prateek4261","9","21","33","18 April 2008"," Superb performance...
","I don't really know why people cannot talk without putting terms as ""he did it"" while thinking about this movie. How racially charged or challenged were those times has been clearly talked about, filmed and factually corrected. Literature, personalities and even a simple man can confirm to those facts and we can really put an end to who did it...or he did it!!! The movie marks the most stellar performance from Denzel Washington as he portrays the character ""Hurricane"". What surprised and confirmed my earlier thoughts about people rating this movie are that an awful lot of movies in here have better rating than this movie....and the confirmation is that ratings do not matter This movie stands out and lets you feel the passion and focus of a man...not born under normal circumstances but freed under great conditions. I think I am confident enough to say about this movie....if you haven't seen this movie then it doesn't really matter to you what cinema can be and what cinema possibly can create.<br/><br/>Forget the ratings....I think when you're done seeing it, you would decide for yourself what I am trying to say here. Where is the Oscar....ohh did we miss it??? Gladly so."
"Voikkari","6","25","41","3 June 2001"," There's another side to the story...
","There might be *SPOILERS* ahead...<br/><br/>The movie itself is a solid Hollywood picture, but after reading some comments and checking out info about the case, I felt confused. First of all, I'm still not sure if Carter and Artis committed these murders, but there seems to be a lot of documents and articles which proves they did. I'm not going to go to details here, but check out for starters www.graphicwitness.com/carter if you are interested. One example: In movie Carter is sent to jail as a boy for stabbing a man implied to be a pedophile. In reality, he stabbed somebody in the face with a beer bottle while robbing them.<br/><br/>One thing I don't understand is why they changed the facts so much in this movie and still this was marketed as based on true story. This might have been a good movie if they'd just make it completely fictional, but probably it wouldn't have sold as much. The championship fight scene seems also to be completely wrong, (from the Herald Sun) The Hurricane typically claims racist boxing judges robbed him, but every sportswriter who covered the fight agreed he was beaten by a better man. On the other hand, if they'd make this movie true to the facts, imo this movie would have been much more interesting.<br/><br/>I think it's a shame that Hollywood takes out a tragedy where 4 people were murdered and makes a disgrace towards them and their grieving friends and families by twisting the truth to make this movie better selling and getting more profit. <br/><br/>All in all, if ignoring this, the movie was pretty ok, although a bit too long (there was many scenes that could have been cut out) and some characters were just plain ridiculous, Canadians and of course Lt. Vincent Della Pesca, who was almost the opposite of the real detective). Denzel was good, maybe not Oscar nominee-good, but isn't the Oscars usually awarded to those who make most money, not those who have the most talent :)<br/><br/>One more quote from Herald Sun By ANDREW BOLT:<br/><br/>Of course, it's quite possible Carter is innocent. But is he still the right man to preach to us about reconciliation? While on bail for his second trial, he beat Carolyn Kelley, the (black) head of his Carter Defence Fund, so badly that she took a month to recover. ``He's Satan, and Satan can fool a lot of people,'' she says."
"desire_911","10","35","61","2 August 2008"," Absolutely Awesome !
","This is the greatest true story I've ever seen. I love the emotion in this movie. I really think that the delivery of the performances are what makes it great along with the direction. It's beautiful. I recommend it to any and everyone. The struggle that Ruben Carter endured just puts light on the way things used to be, and makes really grateful that things have improved. Denzel's great!<br/><br/>I completely felt in love with this movie, in which you can find extreme endurance, strong courage, ultimate love and a very realistic character starred by Washington. The character not only shows how powerful spirit a human being can be to survive in harsh situations, how persistent should a man in desperate circumstances, but also bring strong feeling to watchers, who wanna do something better, something higher than what he is currently doing. <br/><br/>The Hurricane is simply one of my best top10 movies of all time.<br/><br/>for Entertainment: 10/10<br/><br/>Overall Score: 10/10"
"goreilly40","5","11","16","19 June 2015"," Well why let the truth get in the way of a good story?
","People have asked why didn't Denzel get the Oscar for this performance? Well first off it wasn't because the acting was bad by any means, he gives a very strong performance, which is why he was nominated to begin with. So why the Oscar went somewhere else was because of the distortion of the events this movie was based on. Lets start with the main man himself, the movie depicts Ruben Carter as a noble person who was the victim of racism and injustice, were as the real Carter was an unstable violent character with an extensive criminal record. Now the events the movie got wrong, Carter did not stab a child molester as a juvenile, it was assault and robbery. Carter was dishonourably discharged from the army and declared unfit for service, he was not the highly decorated solider depicted here. Carter was not robbed of the middleweight crown, Joey Giardello won the fight fairly, even Carter himself admitted this. Carter's boxing career was in decline at the time of his arrest, he was not about to challenge for the title. The main detective was not the foul mouthed racist who was obsessed with getting Carter, in reality he never met Carter before the murders, he rarely swore and was a sensitive individual due to a facial wound received during WW2, he couldn't have been present at the Federal Court hearing, he died years before. The Canadians did not find new evidence, neither did anyone else and nobody tampered with their car. Carter WAS tried by an all white jury in his first trial, but the second jury had two black members. I could go on and on about what the movie got wrong but there isn't enough space, this movie butchers so many facts and ruins the reputations of people, some of whom are not around to defend themselves. As I said before it's not a bad movie to be sure, however this is not a true telling of the story, by all means watch it but don't accept of what you see as fact."
"pootc","1","36","64","11 March 2006"," A complete fabrication of the truth
","The Hurricane as emotionally gripping as the ""film"" is, is an outright a lie and a complete fabrication of the real events and occurrences that took place on that fateful night in Patterson, New Jersey. First off, I believe it is the job of a responsible filmmaker and a storyteller to educate the public, not mislead them and purposely cover up the true facts and evidence as Norman Jewison has in his film. I too was caught up in the Rubin Carter hysteria upon seeing this film, in fact I loved this film, but I dug a little deeper and what I found was both shocking and disgraceful. <br/><br/>Dramatic license is one thing but to falsify and ignore so many details pertaining to this case is unforgivable and deceptive. Here are some true facts of the Rubin Carter case, which somehow didn't make the final cut of the film. (I wonder why) for those who are interested here are just some of the many facts.<br/><br/><ul><li>Racist pig cop never existed. - Both Bello and Patty Valentine identified Carters car less than an hour after the crime. - The Police did not stop Carter and Artis because they were black, as the film would have you believe. They were rounded up because their car matched the description of the killer's getaway car. At first, just 14 blocks from the murder scene the cops let them go. When the same two cops got a description of the getaway car, they immediately recognized it as Carters car and were in pursuit. - When police searched Carter's car shortly after the murders, they found a live shotgun shell and a live .32 caliber bullet rolling around inside. The live rounds are significant because they fit the murder weapons and were found long before the caliber of the handgun used in the crime was determined. - No conspiracy was needed to frame Carter. On the day of the murders Bello told a friend ""Rubin Carter shot up the whole bar"". Months later he voluntarily (and reluctantly) names Carter as one of the two killers in two police interviews. Three days after Bello talked Bradley was interviewed, confirming Bello's story while he was incarcerated in a reformatory 75 miles away. Bello names Carter again in a tape-recorded interview, falsely depicted in the film. In actual fact Bello had already talked and didn't know he was being taped while Bradley was nowhere near the place. - In jail awaiting his first trial, Rubin Carter writes to his main alibi witness and tells her the story ""I want you to remember."" He runs through the alibi story point by point. - Contrary to the film, Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter failed a lie detector test just hours after the Lafayette Grill triple murder in 1966, according to the man who gave him the test, John J. McGuire, a former police polygraph examiner. McGuire said the results showed that Carter lied when he denied being involved in the crime. He refused to take a second test. Artis also failed his lie detector test. - On the 8/3/76 the Prosecutor told Carter, ""Pass a lie test and go free"". Carter refused. - There was never any attempt to falsify the time of the murders and no evidence to claim it. - Hurricane Carter and his co-accused, John Artis, have never been found ""not guilty"" of the Lafayette Grill Murders. They were twice convicted, and twice the convictions were set-aside on the grounds that they didn't get a fair trial. The State of New Jersey decided not to re-try them a third time because so much time had passed, and withdrew the indictments against them.</li></ul><br/><br/>What a disgrace of a film. What an outright lie, I can't believe they got away with this propaganda."
"marie_baie_des_anges","4","26","45","16 October 2000"," biased account of a ""factual"" event
","When I saw this movie I heard all the hype, and I heard how people said that Denzel deserved the Oscar alongside his Golden Globe and I believed he must have done an outstanding job considering Kevin Spacey was excellent.  I was wrong.  I realize that people say this not to anger the African American community (if they are not African Americans themselves).  I always hear complaints on how African Americans are never nominated and how they should have won.  Sometimes this is true (not as much nowadays) because Whoppi Goldberg should have won best actress for The Color Purple and the movie should have won best picture.  The only reason this movie was so blown up the way it was, is because people see a movie about the (*SEMI-SPOILER*) hardships of an African American during a very racist time period and they automatically label it as a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is an outstanding actor, but his role in this movie did not affect me whatsoever.  I was bored with him in the movie, and his acting here was quite similar to his role in Malcolm X but not as good. The audience is supposed to leave believing this man, Rubin Carter, is a saint. People left the movies worshipping this man, this hero, and they went out and bought his book, making this hero of a man rich.<br/><br/>*SPOILERS* This movie tells the tale of a man who spent the majority of his life in prison mainly for crimes he did not commit.  Of course the crimes he did commit (stealing mostly) was only to survive, nothing more.  People felt sorry for him, even though the drug dealers and thieves probably amounted to as much for the same reasons but are looked down upon in society. Everything in this movie tries to portray this man as a saint (except for the obvious infidelity he had towards his wife and the aggression he showed the other man when he met his wife) but why wouldn't it-after all, it is his point of view.  I do not like movies (especially Hollywood interpretations) that are based on ""true"" stories because they usually distort the ""true"" parts into something else, something not so true.  This was his point of view and a Hollywood construction, yet everyone believed it was the truth unquestionably.  Well I researched his past a bit before making any assumptions, and he was a very violent man.  Not only that, there is still a possibility that he did murder those people.  If you do not believe me, search for him on the internet, and read the articles some people have of him.  The boxing match he claimed to have won so easily, was actually won by his opponent Joey Giardello and there are tapes to prove it.  Besides that, there are many twisted and purposely left out facts in this movie.  The supporting cast were the nicest people I have ever seen on the face of the Earth and their ""nice and perfect"" persona looked difficult to keep up.<br/><br/>This movie was a Hollywood version of yet another unfortunate true story that is still left to be told truthfully.  Denzel's acting is stale, and the supporting cast's Mickey Mouse attitudes are annoying.  The movie also begins very slow paced and is boring."

"Theo Robertson","3","59","114","18 May 2005"," This Is Not A True Story Or An Accurate Bio-Pic
","The problem with this movie is summed up in the very first scene where Rubin "" Hurricane "" Carter fights Emile Griffith for the world welterweight championship in 1963 . You might be surprised when I point out that Carter never fought Griffith for a world championship in 1963 though he did fight for the middlewight championship a year later against champion Joey Giardello who beat him on points with plenty to spare . You might also be shocked to know that Carter was never in fact much more than an average fighter who was well past his prime when arrested for murder so why this movie is making out that Rubin Carter would have been a boxing great if it wasn't for being WRONGLY convicted of murder I have no idea . At the very best Carter was a very mediocre journeyman fighter at best . Robinson , Hagler , Ali or Hearns he was not <br/><br/>Oh yes he was WRONGLY convicted of murder and just to lay it on with a trowel a very early scene has the sadistic warder from THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION telling the wronged but noble Rubin to keep calm because he knows a cruel injustice has been done but there's nothing he can do to help . Meekly Rubin forgives his captor because that's who Rubin is - A noble forgiving paragon of humility , we're only three scenes into this movie and we're weeping tears for the guy , in fact you have to wonder why such a great guy was ever convicted of murder when he was a decorated war hero with a chest full of medals and we don't have to wait too long because it transpires that the cops are racist . We know they're racist because the arresting officer states "" Your black ass is going down "" , but that doesn't worry Rubin because he defiantly replies "" I know I'm innocent "" and he is , such a pity that the twelve jurors were all white and all racist and decided he was guilty simply because he was black . Thankfully justice is served though be it belatedly when a bunch of Canadians expose this terrible miscarriage of justice and Rubin is set free . Despite having his best years taken away from him Rubin bares no hatred towards the people who set him up . Compared to Rubin Carter Jesus Christ was a bitter and twisted man . It makes Washington's performance as Steve Biko in CRY FREEDOM look like an amateur performance in a school play . Or so we're led to believe <br/><br/>This film is a total disgrace . It doesn't play hard and fast with the facts because there's little in the way of facts . As I pointed out he was never a contender for a world title so forget all the boxing scenes that suggest he was . You can also forget all about the racist arresting officer investigating the murder case because he's a composite character that includes at least one black detective so racism wasn't at the heart of the case . Rubin Carter was dishonourably charged from the army and never had a distinguished military career , the jurors in the case included two blacks and he was found guilty by a unanimous decision so having "" a black ass "" wasn't a motive for finding him guilty , he was finally released on a technicality not because he was innocent and there's umpteen other revisionist aspects to the story . If you read the FACTS ( Something the producers of this movie clearly haven't done ) of the Carter case you might not think he's guilty but you'll instantly realise that this story is entirely fictional . It's Hollywood rewriting history in the worst possible way . Okay there's an opening disclaimer pointing out that some of the characters are composites and some scenes are dramatized but people with no prior knowledge of the facts won't realise just how disgraceful this film is at changing facts into something entirely different <br/><br/>I have awarded THE HURRICANE three out of ten and it would have got even less if it wasn't for the good performances and some technical achievements in editing and cinematography"
"dtucker86","Null","36","66","2 October 2001"," basically a work of fiction
","I need to warn people who watch this film, even though Denzel is a great actor who always gives a fine performance, to say the least this film needs to be taken with a grain of salt because its basically biased fiction with extensive ""dramatic license"". I have done some research and there are some facts you need to be aware of. First of all, Carter had an extensive criminal record, he was 29 years old when arrested for the Lafayette murders and had spent 11 of those years in confinement of some sort! The film shows him as a child rescuing a friend from a child molester and then stabbing him in self defense! Wrong! Carter actually beat a defenseless man over the head and stole his watch. He was always getting in trouble for fighting and beating up people, that was why he was sent to juvenile hall. He escaped in 1954 and spent two years in the Army (he was dismissed for unfitness after four court martials). He then went to jail for four years for assaulting and robbing three people. This film makes it look like he was pursued by a Javeat-like, bigoted detective named Della Pesca who ""set him up"" for the murders. There was no such person. Vincent De Simone was the real detective assigned to the case. According to all accounts he was a very nice man and an outstanding police officer who was not a racist or had anything against Carter. Also, contrary to what this film would have you believe, Carter was not unfairly robbed when he lost a decision when he fought for the title. Carter himself admitted this in an interview. Bob Dylans song The Hurricane said ""they put him in a prison cell but he could have been the champion of the world"". Carter lost eight of his last fifteen fights and wasn't even rated when he was arrested. In a 1964 Saturday Evening Post article Carter talked about going up to Watts and shooting cops (I could get about four or five). He owned an extensive gun collection and was feared by the people in Paterson. Is it any wonder he was considered a suspect! Like I said, this is a good film, but its just not true."
"torr59","2","41","77","18 April 2005"," Inaccurate at best, delusional and disrespectful at worst
","If this movie was about a fictional character, the movie could stand on its own and be judged objectively. Unfortunately for the viewer, the movie is based on ""facts"" that are shaded very unfairly toward Ruben Carter. Many of the smaller facts were disregarded (Carter was NOT number one contender at the time of the murders, there is no proof at all that he saved a friend from a child molester in his youth), but some of the larger facts, like apparently being robbed of a decision to Joey Giardello because of ""racist"" judges, is inexcusable to those of us who have seen the fight on tape, and completely disrespectful to Giardello. Why Hollywood feels the need to make a hero out of someone who, at best, was in trouble and around trouble much more than any normal person should be (was arrested multiple times for beating women) is strange to me. Ruben Carter was never, by viewing his actions in the 60's and even now, when he refuses to speak to his son, a person that people can look up to. Everyone knows that Jewison can direct, and Washington can act, but why they chose this story as their vehicle is beyond me. Is Hollywood so much in need of a black hero that they need to bend the truth in all of their bio pics to make them believable? (Heres a suggestion How about Denzel playing a movie about himself? Now thats inspirational) Based on all of the inaccuracies in the movie, I would suggest passing on this one."

","This is the story of a world-famous boxer unjustly imprisoned for more than two decades for felony murders he did not commit. His conviction, upheld in a second trial, before he is finally released by a federal court, is practically an operational definition of the term ""railroaded."" Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter would still be in Trenton State Prison, a hell hole if there ever was one, if it hadn't been for the altruistic efforts of three adults and one adolescent member of a Canadian commune, who became amateur sleuths by accident.<br/><br/>The film isn't particularly complicated. In fact, it's dumbed down to a point beyond which a lack of comprehension would be attributed to pathology. Almost all the frissons that might have made this more than a simple tale of moral strength and fortitude have been left out or shaped to fit a familiar mold. Dan Hedaya, for instance, is Paterson, New Jersey's Detective Della Pesci, the personification of racist-motivated darkness. The only reason he's in the movie is to snarl, threaten, make foul racist remarks, chivvy Carter, and see to it that he spends as much time in the slams as possible. Now, imagine that the movie gives him edge and adds other dimensions. Imagine, instead of Detective Della Pesci, Inspector Javert of ""Les Miserables,"" another police officer who simply cannot give up his persecution and yet is recognizably human rather than another familiar stereotype. It would have been so EASY to give the heavy a family and a dog or at least a social context -- rising black crime in the cities of the 1960s and the panic associated with it. Yet the writers and the director throw away any chance to turn the film into something other than a condemnation of racism and the white people infected by it. As a kid, Hurricane stabs a middle-aged white guy only to save his chum from an oily child molester. Does anyone believe this? Ho hum.<br/><br/>Not to diminish the heinous effects of racism (or, more generally, prejudice) in our justice system. It's an imperfect machine, and Carter suffered abominably for every fourteen-year-old black kid who ever decorated a brick wall with graffiti from a can of spray paint. During one of his trials, the prosecution refers to his having been convicted by ""a jury of his peers"" and Jewison gives us a long shot of the all-white jury, in case we might otherwise miss the point. We can't help being relieved when Carter is ultimately released, and can't help thinking somewhere in the back of our minds about those twenty years of imprisonment.<br/><br/>Nobody really has much to do as far as acting is concerned. Denzel Washington is pretty good at projecting pent-up anger and defiance. And the writers have his character develop too. At first he concentrates on turning his body into an instrument of power. But after reading some inspirational books he develops his mind as well, and in practical ways. He resists being swept up in the prison system by rejecting what sociologists have called ""the small reward system"" of total institutions. If favors are returned by cigarettes, Carter doesn't smoke. If submission leads to protection, Carter can do without the protection. His career in the Army, however, was not quite the smooth ride the movie gives us, but let's not dabble in too many discrepancies between art and life.<br/><br/>The other characters are rather blank. Life in the Canadian commune was evidently not lastingly satisfying. (Carter and Deborah Kara Unger's blond altruist were married, then divorced.) But we don't really get to know much about them. They -- and Carter's legal defense team -- are played mostly as bland do-gooders who would have failed if not pushed to the wall by the power of Carter's will.<br/><br/>There's a good movie around this story, lurking someplace, unorganized, entropic, waiting for someone to write it and put it on the screen. It's a parable of good and evil. Not of good people and evil people, but of people who are each, within themselves, good and evil, just like all the rest of us. But this isn't that movie."

","Framed by a white cop for a murder he didn't commit, boxer Ruben 'Hurricane' Carter tries to free himself from the constrains of his cell mentally by studying, picking over his case and writing his autobiography. Seven years later, Carter is still in prison with appeal after appeal being turned down, but his book has found its way into the hands a young student, Lesra who is inspired to study by the lessons in his book. As the two get to know one another through letters and meetings, Lesra and his teachers devote themselves to getting Carter freedom through a successful appeal.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that the basics of the story is interesting and compelling, this film only manages to be reasonable entertaining rather than compelling because it never really goes deeper than the basics. The story of a man wrongfully imprisoning and yet, somehow, overcoming that is going to be worth a look as it offers enough human interest for me to give it a try, but the problem here is that the film will give you a very basic look at the story and this basic feel will stop you getting involved in the story and maybe even make you wonder how much of it has been simplified down. Enough elements of the film remain interesting to cover this gap though and the character of Carter is interesting and semi-inspiring as he is portrayed here; I say 'as portrayed here' because I do not know how real this person I have seen here is. Part of the problem may be Jewison himself as his background is of a time where things could be as simple as, literally, black and white  but he brings that view to this movie and the story (and even the truth) appear to suffer as a result.<br/><br/>In Jewison's world there is no complex issues, no legal technicalities, no nothing  there is only a good black man who has been framed by bitter, racist cops even though everything points to his innocence; and boy, does Jewison spread it on thick! We trace Paterson's hatred of Carter all the way back to childhood and a scene where he comments on Carter's boxing fame just so we are totally clear that he wanted Carter more than anything! It's a real shame because the truth must be more interesting than this, although I imagine a lot more complex and for the film to just present such a clear cut and simplistic view of real life events not only insults the intelligence of the audience, it also does a disservice to the real life events it represents.<br/><br/>The cast are a big reason most of the film is interesting, or rather Denzel is a big reason it works. How close his Carter is to the real Carter is anyone's guess but his dialogue and his performance are both great. Washington made me believe this man's inner struggle by looks, words, tone of voice  this is the performance he deserved his Oscar for, not the more showy (and less controversial) one in Training Day. Shannon is also good even if he is far from central to the film. Unger, Schreiber and Hannah have clearly been told to play 'non-threatening white people' and they are all about as bland as a collection of people as I have seen. There is no meat on their characters and, as a result the three just play them very simple, basic and far too 'nice' to be believable; I'm not suggesting we have more detail on their lives but there was nothing to them whatsoever  a real problem when they are asked to carry some scenes near the end by themselves. Hedaya gets paid with a lazy 'racist cop' role that he can do nothing with, while Brown is OK in a return to his Shawshank role. Pastore, Steiger, Yulin and Paymer all add the feeling of depth in minor roles but really this is Washington's film and he is a big reason I found it entertaining.<br/><br/>Overall this was potentially an interesting, compelling and emotional film based on an intriguing real life story of injustice. However the script simplifies the story and characters to the point of being almost a version for people in a rush or without the intelligence to understand more. I cannot understand why the film just brushed past areas that would have made it more interesting (albeit more morally complex) and Jewison is to blame for a film that is very black and white in the portrayal of circumstances and its characters. Washington's performance and well written dialogue makes the film worth seeing but I was surprised by the film's ability to take an interesting and compelling story and simplify it to the point of lacking any real punch (sorry  he starts with a pun and he ends with a pun!). Watch once but there are much better examples of the genre and much better sources for hearing Carter's story."

Well, in reality it probably would not do so,for the true story of Carter and his incarceration would have made him more of a thug and less of the ""victimized African American"" that the propaganda machine in Hollywood would hope you to see. Washington as usual is very strong in his role though almost nauseating in his delivery of many politically skewed lines fed to him from the obvious sympathy script. Hell even the real Carter has criticized the film for its watered down characterizations. The kneejerk liberal garbage this film exudes is sickening to anyone who wants truth in films, but hey go figure...

Even thought I knew nothing about the truth, the story seemed extremely biased and unbelievable.<br/><br/>Filmmakers seem to always fall into the same trap when making a true story'.  They try and make out the hero' is an angel.  This then ruins all credibility for the film.  There were two scenes at the beginning of the film that made me immediately doubt the story:<br/><br/><spoiler><br/><br/>The scene at the beginning when a young Rubin, stabbed the man, seemed so contrived, I, immediately assumed, he actually stabbed the man, without provocation.  The scene where Rubin, allegedly jokes with the reporter, about killing white cops. I suspect he did make these remarks in a serious way.<br/><br/>I don't know, if either of these events were as they were portrayed, but I suspect the reality was very different from what was shown.<br/><br/>I found the first half of the film amateurish and disjointed, admittedly after that, the film improved, but still there was a large lack of believability.  The Policeman, who seemed hell bent' on making Rubin's life a misery, was totally unbelievable.  I'm sure there are bent' cops, but they was absolutely no explanation as to why he acted in the manner he did. There was a similar problem with the Canada crew', these people who seemed too nice to be true.<br/><br/>I still found the film entertaining and reasonably well made in the second half, but please Hollywood, if your going to make a true story, make it true."

The ""medling kids"" set out to solve a mystery.  After they gather some clues and start getting close to solving the mystery, the bad guy shows up wearing a beige trench coat and fedora (just like they always did in the cartoon) and warns them to back off.  Of course, they don't, so the bad guy sabotages their car (Mystery Machine) and as they are driving, the wheel falls off!  There are so many similarities to the old Scooby Doo cartoons that I find it very difficult to believe the director did not parody the cartoon on purpose.  Further more, most of the the movie is done via Denzel's narration, as his character recounts the story of Hurrican Carter's life.  This movie drags on and on and ON!  It is extremely boring.  I found myself interested in the movie when it first started, but soon I was seeing through the over-dramatic bull crap and I was repulsed.

","Despite a fine performance by Denzel Washington, the writers and director have too little regard for the audience to make this a really great film.<br/><br/>Some dramatic license is understood and expected, especially since a story of this nature is difficult to fit into a single movie. But too much of the license taken is unnecessary and pedantic. One would imagine from watching this Rubin Carter is just about the most terrific guy that ever was. It's not so much that it's not true, it's that it makes for a less interesting story. The filmmakers seem to imagine that audiences can't accept that injustice done to a flawed man is still injustice. Washington brings out the intensity of Carter and gives him as much dimension as possible given the constraints of the script. But it still feels like we are shown only a piece of the man and not the whole.<br/><br/>Embodying the evils of the system in a single man--the Javert-like detective, as others have noted--is just lazy. The real problem of the system is its Kafkaesque nature, labyrinthine, monolithic and shadowy, filled with faceless bureaucrats who cannot singly be held accountable. Taking this approach would not only have made for a better story, but I suspect would have been more accurate.<br/><br/>5/10, mostly for a good soundtrack, nice production, and largely good performances, particularly Denzel Washington, who has better movies out there."
"tedg","Null","10","17","27 April 2001"," Denzel Makes Us Do the Time
","Spoilers herein.<br/><br/>Yet another story about injustice righted. About a conspiracy of power (government or corporate), against an admirable hero. This would be a much more powerful story if they stuck to the truth. Carter WAS a thug -- that we couldn't be equally outraged knowing this is patronizing. The other smarmy elements (the relationship with Lisa, the drugs in the commune) would have helped as well.<br/><br/>The writing and directing is dreary, and the two and a half hours or so drag. Jewison is not a first-rate director. What's interesting is Denzel. I just hit him hard two days ago for `Titans.' He was mugging not acting, and supporting an irresponsible reduction of truth that I thought reduces society. I do have problems with this story as well, but I have to give Denzel his due as an actor.<br/><br/>First, let's note that we have some very fine black actors. There's no lack of appreciation of talent in this regard. Consider (among the younger crowd) Laurence Fishburn, Don Cheatle, Cuba Gooding, Forest Whitaker, Samuel Jackson, Delroy Lindo, Denzel, A few comedians. All of these have had some very respectable work. I've listed them from what I think is best to worst. Note: Denzel is just above Eddie Murphy (who is no slouch).<br/><br/>Denzel is committed, no question. But his effort shows. Its not supposed to. You don't notice it so much when the character is supposed to be intense. But that's cheating. In the first part, he plays an angry man -- in the last half by fits and starts, different types of intensity. Newspaper critics applaud intense roles, but the calm ones, acting naturally, are much harder.<br/><br/>
There was a time when he tried. He was very controlled in `Much Ado,' really very good. There were moments in `Blue Dress' where I thought we were watching a major talent. But with fame comes that hungry ego which ruins the self that must go away when acting. This is a very sad film. In the character of a man who has lost his chance at greatness, we have an actor who has lost his chance at greatness to the prison of celebrity. That's the real tragedy of our society: how it eats people."

While watching the film tonight, which happened to be on TV, I could barely stay awake.  Hollywood treats the audience like ignorant children.  Every scene was ruined because the director doesn't trust us to understand the slightest complexity of the events.  What's worse is that only makes the events onscreen even more incomprehensible, especially regarding the track record of the judge in New Jersey.  As well, the activists in Canada were portrayed as 3 people who sat around in their house all day mouthing unpassionate quips about life.  <br/><br/>I think most people who raved about this film were taken by the amazing story of justice finally done, and the escape of Lesra from the poverty and injustice of life in the ghettos of the US.  For such deep and complex issues to be addressed, we need deep and complex filmmakers.  Hurricane the film is so one-dimensional, and that's a shame because in the right hands it could have contributed to social change.  Instead, it's just a showcase for Denzel the actor.

","The film,Hurricane,tells the story of boxer Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, whose conviction for a Paterson, New Jersey triple murder was set aside after he had spent almost 20 years in prison.It stars Denzel Washington in the title role together with Vicellous Reon Shannon,Deborah Kara Unger,Liev Schreiber,John Hannah,Dan Hedaya,and Debbi Morgan.The script was adapted by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon from the books Lazarus and the Hurricane by Sam Chaiton and Terry Swinton and The Sixteenth Round by Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, and it was directed by Norman Jewison.<br/><br/>Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter was a top-ranked middleweight boxer whom many fight fans expected to become world champion. When three people were shot to death in a bar in Paterson, New Jersey, Carter and his friend John Artis, driving home from another club in Paterson, were stopped and questioned by police. Although the police asserted that Carter and Artis ""were never suspects,"" a man named Alfred Bello, himself a suspect in the killings, claimed that Carter and Artis were present at the time of the murders. On the basis of Bello's testimony, Carter and Artis were convicted of murder, and Carter was given three consecutive life sentences. Throughout the trial, Carter proclaimed his innocence, saying that his African-American race and work as a civil rights activist were the real reasons for his conviction. In 1974, Bello and Arthur Bradley, who also claimed that Carter was present at the scene of the crimes, recanted their testimony, but Carter and Artis were re-convicted. In the early 1980s, Brooklyn teenager Lesra Martin worked with a trio of Canadian activists to push the State of New Jersey to re-investigate Carter's case; in 1985, a Federal District Court ruled that the prosecution in Carter's second trial committed ""grave constitutional violations"" and that his conviction was based on racism rather than facts. Carter was finally freed, and he summed up his story by saying, ""Hate got me into this place, love got me out."" <br/><br/>This is a truly inspiring movie of a man who has suffered severely and managed to rise above the conditions that he has been through.Although the movie was criticized for misrepresenting many of the facts of Carter's life and the case itself, as documented in both his criminal and military records, and police reports and court documentation,it was a good movie that could serve inspiration to many people who have been against many odds and who have been barely managing to make ends meet in life. Denzel Washington gives an amazing performance as Rubin Carter as he captured the viewer's sympathy from the moment he appeared on screen until the end when he was freed.His performance was a powerful and compelling film. It was truly an expertly crafted, deeply moving biopic of an imprisoned boxer."

","THE HURRICANE (1999) ***1/2<br/><br/>Starring: Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Deborah Unger, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya, Debbi Morgan, Clancy Brown, David Paymer, and Rod Steiger Directed by Norman Jewison. Written by Sam Chaiton. Based on the novel ""The 16th Round,"" by Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter. Running Time: 155 minutes. Rated R (for language and some violence).<br/><br/>By Blake French:<br/><br/>(The following review of ""The Hurricane"" contains a description plot description that may or may not be of a spoiling nature.)<br/><br/>	The most amazing property of Norman Jewison's ""The Hurricane"" is that it would have been equivalently as powerful, equally as touching, and just as thought-provoking if there never lived a man named Rubin ""The Hurricane"" Carter. The movie is such a relevant, understandable feature, it has abundant emotional impact on the majority of an appreciative audience regardless if they realize it is based on an actual individual or not. This is one of the best movies of the year. In accordance with its many strong areas it succeeds in, the picture should present itself well when Academy Award time comes around. <br/><br/>	""The Hurricane"" tells the true story of famous African American middleweight boxing champion named Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter. The time period is the late 1960's. Rubin spent more of his childhood being incarcerated in one way or another. The past is behind him, however, and Carter has miraculously turned his life around and raised a happy family consisting of a wife and young boy. <br/><br/>	A corrupt police force wrongly accuses ""The Hurricane"" and his friend of murdering several innocent pedestrians when coming home from a party one evening. Det. Vincent Della Pesca, a cruel, racist law enforcer who has been after Rubin since he was a child, demands that Carter and his pal be named the killers. A half dead victim, full of hate towards his shooters, identifies Carter and his acquaintance as the terrorists. After a trail based on stacked lies, Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and his buddy are convicted and sentenced to three life sentences in a state prison.<br/><br/>
	While serving his term, Rubin puts the prison warden a fight it isn't ready for. Carter refuses to wear clothing that other convicts ware; he does not allow himself to be at the same level as others who have committed horrendous crimes. ""I've committed no crime, a crime has been committed against me,"" states Carter in a powerful confrontation sequence. He makes several attempts for acquittal while serving his time--all are eventually denied. Carter eventually loses hope, orders his wife to divorce him, and becomes a strong, hardened prisoner, focusing only serving his time..<br/><br/>	For years, Carter's innocent life is wasted away while concealed behind concrete walls. Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter decides to write a book about his life experiences. In the book, Carter explains to his readers about the injustice that was served to him, the police corruption with so much malignity towards his race, his life as a child going up in a racist time, and his practice as a professional boxer. That publication, titled ""The 16th Round,"" becomes a bestseller. However, as time passes, it becomes over looked, and forgotten. <br/><br/>	This is where the movie's decisive script introduces several new, important characters. Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon), an African American teenager living with his Canadian foster parents, Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber), Terry Swinton (John Hannah), and Lisa Peters (Deborah Unger). One day, Lesra randomly picks up a book and it just so happens to be ""The 16th Round."" After reading it, and being emotionally touched, he begins to plead with his foster parents to help Carter fight for his redemption.<br/><br/>
	It is unusual and risky for a film to open a new series of events so far into the plot. However, ""The Hurricane"" contains character development among the year's best. Most of the production is spent explaining Rubin Carter to us in one way or another, which is why, as the story progresses, we care more and more about him. His development is not necessarily in a certain order, which is understandable here. The structure within the characters presents itself in a non-conventional approach. To my surprise, the narrative point of view, although about a specific character, is more omniscient than a first person like you'd expect. <br/><br/>	Denzel Washington recently won a well-deserved Golden Globe award for his portrayal of Rubin Carter. He performs his character with a strong emotional foundation and realistic, vivid details. These qualities are what makes the character so empathetic. Also contributing fine performances are Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, Deborah Unger and Vicellous Reon Shannon, all with solid supporting roles. <br/><br/>	Many of the scenes in ""The Hurricane"" come off as a little on the gentle side. Obviously the filmmakers believe in the theory about catching more flies with honey than sugar. Though the film still packs a powerful message, with such material, director Norman Jewison should have taken a more aggressive approach towards the movie's concepts, such as racism, corruption, and injustice. This somewhat mild advance on us displaces the film on a level just short of profound. <br/><br/>	The film's theme of action propels the screenplay along  a lengthy road of focused dramatic tension. Also furnishing the picture's visual narrative style, ""The Hurricane"" embodies superlative dialogue that is on the level of merit equal to a lesser ""Forrest Gump."" The actions and dialogue support each other here, constructing a strongly structured production.<br/><br/>""The Hurricane"" is more about racism than injustice, more thematic in nature than subjective. It proves a solid moral about what society is like. A point that is powerful and touching because of its strong development...but also saddening because it's true. <br/><br/>Brought to you by Universal Pictures."

I couldn't take my eyes from the screen whenever he was there. Assured direction from Norman Jewison boosts this story from the ordinary bio-pic to a masterpiece of pacing where the audience's emotions are taken on a rollercoaster ride. It's not manipulative of our emotions, as some films can be. The truth of the man's life and times and those who were drawn into his exoneration are moving alone. I found the portrayal of the Canadians much less stereotyped than other non-Canadian productions, although I found myself watching John Hannah who played the Canadian Terry. I'm accustomed to hearing his Scottish accent as I've seen his work in the UK. It's hard not to ""see"" him in his role in ""Four Weddings and a Funeral.""

It is not remotely based on any facts and takes a man who was a twice convicted double murdered and makes him a role model. One thing in the movie I have issues with is the fat pig racist cop. Even Hollywood admitted there was no person like this. It was made up to enhance the movie. Do some research of your own. It was a well- made fiction movie but there was nothing factual about this movie which is why I rated it a 1 and only gave it that because you can't give a 0. I always loved movies with Denzel Washington but I will think twice before I watch him in another. Hollywood star or not.

","I saw this film for the first time on TV the other night and was at first quite impressed. Denzel Washington is a consummate character actor and really lived the part. The boy taking refuge from his alcoholic parents was pleasant, sincere and convincingly supportive to the allegedly greatly wronged black ex-boxer. Dan Hedaya makes a very convincing bigoted cop who is supposed to have pursued, framed and persecuted the hero throughout his life in an even more ruthless and unfair manner than with the equivalent two characters in ""Les Misérables"". The do-gooder Canadians were very bland and sheepish, but that is probably how Americans think of Canadians so they were presumably doing what the director wanted. The boxing sequences thanks as much to skillful camera work as nifty footwork seemed authentic, at least to a non-boxer, which is by no means always the case.<br/><br/>As the film progressed I asked myself how it was that I had never heard of the particularly flagrant injustice on which the film was based when I was familiar with so many such stories emanating from the States and even from the U.K.. The reason became apparent when I looked at the chronological list of comments on this site and saw that I had almost certainly had the wool pulled over my eyes. From what was said by the less gullible commentators, the true character of the ""Hurricane"" was in fact more like that of the nasty murderous cop Denzel had played in ""Training Day"" than this persevering family man who has up to this point triumphed over undeserved adversity. (There is a hint of adulterous intent when Hurricane confesses why he was where he allegedly was on the night of the triple murder, but this flaw is put in to make him appear more human - a Persian rug salesman will show a customer the underside of a carpet and say ""Look at the mistakes"" which serve actually to increase the value.<br/><br/>I tried to access the URL quoted by one negative critic to read what the real facts of the case were, but it didn't work. So I looked up Hurricane Rubin Carter in the Wikipedia On-line Encyclopaedia, read the bare facts there, then moved to one of the links listed entitled ""The Other Side"". With carefully detailed and abundant documentation, the whole white-wash of this black boxer that the film attempts so successfully (if you don't check up afterwards) is utterly negated.<br/><br/>Whether the nice black boy ever existed I do not know, for Lazarus who in the New Testament arises from the dead seems to be an incredibly apt name for one who is given a new life by the nice Canadians, who also may or may not have existed. Whether they did exist or not, Hurricane did receive a lot of help to try and spring him from people some of whom must have believed in his innocence and others for political reasons.<br/><br/>However unfavourable the statistics are for reasons of social depression,one must not tend to believe a man is more likely to be guilty because he is black, any more than one should believe out of political correctness that he is innocent because he is black. I hope that we have generally left all that behind us by now. The fog produced by the element of alleged racism in the Simpson case was what allowed O.J. to slip through the net. <br/><br/>It would have been alright if they had changed the name to a fictitious one and made no claim to veracity. But I suppose this was impossible because Hurricane wrote both the book and the script and it would have been like pleading guilty if he had changed the name. As fiction I would have given it up to eight, as a barefaced lie four is generous.<br/><br/>Hurricane has done twenty years ""bird"" which, since often only five years is served per murder in States where they don't execute, this would give him a little change , and furthermore he shared his murders with an accomplice so that I suppose he has ""paid his debt to society"" and does seem to be acting as a useful citizen now."

","Denzel is about the only thing that is right in this movie.<br/><br/>Maybe once in an early stage this was a better movie.

That and ruining whatever build up in pace and rhythm the movie might have had before.<br/><br/>So first it confuses you and then it puts you off.

Also a note: Carter no longer speaks to the Canadians who devoted so much time and effort to free him."
"sychonic","Null","5","10","20 April 2000"," The movie makers should be ashamed of ignoring the true story.
","The true miscarriage of justice will be that many, many people will walk out of theaters around the country and the world actually thinking this movie had something to do with reality.  The fact is that Ruben Carter was twice convicted of murdering a number of people in a bar late at night in New Jersey.  His conviction was overturned in the mid-eighties on legal technicalities.  The film fails to portray Carter in anything close to an accurate light.  <br/><br/>It's unfortunate that the talents of Denzel Washington, considerable as they are, should be wasted in a film like this.  If he and director Norm Jewison wanted to tell the fictional story of a racist system framing an African American, they should have done so honestly and openly, and not by furtively concealing the true nature of Carter, or the facts surrounding his conviction, twice, for murder.  The most openly known is that the police officer portrayed in the film is entirely fictional, though central to the plot of the movie. That just scratches the surface of the fiction this movie tries to pass off as fact.  <br/><br/>The film ignores a number of salient facts that caused Carter and his friend to be convicted: One witness positively identified Ruben Carter coming out of the bar soon after the shooting took place.  That witness and another saw two African-American men fleeing the scene of the crime in a white car with out of state plates.  Ruben Carter and his codefendant were shortly thereafter stopped driving a white car with out of state plates. When stopped, shells of the same caliber as used in the shooting were found in the car.  The car itself was positively identified later by a witness as the one driving away from the scene.  Carter was laying down in the back seat of the car when stopped, almost like he was hiding.  <br/><br/>The movie entirely ignored or twisted all of these facts -- like showing the witness only briefly seeing the two fleeing from across the street instead of face to face as in reality.  It never makes anything out of the fact that one of Carter's friends had his father killed earlier in the night by a white, and that revenge was clearly a possible motive in the shooting at the bar for which Carter was convicted. <br/><br/>It never explains why in reality Carter was known to have been searching earlier that evening for guns he owned, but had either been lost or stolen quite some time before. The movie never explains why the two defendants, Carter and his friend, had entirely inconsistent alibis. In addition, it doesn't explain why three people admitted they lied when providing an alibi for Carter, one of these people saying that Carter asked him to lie. <br/><br/>
Perhaps the most tragic part of this movie is that it really ignores the crime itself--four people gunned down in the most savage fashion, three dying, the last blinded and maimed by the gun fire, only to die a year later. <br/><br/>The makers of the film had a preconceived notion of what they wanted to say, and then cut and twisted the story to suit that idea. They obviously think the American system of justice is hopelessly racist and corrupt and wanted to use this case to prove it.  The problem is their hero really committed the crime and the true story is that if you have enough Hollywood celebrities making noise, Bob Dylan to write a song for you, and can find a court pro-criminal enough to use technicalities to overturn two jury verdicts (the second jury had two blacks on it by the way), then you can triumph over justice and eventually have a movie made about you.  Since Carter's purported innocence is central to the plot of this film, the makers might have at least tried to explain a least a part of the story correctly.<br/><br/>
Everyone involved should be embarrassed and ashamed--if you want to make a point, go ahead and do it, this is America after all, don't lie and reinvent the past to suit a political and cultural agenda."

","Rubin Hurricane Carter was in real life an African American who spent nearly half of his life in prison in the U.S. on trumped up charges. He was also, when out of prison, a successful professional fighter. While he was locked up he wrote an impassioned book about his experience; a book that drew liberal activists to his cause and inspired the Dylan hit song `Hurricane'.<br/><br/> Denzel Washington plays the part of Carter with convincing passion and with great restraint. There is no doubt that director Norman Jewison has fictionalised the story but that's does not detract from the essential facts and certainly makes for strong drama.<br/><br/> For instance Carter married and later divorced the Deborah Unger character after release, there were nine activists not three, and the lawyers had much more to do with the case.<br/><br/> The Hurricane won't tell you anything your didn't know already, unless you haven't realised how good an actor Denzel Washington is or perhaps if you were under the illusion that the U.S. judicial system isn't racist. But you will definitely be impressed by a terrific, Oscar nominated performance from the lead actor.<br/><br/> On the debit side the last third seems a bit hurried and the whole effort is depressing. Carter in jail in desperation silently crying I'm 50, Get me out!' was as moving a film moment as I've seen.<br/><br/> But now I'll repeat if you don't mind some statistics I gathered from Amnesty International regarding death row inmates in the U.S. They were originally presented with my review for The Green Mile.<br/><br/> Bearing in mind that we now have an Australian state government calling for the death penalty, not to mention a particularly regrettable, recent Australian death in custody.<br/><br/>  There have been 598 recorded executions in the USA, of which 97 were in 1999: 142 by electrocution, 2 by firing squad, 11 by gas chamber, 3 by hanging and 440 by lethal injection. More than 3300 are on death row now in the US. Your colour matters. For example, of the 124 prisoners from Philadelphia on death row as of October 1998, only 15 were white.<br/><br/> Rubin Carter must have been luckily not to be in one of the States in the U.S. where they kill their prisoners<br/><br/> Texan Governor and the probable next U.S. President George W. Bush has presided over more than 100 of those deaths and no doubt would have had the innocent Rubin Carter executed if given the opportunity."

","I liked the movie. I thought Denzel Washington was excellent until I shut it off in disgust in the middle. Why? Because the film makers lied in the middle of the movie. They purport to show that Hurricane Carter was robbed of the middleweight title by racist judges. The problem is I saw the fight. It was against a tough Italian American boxer from Philadelphia - Joey Giardello, the reigning champ. There was a head butt, probably unintentional, in one of the early rounds. It opened up a cut over Giardello's eye. Nevertheless, for the rest of the fight Giardello gave Carter a boxing lesson. The decision in favor of Giardello was clearly correct and not controversial at the time. I have no gripe against Carter, when asked about the fight he said without hesitation that Giardello won the fight. I believe that the producers had to make a settlement in Giardello's favor. Why does liberal Hollywood not just stick to the facts when recounting recent history. They are obsessed with racism whether real or imagined, I lost all respect for the producer, director and all parties involved except for Carter who remained true to the code of the athlete and gave proper credit to his opponent."

I still think that it's moving and inspirational after watching the film DESPITE knowing from the start that almost everything in it is a provable lie and that Carter was almost certainly guilty. Anybody undertaking even the most cursory of research will inevitably realize that Carter is a congenital liar and fantasist and twists the truth even in the face of overwhelming contrary evidence; no - his first victim wasn't a paedophile but was hit over the head with a bottle so his watch could be stolen by Carter, no - he wasn't a very good boxer and was a has-been at the time of his arrest, no - he fairly lost his one title fight and his opponent successfully sued the film for the suggestion that it was a racist decision, yes - he was a criminal with multiple convictions for robbery and violence, no - he was a terrible soldier with four court martials and no medals, no- he was not involved in the civil rights movement in any way, yes - there were black jurors (2) at his trial, no - he failed a lie detector test and refused to take another one, no - he was pulled over by the police within 10 minutes of the 911 call because his car matched exactly the description given by witnesses but was let go because he was the well-known boxer It is a sobering example of just how frighteningly powerful propaganda can be and how easy it was for Hitler and Stalin to lodge their ideas in the minds of the masses."

","This film has 'triumphalism' written all over it, from the official synopsis to the opening credits to, even yes, the end.  This is a movie that never begins to consider the idea that its audience may just disagree with some of its cavalier assumptions.  We simply are served the tale of an 'indomnitable fight for justice', failing spectacularly to convince on most levels, apart from Washington's performance as the main character.<br/><br/>As he did in ""Cry Freedom"", Denzel elevates the dross around him.  ""The Hurricane"" suffers from being appallingly threadbare in detail, as opposed to bloated and pompous like the Attenborough treatise years earlier.  Still, Washington almost works miracles again, inspiring dignity where by rights there should be none.<br/><br/>The details of the framed crime are scant, perhaps because if it were fleshed out a little bit, the implausibly bitter pill would be that much harder to swallow.  Where is proper motive, expositional dialogue, nuance to scenes?  Nowhere to be found.  The world of ""The Hurricane"" is black and white, uncomfortable given that the movie only airily tosses racism into the mix as an afterthought compared to its other indignations.  Maybe that's why any unjust motive for imprisoning Ruben that there may be is so muddled.  A proper dissection of race-relations would only serve to derail the film from the blatant righteous agenda that it insists on having.  The family of Carter supporters, like the jury who convicted him prior to their championing, are too easily convinced.  The audience outside the confines of this fictional world are the only ones who are probably likely to be found scratching their heads.<br/><br/>Hannah is badly miscast.  Why pick somebody with a Scottish brogue if accent was going to be important?  It's not even easy to see why he's there in the first place.  Only Washington and the boy contribute anything worthwhile to the story.  Given the liberties with the material the makers already chose to sanction, why didn't they just compress at least one more character and remove that difficulty altogether?<br/><br/>The actual fight scenes are surprisingly well done.  A shame then, that they do nothing to contribute to the 'noble' image the film would like so much to establish for its lead character.  Like the performance of Washington which is ultimately in vain, they are but one more insufficient coat of gloss on a tale that all too visibly begins to 'peel' with alarming rapidity."

","This movie is one of those films that says it's based on a true story, but seems more like a fantasy; sort of a dumbed up modern fairy tale.  The first half is implausible, poorly written, poorly executed, and underminds the viewers intelligence.  The evil sheriff was such a needless and undeveloped addition to the story.  The inclusion of the child molestor was also unnecessary, and also manipulative, since that one incident seems to shape the rest of his life.  Worst yet is the fact that Carter most likely did commit the murders.  The screenplay never allows for any character development or any logical connections between the themes in different scenes.  The editing between the flashback scenes is sloppy, and, while the plot points aren't confusing, the pondering viewer is likely to get frustrated because the movie barely ever questions or answers ""Why?"".  Why are they like this?  What's wrong with society to allow this to happen?  It also seems like all the times that the movie does give some insight of why people are who they are, the explanation the movie gives is completely untrue.  <br/><br/>Ok, so the first half is pretty awful whether or not anything happened in it was actually true.  In my opinion, the second half was well worth the wait. Regardless of how likely the events were, the story told a more interesting, less manipulative theme.  The first half was manipulated to show how evil white people are, and how the African Americans in this country have been greatly oppressed for so long.  This is definitely true, but you will never get an accurate or complete understanding by the this movie.  The second half, however, becomes a story about hope, and a very interesting one as well.  Ok, so it also becomes a courtroom movie, a genre that's been overdone, particularly when it's supposedly ""based on a true story"".  But it also has a message of persistance, about never giving up.  It's a story about friendship, a story about letting yourself open to avoid self destruction.  Ok, it's still a little hokey, but at least it's better than mindless drivel of the first half.  It's also hard not to like the characters in this movie, particularly Carter, Lezrah, and the three Canadians.<br/><br/>This movie has it's share of problems, and BIG problems none the less. However, overall, the film is worth the time it takes to see it.  People that are afraid of prison movies because the intense drama should not be afraid of this movie, as it does not tackle any issue very deeply.

He was court-martialed four times and thrown out of the army. There is also one additional fact which completely shuts down the cries that he was innocent.

The film makers took liberties but still stand within the fact and they served Rubin better then any lie. Denzal Washington simply is the movie he makes the film sizzle and that is a glowing tribute to an extraordinary man Rubin Hurricane Carter."

","A movie which took to much of my heart .Never felt so much emotional before watching an English movie. A real true story about a boxer who in his prime of boxing career is sent to prison for committing a multiple homicide which he never did. Just because of racism. His life wasn't able to get rid of prison since from his childhood when he stabbed a white man in self defense but was wrong fully proved guilty by a local detective and his associates and then again they were the same party who again framed him along with a fan. From there Rubin Carter writes his biography , the 16th round. This book is purchased by an African American teen who is living in Canada along with his white Canadian guardians. He along with the Canadian folks decide to meet and pursue the case of Rubin carter and John Artus accused along side with him. Rubin and John are sentenced for life , both are trying to gather there spirit to live another day, tryi9ng to compromise with their fate. The 1st very scene where Rubin is in the isolation cell of the prison and he is very frustrated , and tense about his future , than he is an imagination of his won to half's. One is of his own professional boxing icon and the other is of a simple ordinary god fearing Innocent person. The boxer of himself is outrage anger wants him to be aggressive use violent measures, unleash fury on any body as an act of revenge because what happened to him is never tolerable. Some how i understand that when you have left nothing but desperation , dejection, a feeling of being discarded cast away and destroyed you will also like to go at any extreme. But he didn't decide to adapt such measures ,when he brakes into the tears and cries that was very sentimental kind of moment for me. Other where he asks his wife to file divorce just because he wants to release his wife from a false hope of he being released for rest. He said That i am dead bury me. There when his judgment of appeal in the supreme court is about to be announced and he is waiting for it in his cell while the boy who is pursuing his case is also in tears and says he will personally put him out if the court doesn't. Than carter says by wiping off his tears ,'you have already brought me out(my voice is now heard ,people now know who i am , what happened to me and they know why i was subjected to this, i can even live with that)'. When finally he is released by the court and the case of homicide is dismissed against him, he sees his first sunlight of freedom, here he sees hurricane clouds on horizon ,a reporter asks a question about his return as hurricane carter in the world ,'Than he said i will always be the hurricane and hurricane is beautiful, I shed some tears and tohught he is hurricane and nobody can get into the way of a hurricane when it unleashes its power and fury. I really admire the courage of this man and the other black man who also was released from the prison and thanks to Mr Denzel Washington for bringing such tears in my eyes through his heart warming performance"

","After a couple of hours, this movie gets good.  It becomes a courtroom drama where the emotional parts become genuinely emotional.  The young boy doesn't get as many lines (which is good.  I'm sorry, but he just can't act), and maybe it's fatigue from being in my seat for so long, but the lines of dialogue that everyone else spouts become believable for the first time. Other than that, I can say very little in favor of The Hurricane.  The writers obviously killed perfectly good trees writing hours of dialogue for characters who will only be remembered as Good White Man 1 or Bad White Policeman 3.  Dan Hedaya does a decent job with what he's given, but every line amounts to ""Grr...  I don't like you because you're black.  By the way, have I mentioned lately that I'm evil and corrupt?  I'm afraid the guy asleep in the back row may not have picked up on it yet.""  The 3 Canadians have nothing to do but stand in a group like some obscene 3-headed beast, one being surly and dark (Liev Schrieber), one being the stereotypical pretty blonde, and the third being at times mildly accented and other times so British I honestly thought he was going to wrap himself in a British flag and dance around.  As expected, Denzel Washington does an incredible job, and he's helped by the fact that his lines are the only ones that sound like they were written by someone who has actually come into contact with people in the real world.  I mean, there are some really good lines (""You know, not all white people are racists."" ""Yeah, and not all black people are murderers.""), and some funny moments (they really don't warrant to more than a mild chuckle, but they're good attempts, and I'm really reaching for reasons to like this movie that is Socially Conscious and that everyone else will, as usual with Socially Conscious movies that ride the coat-tails of their capital letters, love and weep over and use as an excuse to pick a fight with me over my tastes in films), but I'm not someone who watches movies purely for the story being told.  For a movie to get to me, the story is just one factor.  I need something that is well done as well, something with good writing and good acting.  Aside from a couple of good lines and a great performance by Denzel Washington, this movie didn't have anything to like other than the emotional force of its story, and I'm truly sorry to be admitting this, but that's just not enough for me.  I can't recommend this movie.  I'm sorry."

The movie script makes almost all the characters out as caricatures of racism. The whites are either so purely evil or so purely altruistic that I found myself very discomforted. They're not real characters at all, with mixed motivations and feelings. The movie, in a sense, is racist in it's presentation of a difficult subject. It missed an opportunity to tell a deeper, more thought provoking story.<br/><br/>Hurricane Carter is played well by Denzel. Not Oscar material, but good.<br/><br/>What's disappointing is the degree to which the general population is easily manipulated by Hollywood's view of what should sell, what is Politically Correct and what we should feel and think.<br/><br/>Why couldn't a more realistic story be told, leaving viewers with more serious questions, like: What would I have done? Was there racism or was there judicial incompetence? Where was the truth?

"Buddy-51","Null","2","4","14 July 2000"," more about writing than boxing
","The most startling revelation about Norman Jewison's film `The Hurricane' is that this true-life account of middleweight champion Ruben `Hurricane' Carter turns out to be more about the glories of writing than of boxing.  In fact, almost no time at all in the film is dedicated to chronicling the details of Carter's fighting career but rather to the attempts made by him and others on his behalf to prove his innocence in a murder case that resulted in his serving a nearly 20-year long prison sentence.<br/><br/>The sympathies of the filmmakers clearly lie with Carter, although a number of people have, since the release of the film, challenged some of the film's reliability and veracity.  As one completely unacquainted with the facts of the case as they initially played themselves out, I am certainly in no position to adjudge the authenticity and accuracy of the film.  As a piece of drama, however, `The Hurricane' generates an impressive amount of interest in the viewer and even attains emotional greatness in a few scenes. Because the film is trying to come at the story from so many different angles, it occasionally feels a bit like a patchwork  part boxing film, part prison drama, part investigative thriller, part inspirational feel-good drama - rather than a completely unified work of art.  And, understandably, the film is more successful in some of those areas than in others.<br/><br/>The first half of the film is pretty standard issue stuff.  We get, perhaps, a somewhat overly sketchy portrayal of the events in Carter's life before the fateful night in Paterson, NJ when he found himself the prime suspect at a murder scene.  We see Carter as an 11-year old boy getting in trouble with the law for defending himself against a pedophile who turns out to be a well-respected and highly placed figure in the local community.  This incident introduces him to the Paterson sergeant (Dan Hedaya) who plays the Javert to Carter's Jean Valjean, dedicating his life to seeing that Carter never lives his life outside prison, hounding him out of a misguided sense of self-righteous zeal  an obsession aggravated by the galling fact that Carter has since gone on to achieve international notoriety in the ring.  As in many of the early sections of the film, the writers Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon fail to portray the incidents in Carter's life in a well-rounded, totally believable way.  We find it hard to understand just why this one black child  among a vast number in Paterson one presumes  would fire up this sergeant's passion so intensely.  We also are rushed along through Carter's early stints in prison, his time in the military, his rise to fame in the boxing world, sometimes with little more than voice-over excerpts from Carter's novel to inform us of how much he has learned and changed from his experiences.  The script is so jumpy at times that we never feel we get to know much about the young Carter at all.<br/><br/>Luckily for us, this is not all there is to `The Hurricane.'  The writers and director wisely enlarge the canvas of their story to include the teenager, Lesra Martin, whose contact it was with Carter, languishing almost forgotten in prison, that ultimately set the wheels of justice rolling that would lead to Carter's eventual release.   And herein lies the real emotional core of the story.  Lesra, a near-illiterate inner city boy from Brooklyn, living with some benevolent white liberals in Canada, purchases an old copy of the autobiographical best-selling novel Carter wrote in prison  the first book Lesra has ever read  and becomes so caught up in the similarities to his own life pouring off the pages that he decides to write to Carter in prison.  A warm relationship develops between the aging convict and the budding youngster which eventually leads to Lesra's introducing Carter to his mentors who then take up the cause of getting Carter's case overturned.  The highlight of the film is clearly the mesmerizing, emotionally riveting first encounter between Lesra and Carter; we sit spellbound as the two hurting individuals grope tentatively towards one another, each seeking that connection with (and recognition from) the other on the common ground of their parallel life experiences that they need so desperately.  As the two discuss the liberating effect their writing has on both of them, the film becomes a glorious paean to the power and might of the written word.  It is a truly unforgettable scene.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film only achieves that gripping emotional power a few times afterwards and in each occasion it is the connection between Lesra and Carter that brings it about.   The three Canadian activists who take on the case for Carter's innocence remain underdeveloped as characters.  We wonder how they can afford to leave their jobs in Canada and dedicate themselves exclusively to Carter's cause.  And why are they always together?  Do they have any other relationships in their lives or have they taken a vow of celibacy to go along with their social crusading?  Their successful attempts to unravel the mystery of what really happened on that night in 1966 are interesting on the level of historicity but these sequences weaken the emotional drama at the film's core.  Since we do not get to know these characters as fully fleshed-out human beings, we watch these scenes with an attitude of detached disinterest rather than intense emotional involvement Perhaps, the story of Ruben `Hurricane' Carter is too diverse a one to be successfully encapsulated even in a film that runs an impressive 146 minutes.<br/><br/>I realize, of course, that I have not yet mentioned Denzel Washington's impressive performance as Carter.  He literally holds the film together since there is virtually no scene in which he is not present.  This tour-de-force role allows him to run the emotional gambit from sullen rage and explosive fury to warmhearted tenderness and stoic idealism (and how many 40-something actors could still convincingly portray a man in his early '20's)?  Equally impressive, though, is young Vicellous Reon Shannon's work as the disadvantaged but ever idealistic Lesra.  Together these two extraordinary actors take `The Hurricane' to impressive emotional heights. This is their film all the way and it undoubtedly does `The Hurricane' himself proud."

","Denzel Washington gives an excellent performance as Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, a boxer who was imprisoned for 20 years in connection to a triple homicide. There is significant controversy surrounding both Carter's possible involvement and the film's portrayal. The film takes the stance that Carter was completely innocent of all of charges against him, including his childhood assault and robbery, which they frame as him protecting his friend from a child molester. They also imply that his title bout loss to Joey Giardello was due to racist scoring, though Carter himself has admitted that Giardello beat him fair and square. <br/><br/>Ignoring all that, there was little draw to the film besides Washington's outstanding performance. There was a significant portion of the film devoted to Lesra (Vicellous Shannon) and his adopted family working to free Carter from his wrongful imprisonment. While what they did was very important and made an impact on Carter's life, there was far too much screen time devoted to them given how long the runtime already was. There were no important people shown in Carter's life besides Lesra, with Carter's wife given just a few brief scenes. The Hurricane couldn't decide if it wanted to be a courtroom drama, a boxing movie, or a character study and just dabbled in all of them without devoting enough time to thrive in any of the genres. It is disappointing to see a great director like Norman Jewison do so little with such a high quality performance like Denzel gives here."

Whether it's ""indisputable"" evidence, false witnesses or sheer manipulation, the story of the Hurricane is one to be remembered. <br/><br/>Known as a prominent fighter, Hurricane's battle with overcoming challenges began from an early age. This film is deeply emotional. It delves into the ploy of sinister men in positions of power who have goals besides enforcing the spirit of the law. The Hurricane is unluckily swept into the midst of corruption and loses everything. It's a struggle to one day taste freedom and bring justice back to the courts.<br/><br/>The Hurricane is a strong movie. Whether it's the psychological trouble or loss of family, it's impossible to not sympathize with the protagonist. Although not truly meant to be a documentary, my main concern is that the film is clearly one-sided. Although it is a great piece of film, the plot does not represent history accurately and only reveals light from a skewed perspective.

Vindictive police detective Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) has been after him since he was 11. With falsified evidence and rampant racism, Carter and his friend get locked up for 3 life terms. He sets about writing his biography which is eventually published. Then 7 years later in Toronto, student Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) finds his biography in a pile of used books. He's a poor student from Brooklyn who is given a chance to study in Canada. With the biography, he starts a long journey to get Carter's release and his good name back with the help of his mentors Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (John Hannah).<br/><br/>It's a very standard biopic from Norman Jewison.

A similar story was told in I AM A FUGITIVE FROM A CHAIN GANG with Paul Muni. Innocent man goes to jail, escapes, gets caught, goes back to jail. Only he was innocent and Carter seems guilty of a lot of antisocial activity.<br/><br/>In a sense the movie is racist because it portrays facts that are seemingly untrue for dramatic effect and to sell the film to ""gullible"" audiences searching for racism everywhere.<br/><br/>One of the lines in the movie is by the kid who is ""adopted"" by the Canadian couple, ""are you helping me because I am black or do you have pity for me"", all too often the answer is yes, which is a demeaning attitude. <br/><br/>During an interview, Tracy from SNL, was asked about Loren Michael hiring him and he said that Loren said, "" I am hiring you because you are funny, not because you are black,"" and Tracy said that made all the difference to him in his career.<br/><br/>This movie really serves to fan the fires of injustice not to shed light on it.

","You can't help but be inspired by Denzel Washington. The charisma and wonderful wit he adds to fictional characters is something to behold, but the power and the integrity he adds to his portrayals of real life individuals is nothing short of outstanding. Here in Norman Jewison's ""The Hurricane"", he brings Rubin ""Hurricane"" carter to life with such raw emotion and intensity that this performance at least equals the high standards set by his portrayal of controversial civil rights leader Malcolm X. That film is superior in my opinion , but this is still an excellent film enriched by Washington's performance. This, a performance really showing ""The Hurricane"" as a man that throughout a heinous and unjustified stint in prison was as Dylan said ""a son of bitch that was brave and getting braver"".<br/><br/>Norman Jewison's directing is very accomplished, displaying cut scenes of racial violence showing the gross malpractices of police in sixties America in many parts towards African Americans. He also cuts to scenes of real life protests for Rubin Carter's release from imprisonment aptly surrounded by the sound of Dylan's ""The Hurricane"". I like these scenes as once they finished and returned to Rubin in prison, a nearly broken man, you really felt his helplessness. Despite the protests, they mattered little to him, isolated in a small cramped cell, trapped, as he had being in different circumstances for far too long of his natural life. I also felt Harris Yulin and David Paymer as his legal representatives as well as also Dan Hedaya as a corrupt cop were all very impressive in their relatively small roles. You really believe Hedaya as a desperately bitter individual with little moral fiber.<br/><br/>Vicellous Reon Shannon as Lesra Martin grew in his particular role, I felt as the film progressed.However in some early scenes, he seemed a bit too simple such as the mad jumping at the arrival of one of Rubins letters, proclaiming ""he wrote back"" repeatedly like some hyper kid who had drank too much Coca Cola from the fridge. Overall though he was reasonably good. However his Canadian friends made up of actors Deborah Kara Unger, liev Schreiber and John Hannah were at times just awful. There was some dialogue between them that might as well have being performed by robots for all that convincing it was , which is strange cause all three actors have being excellent in other roles, particularly Hannah, who was brilliant in his role in ""Four Weddings And A Funeral(1994). Their not key though as Washington dominates the screen, so it's a small gripe, I guess. But still It was annoying.<br/><br/>One scene where Unger's character answers a very distressing and emotional call from carter is kind of laughable due to her response to the other Canadians and Lesra. In the scene, It would have being just as effective for me if she turned and said ""that was Rubin, he's a bit sad... oh well, do you want to go to a field and rake some leaves?"". That's how inadequate I felt that particular scene was, which is clumsily cut away from, but the acting made it feel extra like a clumsy cut.Incidentally, there is some strange joke about Canadians past times being limited to raking leaves, which doesn't really work, I think.<br/><br/>Back to the triumphs of this film. Most the cast is terrific, whether it be in flashbacks of Rubin's earlier life, his prison life(notably Clancy Brown, playing sort of a similar, but yet opposite role to his character in the Shawshank Redemption) or also, the latter time setting of his final drive for freedom, after meeting Lesra (Mostly). I would also like to praise the late Badja Djola, who is fantastic in his minor role as a sort of wise man in ""the hurricanes"" prison. Jewison also gets a terrific shot of him near the end I thought, coming out of a cell. Jewison's directing is as you would expect well thought out and carried out with great aplomb showcasing him as a true master of the trait of cinema. The pacing of the story may drag slightly but it is also very well done all the same, script wise,in fairness to Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon, who adapted it.<br/><br/>The key part of this films success though lies with the wonderful Washington, who shows Carters loneliness, despair, anger, hurt and determination with incredible passion and intensity displayed prominently in one scene where the hurricane proclaims to his lawyers in jail in a sad whimper ""I am fifty years old...fifty years old!"". He goes on to declare his desire to be free. He showcases all those mentioned characteristics at once. The scene is a triumph and the acting of Washington is quite simply superb. It captures Rubin Carter entirely as he was and how he came to be The Hurricane as a fighter as well as a free man. The film may drag a tad at times, telling it's tale, but for a biopic on this man, that tale is what the audience wants to see and boy does Washington carry the day."

Their paths meet in ""The Hurricane"", a well-intended story of racism and the price a man paid because of it.  It's a pity that Jewison can't carry this film with the same zeal of his two earlier successes.  Certainly Denzel Washington brings us 'Hurricane' Carter at his gut-level best, well enough to garner an Oscar nomination.  But the tension he brings to his character doesn't seem to rub off on anyone else in this picture and he can't carry this film by himself. The weakest part is, surprisingly, the boy Lesara (played too innocently by Vicellous Reon Shannon) and the white extended family, Sam and Terry and Lisa, that fight to save Carter.  There is no fire nor spirit in what they do, just a matter of fact, going through the motions.  If there is any love between them, it doesn't show in any tangible way on screen. When we finally get to that touching scene in which Lesara says he will bust Ruben out, one way or another, he sobs openly on cue through an emotionless expression. There is the matter of Detective Della Pesca (a menancing Dan Hedaya) who has been a thorn to Ruben Carter since he was eleven.  If this vendetta was indeed racially motivated, the film should have developed this villianous character more rather than merely using him as a straw man whenever the opportunity presented to put Carter 'in his place'.  ""The Hurricane"" dishes out a story of racism and injustice without much fanfare nor conviction - like a boxing match that finishes the course without a knockout punch."

","Title: The Hurricane; Genre: Drama; Certificate: 15; Year: 1999; Director: Norman Jewison<br/><br/>Starring: Denzel Washington, Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, David Paymer, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Dan Hedaya, Deborah Unger<br/><br/>It's almost fifteen years since Denzel Washington's big breakthrough as Steve Biko in 1987 smash-hit, ""Cry Freedom"". Since then he has become recognised as one of the finest actors of this generation with acclaimed performances in movies like 'Glory', 'Malcolm X' and 'Philadelphia'. He notches up another tick in the success column with a remarkable performance in the title role of ""The Hurricane"". Norman Jewison (""Moonstruck"", ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", ""Fiddler on the Roof"") directs the story of boxing prodigy, Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Washington) whose life is turned upside down by his wrongful conviction for murder.<br/><br/>Having spent half of his first 20 years in juvenile prison thanks to the close attentions of a racist police officer (Hedaya - ""The Usual Suspects"", ""Shaft"", ""Maverick""), Carter focuses his anger and aggression to become one of the world's leading middle-weight boxing contenders. The fame and fortune it brings him helps fuel racist fires in the local police department and when the opportunity arises, Sgt Della Pesca uses a heinous multiple-murder to frame and jail Carter. A subsequent re-trial fails to free him, appeals are rejected and Carter uses the time in jail to write his autobiography. Young student, Lesra Martin (Shannon - ""Deep Cover"", ""D2 - the Mighty Ducks""), comes across the book and becomes engrossed by Carter's story. Fully believing in his innocence, Lesra begins to write to and visit Carter in jail. His tutors (played by Schreiber, Hannah and Unger) also believe in Carter's innocence and they plough their efforts into disecting the evidence at his trial and trying to prove his innocence. There is no doubt that the outstanding aspect of this movie is another 'tour-de-force' performance from Washington. His touching portrait of a wrongly-convicted man evolves brilliantly as the movie progresses. The aggressive boxer soon becomes the focused writer whose only goals are freedom and justice. His support cast also receive kudos. Shannon is superb as Carter's guardian angel and mental strength during the hardest periods of his struggle, while Hedaya is the perfectly evil racist cop.<br/><br/>Jewison is not the most prolific movie maker but if he rolls out classics like this once a decade I'll certainly always look forward to them. My only regret is that this is marketed as the true story of Rubin Carter when in reality a lot of the facts have been changed to make the movie more dramatic. I guess that happens all the time but it seems a bit tasteless where the lives of innocent people are concerned. But beyond that, this is an absorbing and thoroughly deserving movie experience."
"TxMike","Null","3","10","11 December 2000"," Detective Della Pesca was Rubin Hurricane Carter's ""Javert"" (see Les Miserables).
","This film, ""The Hurricane"" is one example where the ""hype"" was not overdone. Denzel Washington did a masterful job here, both in preparation for the role, and then execution of it.  When you see interviews with the real Hurricane on the DVD ""extras"" you realize how well Washington captured this role.  I wish I could rate it 8.5, but settled for ""8"" of 10, but a very strong 8. This is based on a true story, however some charcaters are created or consolidated, and in truth the ""real killers"" were never found, and some stilll believe Carter murdered the three people he went to prison for.<br/><br/>I didn't particularly like the style of the editing where the film jumped from far past, to present, to near past, to present, etc - it detracted from the story because you had to think ""OK, where did this happen."" However, the story is fairly simple - two gunmen kill 3 people in a bar at 2:30AM and the evil and PREJUDICED detective Della Pesca, who had a history with Carter since he was a young boy in trouble, conspires to falsely convict Carter of the crimes. <br/><br/>CAUTION - POSSIBLE SPOILERS... Della Pesca in a real sense is the Javert of ""Les Miserables"" who relentlessly hunts down Valjean even after he becomes a good and exemplary citizen. Carter, when he was first arrested, had just come out of the Army where he had been a paratrooper and as a fighter became all-Army welterweight champ. But Della Pesca said, ""you still owe me time"" for having escaped from the state home for boys and joined the Army, two years before he was to be released at 21. It was the 8 years at the reform school, from age 11 to 19, that Carter says ""I learned how to maime, butcher, and fight for my survival."" <br/><br/>After that second prison time, Carter is falsly, according to the film, arrested for the 3 murders, framed by Della Pesca. Carter fails to get a fair trial in NJ, witnesses disappear, relevant evidence is not admitted, he gets 3 life terms, and his several appeals fail.  In prison, he writes a book, ""The 16th Round"", which he views as his only way to get the ""true"" story out to the public.  A young, struggling black student, Lesra, comes upon a used copy of the book, bought it for 25 cents, used it to sharpen his reading skills, wrote a letter to Carter, then spoke with him by phone, then visited him. He and his 3 Canadian ""tutors"" eventually move to NJ and vow ""to stay here until we take you with us"", they told Carter.<br/><br/>So, the real ""meat"" of the drama is twofold.  First, how Carter builds the inner strength to endure 22+ years of prison and not play by the rules of the prison. And second, how these 4 Canadians investigate and succeed where many lawyers before them had failed. In the end, in 1985, after 22 years in prison for the murders, they take a very risky path with an appeal to federal court, bypassing NJ courts. It works, the judge ordered Carter freed. Prosecution appeals failed, Carter moved to Canada where he resides today. His young friend Lazra, who also is included in the DVD extras, in an attorney.<br/><br/>I like well-made films based on important historical events, and this one qualifies. As other reviewers commented, this film is a bit unbalanced, of course focusing more on Carter's POV, and ignoring some important development of other characters.  Still, I rate it a high ""8"" for overall impact, and an important film to recall how some past injustices so greatly affected the lives of others."

","I'll admit that I'd never heard of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter before this movie came out. But watching the movie, I came to understand the whole case perfectly. Carter (Denzel Washington) grew up in the slums of New Jersey, forcing him to be strong (and a hard-ass). The racism surrounding him caused him to develop a solid hatred of white people (and he had every reason to). Finally, he was arrested, tried, convicted, and imprisoned for murder. But really, they imprisoned him for being a strong-willed black man (and they claimed that he was convicted by a jury of his peers, despite the fact that every one of the jurors was white).<br/><br/>So, after a few years, Canadian activists Lisa Peters (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam Chaiton (Liev Schreiber) and Terry Swinton (John Hannah) start a campaign to reopen the case and free Carter. Bob Dylan wrote a song about the case, and Ellen Burstyn also campaigned for him to get released. Finally, in the early '80s, he got exonerated. As he affirmed: ""Hate put me in here. But love's gonna get me out.""<br/><br/>The overall point of the movie is that the racism of our society has been wrongfully imprisoning people for years. I think that it's appropriate that this movie - directed by Norman Jewison - came out in 1999. In that year, I was as old as my parents were in 1967, when Jewison released ""In the Heat of the Night"" - also dealing with race relations in this country. All in all, this is a movie that everyone should see."

","The Hurricane (1999): Dir: Norman Jewison / Cast: Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, Deborah Kara Unger, Dan Hedaya, John Hannah: Based on the true story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter who spent most of his life in prison for the murder of three people. His ring name is Hurricane in the sport of boxing but it also mirrors his emotions, which is fueled by rage. The film spans from his troubled childhood where theft led to his initial encounter with the law. Central plot regards his innocence and his ability to go unbroken from the corrupt system that placed him there. Director Norman Jewison dealt with racial issues before in films such as In the Heat of the Night. He presents boxing footage in appropriate black and white. Powerful performance by Denzel Washington as Carter whose patience for corruption payoff in the form of Vicellous Reon Shannon as the ghetto kid who reads his biography and determined to set him free. This will land a predictable conclusion that holds question as to how much is accurate. Deborah Kara Unger plays one of Shannon's foster parents who assists him. Where the film goes wrong is its representing of the villain cop, played by Dan Hedaya seen more as a bad guy than an actual personality. It never examines this issue beyond the basic finger-pointing agenda while strong arguments can equal stronger content. Compelling film about race and justice. Score: 8 Â½ / 10"
"jb_campo","8","1","2","15 October 2015"," Powerful, thought-provoking drama.
","Denzel Washington stars as Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter, an up and coming African-American boxer who lived in Paterson, New Jersey. Director Norman Jewison delivers a powerful drama that kicks you in the guts multiple times, making you empathize with the injustice of Carter's incarceration on false charges of murder.<br/><br/>Carter was no saint mind you. The film walks you through his youth and encounters with a certain detective Della Pesca. Carter grew up in the 1960s in a time of extreme racial prejudice, which comes through in all aspects of the story. Although this film is based on a true story, the director advises us that some characters have been made up and some activities have been fictionalized for the story. Therefore, you are not sure what is close to reality, and what is Hollywood fiction.<br/><br/>The story focuses on the efforts of a young kid from Brooklyn, Lesra, played very well by Vicellous Reon Shannon, to become friends with and eventually help Carter get justice. Lesra is helped by three Canadians who take him under their wings to help him. There always underlies suspicion about their motives, but the film makes it seem they simply saw this boy had potential and needed some assistance to reach it.<br/><br/>The film weaves you through the murder, the trial, the imprisonment, and efforts to appeal. The process drags on, for years, giving my only critique that perhaps the film could have been shorter. The anguish though, is palpable, similar to 12 Years a Slave, without the blood.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington is simply terrific, and won the Golden Globe Best Actor for his portrayal. He delivered so many emotions in this role, particularly during his first visit to solitary confinement where he has a battle, with himself, to basically retain his sanity, and later, his dignity. Why he did not win the Osacar, I'm not sure.<br/><br/>The ending will grip you, as they risk all in a life or death fight for justice. Watch for a short but important role by all-time-great, Rod Steiger, perfectly cast by the way.<br/><br/>At almost 2 1/2 hours, the movie runs long, but it keeps moving. There is a fine interweaving of music, particularly the song Bob Dylan wrote about the Hurricane. This is a must-see film about race, prejudice, redemption, and justice that will stay with you. Enjoy."

","""Everybody knows the fight was fixed, the poor stay poor, the rich get rich. That's how it goes. Everybody knows."" - Leonard Cohen<br/><br/>Norman Jewison's ""The Hurricane"" stars Denzel Washington as Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter, a middleweight boxing champ charged with triple murder. An all-white jury sentences Carter to life in prison. The film's second half watches as a group of Canadian activists struggle to get Carter released. The evidence used to indict him was manufactured, they claim, the African American Carter the target of racial persecution. <br/><br/>""The Hurricane"" is cartoonish and simplistic, but boasts another infectious performance by Washington. The immaculately chiselled Deborah Kara Unger is also fine in a small role. The film was based on a real life incident, and its screenplay adapted from two books, one of which was Carter's own memoir. Over the decades, Carter's case would become a cause celebre; Muhammed Ali, Ellen Burstyn, Bob Dylan and a number of other figureheads would tout his innocence. Many believe the opposite. Regardless, law and legal systems have always been inherently racist and classist. To this date, studies estimate between five to ten thousand wrongful convictions in the US per year. For a better take on this material, see Jean-Xavier de Lestrade's ""Murder on a Sunday Morning"".<br/><br/>7.5/10 – Excellent in patches, but mostly conventional. Worth one viewing."

Carter was NO Muhammed Ali, Jack Dempsey, Rocky Marcino, Joe Louis, George Foreman, Joe Frazier,etc despite what this bs movie tells us. He was ranked ninth place in middleweight boxers, anyone who watched the fight he whined ""racism"" over the judge's decision knows that the only racism was from Carter when he didn't get his way when he lost. He never defend his friends from a child rapist, but he did slash a man's face with a beer bottle when Carter tried to mug him. He assaulted a member of his Carter's defense group, who is Black. To me ""Hurriance"" is NOTHING more than a degraded level one tropical storm at best. This and ""Redemption"" which was redemption in name only and like Hurriance"" was insulting fictional propaganda that claim to be ""Based on a true story"".

","Maybe the makers of the film got here before anyone else did and as such have printed up positive reviews about the Hurricane,the fim about the 1960 middleweight contender Rubin Hurricane Carter played by ,who else, but Denzel Washington. Does the film have flaws?Of course it does.Carter was given three life sentences for a crime HE says he did not commit,and the movie goes overboard giving only his side of the story.As with all Hollywood pictures the true story of Carter involvement in the murder he was accused of will not be told totally.What for it is his story after all.THE HURRICANE!Oh well so much for evenhandedness. The real life Carter wasn't this saint that Washington portrays in the movie,he was a more gruesome figure.Therefore thanks to the PC content of this movie no one watching it will know him or herself  if<br/><br/>Carter is really innocent since they really don't know the true facts of his case. The bringing along of the black kid who reads Carter's biography and then seeing him live with three hippies from Canada no less,two men and a woman ,and see them as the driving force to save Carter from prison life is almost too much.Three white live and let live canucks raising a black kid and they dedicate themselves to getting a black man out of prison?A lifer no less?Somewhere out there some lifer is asking where are three canadians to get him out of prison?Maybe he should write a book. The police are portrayed as comic book villians so the credability of this film is thrown out from the get go.The Hurricane is a curious study to say the least,at least in our age.When Carter was put in prison the civil rights movement was still going on.Now his story seems old as the political correctness of our times has even things out between people or made them more seperate whichever way you want to look at it. Do not get me wrong,there is still plenty of racism out there.But was Carter really innocent?Could have Norman Jewison told the story in a balanced fashion? How many people out there know the true facts of this case?Shall the real story of this man and his trial and his crime be told.In this corny movie the answer is no."

","We are always told that our justice system is the best in the world. Given the fact that this film is based on a true story and also given some recent verdicts, I think the reason for the statement is sobering -- if this system is the best, imagine how horrible other systems must be.<br/><br/>This film tells the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, a prize fighter convicted of murders in a bar that he didn't commit, railroaded by a bigoted cop. Though many people took an interest in Carter's case over the years, it took a group of young Canadians (Deborah Kara Unger, Liev Schreiber, and John Hannah) to come to his aide and not give up. This is thanks to their ward's friendship with Hurricane (Lesra Martin), who is inspired by Hurricane's book. <br/><br/>Carter's courageous story is certainly one that should be seen. Rod Steiger plays the Supreme Court judge, and he's wonderful; soap star Debbie Morgan plays Carter's wife, and she gives an excellent performance. The entire cast is very believable.<br/><br/>A very spiritual film with an amazing performance by Denzel Washington. This is one of a number of incarceration films to hit the screen in recent years and, with a powerful actor like Denzel in the lead, one of the best."

I have met the man, I have read the book, and I have seen the movie, and the movie was incredible. The acting, the cast, the script, the directing, all were to me, the best they could be.

So I basically came to internet and started looking for some information. This whole racism thing is terrible. The way black people have been treated is not human.

","The Hurricane is none but three films in one, not a surprise considering the screenplay by Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon is an adaptation of no less than two books, one of which being the title character's own. One of the self proclaimed, nirvanas is a biopic. Tough, blatant, straightforward. It dictates the life and struggle of Rubin Carter, whose childhood was not an easy one, `All I have to say about my childhood is that I survived it.' The second is an expression in struggle, interest and self-motivation. It is about a boy of little intellect who is motivated to be more than he is given credit for after he is taken out of his home and educated by three white Canadians. It exists outside of the first and works because it focuses around the main idea and not inside of it. The third is about a trial; it is a search for answers and a way to simplify things into film formation. I liked the first two concepts; they worked well together, accenting one with what the other couldn't say in its period. The third on the other hand is where flaw strikes. Not because it is any less important or significant than the others but because it presents no idea of establishment, only rousing scenarios that pit the film against its earlier offerings instead of furthering their conclusions. I went into this film with something that I did not walk away with: thoughts, opinions and questions. In turn I was drained of such feeling as I watched a pedestal of thoughts, opinions and questions culminate that addressed my expectations before even I had a chance too. Rubin `the Hurricane' Carter was a middleweight prize-fighter that spent almost half of his life in jail due to the racism that sprouted from a corrupt police force. An undertone in the film that presents nothing more, story wise at least, than what would be perceived at face value to the real life true story. He was falsely convicted of murdering two men and one woman in a bar during the year of 1966 that is never given a reason for by this film, a good call on behalf of Canadian director Norman Jewison. The first half of the film is based around the life of Carter through flashbacks, as a young black boy named Lesra reads Carter's book, the first and most empowering book the boy will read. Lesra becomes so inspired by the parallels between Carter and himself that he takes a personal interest in the case. Carter amazes Lesra; he sees something in him that only a boy of struggle could understand. And just as equally, Carter sees something in Lesra that only a man of confinement could behold. This leads Lesra to persuade his three Canadian mentors to help Carter fight his case for freedom, collecting facts that were overlooked as evidence the first time around. Carter struggled for freedom for twenty-two years and that final trial is shown in the films third act (a palpable weak link in my opinion). Still the Hurricane works on the basis of discovery. Jewison plays things smart by placing the burden on character and not their surroundings. You want to learn because you care about the characters and not what they did. I guess that is why the ending is weak, it tries to explain the actions taken during Carters life and tries to peg people as labels instead of characters. The screenplay also touches on race, maybe `touches on' is an understated adjective but nevertheless the ideas are there. Carter's resentment towards white people is a strong running theme throughout the film, sometimes even over taking the story, leaving things awkward and confused, seemingly forcing opinions on the audience in a film that wants you to form them for yourself. The direction from Jewison is superb; this is his best film since In Country. This material works well because Jewison knows how to present it in a manner that symbolises something that would not otherwise be stated. This is not a film about jail, or freedom. It is not about boxing or commitment. It is a film about struggle, defiance and personal motivation, as directed metaphorically to be something that you can both connect to and understand as a singular unit. Denzel Washington stars as the title character in a brilliant portrayal of real life struggle that almost seems born for Washington to play. He retains exactly the right amount of poise and suppressed idealism to manoeuvre around the entire emotional ark of Carter, making him just as much a symbolic presentation of determination though suffering as a real life hopeful. He never lets things slip into a pit of sentiment. Even when the story seems to be headed down the insincere path to happiness, Washington brings things back to reality. He reminds us that this is a man whose life has been built around little in positive respect. Washington has crafted a career around films that allow him to express what he has to offer as an actor and not just the dialogue he speaks, this one is no exception. He is one of those rare actors that can make even the drabbest dialogue seem meaningful. Even through insightful phrases like `Hate put me in prison, loves going to bust me out,' The Hurricane worked on so many more levels of exploration than just deliberate sentiment. This film goes deeper than that, its suggests that emotion is created out of feelings and not assumptions.  The end result of this film is like a boxing match. It is unpredictable and could possess many outcomes. It will disappoint some and amaze others. It is tough and filled with spite, but the fight lasts not out of courage, but out of instinct."
"bburns","8","1","3","19 April 2000"," Very good, but fact & fiction don't blend well
","Watching ""The Hurricane"", I was moved by Denzel Washington's portrayal of wrongly imprisoned boxer Rubin Carter.  Carter (""Hurricane"" to fans, ""Rube"" to friends) is a deeply conflicted, deeply spiritual, deeply intellectual, and deeply angry man.  Washington has not played a role this meaty since ""Malcolm X"".  He is particularly good when he converses with his own hate and fear personified.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's plot hinges on a character played by Dan Hedaya who has no real life counterpart, and the parts that were made up for the movie (about a third of the film) stick out like ugly yellow dandelions on an otherwise beautiful green lawn.  And the prison scenes have some of the same sentimentality as ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and I'm not comfortable with sentimentality in prison movies.<br/><br/>Altogether, however, although this is no masterpiece, it is a very good film.  I rated it an 8."
"MickeyTo","Null","1","3","26 March 2000"," A showcase performance for Washington!
","Three cheers to Roger Ebert who commented recently on the bickering and scandals surrounding the film The Hurricane, and the fact that certain inaccuracies could hurt Denzel Washington's chances as a Best Actor Oscar. As Ebert says, ""Who cares?""  We don't go to films to be educated - we go to be entertained.  Let's judge the film on those merits instead.<br/><br/>Reubin 'Hurricane' Carter is the man who 'could have been a contender' had his professional career not been cut short in the 1960's when he was convicted for murdering several people in a bar.  <br/><br/>The film examines the life of Hurricane, how he spends his days in jail, the facts (and perhaps the fiction) surrounding the case, and the circumstances surrounding the appeals.  Throughout we see a character transform from an angry street kid to a tired, but not yet defeated, older man. <br/><br/>
Hurricane's story reaches a young boy who has been 'rescued' from the streets of New York by a group of happy-go-lucky Torontonian's.  The boy and his foster family take on Hurricane's case after several others have given up.  <br/><br/>I'm not familiar with the full story myself and, like Roger Ebert, I really don't think it matters.  I have seen recent interviews with Reuben Carter and have read enough about the case to know that this film captures the essence of the story and the spirit of the man.  Furthermore, The Hurricane makes a pretty strong statement on its own.  <br/><br/>In the end, this film truly belongs to Denzel Washington.  His performance is near flawless, playing someone who is not perfect, but certainly remarkable.  Over the past few years we have seen Washington become somewhat mannered in his performances, however, he is usually playing icy professionals in simplistic thrillers.  In Hurricane, the Washington mannerisms are tossed aside as he delivers a performance that is fresh.  You can not take your eyes off of him - he is that good!<br/><br/>I did have problems with the movie, and none of them had to do with the facts surrounding the case.  I didn't understand, nor buy into, the Canadians who worked on Hurricane's last appeal.  Their undying conviction for this man was honorable, but lacked reason.  We Canadians can be friendly, but not to the extent that we would leave everything behind and move down south.  <br/><br/>On a more personal note, the way that Toronto was depicted was almost laughable.  The first scene projects two characters walking through Ontario Place, under the shadow of the CN Tower.  They are heading to a book fair (where they stumble upon Hurricane's biography) and one is complaining about the cold.  The other replies by saying that he'd better get used to it as this is summer!  Let me assure you that Toronto sees some pretty muggy days. Ask anyone who has been sprawled out over the air conditioner in July. <br/><br/>
In the end, The Hurricane, while sometimes predictable, works.  Washington delivers some great lines.  This character in this film delivers a strong message that is, for once, positive.  And the story does bring tears to the eyes once in awhile."

","This movie was much more.  It made me think about prejudice in my lifetime, like I've never looked at it before.  Reuben ""Hurricaine"" Carter was a man like no other.  He taught that young man some lessons but he also taught me some lessons in prejudice.  I don't consider myself in any way shape of form, prejudice.  I can understand 100% why he felt the way he did towards whites, I feel I would've felt the same.  Why that cop had it out for him escapes me, because other than having a troubled youth, he did nothing to this man, to deserve being tracked down every time something happened, and being blamed for it.  Carter is a strong man, but most of his strength comes in his character and soul, not from his fists or his hatred.  He deserved to hate, he had that right, he earned it.  I'm glad that he chose to leave the country, because I believe that cop would've done it again if given the chance.  I'm also glad that he decided to trust these white people, because it taught him that we are not all bad, too.  I admire him, and I thank him for opening my eyes to the colors of the world!"

","""The Hurricane""<br/><br/>Rated R for language and some violent content<br/><br/>Starring Denzel Washington, Vicellous Reon Shannon, and John Hannah<br/><br/>Plot:  A boxer (Washington), is sent to prison for life for a murder he did not commit.  A group of Canadians, led by a fierce, young Brooklynite (Shannon), try their hardest to get him out of jail.<br/><br/>As you probably know, ""The Hurricane"" is based on the story of boxer Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter, who was jailed in the 1960s for a murder that he did not commit.  Though the film doesn't have all the facts straight, as they were presented in the biography of Carter by James S. Hirsch, but some of them are right.  He is from New Jersey, and he was jailed with a young man named John Artis (Garland Whitt).  <br/><br/>In the film, Vicellous Reon Shannon plays Lezra Martin, a young Brooklynite living with some Canadians in Toronto.  Martin stumbles upon a ""The 16th Round"", an actual autobiography written by Carter.  Intrigued by Carter's story, Martin believes in his innocence and starts exchanging letters with Carter, who is at this point in a Trenton prison.  They soon meet and Martin convinces his caretakers, a few educated Canadians, to get a lawyer to fight for Carter's freedom.  <br/><br/>Shannon has a breakout performance, as does Denzel Washington as Ruben Carter.  I believe Washington is definately one of the best actors in the world right now, putting compelling performances into everyone of his flicks.  Washington brings presence to this drama, and if Carter, a hotshot boxer who never listens to the rules, were played by someone else, it probably wouldn't be as good as Washington's performance.  Washington's performance, as well as the breakout one by Shannon, is indeed worth seeing the film for, even though it is a brilliant film anyway.  Kudos on this great biopic.<br/><br/>My Rating: 8 out of 10 or B+"
"youaresobusted","Null","1","3","29 September 2000"," Possibly the most overrated film of 1999
","Formulaic, slow and fairly dull, THE HURRICANE does not, in my humble opinion, do justice to the unfortunate life of its hero, Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter.<br/><br/>I'm not going into the story, except to say that its unfolding and ending are predictable to the point of boredom.  The script is disjointed, jumping uncomfortably from Canada to the prison, from past to present.  The film attempts to raise issues of racism unsuccessfully, avoiding explorations of the US legal system and explanations of how corrupt or bigoted cops get away with what they might do.  Dan Hedaya's character is a stock villain, with cliched lines and little vigour or zest.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington's performance is adequate, though nothing special or powerful.  That we won a Golden Globe over Richard Farnsworth (THE STRAIGHT STORY), Russell Crowe (THE INSIDER) and even Matt Damon (THE TALENTED MR RIPLEY) come as a surprise.  However, it is only Washington that holds this viewer's interest until Rod Steiger makes his commanding cameo as the judge toward the end.  He manages to steal the entire two hours plus from Washington in his short few minutes.<br/><br/>The script is much to blame for the sluggish pace but a director of Norman Jewison's calibre would be expected to do better.  The film lacks the gritty feeling of RAGING BULL.  The B&W work of Roger Deakins is surprisingly glossy in the boxing scenes.  Deakins has shown that he can do better: look at his unconventional work on FARGO, KUNDUN and THE SHAWSHANK REDEMPTION, for example.  Jewison is probably to blame for this, too, as he had a hand in the film as producer.<br/><br/>Rubin Carter's story is quite a story that did need to be told, I'm sure. However, I'm certain that the Hollywood version does little justice to an apparently great man."
"ary","Null","1","3","21 September 2000"," Boring and pretentious c**p
","This is the biography of Rubin `Hurricane' Carter (Denzel Washinton, in a fine performance), a fearless boxer who almost becomes the Champion of the World, 'till he is unjustly accused of murder. He spends twenty two years of his life behind the bars,and then decides to write a book, `The 16th Round', to tell his story to the people. A young, African-American kid (Vicellous Reon Shannon) casually buys a copy of the book and becomes fascinated with Carter's life. He sees some parallel between his life and Carter's life, and the boxer inspires the kid to reach his goals.He decides to help Carter and get him out of the jail, counting with the help of his three Canadian friends (Deborah Unger, Liev Schreiber and John Hannah).The film is a little bit slow and too long. It starts out o.k. and gives an insight in Carter's childhood and how he became the enraged guy he was, but it soon fails miserably when it tries to be too moralist and pretentious.The story could have been told in less than two hours, but filmmaker Norma Jewison, the man behind classics like In the Heat of the Night, directed `Hurricane' in a bureaucratic and tiresome way. Although the basic idea is very interesting, this film doesn't have emotion and strength enough to sustain the patience of the audience for two and a half hour, every year theaters are bombarded with `court room dramas' (like Rules of Engagement, etc.), and this is just one more of them. The performances of a great trio of stars save, in parts, the movie. Rod Steiger has little screen time, but his appearance is powerful and energetic, and his imposing presence helps to elevate the quality of the motion picture. Denzel Washington is very good, but this certainly wasn't a part for which he should have been nominated for an Oscar, he was better in The Bone Collector. Dan Hedaya also has a small part, but he creates a hateful and racist villain. As a whole, ""Hurricane"" is an o.k. film that had plenty of possibilities but that ended up screwed by a bad script and an uninspired direction."

","The Hurricane is an inspirational story about a guy who was wrongfully imprisoned and how he does all he can to set himself free. This is a moving story and the direction by Norman Jewison is very solid. Also, Denzel Washington gives a magnificent performance as he always do. What adds significance to this story is that it is based on a true story. It may not be historically accurate as we would like, but it's still true enough to the source material that we actually believe the events that happened in the movie.<br/><br/>Norman Jewison's film is about a guy named Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter who has dealt with the law since before he was a teenager. After he was wrongfully accused of a triple murder and was sent to life in prison, he receives the help three Canadian activists who works their very hardest to set this man free.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, Denzel is one of the greatest actors of my generation and possibly the entire history of cinema. He gives a gritty performance and really takes the part of the role very well. The other actors are very well in particular Liev Schreiber, John Hannah, and Dan Hedaya.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a powerhouse film about a guy who is imprisoned because of racial hatred. The acting carries the film especially Denzel. I don't think anyone other than Denzel would be really effective in this role. I rate this film 9/10."

","Jewison's 'The Hurricane' is pretty much a familiar biopic where the hero struggles during his youth, he is wrongfully accused of a heinous crime and the whole world is against him until, years later, with the help of a few friends, he manages to fight the system and win. The story is pretty formulaic but Jewison tells it well.<br/><br/>The passage of time and growth and aging of characters are well demonstrated. The pace is a little slow at times but manages to quickly pick up. The reason why such biopics, provided that they're well-made, manage to pull a crowd and grip the viewer is because it reminds of the struggles one goes through and to fight and overcome obstacles rather than give up and give in. The dialogues, especially those between Carter and Lesra and Lisa, are outstanding.<br/><br/>In addition, 'The Hurricane' further showcases Denzel Washington's performance. It is also crucial for a biopic to have at least good performances and Washington's nuanced portrayal really makes 'The Hurricane' a strong movie. He is excellently supported by a sincere Vicellous Reon Shannon, a beautiful Deborah Kara Unger, and charming John Hannah and Liev Schreiber.<br/><br/>On the flip side, while the movie is pretty much in support of the protagonists, the 'bad' guys are portrayed as full-fledged villains. Den Hedaya's Della absolutely has no redeeming quality and he comes across as a caricature as do the rest of the racist characters. Like many biopics, 'The Hurricane' also does not reveal every single many crucial facts about the case (such as the situations with the lie detector). I also wanted to know more about the Canadians. Who were they really? Overall 'The Hurricane' could have been a better movie but still remains an uplifting film that reminds people to fight on, overcome obstacles and believe in love and compassion."

"zardoz-13","10","1","5","3 April 2008"," Watch This Terrifice Story of Criminal Injustice
","""The Hurricane"" qualifies as Denzel Washington's best movie since Spike Lee's ""Malcolm X."" Truth is stranger than fiction, and ""In the Heat of the Night"" director Norman Jewison's ""The Hurricane"" proves it. Although Hollywood has tampered with the facts about Rubin Carter and his stormy relationship with the racist New Jersey criminal justice system, this knock-out ""Rocky"" meets ""Les Miserables"" biography about a erroneously imprisoned pugilist sticks closely to the truth. For example, nine Canadian hippies instead of three unearthed the evidence that ultimately freed Carter. Moreover, the Canadiansportrayed like the cavalry riding to the rescueresemble Bob Vila's elves rather than commune members! As a reckless youth, Rubin Carter attracted trouble like a magnet in a steelyard. Arrested as a juvenile for stabling a prominent white businessman thatCarter claimstried to molest one of his friends, Rubin comes under the constant scrutiny of racist Detective Sergeant Vincent Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya of ""Tightrope""). Della Pesca devotes his career to railroading Carter. Later, Carter escapes from reform school and enlists in the U.S. Army, where he becomes a paratrooper and a middleweight boxer. No sooner has he returned home from the Army than Della Pesca arrests him again, and Carter has to serve out his reform school sentence.<br/><br/>Della Pesca hates Carter so much that when the latter achieves fame as a middleweight boxer, Della Pesca frames him for a triple homicide in a bar. Furthermore, he bribes two burglars that witnessed the crime to commit to testify that Carter committed the killings! Later, the burglars recanted their false testimony. While Carter won a retrial, the courts upheld his original conviction. Celebrities championed his case, but Carter languished in prison for 19 years. During that soul-eroding time, Carter penned his autobiography ""The 16th Round."" Years later at a used book sale, a black teenager, Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon of ""Hart's War""), found the book. Martin was a Brooklyn native living in Canada with members of a commune that had adopted him to tutor him for his college entrance exams. Carter's book touched Lesra, and he visited Carter in prison. They became close friends and pen pals. Eventually, Lesra's guardians began to smell a rat in the injustice dealt Carter. They moved from Canada and promised Carter that they wouldn't quit until he was exonerated.<br/><br/>Oscar-winner Denzel Washington of ""Glory"" excels as the incorrectly convicted boxer that earned his nickname 'Hurricane' from the gale-force rage of blows he dealt his opponents in the ring. Dan Hedaya, who was not surprisingly overlooked for his villainous portrayal of the evil Della Pesca, richly deserved a Best Supporting Oscar. Veteran director Norman Jewison, who made ""A Soldier's Story,"" streamlines the truth for dramatic impact, particularly Della Pesca, not a real person but a metaphor for the corruption and injustice of the New Jersey criminal justice system. Despite the liberties that Jewison and scenarists Armyan Bernstein and Dan Gordon take with the truth, ""The Hurricane"" scores ten stars out of ten stars."

This is the kind of movie that changes your life when you see it.

One of the best scenes in the movie is when Reuben and his wife are talking after his request for an appeal has been turned down. The raw energy and reality of the scene is amazing and the quote, 'I'm dead.....bury me, please' is delivered so emotionally it literally reaches out to the viewer and screams the tone of the situation to them. Another great scene is when Lazarus visits Reuben for the first time and Reuben leans in close and asks, ""You think I killed those people?"" ""No, I know you didn't"" ""How you know?"" ""I just know."" This last line is delivered with such energy it almost made up for the blatant miscast of Lazarus, who was about 10 years older than he should have been, but he justified his part here.

The book is picked by Lesra Martin a young aspirational African-American male student who with some of his fellow white Canadian friends fights Carter's case for freedom and visits him regularly in jail where some exceptional emotional acting from Washington takes place.When Martin sends his outstanding college results accompanied with a beautiful emotional letter and moment is one of the pinnacles of the film,(Perfect piece of filming by Jewison). Eventually Washington is freed after the substantial legal flaws in the case which is mentioned in his autobiography are unearthed and presented to a modern day judge and jury. The film is my favourite and Washington after watching this film and his other masterpieces became my favourite actor (a excellent role model for African-Americans)and if the misrepresented facts in the film were corrected hands-down Washington would of one won his first Best Actor Oscar at the time eventually winning the accolade with his more publicised masterpiece 'Training Day' in 2001 (although he should of won at least two more Oscars for 'Mo' Better Blues' and 'Malcolm X'... well he is black) The film is highly recommended."

","In my opinion, the film ""The Hurricane"" was exceptional and I don't think that anyone could have portrayed Ruben Carter like Denzel Washington. Every time he plays the character of an African American leader he gives his all and he proved it in such films as Malcolm X and The Hurricane. Every trial and tribulation that Ruben Carter endured during his time in prison was brought to the screen with the help of  Denzel Washington and because of his outstanding performance I think that he should have won the Academy Award as Best Actor."

I found the answer very soon and I also found it was a good answer. For the answer is no, this is just how the story must be told. It is a heartwarming and heartbreaking story folks and it is well acted. I really loathe the fact that racism was and maybe even is so frequent in America and I must say this film could have also been told in a different way.

"Anonymous_Maxine","9","1","5","30 August 2000"," This is the best boxing film that's not really a boxing film since Rocky.
","There is no role that Denzel Washington fits more perfectly in than the kind he played in racially charged atmosphere in The Hurricane. When he and that poor kid John Artis were pulled over and the officer said that they were looking for two negroes in a white car, no actor could have been better than Denzel when he said, ""Any two will do?"" What a perfect piece of casting, and Denzel Washington was startlingly convincing as the legendary Rubin Carter throughout the entire film. Every actor performed amazingly, even Liev Schrieber, who makes a smart turn after all of his obnoxious performances in the Scream trilogy. However, I have to say that I did get a little bit tired of watching Vicellous Reon Shannon mumble through his lines as the determined Lesra Martin, but besides his slightly botched dialogue he also contributed an important element of innocence and wonder to the film.<br/><br/>The Hurricane is a nearly flawlessly photographed film. Every scene has such perfect cinematography that you forget that you're watching a movie, you're actually THERE. This was especially important in the many prison scenes, particularly when Carter was in ""the hole"" for refusing to wear prison clothes, where his fall into temporary insanity was creatively and amazingly portrayed. I've seen people go insane in a huge number of movies (Hilary and Jackie (1998), Shine (1996), Little Voice (1999), and even Little Man Tate (1991)), but I've never seen the editing used to make a character seem that he was actually having a conversation with himself. Excellent piece of filmmaking right there. The time periods were portrayed perfectly, the costumes were designed to fit not only the time period but also each specific actor, and the dialogue was absolutely engrossing in every scene.<br/><br/>
This was an absolutely incredible film. It moves the audience just as much as even the most emotionally intense films, and it is a great film to enjoy and learn from at the same time. Unfortunately, there were a few fairly important things that were left out that just should not have been. (spoilers) For example, we never find out what happened to Carter's wife. Sure, it's easy to assume that she divorced him, but after the scene when she visits him and he tells her that he's going to die in prison, we never see or hear from her or about her again. Also, nothing really came of the strong threats that Terry (John Hannah), Lisa (Deborah Unger), Sam (Liev Schrieber), and Lesra (Vicellous Shannon) received from Detective Vincent Pesca (Dan Hedaya) on the street corner that day except for one time when their brakes were evidently disabled. Sure, that's a pretty vicious thing to do, but when he approached the four of them he seemed pretty determined to stop their investigation at all costs. The last thing that I think should be noted (as well as the most important), is that at the end of the film, nothing ever came of the heinous crimes that were committed against Rubin Carter. None of the people who falsely imprisoned him (especially Det. Pesca, who had falsely imprisoned Carter for most of his life) were ever reprimanded for their negligence to uphold the law. At the same time, however, this can be seen as a very respectable element of the film, because it suggests that the movie is about the tremendous strength of the human spirit in the face of hopeless circumstances, and that it is NOT about revenge. This is the kind of thing that you get from films that are somehow able to avoid the poisonous influences of Hollywood, and they are often not easily accepted because people don't look at the actual meaning of things like this, they just want a perfectly happy ending. The Hurricane is an example of a film in which you have to look at what the ending MEANS, not just the basic way that it happened. This same is true for other great films like Boys Don't Cry (1999) and Life Is Beautiful (1997). The emphasis is not on happy endings, but instead on being as accurate as possible in the depiction of reality, which does not work at all like a movie does. This type of thing is especially important in true stories, such as The Hurricane.<br/><br/>The Hurricane is among the most powerful films released in years. I think that it is just as emotionally intense as films like Schindler's List and American History X and, like both of the above mentioned films, it not only provides wonderful entertainment, but it also tackles one of the most important messages that can possibly be delivered to our society today - the destructive power of racism. From the opening scenes of the movie, you just love Rubin Carter, and the way that his life is demolished because of racism and prejudice is an extremely powerful thing to watch. Every scene is saturated with emotion and intelligence and cinematic skill, and the end result is magical."

","""The Hurricane"" may have been the best film of 1999. It is the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Washington, in an Oscar-nominated role), a middle-weight boxer who was wrongly accused of multiple murders and ended up spending nearly 20 years in a New Jersey prison. Washington is so solid here. He dominates the action. He makes the film succeed all by himself. All the supporters help Washington's cause and Norman Jewison's sharp direction keeps the film intriguing and solid all the way through.

","15 years after The Hurricane came out Rubin Carter passed away still quite the
symbol of what can happen when a malignant criminal justice system puts a

nickname in the boxing arena given him for the speed and accuracy of the deadly
attack in the ring. He was forever Rubin Hurricane Carter even after he fought
his last fight.<br/><br/>After his boxing career had wound down he and a friend were picked up in his
home town of Patterson, New Jersey because they vaguely resembled two men who had shot up and robbed a bar and killed 3 people. On some flimsy
evidence and some evidence withheld Carter and the other man went to jail
and probably escaped the death penalty because it wasn't being used at the
time.<br/><br/>Besides the background events The Hurricane mostly focuses on the events 
of Carter trying to clear himself and the young kid who reads the book Carter
wrote while he was in prison. The best scenes in the film are Vicellous Shannon as young Lezra and Denzel Washington as Carter.<br/><br/>The Hurricane brought Denzel Washington one of his Oscar nominations and
he will keep you riveted on the screen with his intensity. Occasionally Washington boils over, but it's the slow simmering tension he conveys as Carter
that really keeps you watching. His scenes with Shannon are a great relief for
him as in this kid he meets someone who believes his story and gets what he's
about.<br/><br/>Besides Washington and Shannon, performances to watch out for are Rod
Steiger as Judge Sarokin who is the federal judge who decides Carter's fate and
Dan Hedaya as the incredibly vicious and racist police lieutenant who made
incarcerating Carter a life's obsession.<br/><br/>The real Rubin Carter could not have had his story better told than be Denzel

","The Hurricane tells the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter (Denzel Washington) an African-American boxer whose boxing career comes to an unexpected end when Carter and his friend John Artis are both convicted for murdering 3 people at a nightclub. Carter has always maintained his innocence and has fought unsuccessfully for a retrial for several years. Lesra (Vicellous Shannon) strikes up a friendship with Carter after being inspired by what he read in Carter's own book and also happens to believe in Carter's innocence. With the help of his three mentors; Lisa, Sam and Terry they all set about gathering as much evidence as possible to prove Carter's innocence and in getting him the retrial that they all feel that he deserves.<br/><br/>The opening credits for this film clearly state that this film is ""based upon a true story but that some characters have been invented and some incidents have been fictionalised"". This statement probably exists to try to counter-balance those 1 star reviews from people that claim that it's rubbish because it's historically inaccurate. Well from what I've seen this is certainly not a rubbish film; in fact it's actually a very good film.<br/><br/>The first thing that needs to be acknowledged here is Denzel Washington's performance; this is probably the best that I've seen from him and sometimes when watching a film I get the impression that some film roles mean much more to some actors than some of their other projects (Forest Whitaker in The Last King of Scotland is a good example). Likewise Washington really gets into character and brings Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter to life, his multi-layered performance always makes Washington fascinating to watch here and coupled with an interesting character such as Rubin Carter the film is never less than compelling. The time and effort that Washington has invested in his role as Rubin Carter really shows here; he looks tough and it's evident that he has spent considerable amounts of time training for this role (one year with a boxing coach according to IMDb Trivia). It's a shame that he wasn't awarded with an Oscar for his performance as he definitely deserved one (he was nominated however).<br/><br/>Aside from a fabulous turn from Washington what you also get here is an interesting and engaging story about a black man's fight for freedom against a police department with somewhat racist tendencies. The only real flaw with the story is that it is shamelessly one-sided and I get the feeling that some of the fictionalised incidents and characters exist to represent Carter being the victim and the police as the villains. It probably would have been a better film if Carter was represented in a good and bad light which at least would have allowed us to judge him for ourselves (even when he does something bad the film seems to try and make excuses for him). Whilst these things didn't take away my enjoyment of the film, they do make the film feel rather manipulative and I can imagine that this may leave some viewers feeling a little dissatisfied.<br/><br/>The 'fictionalised' story is certainly presented professionally; the boxing footage is good, the story unfolds fairly well (although the way that the story jumps back and forwards is a little distracting and unfortunately makes the film feel a little episodic and repetitive). Despite being well-presented and interesting, the storyline is a little old hat now, predictable and rather clichéd, but the strong acting and the way the whole thing is mounted easily cover over most of the cracks.<br/><br/>In order to enjoy this film you really have to see it as a story; the film makes out that Carter was proved to be innocent at the end (in reality his case was thrown out on a technicality due to the prosecution mishandling evidence). The film is one-sided and manipulative which will cause problems for some people, but as for me I still enjoyed the story that was presented to me and thought that Denzel Washington was magnificent and it's worth a look for Washington's performance alone."

I liked the movie, but only in recent years going back and watching it again did I realize just what a great film this is- in spite of the falsehoods used. <br/><br/>Two-time Academy award winner, Denzel Washington, gives one of his finest performances as middleweight champion Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, who was twice convicted of a triple homicide in the 1960s, and spent almost twenty years in prison before finally having his conviction overturned. Washington is so great in the role, especially at times you can see the vulnerability of the character- just amazing work! And a special shout out to young actor Vicellous Reon Shannon (who was great in the HBO film ""Dancing In September"") as Lazarus, the young man who befriends Carter after reading his autobiography, and later helps out with his case. This movie was partially based on the book ""Lazarus and the Hurricane"".<br/><br/>I've looked into the real facts of the case- such as that supposed racist cop played by Nick Tortelli (or Dan Hedaya rather LOL), who turns out there was never such evidence with his character- and the facts maybe even supporting that Carter was in fact guilty-?? I see this as one of two things. After he got out of prison I know he became an advocate for seeking the release of those wrongly imprisoned, so either he was innocent or he was guilty and maybe redeemed himself a little bit-?? (that's after the 20 years in prison too). And as film critic Roger Ebert put it- sometimes you get at the heart of the ""dramatic truth""- if you want the exact literal truth, you watch a documentary. Norman Jewison directed this film, who was actually the original director of ""Malcolm X"" before Spike Lee's involvement, and had directed Washington previously in ""A Soldier's Story"".

Then color gap or racism ...ppl hatred and he found guilty for murder he never did.

"classicsoncall","8","0","2","5 August 2012"," ""It is very important to transcend the places that hold us.""
","My rating for the picture has to do with the way the story was conveyed on film, irrelevant of the actual facts of the Rubin Carter murder case. In that respect, the movie is a pretty compelling one even if it runs a bit long. However on the flip side, as I read some other reviewers here and dip into some of the facts surrounding the murders, I have a real sense of disappointment that this turned into just another Hollywood 'treatment' of a controversial figure. Even the scene of Carter's match against Joey Giardello in which he was 'robbed' of the middleweight title can be fact checked against the actual footage of the fight, so where's the percentage in going against reality? I was ready to go all out about Carter's perseverance and the injustice of his situation, racism and corrupt cops, the whole nine yards, but now I have to over compensate for the picture's opening remarks stating that 'some characters have been composited or invented, and a number of incidents fictionalized'. Really? Composited, invented? That's a real downer.<br/><br/>I'll give Denzel Washington his due - his portrayal here proves he's a master of his craft. Dan Hedaya made you hate him as the corrupt Sergeant Detective, and he was a compelling figure too, but then again he was one of those invented characters. That Dylan song went a long way to inspire celebrity talent to take up the cause at the time, but I wonder how they feel now, Dylan, Ellen Burstyn, if in fact they bothered to learn more about the case than a surface treatment would suggest. I've always been suspect of films that billed themselves as 'based on a true story'. Now I have more reason than ever to be suspicious."

","What a disappointing movie. Who really cares about what happened to Rubin Carter? Who knows whether he was innocent or guilty? The movie suggest that his arrest and conviction was unfair, and maybe it was. But how does that translate into something dramatic? The criminal justice system is not perfect, and miscarriages of justice happen. Now, do these miscarriages of justice make for good drama? The answer is no, because of the highly bureaucratic nature of the criminal justice system which reduces even the most explosive situations down to case files and case numbers, which perhaps is the way it is supposed to be. Mr. Carter's case was initiated, processed, and finalized, and while he was going through the process, many other defendants were going through the same process too. For each defendant the process is dramatic because their life is being affected, but for everyone else, it's just a case. If Mr. Carter was in fact wrongly accused and convicted, then that is a tragedy, but one the depth of which cannot be conveyed in a movie. The injustice is smothered by the sheer weight of the paperwork which highlights the essential indifference of an unfeeling bureaucracy which reduces its subjects to case numbers and treats them accordingly."

The drama in the late court room sequence with an aged Rod Steiger doing a good job as judge, is very well staged.<br/><br/>The DVD set of Washington films recently released with this and Malcom X is definitely worth spending so time with.

"noodles-13","5","0","2","17 August 2006"," Great acting in an under-average movie
","I had great expectations for this movie, which eventually have been disappointed. A lot of fictitious characters have been added for no apparent reason. The evil and racist policeman (Della Pesca) who prosecutes Carter even since he was a 6 years old child is one of the most silly and useless (if not detrimental) characters I ever saw in a ""based on a true story"" movie. The three good Canadian Samaritans literally come from nowhere and the script should give us some ideas about them. Apparently, they succeed, as amateur detectives/lawyers, where dozens of others had failed, just because they are guided by peace love and unity. The scene in the isolation cell-block, where three different ""Hurricanes"" deal one with each other to symbolize the different sides of the character's personality is a mere clichÃ¨ and, frankly, the similar scene involving Gollum in the Ring's saga had a more realistic touch (enough said, I guess). What remains, in the end: an outstanding performance of Denzel Washington, whose personal involvement in the project can be clearly perceived in his acting. Not enough to me, unfortunately. For a ""boxe&prison"" movie, one could find a lot more intensity and truth in Walter Hill's ""Undisputed""."
"PeterJordan","7","0","2","9 August 2006"," Excellent portrayal by Washington
","The Hurricane is an inspiring biopic of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter whom I had only brief previous knowledge of, predominantly through Bob Dylan's excellent narrative song ""The Hurricane"".<br/><br/>Denzel Washington gives a sterling and Oscar nominated performance of Rubin Carter over a thirty year period, from his initial youthful run in's with a vengeful, grudge bearing and corrupt detective, through his boxing career and his bid for the world middleweight boxing crown followed by his framing and long imprisonment for a New Jersey bar room triple murder.<br/><br/>Rubin Carter was one of those cause celebre's a la Nelson Mandela, The Birmingham Six and The Guilford Four all of whom attracted considerable public attention, high profile personalities and a series of failed appeals which, it would seem if the movie and Bob Dylan's song are true, if they were to succeed would have meant exposing a deep rooted racism and corruption within the New Jersey police and the judicial system that went right to the top.<br/><br/>Even within the movie itself, the point is made that even though Rubin's cause has managed to gain attention and many high profile supporters including Muhammad Ali and the aforementioned Dylan, very few have really managed to stay the course and stick with it doggedly over a twenty year span which has seen the failure of two appeals and even a biography penned by Carter within prison (""The 19th Round"") laying out his claim for innocence and the trail of events that got him to where he is.<br/><br/>It is out of this biography, long discarded and battered and published so long ago that it's been forgotten by most, that Reuben's hope for clearing his name is reawakened, in the hands of a barely literate young black refugee from the Bronx called Lesra Martin who has himself been taken under the benevolent wing of a threesome of somewhat idealistic, hippyish, but well intentioned Canadians in Toronto. Lesra chooses the battered volume as his first ever book purchase attending a used book sale with his Canadian friends. In another parallel, right from the start, Lesra finds similarities and something of a soulmate in reading about the life and fate of ""The Hurricane"". Eventually the story so inspires and motivates young Lesra that he kick-starts a new campaign to get Rubin freed and succeeds in enlisting the help of his Canadian friends to do so.<br/><br/>Admittedly, whilst the goodie goodie and over idealistic, even bordering on sinister, intentions of the Canadian threesome are at times somewhat unbelievable (They live in a sort of a threesome commune, surviving apparently quite comfortably renovating and selling houses, have plucked a young black kid from the streets of the Bronx and out of the grasp of his alcoholic parents, merely because they believe in him and feel he ""deserves a chance"" in life and NOW, along with their young black friend, they uproot their lives to move from Toronto to New Jersey ""for as long as it takes"" to prove Rubin's innocence) yet there is quite the air of realism in aspects of the difficulties and dilemmas they encounter such as the harassment (apparently very much truth based) they get from senior forces in New Jersey, but most significantly during their first visit to Rubin in prison. Indeed this is one area of the movie that pulls no punches and doesn't attempt any major makeover of Rubin's character. The Canadian's are subjected to his full wrath and venom and all the hateful spewing of an oppressed black man that has through experience come to hate all white men and everything they stand for. Of course his character isn't overtly polished or sanctified either. He has had his brushes with the law, all be it, if we are to believe the film at least, unprovoked. His swaggering, intimidatory ways and arrogance (though he terms it ""pride"") and indeed his real life temper are touched upon at least, albeit minimally most notably in a scene where he meets his future wife. However even with all this, Washington's portrayal of the Hurricane is so touching and sympathetic that one does come to respect and like this guy and to feel really sorry and angry at the way he has been wronged.<br/><br/>Possibly the major achievement of this movie is its documentation of one mans near descent into madness and total despair when the only way he can survive in the end is to retreat deep into himself and completely shut off the outside world. It is a credit to the talent of Denzel Washington as an actor the way he carries this portrayal off so convincingly. However whilst it may take all of his inner composure to survive and stay sane, it will take much more and the efforts and perseverance of others outside to prove his innocence. This is essentially what the last third of the movie deals with and similar to other ""based on a true story"" movies it has attracted some criticism of how events and incidences were condensed and manipulated to suit the plot and lead to the desired outcome.<br/><br/>That aside, this is an emotive movie about major miscarriages of justice and the necessity for perseverance of hope within utter despair and indeed for perseverance full stop.<br/><br/>I also particularly liked the sound track of this move, which predictably enough featured Dylan's song along with some other jammin' tracks particularly the one about ""the revolution"".<br/><br/>Finally as a point of trivia, this movie stars one Clancy Brown, reprising his role from Shawshank Redemption as a prison guard, all be it this time a sympathetic one who treats Reuben with the respect and dignity he desires right from the start, as opposed to the brutal figure he played in Shawshank."

"vchimpanzee","Null","0","2","7 July 2003"," Inspiring but also depressing fact-based story; well-done, especially Washington's performance (SPOILERS)
","The movie begins with a 1963 boxing match, filmed in black and white, involving Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter.  Then we see a scene from 1973, in color, where Carter is worried the manuscript from his book will be taken away, but a compassionate guard tries to assure Carter that doesn't have to happen.  After we go back and forth between the two settings for a while, it is 1966 and we see the murders for which Carter was convicted, but we can't see who committed them.  Outside after the murders, we are unable to see any more than one of the witnesses does.<br/><br/>Then it is the 1980s and Lesra, a troubled black teenager, has moved in with Lisa, Sam and Terry, who are white and want to help him make his life better.  They met when Lesra was working for the EPA, and after finding out Lesra didn't know how to read, they want to teach Lesra to read.  One of his first books is Carter's autobiography.  As Lesra reads, Denzel Washington narrates, and we see Carter's life in flashbacks, starting when he was young and got in big trouble for the first time.  According to the movie, Carter was merely defending himself from a pedophile, though the police did not believe him, since the man was one of the city's leading citizens.  Though we don't get to see any of the time he spent there, Carter is sentenced to a juvenile detention facility. Later, Carter is home while serving in the military, wearing his uniform. He has cleaned up his life and vowed to improve himself mentally and physically.  But even then, he can't stay out of trouble.<br/><br/>Some of the scenes relating to the murders are shown again, along with new ones.  Apparently one of the people who said Carter committed the murders was trying to get out of trouble.  And one of the cops remembered him from before and just had it in for Carter.<br/><br/>Once in prison, Carter thinks he can go against the rules.  The warden won't hear of it.  Carter takes everything that is thrown at him, but one guard thinks he can give Carter special treatment and get Carter to stop behaving in a way that could kill him.<br/><br/>The flashbacks stop for the most part (if they don't get confusing enough, Lisa also picks up the book and Washington starts narrating).  Lesra starts a pen-pal relationship with Carter that eventually leads to visits.  Lesra and his friends believe they can help Carter get out of prison, but so far his many attempts to appeal have failed.<br/><br/>Washington gives a wonderful performance.  He is positively terrifying in the boxing ring and during his angry episodes as a prisoner.  Most of the time he comes across as dignified, intelligent, and somewhat bitter but not chronically angry.  He can also be vulnerable and even sad, and borderline insane.  And of course Washington does happy very well, something we don't get to see enough of since Carter didn't have many reasons to be happy.  His Oscar nomination was certainly deserved.<br/><br/>Vicellous Reon Shannon also does a good job as Lesra, and Deborah Unger plays Lisa well, especially in the second half.  Al Waxman commands respect as the warden, and Clancy Brown is quite likeable as the guard who treated Carter like a human being.<br/><br/>Lesra is inspired to make something of himself as he gets to know Carter, and in this way I suppose it was valuable to learn about Carter the way he did.  We are also inspired by Carter's struggle, but we get let down a lot.<br/><br/>I have two major complaints about the movie:  Mae Thelma obviously cared a lot for Carter, judging from her reaction to his conviction, but we never saw his relationship with her develop, and we heard little from her throughout the rest of the movie.  Also, the constant flashbacks at the beginning were quite confusing, as we went back and forth from one time period to another.  The flashbacks came back later in the movie, but they were necessary to illustrate the process of appealing Carter's case. The boxing scenes also appeared well done, though I'm no boxing fan. Overall, I found this movie very worthwhile and entertaining, especially toward the end.<br/><br/>*********************SPOILERS********************<br/><br/>Lesra and his friends moved to be near Carter and help with his appeal.  The efforts that have failed over many years suddenly shift into high gear, and it's quite exciting to watch the process of finding out the truth.  A risky strategy takes the case into federal court, and Rod Steiger gives an impressive performance as the judge.  It is a case of all or nothing.  This makes the ending a real joy to watch. In case you don't know, Carter did get out of prison.  I only say this because it's probably well-known."

"zza99tmk","5","0","2","27 March 2000"," worth seeing mainly because of Denzel Washington
","""The Hurricane"" was after ""Magnolia"" (decent, partly inventive work with some flaws) and ""The Cider House Rules"" (indecisive and boring take on abortion and incest) the third movie I've seen this weekend and in terms of quality it is somewhere in between the other two. Norman Jewison has made a moody, sometimes incredibly intense, but also predictable and somehow unsatisfying movie. It owes SO MUCH to Denzel Washingtons performance as Rubin Carter that one actually has to see it to believe it. I've always thought of Washington as one of the most reliable actors around, but in this film he was simply superb. He was so good that often I forgot how conventional the movie actually was. Don't misunderstand me, I really felt with Carter and was absorbed into the story of his life, but mainly because of Washington. The film relies on well known premises: You get the racist detective (I can't remember the actor's name right now, but he's played corrupt characters before, so that's just another case of lazy type casting) and you get the good ones, here in form of the Canadians and the black boy Lesra Martin and of course the Salomon-like judge in the courtroom finale. So ""The Hurricane"" does nothing more than corresponding to usual plot lines and characterizations. Well, that's not so bad in this case, but it prevents Jewisons film from becoming the outstanding experience it could have been. Furthermore I would have liked to see much more about the public and celebrity support Carter has got during his sentence; to play Bob Dylans song twice or three times and only to show a three minute demonstration scene is not enough. And there is an another scene which doesn't work for the film; it is the one where the canadians visit Carter in jail and he says that they can't imagine the inhumanity and the hell of the prison. Well, that might be the case, but we can only rely on Washingtons intense portrayal, the film itself never really gives us an impression of what Carter is talking about. After all, it is one of these movies, which when you are seeing them, amazes you and makes you want to value them better as they are. When it's over and you've got some distance between you and the movie, its conventional approach and treatment of the story becomes clear. I liked ""The Hurricane"" for its handful of truly ingenuine scenes and it's worth while for Denzel Washington, but the film itself is rather mediocre."

I wonder why they just didn't tell the story in a chronological way. Obviously this was meant to speed up the story and to make it more interesting but for me it was just annoying. Some flash-backs (yet occasionally) could have been worth the effort but the contrast was to big in comparison with the second half of the movie that is almost entirely consecutive and chronological.<br/><br/>As I said the Canadians were portrayed as silly almost naive people and so was Lesra. The actor who played him has my sympathy though...<br/><br/>The movies ending was completely predictable and extremely American Disney-esque with the scene in which Rubin's fellow prisoners start to cheer from happiness as its most sad example.<br/><br/>Washington was good, but that doesn't save the movie.

","You know what I find amazing? Denzel Washington has been in the movie business for years and yet Hollywood never seems to give him the same respect that is given to actors like Brad Pitt or Tom Cruise. But when you listen to fellow actors speak about Washington, it is clear that he is regarded as an extremely talented actor and one of the best at his craft which brings me to his latest movie, The Hurricane.<br/><br/>        This is a movie based on the true accounts of Rubin Carter, a professional boxer in the 1960s accused of murdering three people in a bar. The evidence surrounding the case was sketchy at best in the original trial yet in an attempt to satisfy public dissention and with the aid of an ethically challenged detective, a swift sentence was handed down to Carter and an innocent fan that happened to be with him when he was picked up by the police. The story paints the impression that Carter will spend the rest of his life in prison and flashes forward several years before we meet a young boy by the name of Lesra Martin. Living with a group of Canadians in Toronto, the young boy from Brooklyn visits a book market where he buys his first book; one written by Rubin Carter. A correspondence between Carter and Martin ensues not too long afterwards and after befriending the boxer, the boy and the Canadians decide that they are going to help Carter out of prison.<br/><br/>        As with most movies based on facts, not all of it is going to be absolutely accurate. What you will see here is only one perspective and in this case, the perspective of a person wrongfully imprisoned for a crime that he did not commit. As such, you are going to see facts displayed from that perspective which may or may not be objective. Quite often, while I was sitting there, I did have questions as the story glossed over areas that did not related to the main character. For a movie that is primarily dialogue and storytelling, The Hurricane was inconsistent and sometimes incomplete. The director (Norman Jewison) would bring up situations at certain points and not really elaborate on them laterwards leaving the audience hanging on that particular issue. The impression that I got was that Jewison was trying to fit too much into the movie. He essentially tried to cover 25 years worth of facts in 3 hours and what resulted was a movie that was somewhat rushed.<br/><br/>        What saved this movie was the performance of Washington. He took what he was given and did a fabulous job. I found myself riveted whenever he was speaking and couldn't help but gain a new respect (which I already had plenty of) for him. The young man who plays Lesra Martin (Vicellous Reon Shannon) also did an excellent job. The chemistry between Washington and Shannon was very evident and they do manage to tug on some heart strings. The rest of the cast was pretty good but unfortunately due to incomplete storytelling their performances seem to be lacking.<br/><br/>        Overall, if you want to see some brilliant acting from Washington, then definitely see this movie. He has already won a Golden Globe for ""Best Male Actor"" earlier this year for his portrayal of Rubin Carter and I suspect that he will be favored to win for the Oscars. Hopefully Hollywood gives him the respect that he deserves after this performance. As for pure entertainment value, this movie does manage to tell the story but you may feel a bit lacking when you leave but I still do recommend it purely from a human interest perspective."

","First of all....I loved it. Denzel Washington's best film to date and that definitely was not an easy task for him to accomplish. If you recently enjoyed seeing Denzel in the ""Bone Collector"" then you'll love him as the ""Hurricane"". ""The Hurricane"" is based on a true story of Rubin ""The Hurricane"" Carter, a contender for the World's Middleweight Championship in the 1960s. That is until he is arrested and convicted for the murder of three people. From the beginning the audience is led to believe that Carter is wrongly accused and convicted solely on the actions of a corrupt police official and on the rising racial tensions of that time period. Many times movies have taken liberties with a story and presented it in such a fashion to make the audience believe what they are seeing is completely and 100% true and accurate. We went through it with the movie ""JFK"" and ""Nixon"" to name just two stories based upon ""truth"". However, ""The Hurricane"" is different. You watch this film and you can't believe the injustice that you are seeing nor can you imagine that such an injustice could continue for almost 20 years. But it can and it did. Check out any web site on Hurricane Carter and you are amazed with what you will find. This film details the story of a young man living in Canada who picks up a book at a used book sale. The book is written by Rubin Carter and chronicles his life from youth through incarceration. The young man writes Rubin Carter in prison to tell him of the impact that his book has had on his life and in return the youth begins to have an impact upon Carter. From here you are thrown into a web of deceit and corruption as the youth and his legal guardians attempt to free Rubin Carter from prison. Throughout the film, you can't help but imagine that you are watching an A&E biography of the man rather than a movie. The film keeps your interest throughout, but it is not until the final courtroom scene when Rod Steiger playing a Federal Judge hears Rubin's case and has to make a decision. It has been a long time since I have been at a film where the audience breaks out in applause and cheers towards the close of a movie, but ""The Hurricane"" does it to you.

","""The Hurricane"" is the must see movie of 2000! The character development in the movie was fascinating, because when you leave the movie I guarantee you will feel like you've known Ruben Carter your entire life, going through his childhood to his adult life, and the why's and how's of changes he made.  Denzel Washington did the best acting of his career.  There were moments during the movie where I forgot he wasn't actually The Hurricane.  As well as Denzel, the supporting cast did an excellent job, and I enjoyed that they didn't use any high profile actors, while still producing excellent acting.

"Sam_Gray","9","0","2","13 February 2000"," make no mistake, this movie is nothing without Denzel Washington
","Never before have I seen a movie in which the lead actor is so definitely the central reason that the movie is good.  Denzel Washington does a perfect job throughout the film.  I think Roger Ebert said something like ""he explodes onto the screen.""  I'd agree with that.<br/><br/>But, it's a shame that Washington's Rubin Carter is the only round character in the film.  Everyone else, particularly the Canadians, are ridiculously one-dimensional.  I also think the use of Bob Dylan's song about Carter's case is a mistake.  While important to the story, the music itself comes off as upbeat and is jarring in the context of the film (but, then again, it might just be that I can't stand Bob Dylan).<br/><br/>Still, Washington is so good that the film's failings become almost excusable.  If ever there was a year that I would want to see two actors get the Oscar, this is it (I know it won't happen, but I'd like to see Washington and Spacey share the award).  9/10"
"M83731","7","0","2","13 February 2000"," Great film, but...
","This was probably one of the most triumphant and emotional films I have seen for a long time. The story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter took us through all his troubles from boyhood to his manhood, to when he was finally released. It's a crowd pleaser at its best, criticizing the prejudice and injustice in the society because of difference of a person's color. One criticism I'd like to make is the focal point. Throughout the film, the point of view shifts from Lesra, Hurricane, and the Canadians. The film starts us off with the arrest of Hurricane, and then it goes to view of Lesra, or Hurricane's view through Lesra when he is reading Hurricane's book. Even with the shifts in point of views in the first half, the film holds on. But in the second half, it almost seems like a detective story when the Canadians investigate the case of Hurricane. During the sequence, the film is shot almost like a mystery-suspense story which does not exactly fit in with the first half of the film. Also, Lesra is not shown during the investigation sequence. He is not shown until the last moments of the film, which seems very akward. It was almost as if Lesra was put in in the last minutes of the film to force emotion out of the audience. But other than the point I just made this was overall a great film. It could have been better, though, if some picky little things were fixed. But the problem with the focal point wasn't that big of an issue. But anyway, awesome acting, direction, great cinematography(Roger Deakins! Yeah!!), just overall a great film.  ***1/2 out of ****."

","The story of boxer Rubin `Hurricane' Carter is a fascinating and controversial one, and it has been brilliantly brought to life in Norman Jewison's film `The Hurricane.'  Denzel Washington, in a terrific performance, portrays the New Jersey boxer who was twice wrongly convicted for murder, and finally released in 1985.   <br/><br/>The movie tells Carter's story, from the rough streets of Paterson, New Jersey, his days as a champion prizefighter, and the prison where he spent so many years.  Washington, always a great actor, gives a performance that is full of the power and emotion that is Mr. Carter.  The rest of the cast is also very good, especially the great character actor Dan Hedaya as the Javert-like detective obsessed with putting Carter away.  Which leads to an important point: As has been reported, there is much in this film that is true, and there are characters and storyline that are not.  One example is Hedaya's character, who is supposedly meant to be representative of the many corrupt police and prosecutorial officials involved in this case.  Even with this controversy, however, The Hurricane is both beautifully directed and acted."

Washington plays Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter.  A champion boxer who was framed for murder in the 50's, by a racist, corrupt police force.  A young black boy (played with passion by newcomer Vicellous Reon Shannon) reads his book, and decides that Carter shouldn't be in prison, because he is innocent.  The boys mentors, a group of Canadians, joins him and makes Carter's freedom their life's work, leading up to his eventual freedom in 1988.

In this brilliant film, which in my opinion is the best this year, Denzel gives the most beautiful performance of his career yet. It's simply superb. <br/><br/>To be honest, I hadn't heard of Hurricane before Denzel got a well-deserved best actor award at Golden Globe. The award made me curious and I rented it last night and boy, what an experience that was! I just couldn't take my eyes of the screen for a fraction of a second. I knew I was watching a masterpiece, five minutes into it. It had been a long time since I have seen a movie that has touched my heart in the way Hurricane did. It made me realize just how much pain Rubin Carter, or any wrongly accused person for that matter, would have felt. And still, I fully believe in what Denzel says to Deborah Unger `You just can't understand how I feel cause you've never been in the prison'<br/><br/>The movie is filled with scenes that would melt your heart and bring tears to your eyes. The one I found truly exceptional was the one when a convict Hemmings' mother comes to see him in prison and is told that his son is in lock up so she can't see him. The look on that lady's face would stay in my mind for a long time. Full marks to Norman Jewison.<br/><br/>The supporting cast has performed really well but the star of the show is definitely Washington. If he doesn't get an Oscar for this one the case wouldn't be much different than that of the fight that Hurricane lost because of judges' biased decision. And the only thing then we might say won't be much different from what the commentator said on that match, i.e. `the judges must have been watching some other fight.'"

","I admit shying away from this film at first because the standard ""wrongful imprisonment"" motif can be depressing.  But here is a film that tells an honest story without falling back on the usual cliches.  No shower rape scenes, no racist beatings in the kitchen, none of that.  Rather, we are treated to a non-linear narrative following both the life of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and the life of Lezra, the African-American boy who persuaded his White Canadian tutors to take up the Hurricane's cause.  At a time where silly filmgoers seem to hunger for stories told in a unique, non-linear fashion (witness the popularity of ""Pulp Fiction"" years ago), one should rush to ""The Hurricane"" and see the non-linear narrative structure put to good effect.<br/><br/>Perhaps the best reason to see this film is Denzel Washington.  Here, Denzel puts in one of his most powerful performances in years, capturing the subtleties of change Rubin Carter undergoes in his quest for justice, then survival, and finally transcendence.  As a writer, I found his speech on the power of written word to be the most moving film monologue I've heard in years.<br/><br/>White audiences, by the way, should not shy away from this film because of its Black protagonist and racial issues.  This is an indictment of racism as a concept, and even the Hurricane finds his eyes opened a bit (for years, he holds a hatred of whites that he must eventually cast off to allow the love of his white friends).<br/><br/>I can think of no other way to say this.

","There are few actors that can do what Denzel does.  That is, actually become the character that he plays.  It doesn't matter if it is a fictional character or if it is a real character.  From guys like Walter Hubbard and his character in The Bone Collector to Malcolm X and now Rubin Hurruicane Carter, Denzel Washington has something that only the greats have, and that is charisma.  I honestly can't think of a better actor in the business today and I mean that with all due respect to people like DeNiro and Pacino.  But before this film I didn't know anything about Rubin Hurricane Carter or the people that helped him out.  Now, thanks to this incredible film by Norman Jewison and because of Denzel Washington, I feel like I know the man and feel for what he went through.  <br/><br/>There are so few films that I let get inside of me.  I mean where they can manipulate your emotions to the point where you feel like you just ran a marathon upon leaving the theater.  That is how I felt.  I was emotionally drained after seeing this film.  The Hurricane is not an easy film to watch. It will send you through the wringer and it will make you want to cry in many areas.  This is the story of a man that has spent almost all of his life behind bars because of racism and because of hate.  It is stories like this that show you how sick and twisted our world is. <br/><br/>
Mississippi Burning was a film with racism as it's main theme.  It showed how rampant and authoritative it was back it the 60's.  It was directed by an Englishman ( Alan Parker ) as The Hurricane was directed by a Canadian. Two bleak times in American history and their stories were told by foreign directors.  Maybe it easier for foreigners to see what it wrong with the U.S. in some ways.  <br/><br/>This is an incredible story of injustice, love, hate, persistency and the true spirit of five people.  Rubin Hurricane Carter, Lesra, the young man that gave Rubin hope and the three Canadians that diligently fought for his innocence.  It is a film that moved me almost unlike any film has before. When Rubin was granted his freedom, I wanted to hug the person next to me. I was so happy for him and I felt like I was watching the real trial.  The film became real to me.  And that is something that as I said before, not many films have done to me.  And I do want to thank Norman Jewison for making this incredible film.  After seeing this movie you can be sure I am going to go back and watch other films of his that I have not seen before. He is a great director and although I have said in many reviews this year that American Beauty is the best film of the year, for the first time since seeing that mind blowing film, I can now finally say that if The Hurricane beats it out as best picture, I would not be disappointed.  It is that powerful of a film.  <br/><br/>If you have been deterred from seeing this film because you have heard people say that it drags or it is a little slow in parts, please don't listen to them.  This film is about two and a half hours long because it has a lot to say.  And it never drags at all.  This is a powerful movie and the length should never keep you from a good film.  This, believe me, is a great film and it is one that should be seen.<br/><br/>10 out of 10---  A True Masterpiece"

It's like one day they just woke up and decided that he was innocent, and they were willing to relocate to prove it.  Where is the backbone for this story line? We should have seen the Canadians feel more before they just picked up and move to the US.  More court scenes wouldn't have hurt.  Why couldn't the audience see the appeals denied time and time again.  If it wasn't for Denzel being such a great actor we probably would have never been disgusted about what was happening to Hurricane Carter.  When we all when we walked in the movie that Hurricane was going to be sent to prison for murders he didn't commit, and then after serving 30yrs in prison he was going to be set free, it was in between the events that was going to make this movie powerful or not, and in that sense it really didn't explode.  They could have done much better filling in the blanks than the did.

"JimPills","Null","0","1","22 January 2000"," Good, but no classic
","In some ways, the story of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter would seem tailor-made for motion pictures.  The story of Carter, a champion middleweight boxer who was sentenced to life in prison on a bogus murder rap and who was set free after 19 years through the efforts of his lawyers and a group of courageous Canadian do-gooders, is a tale of triumph over a corrupt system, and the power of hope.  Still, it requires the hero to be a relatively passive figure in the deciding of his fate, trapped as he is behind bars.  ""The Hurricane"", Norman Jewison's dramatization of Carter's story, encounters both this story's virtues and its flaws, and ends up with a story that's quite a mixed dramatic bag.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays Carter with his customary intensity and control, and undergoes an impressive transformation from hard-souled fighting machine to soft-spoken, eloquent defender of justice.  It's really an impressive performance, and Washington benefits from being at the center of many of the film's best-written scenes, including a terrific sequence where Carter hallucinates conversations with himself while trapped in solitary, and a great moment where he gets an unexpected present from his Canadian benefactors.<br/><br/>These Canadians cause other problems, however.  Though there was a real group like this involved in the freeing of the Hurricane, the film puts almost the whole operation into their hands, thus making Carter feel like he is passively handing his fate over to them.  Also, these three white Canadians sometimes play like satires of do-gooding white liberals.  They have taken in an underprivileged black youth who they see potential in (and who I guess they assume would not be able to realize that potential without their help), and after he brings Carter's case to their attention, they shoulder the burden of securing his freedom.  It's another film, like the inferior ""Ghosts of Mississippi"" and the superior ""Amistad"", in which the black man is only able to achieve his deliverance through the action of white hands.<br/><br/>The American system is a corrupt one, yes, and has perhaps more often worked against blacks than for them.  However, the necessities of dramatic condensation has caused ""The Hurricane"" to channel its criticisms of the system into one man, the fictional cop Della Pesca, played as a one-dimensional bigoted thug by Dan Hedaya.  Those unfamiliar with the facts of this story will come away believing that the case of ""Hurricane"" Carter was not a story of a miscarriage of justice, but of what one white man's hatred did to an innocent black man's life.  <br/><br/>Still, even with these criticisms, there is much to admire in this film. The acting is fairly consistent and strong throughout the film (though Washington pretty much acts everyone else off the screen), and Jewison's direction is classy and well-modulated.  The film's soundtrack is also nicely handled, with Christopher Young's moodily effective score intercut with classic tunes, including Bob Dylan's exhilarating ode to Carter. Besides, it IS a pretty fascinating story, and thanks to Washington and Jewison, enough of that comes across to make ""The Hurricane"" an interesting and uplifting experience.  You do leave the film with the satisfaction that justice has at long last been done.  Hopefully, you'll also leave with a desire to go out and get the real facts of the story."
"H5O","Null","0","1","20 January 2000"," An ode to Racism and Institutional Discrimination
","The film depicts the life of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, a framed athlete that is serving a life sentence.  Throughout the film, racism and institutional discrimination play a key role, especially with a racist cop (Dan Hedaya), and the turbulent 60s, during the peak of the Civil Rights Movement. <br/><br/>
Norman Jewison might be an outstanding director, since he directed a couple of films that depicted racism, like In the Heat of the Night (1967), and A Soldier's Story (1985).  After watching this film, seeing Rubin Carter in prison might be analogous to the life of Nelson Mandela, where a miscarriage of justice still exists.  Like The Green Mile (1999), where Michael Clarke Duncan is a death row inmate, Denzel Washington is a lifer, who has nothing to lose.  <br/><br/>Anyone who is familiar with the Alabama railroad boys case would enjoy this film."

","My summary almost says it all... This was one of the best movies I have seen in years. Since the whole incident happened before I was born, I realize that those who lived during the time Carter did will not be as impressed, but I was. As to specifics, I think Denzel Washington's performance was incredibly well-done! He almost makes the viewer believe that he is Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter and not Denzel Washington. IMHO, the Academy is insane not to choose Denzel for the Best Actor Oscar. I also thought the actor who played Lesra Martin (the actor's name escapes me at the moment) did a nice job. If this was his first movie (which I doubt...), then I believe we can look forward to some exquisite performances by this gentleman. The movie also had some great lines, including this exchange between Lesra and Hurricane. Lesra:""Not all white people are racists."" Carter: ""And not all black people are murderers."" The best quote of the movie -by far- was this one. Unfortunately, I don't remember who said it: ""We don't always choose the books we read. Sometimes they choose us.""

","OK, first allow me to echo the continued praise of Denzel Washington. Great performance as Hurricane Carter...intense, focused, can't take your eyes off him. A sure Oscar nomination. Unfortunately, there's not much to rave about here aside from Denzel. Every other actor, with the possible exception of Lezra, seems somewhat lost, as if they wandered into the wrong movie.     Particularly, the strange trio of Canadians ""determined"" to free Carter, who blandly wander through the movie in search of a purpose. Although their amateur detective work (performed with all the passion of someone calling for dinner reservations) leads to Carter's release, you keep hoping they'll pack up and return to Canada. And why does that one guy sound British? Dan Hedaya, portraying the racist cop with a vendetta against Carter, delivers the most banal dialogue in recent memory. Considering he imprisons an innocent man for 20 years, this role deserves more than stereotypical ""bad guy"" talk. His role is too one-dimensional to inspire any significant hate or fear; he seems more like a pesky roach you want to crush beneath the heel of your shoe.     The film also failed to take good advantage of Bob Dylan's fantastic song ""Hurricane."" Sure, it crops up here and there during the story, but at fairly arbitrary and anticlimactic moments.     Don't get me wrong, ""The Hurricane"" packs quite a punch (no pun intended), and nobody should miss Denzel's performance. But it's a very good movie that, like Carter, missed its chance at greatness."

","I actually was not familiar with the story of the Hurricane.  I hadn't heard the story at all.  I don't remember it being talked about at all.  I was of an age that I would have remembered it when he was finally released.<br/><br/>As is my usual custom, I try not to consume any information relating to a movie before I get out to see it.  I don't want my thoughts prejudiced by someone else's opinions.<br/><br/>I saw it opening night and I was impressed.  Denzel has been better, but that is not to say he was bad at all in this.  Actually, he's not required to do too much except look like a boxer and resemble Rubin Carter.  He does both well.  he doesn't need the character ability that he showed in Glory, nor does he need the screen presence he showed in Crimson Tide.<br/><br/>Knowing this movie was based on a true story, I felt compelled to find out what I could about what really happened so I could say how it was portrayed in the film.  If the facts aren't important then there's no need to tell me that it's based on a true story.  <br/><br/>After doing that research, I think I am a little disappointed in the film's accuracy.  While I don't have a problem with them consolidating the forces that helped convict Carter into the character of Detective Vincent Della Pesca for theatrical purposes, I don't like how the truth of his innocence being discovered was portrayed.<br/><br/>First, the two men that testified they saw Carter seen leaving the bar that night after the shootings later recanted their statements saying the police paid them and gave them sweetheart deals (they were criminals) in exchange for that testimony.  This isn't even mentioned in the film and I think would have been much more dramatic and realistic than the alternative that was portrayed.  I won't mention it because I'm no spoiler. <br/><br/>
Also, the film seems to imply that the case against Carter was unraveled by Lesra and his guardians alone and that the defense lawyers were kind of incompetent.  That simply wasn't the case.  I don't know if what is depicted played better or what, but without the testimony of the witnesses being recanted Mr. Carter might still be in jail.<br/><br/>In general the film is very well done and all give good performances.  Aside from straying from the facts, this is recommended viewing."

","Key Words:  Powerful / Poignant / Thought provoking / Plodding<br/><br/>Denzel gives us yet another believable and powerful performance throughout a story that is otherwise slow and plods along.  He and the writers clean up the image of the real ""Hurricane"" who was not nearly so lovable.  Not withstanding, this is a strong moral tale about how ""justice"" can be so easily be mis-used and made to serve the greed and hate of those sworn to uphold it.<br/><br/>Everyone missed one point that could have been made by this story - if Hurricane had been put to death rather than in prison for life, there never could or would have been the chance to release an innocent man years later. Think about it.  How many others have been railroaded into prison for things they did not do?  How many innocents have been put to death before another trial could have shown they were innocent?  It is scary to think about....<br/><br/>See this one for the strong performance by Denzel.  And rejoice when justice, though long delayed, is finally his- and ours (although there is no indication that the ones who framed him ever suffered for their deeds, except if they had to watch themselves portrayed in this film).  And wonder why Hurricane (actually the writers) never worry about getting justice for the poor innocent boy who also went to jail just for being in the same car with Hurricane and never gave in to the pressure to say that Hurricane did the crime just to save himself.  Hurricane says the boy is ""my hero"", but that is the last we hear about him.  If there was such an interest in final justice, a few words could have been left in to show they cared about getting that poor guy out also....."

"Joe Moretti","Null","0","1","16 January 2000"," A Powerhouse Performance in the Powerful Hurricane
","Having seen approximately 90% of the quality films of 1999, three performances by a lead actor stick in my mind, Kevin Spacey (American Beauty), Russell Crowe (The Insider) and now Denzel Washington as Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, the boxer who was immortalized in one of Bob Dylan's best songs ""The Hurricane"".  Of those three wonderful performances, I give the nod to the hugely talented and charismatic actor, Washington, who gives a stunning and towering performance as the boxer who was falsely imprisoned for 20 years for the killing of three white people in a New Jersey bar in 1966.  This is an Oscar worthy performance of the highest caliber in a powerful film that focuses on racism, political corruption and sheer determination of the human spirit. <br/><br/>Norman Jewison has done a fabulous job of chronicling the tragic life of the great boxer nicknamed ""The Hurricane"".  After being falsely convicted due to a corrupt and racist detective (Dan Hedaya), Carter (Denzel Washington) is sent to prison where he spent 20 years for a crime that he did not commit. Many people, including celebrities such as Ellen Burstyn and Bob Dylan came to his aid, but to no avail.  It was not until a young boy (Vicellous Reon Shannon), who became captivated by his story and a trio of Canadian activists that started the ball rolling in full gear that eventually led to his release from prison.  While the film is expertly directed with some great black and white fight scenes and the handling of the back and forth time frame, the film does not dig deep enough to explore the issue of racial injustice within the judiciary system during the 60's.  It basically uses the racist detective (who is the motivating factor) as the only one involved in this tragic display of injustice.  Also the Canadian trio (Hannah, Unger, Schreiber) are a little too righteous and squeaking clean and made out to look like they were the only ones who brought this whole travesty to justice.  Regardless, you cannot take away the power of this film or the performance of Washington.<br/><br/>Young Shannon as the black youth Lesra who strikes a bond with Carter does a nice job, the great character actor Hedaya as the racist detective is purely despicable and Rod Steiger who appears briefly as a judge makes up for his appearance in the awful ""End of Days"". But this picture belongs entirely to Denzel Washington.  Washington who has played larger than life characters before as Malcolm X in Spike Lee's 1992 film and South African martyr Steven Biko in ""Cry Freedom"" gives the performance of his career that should garner him an Oscar.  This is a very powerful performance of a man who held onto his dignity throughout his entire ordeal and never let the system beat him down, it is truly inspiring.  Washington is strong, moving and explosive throughout; it is this year's best performance in an outstanding year of acting.  This is a case of the role and actor coming together for a flawless fit that just ignites the screen. <br/><br/>At 45 years of age, Washington who worked out to fine tune his physical appearance has a body that would put a twenty-something to shame. Washington is one of our top actors today who for the most part gives great performances, but his turn as ""The Hurricane"" will literally blow you away. Like fellow actor George Clooney, Denzel Washington's career started as a doctor in the brilliant hospital TV series St. Elsewhere in the 80's.  Check out one of this year's best pictures that display an actor at the height of his career. Highly Recommend. × × × × out of 5"

","'The Hurricane' is the most recent cinema release by Norman<br/><br/>Jewison ('Cincinnati Kid', 'In The Heat of The Night', 'Thomas Crown<br/><br/>Affair ' (1968), 'Rollerball' etc) whose 70-odd years don't show in<br/><br/>this engrossing and well done true story of racism, wrongful<br/><br/>imprisonment and the human spirit. In one of his better roles,<br/><br/>Denzel Washington plays the framed boxer Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter<br/><br/>and his struggle for a successful appeal after 30 years in prison.<br/><br/>There's something of the anger that Washington communicated in<br/><br/>'Malcom X', as the understandably bitter Carter traces his woes<br/><br/>back to a colour-prejudiced system in general and a racist cop in<br/><br/>general.<br/><br/>However Jewison's liberal credentials lead to a slight wooliness in<br/><br/>the background of the film where greater realism would have been<br/><br/>more effective. For instance Carter's stay in prison is notable for the lack of any violence, intimidation and menace (excepting his one stay in<br/><br/>'the hole' upon arrival.) He is allowed to keep his clothes distinct, to write books, to avoid prison fatigues and keep to his cell or watch<br/><br/>TV. Such slightly unbelievable events contrast with the more<br/><br/>sentimental and successful 'Shawshank Redemption', where one<br/><br/>feels the hero has something to rebel against, besides mere<br/><br/>containment. (In a revealing casting decision, Clancy Brown, the<br/><br/>sadistic Captain Byron Hadley in the earlier film, here plays an<br/><br/>accommodating and non-threatening prison guard). The effect is to<br/><br/>reduce Carter's imprisonment to something less than the inhumane<br/><br/>experience he claims it is. <br/><br/>Similarly the three Canadians who take up Carter's case have little<br/><br/>to do (although they are supposedly instrumental in helping<br/><br/>Carter's final appeal in the Federal court) except make house call,<br/><br/>thumb through paperwork and look concerned. The script fails to<br/><br/>make them interesting or give them any real dynamic, while their<br/><br/>relationship to each other is entirely unexplored. The romantic<br/><br/>attraction of one of them to Carter is hinted at and then left<br/><br/>undeveloped. Vicellous Reon Shannon, playing the young black<br/><br/>student won over by Carter's book and who first takes up his<br/><br/>cause, is also rather too good to be true - occasionally coming<br/><br/>across as chubby and gauche, rather than shocked then converted<br/><br/>to the boxer's plight.<br/><br/>In short this is a film which, despite the anger which must exist in<br/><br/>the original source (Carter's prison book) has led some of it slip<br/><br/>away except for Washington's intense and charismatic performance. This is a shame as the film is well done, with an<br/><br/>interesting structure. The case was sufficiently unknown to me to<br/><br/>make the result of the climactic court case suspenseful. The first<br/><br/>third in particular creates tension by juxtaposing past and present<br/><br/>events, establishing a true sense of time and place. Washington's<br/><br/>fans will want to see this, and if it proves Jewison's last hurrah on<br/><br/>the big screen (he's done a TV movie since) it is entirely creditable"

"hollywood2k2","10","0","1","14 January 2000"," Great movie; Oscar worthy
","If this movie doesn't win Best Picture and Denzel Washington doesn't win Best Actor then I'm giving up on the Academy all together. This was quite possibly the best movie of the year (with ""Dogma"" a close second but that's a biased remark). This movie had it all, great characters, a moving story, and superb acting. What is even more amazing and moving is that this is a true story about a real man. It's sad that something like this happened in the home of the ""free"" but in the end justice prevailed albeit tardy.<br/><br/>
This was also Denzel's best work since ""Glory"", which won him an Oscar. But then again it followed a lack laster ""Bone Collector"" but I like his work. Washington is probably one of Hollywood's best actors despite sometimes being type casted as the angry black man but no one does it better. All I have to say Tom Hanks better not get the nod over Denzel for ""The Green Mile"" because Hanks wasn't great and he's highly overrated but then again I'm still bitter because he beat out John Travolta (in ""Pulp Fiction"") for best actor for ""Forrest Gump"". All I hope for is the end of Hollywood's fascination for Hanks while there are better actors out there today.<br/><br/>I think the Best Picture award will be between this movie and ""The Green Mile"" because they have similar stories (a black man imprisoned for a crime he didn't commit and those who support them) but ""The Hurricane"" was believable and it should be since it's a true story while ""The Green Mile"" was nothing more than Stephan King fantasy with touching undertones.

"thehumanduvet","7","0","2","20 February 2001"," Rather lengthy, sentimental 'true story' picture, but quite
","The legend of Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter is told here at considerable length and with many of the standard Hollywood touches of slush, but gets across a pretty powerful message about injustice and a righteous man's capacity for great nobility in the worst possible circumstances. The warning that an ostensibly 'true' story has been 'slightly fictionalised for dramatic purposes' (or words to that effect) should be enough to put the informed viewer on his guard, however, and for me at least takes a lot away from the strength of the subject matter - if you can't trust all of what you are being shown, a shadow of doubt is thrown across the entire piece. If you can ignore this problem and just go along with the story it makes for quite a good movie, but unfortunately, with this doubt in mind throughout, much of it seems just a little too simplistic and 'Hollywood' to ring true. This is sad, as perhaps the viewer disregards much of what is honest and accurate, but until some kind of standard of true-ishness is set, all major movies claiming to depict true lives and incidents must be tarred with the same propagandist brush that mars some really great films - Braveheart etc - which lose a lot in becoming mere stories and not the recreations of history they at first appear.<br/><br/>Taken as a story though, this is a good one, and Washington turns in yet another powerhouse performance ranking alongside his best. The supporting cast is admirable, although perhaps accent experts may spot a few flaws in John Hannah's attempt at Canadian, and Dan Hedaya provides another wonderful, if rather comic-book, villain. Nice to see Clancy Brown playing a fairly good guy for a change too. The movie does tend to drag a little towards the end, especially if viewed on a rather sleepy Sunday afternoon, but until the final fifth or so it is well paced and well structured, and looks at the racial themes at the heart of the case with an unusually delicate touch, contrasting strongly with Hollywood's typically clumsy, heavy-handed treatment of such matters. An interesting film, but those truly interested will need to find some serious information on the subject to find out how balanced this movie really is."

","Norman Jewison's name on a film is a hallmark of quality. That certainly is true here. A brilliantly conceived and creatively produced film that handles immensely emotional material without sinking into bathos. Denzel Washington was the perfect choice to play Reuben Carter. The black and white ring flashbacks, evocative of the old newsreels, are immensely effective. Jewison has tampered with the facts, mainly by omission. But a great director is entitled to a bit of cinematic licence. And how nice for once to see Toronto represented as Toronto instead of as a stand in for some US city.

I was held by Denzel Washington's riveting superstar thing. He's just got it. What can I say? I was rewarded. The film evolved into one of the best mind benders I have seen about race relations. I like that a lot. There were no bad groups or good groups by the end of the film. Just very real individual people, responsible and irresponsible, lovable and hateful, hopeful and defeated. I really enjoyed Liev Schreiber in this film. Also, isn't Rod Steiger always a welcomed player?

","What made me look out for this movie was the song by the same name by Bob Dylan. I missed this movie in the theatre, because I took it as a movie about some black boxer. But when I heard the song, it instantly caught upon me, and I kept playing the song again and again till it was inside me, a part of me. I did some research on Rubin Carter on the net, and it was then I discovered about the movie. I rented it the same day. Making a movie on a real life story is undoubtedly walking on a tight rope. A fine balance has to be maintained between reality and drama. You run the risk of making the film too raw documentary style and dull, or too dramatic and not very true the real story. In my opinion the best director to dance such a tango is Oliver Stone. His movies run like documentaries with fact flashes, but at the same time you are involved in the drama acted out on the screen. In this movie, Norman Jewison succeeds to some extent in building the drama in the beginning, but as the film progresses it starts fizzling out. As Rubin comes into contact with his Canadian friends the story slows down. The canadians as it has been pointed out by somebody aren't convincing in the filme at all. I found the young canadian friend particularly irritating. I didn't like the way Rubin's life is been shown through the reading of this boy. It looks mushy. The way all the 4 canadians are shown to be together all the time, like a happy lil family is so synthetic. No motivation, no justification has been established for the canadians to come to Carter's rescue. Towards the end, the movie does get a lil better. Specially the courtroom scene does bring back some drama and tension, but too late. All in all the film lacks the punch, the sarcasm, and the poignancy Bob Dylan's 'Hurricane' has. Only Denzel Washington gets a chance to act, and he does an OK job."

","Okay, here we go again.  This film is a solid film.  But it is not really that great.  Don't get me wrong, it does have a few good things about it. But first things first.  This film is yet another example of a film that fails to realize that there can be more than one strong performance in a film.  The films casting agents had the good idea of casting David Paymer, Harris Yulin, Liev Schreiber, Deborah Unger, and John Hannah in supporting roles.  The problem is that they were giving little, if anything, to do. Mr. Paymer, who proves his worth time and again in films, is reduced down to some mugging and about two lines of dialougue.  Mr. Yulin gets even less as his co-counsel.  Mr. Hannah's character is not defined at all, and he too is not given anything to do other than to fill up the screen.  Ms. Unger is given one scene of affection with Mr. Washington, but the scene is awkward and one is left feeling that there was something between her character and The Hurricane that the film makers chose to leave out (some sort of romance or something along those lines).  Mr. Schreiber is given 'stuff' to do, but it seems that this 'stuff' is in the film only to boost the film's running time.  The worst offense comes with Mr. Hedaya.  Here is a true actors actor that proves that he can chew scenery with the best of 'em (if you don't believe me, check out the much over looked and recent video release DICK). Mr. Hedaya plays the heavy, but his legs are cut from under him in the middle of the movie, for no reason, and he really looks like he pained over this for the rest of the film.  The film does not even give him the comeuppance that his character, and the audience, deserves.  The other real problem with the film is that a lot of critics have come out saying not only that the film is more fiction than fact, and that the true story would have made a more compelling film.  <br/><br/>Now for the good stuff.  Mr. Washington's performance is a hurricane indeed. He is sheer pleasure to watch as he goes through a transformation similar to what he did in Spike Lee's MALCOLM X and in Edward Zwick's GLORY.  The many faces of pride that he manages to show us is reason enough to see the film, and he deserves every accolade that he gets for this performance (only Russell Crowe's performance as Jim Wigand in THE INSIDER stands a chance to beat him this year).  The real reason to pay to see the movie is to see what Mr. Washington and Mr. Jewison concoct in their second collaboration (first cam A SOLDIER'S STORY) inside the boxing ring.  <br/><br/>In the boxing ring, the film is poetry in motion.  Not since Martin Scorsese and Robert DeNiro decided to make motion picture history in RAGING BULL has boxing looked so poetic on film.  And that is quite the compliment considering ROCKY, THE BOXER, and FIGHT CLUB are all in the same broad genre.  <br/><br/>Unfortunately, the boxing sequences far outshine the rest of the film, crippled as mentioned above.  Where ROCKY, THE BOXER, FIGHT CLUB, and RAGING BULL managed to keep everything looking just as good, this film does not.

Then, the second half of the film brought new characters without any development at all. The three teachers who helped proved Rubin Carter innocent didn't seem to have any motivation or passion at all.  They were very flat characters. And, it seemed that they found all this new evidence without really trying.  Even the threats seemed empty. Finally, the ending was unclear.   The federal judge freed Rubin Carter with an ambiguous explanation.  The explanation may work for lawyers, but as a layman I did not understand it at all.  It all seemed too easy. In essence, even though Denzel Washington did a good job, the screenplay was weak and therefore the film itself was disappointing."

I will not deny people of their right to think what they want, and have their opinion, but what some people write is somewhat beyond me, thus why I need to say my piece. I find that yet again some judge this movie as if it is a work of art, in a gallery on display and awaiting our criticism. No I don't think this is correct, perhaps the actors and creators made this film to inform us of this great injustice, as a way of their release of emotion, and our gain. <br/><br/>Can we please just let ourselves go and be taken in by this film. Forget where you are and be enveloped by a remarkable story that should inspire you to the core. This was packed to the brim with power and emotion, and if you missed it, then maybe you weren't watching the movie correctly, the way a movie should be watched, for our benefit. Was Denzel Washington's performance as good as it was said to be? The answer is it was better, and you can say otherwise, but he got through to me. Could you not see his own passion? One of the great performances of our time. I felt his emotion, and if he could do that, if only for a few, then he has gone beyond his job. A remarkable acting performance that should be congratulated, and i am satisfied that I recognised it.<br/><br/>This is an inspiration tale, and yes it is like The Shawshank Redemption and In the Name of the Father, but what does that matter? Is this is a true tale?  Well yes it is and it needed be told. It cannot be a cliche for it exists and cannot be denied. No matter how many times the story be told and in how many different ways, it is not boring but insightful and I will continue to be impacted by it. It is a brilliant tale that inspired me and puts me on track. What a great man, what an honour it would be to meet him. What honour I could feel as the boy met his idol in this film, not just his idol but his role model and perhaps one for us all in a way. A representative of trust and strength and love.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend this film with the advise that you not look to criticise it but relax and enjoy it, and you may just feel something amazing, true inspiration.  For this is a true story, and a powerful one at that. I loved this film and I have benefitted from seeing it. It has so many lessons, and even though, from what I read in other comments, some choose to ignore they even exist and concentrate on what is not as important, I have learned some, and I am happy that I and others can let myself go, and be taken by this movie, and feel some emotion.

Another IMDB commenter mentioned that Denzel does not just act, he BECOMES the character.  And watching this story, I wanted to know what happened to Ruben Carter, I wanted to watch this character grow and change, I wanted to see if justice would be done for Ruben, because I believed that Denzel WAS Ruben, and I was really watching him go through his life.  Now, the young man that plays Lezra, the boy who takes an interest in his case after reading Ruben's autobiography, is very real and natural.  And their scenes together are very moving.  And many other fine actors do well in this film, particularly the actress who plays the one of the three Canadians who help Ruben -- but this is Denzel's movie.

"dfranzen70","9","0","2","1 August 2000"," Hurricane a perfect knockout
","Denzel Washington plays Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter, a welterweight boxer who was wrongly imprisoned for murder. Rubin's learned his life lessons at the proverbial school of hard knocks, mostly at the hands of racist police officers in his home town of Paterson, New Jersey. But, being the tough I-can-take-on-the-world kind of guy he is, he fights his way through the hatred and perseveres to become welterweight champ. And all is going well until one night when Carter is arrested and charged with the murders of four innocent people. With a checkered past that includes problems with white authorities, Carter is convicted and sentenced to imprisonment.<br/><br/>
Carter tries to appeal his case, but to no avail. Many people rally to his defense, including celebrities. Nothing. Sixteen years later, Hurricane is still in stir. Three Canadians decide to pick up his case:  Terry Swinton, Lisa Peters, and Sam Chaiton, who vow to free Carter.<br/><br/>On the surface, you might dismiss this as another put-upon-man-fights-back-against-all-and-triumphs-over-bad-due-to-the-strength-of-his-heart kind of movie. And the fact that this is a true story would tend to make you think, ""Oh, well of course he triumphs, otherwise they wouldn't be making a movie out of it!"" But let me warn you here: Please don't make such sweeping assumptions about this masterpiece.<br/><br/>There are times, during the early part of this movie, during the childhood years and early adulthood years of Carter, that one gets a sense that they've seen this before. Those times are slowly erased when  the film turns from being a standard biopic to being a taut, tender courtroom drama. And if you think there's no such beast as a ""tender"" courtroom drama, then friends you have not seen this movie.<br/><br/>This is a powerful film. It first lulls you with that sense of sameness from the early Carter days then smacks you upside the head with an ending that, while predictable (it IS a true story, of course) is so emotionally charged and magnificently acted that there is simply no way you can walk away from it without feeling something. There's a lot to be said for a movie that can do all that despite being so factual and almost antiseptic. Sure, anytime the good guys win you're more apt to have a tear running down your face, but this movie seems to transcend all of that. <br/><br/>Washington himself turns in perhaps the best performance of his entire career, and considering the accolades this man has generated in his nearly 20-year career, that's no small feat. Even with a murmur, Washington can essay such passion to raise the eyes of even the most downtrodden lost soul. He is the magnet in this film, the movie's draw, but he's not the only one performing so well. Each of the Canadians who fight for him are a real treat to watch, especially the talented Deborah Unger as Lisa Peters. Add to all of this the superb, experienced direction of Norman Jewison, and my friends, you have yourselves a masterpiece."

","I agree with all the intelligent people who saw The Hurricane as a movie about the human spirit and courage. I just wanted to point out to a previous reviewer that the young black boy, Lesra, who reached out to Carter did exist. One would know this: a) if he/she didn't criticize immediately without finding out facts, and b) common sense (how would Carter's story have been told if the book he wrote wasn't picked up...the word 'duh' comes to mind) This movie is different from Raging Bull, not stealing from it, because it is an intense drama depicting the life of a black boxer wrongly accused of murder. It is a story in its own category which should have gotten more publicity and push for the academies, but American Beauty was pushed (AB had Oscar talk waaay before it even hit the theaters, kinda fishy, isn't it?)<br/><br/>The cop may not have existed but there have been facts that show there were more than one involved in the plot of destruction against Carter. The cop was named ""overvillified."" Believe it or not there are people like that in this world, and even more worse than he was portrayed (watch Rosewood another true story.) I notice a few who are saying some things are ""too good to be true"" but believe it or not truth is stranger than fiction and alot of times the truth does hurt.<br/><br/>This is a compelling film and a look at how blacks (even celebrities) were treated during the civil rights movement (notice footage from the television and Carter not winning the medal over the white boxer). Its seen through the eyes of Carter himself and although it may be ""bias"" as some people believe, if it was seen through the criminals, would it not be biased as well? After all, the movie is called THE HURRICANE. Not the people who convicted the Hurricane. Although it did leave out some key factors of the trial, it doesn't hurt to pick up the book and read more on it, does it? After all, the length of a film is the length of a short story and a book could definitely not be told in a 2 hour plus movie as it would a mini series.<br/><br/>Overall, The Hurricane is a powerful film that goes into character rather than plot. It is definitely a character driven film so if your looking for the complete historical view that the movie may have missed go check out: Hurricane: The Miraculous Journey of Rubin Carter by James S. Hirsch, Lazarus and the Hurricane : The Freeing of Rubin 'Hurricane' Carter by Sam Chaiton, Terry Swinton  or The 16th Round : From Number 1 Contender by Ruben Carter himself."

Well, after having now seen the film, I am left rather speechless. The Hurricane, though unnominated for Best Picture of 1999, was in all probability just that. The fact that the Academy didn't even deem it worthy of a nomination is pretty telling of the level of injustices that the performances in this film received. Denzel Washington as Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter was beyond stellar. I simply can't recall more moving or compelling acting than what Washington provides here. He was clearly the Best Actor of any film in 1999, and his performance here was probably the best example I've seen in the past 5 years of the Best Actor category. Enough of the injustices at the hands of the Academy. Simply put, The Hurricane is a tremendous film. I didn't once during the 2 hours and 26 minute running time look at my watch, and I was actually moved to tears more than once. This is a powerful movie, a shining example of the terrible injustices that can befall a person due to his ethinc origin during the explosive 60's.

This movie was based on Carter's novel ""The Sixteeninth Round"" and another novel (the name I forget).  Carter is serving a life sentence in a New Jersey prison for the murders that he never committed.  Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya - Shaft) is the bitterly crooked cop that framed and has an obbsession of Carter since the man was a young child.  Despite many appeals for a new trial have failed, Carter's last chance for freedom comes in the form of a young black boy (V. Reon Shannon) and his three Canadian friends (Deborah Kara Unger, John Hannah, and Liev Schrieber).  The trio and Carter search through the information of the murders for key clues.  The events leading up to the hearing are very emotional and powerful.  Christopher Young's musical score adds a key part to that and so does the film's story.  Washington is sensational in his role that earned him a Golden Globe for Best Actor and an Oscar nomination.

Based on a true story, the film is an in-depth character study including Carter's early life, the murders for which he was incarcerated, his coping with prison and his court battles.<br/><br/>Veteran director Norman Jewison creates a tight weave of factors affecting Carter's life; his childhood, the turbulent civil rights movement of the 1960's, and the people who came to his defense.  It is an impressive panoply of the forces that swept over his life like a tidal wave. The period props and costumes were well done and accurate in the 1960's scenes.  I loved the fact that all the fight fans in the arena were wearing suits and ties. Strange as it seems, that's the way it really was in the early 1960's.  The camera work was very good and I particularly liked the use of black and white for the fight scenes.  Unfortunately, Jewison made a few choices that bogged the film down in the middle and detracted somewhat from the story.<br/><br/>The film presents some good historical footage of the civil rights movement, but gets a little too preachy at times.  The character development of Carter and Lesra was good, but the film would have benefited from a little less of Carter's internment angst and more time in character development of the Canadians.  Jewison also presented Detective Della Pesca (Dan Hedaya) as an evil character of superhuman proportions, an inconceivable depiction.<br/><br/>This was a superb performance by Denzel Washington, perhaps his best to date.  His portrayal of the internal struggle to use his seething anger to help him survive was sensational.  He got himself into tremendous shape for the boxing scenes and handled himself well in the ring.<br/><br/>I was also impressed with Vicellous Reon Shannon who played Lesra.  He exuded sincerity, toughness and genuine empathy, and had very good chemistry with Washington.<br/><br/>This strong drama grabs you like a boa and doesn't let up.  I rated it an 8/10.

","Due to a script which tries far too hard to show how ""naughty"" the bad guys are, and how noble the good ones can be, ""The Hurricane"" is a film that never quite lives up to its potential.  These characters are far too one-dimensional to be believable.  The sinister villain of the film, a corrupt law enforcement official played by Dan Hedaya, is so abominable, I kept expecting a couple of horns to pop out of his skull, as he tilted his head back to let out a contemptible laugh.  At the same time, Lesra Martin, and his group of Canadian merry men, are so virtuous, so totally pure, I wondered when woodland creatures would lovingly surround them, causing them to break into song.  The only character in the film who seems to have any genuine moral conflict is Denzel Washington's Rubin ""Hurricane"" Carter. It's a pity the screenwriter (Sam Chaiton) took such a black and white approach with his character depictions, because, without this misstep, ""The Hurricane"" would have had everything going for it. <br/><br/>The cast of The Hurricane is superb.  The directing, by Norman Jewison (""Agnes of God"", ""Moonstruck""), keeps the two hour plus movie moving at a fast pace, and doesn't give us time to get bored.  When it isn't annoying you with its simplistic character depictions, even the screenplay can be remarkably compelling.   <br/><br/>I will recommend this movie, but with far less enthusiasm than I would have, if it had taken the time to make the true story it was based on seem a little more real.

A young black man, Lazurus, or Lesra (Vicellous Reon Shannon) stumbles upon the autobiography of Rubin Hurricane Carter, and with his three Canadian 'home tutors', Lisa (Deborah Kara Unger), Sam (Liev Schreiber) and Terry (John Hannah), decides to fight for Rubin's release from prison. Attempting to constantly foil any attempts at justice is the 'bad' cop, Della Pesca, (Dan Hedaya), who has been hounding Rubin since childhood and seems determined to keep him behind bars.<br/><br/>Denzel Washington does well in the title role and applies himself with his usual commitment to creating a whole and believable character, especially important in such a movie that is based on real events and people. Watch out for the prison scene with Mae, his wife and the scene where he meets Lesra for the first time. This latter especially I found very powerful - it was well shot, the dialogue was tight and their relationship is beautifully established. And not to forget the prison scene with Myron (David Paymer) and Leon (Harris Yulin) his lawyers - this may just snare Denzel the Oscar. His supporting cast also do a fine job -Vicellour Reon Shannon, although a little wooden at first, seems to grow into his role (which I guess fits the character quite well) and Unger, Schreiber and Hannah as the three Canadians do a solid job also. Rod Steiger's cameo as Judge Sarokin is noteworthy as is Mitchell Taylor Jnr's role as young Rubin.<br/><br/>The screenplay itself is possibly a little long. The first hour takes us through flashes of Rubin's early life and concludes with his conviction, intercut with Lesra's growing fascination with the case. We then speed up a little with the ongoing case and a reconstruction of what actually happened the night of the murder - the film culminating with Rubin's final appeal to have the conviction overthrown. However there were many loose ends - what happened to Mae (Debbi Morgan), his wife? Why don't we see much of John Artis (Garland Whitt), his supposed accomplice? I wanted to know where these characters ended up - something one does eventually discover, but until the closing credits.<br/><br/>And yet on the other hand, the movie tries to go into too much detail about other issues and left me feeling that, despite it's feature film quality, it might better have been made as a mini series or two part telemovie, in which case the loose ends could have been tied up and the overall length more appropriate.<br/><br/>Production values are high and there is some especially nice camerawork, most clearly seen in the emotionally charged scenes mentioned above.<br/><br/>Overall, a 'good' movie - quite compelling because it is a true story. It does lose some of its impact because it comes at the tail end of several decades of movies about racial injustice and inequality (which although still an important issue, is not so 'filmic' anymore."

","I was very disappointed in The Hurricane after all of the hype that had been built up for it.  Washington had a dynamite performance, no doubt, but that was not nearly enough to save this movie.  It's been brought to many people's attention that the film is based, at best, only loosely on fact. That stretching of the truth caused the story at times to be very unconvincing. The lack of character development in the movie is my biggest complaint. The Canadians, seemingly out of nowhere, become these outspoken supporters of Carter and drop their careers to aid in his case.  And their background is never really brought to light.  The only insight we get into Lesra's character are the parallels he draws between himself and Carter. Another part of this film that really bothered me was its length.  I'm sorry to say, but even Washington couldn't keep me from looking at my watch. Several of the prison scenes were so drawn out that I wanted him to be free just so I wouldn't have to watch him working out or reading in prison any more.  Also, they included the Canadians going around and questioning people that said nothing.  What was the point in that?  To prove that they didn't want to talk?  I think we would have taken your word for it. This whole movie just seemed a bit contrived and forced, not as impacting as I expected it to be."

","Regardless of what truths might have been stretched for this film, all I have to say is that Denzel Washington is one of the most amazing actors to come across the big screen in a long time.  I believe that he was Rubin Carter here, and though Kevin Spacey was great in ""American Beauty"", it would have been really nice for the Academy to finally recognize Denzel as the true gem that he is..."

","Undoubtedly, this was a great film, and Denzel Washington was phenomenal, but I had some problems with this movie. I know people have been questioning its authenticity, and I think it should be. This story sells on basis that it is a true story, so if the script is in fact somewhat removed from the truth, then this movie is essentially fiction. One of the things I disliked was how clear cut the heroes and villains were portrayed. Surely Dan Hedaya's character could not have been that bad, and those Canadians were just a little too nice- we had no idea what they did or who they were either. And to think that all this started because Rubin was trying to protect his friend from a paedophile seems a little too good to be true. Perhaps it is all true, but it lacks credibility, since it's from the eyes of the Hurricane, and is subject to obvious bias. Nevertheless, not to take too much away from the movie, it still deserves a 3.5/5."
"memnova","7","0","2","24 April 2000"," biased, but strong performance by Washington
","I really thought that this film was very biased,  and that it basically did a one-sided defense of Hurricane Carter.  I thought that they overvillified the cop who pursued Carter.  Furthermore,  some of the details,  which were significant,  of the trial and why those Canadian people just decided to drop everything and join the case were a bit unclear.  However,  Denzel Washington did a magnificent job as Carter--one of the best of his career."

","What a powerful film, A story that needed to be told. Although very different in some respects this film reminded me of the film 'In the name of the father' Another story that needed to be told. Denzal was robbed of the Oscar, even Kevin Spacey would think so!"
"bburns","8","0","2","19 April 2000"," Very good, but fact & fiction don't blend well
","Watching ""The Hurricane"", I was moved by Denzel Washington's portrayal of wrongly imprisoned boxer Rubin Carter.  Carter (""Hurricane"" to fans, ""Rube"" to friends) is a deeply conflicted, deeply spiritual, deeply intellectual, and deeply angry man.  Washington has not played a role this meaty since ""Malcolm X"".  He is particularly good when he converses with his own hate and fear personified.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the film's plot hinges on a character played by Dan Hedaya who has no real life counterpart, and the parts that were made up for the movie (about a third of the film) stick out like ugly yellow dandelions on an otherwise beautiful green lawn.  And the prison scenes have some of the same sentimentality as ""The Shawshank Redemption"", and I'm not comfortable with sentimentality in prison movies.<br/><br/>Altogether, however, although this is no masterpiece, it is a very good film.  I rated it an 8.<br/><br/>
Altogether"

","I saw this movie as an unfinished work about two months ago.  The film was put together but missing a few technical touches.  Aside from that, it was a flawless piece of work by Norman Jewison.  All, and I mean all, performances were impeccable.  It is the story of Ruben ""Hurricane"" Carter, his imprisonment for murder charges, and what follows.  See this movie.  In January, expect many nominations for all these actors, especially the young man playing Lazarus.  Hopefully in March, it would be nice to see this movie walk away with many awards.  When it is released, go see it.  I know I will again."
