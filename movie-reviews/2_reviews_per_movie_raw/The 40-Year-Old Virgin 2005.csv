","In the previews, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" boasts the image of another immature sex romp about a 40-ish Lonely Guy who suddenly feels the urge to do the deed simply because he hasn't. Too many past bad experiences have dampened his enthusiasm to the point that he avoids women completely. And then the unexpected happens: he falls in love. What's more, there's a movie out about it, and it's called ""The 40 Year-old Virgin.""<br/><br/>The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches ""Survivor"" with his two kind elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women.<br/><br/>Now here's the real novelty with this picture: it does the impossible task of actually dealing with its subject matter in a cute, mature fashion. This is a movie that could very easily have turned out a lot differently in the hands of a more transparent team of filmmakers. It could have descended into endless sex gags and jokes but thankfully this picture never stoops that low. Sure there are sex jokes here and there and even a few prods are aimed at the gay community (which are, in no way, meant to be taken as gay-bashing), as two of the characters exchange insults towards each other while playing a video game (""Mortal Kombat: Deception,"" no less - the ultimate testosterone-driven fightfest for guys).<br/><br/>As someone who is rapidly approaching 20, collects McFarlane Toys action figures AND has himself never done the deed, I found this film amusing and touching in a way that a similar-themed movie could never have been. I was able to relate to the character of Andy Stitzer more than anyone in the theater because I was the only teenager present at this showing; everyone else looked like they were all past 40. A bit arrogant, I know, but would you (""you"" is italicized) still be able to relate if you were the only teen present at an afternoon screening of ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin""?<br/><br/>Of course Andy has never had sex and wakes up everyday with ""morning rise"" (don't ask), and he's pressured by his buddies to try outlandish methods of gaining the attention of the opposite sex. When it's first discovered Andy is a virgin, at 40, his three buddies and fellow electronics store coworkers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) all at first assume he's gay because he's never been with a woman, which couldn't be any further from the truth. The truth is, Andy loves women, but past traumatic experiences (revealed hilariously one after the other in a flashback sequence) have put him on the sidelines for good.<br/><br/>David, Jay, and Cal each embark on a mission to get Andy laid, so help them all. But you know that such escapades will only end in disaster, as proved by one date with Nicky (Leslie Mann), who puts Andy through the worst drunk-driving experience I think anyone would not want to go through and he has a rather creepy encounter with Beth (Elizabeth Banks), the pretty girl who works in the bookstore and is eventually revealed to be a total sex fiend.<br/><br/>Things brighten up for Andy when he meets Trish (Catherine Keener), the friendly woman who works at a store across the street that sells stuff on eBay for people. Hmmm. And with that nice-looking collection of action figures, you can go figure that in the end a large financial payoff awaits him, that is if he can ever ""do the deed.""<br/><br/>At last, this is the sex romp we've been waiting for. It deals with a very real issue a lot of Lonely Guys probably go through, not that anything is wrong with being a virgin but let's look at the big picture: How many of us ""Lonely Guys"" want to be a lonely guy forever? The important thing we're taught in this picture is that Lonely Guy must be himself. I don't think he needs to go through body waxing like Andy does (which is side-splitting to be honest, and according to this website and various other news articles, was in fact real, and so was the blood on Carell's shirt afterward).<br/><br/>""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" was directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by himself and Carell, which originated as a skit that starred Carell. Carell is sweet and human, as his character is not some layabout who approaches this thing with his eyes shut. This is probably one of the most intelligent romps I've ever seen and is not offensive (a whole lot) because its characters are treated with dignity and respect. Even Carell's buddies, who pass off bad advice to cover up their own relationship insecurities, can be related to on a fundamental level.<br/><br/>The way ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" plays out is indeed funny in the end, but I'll leave that up to you, the viewer, to observe. Surely, if anyone can go through the things Andy does and still have the strength to attract a woman as sexy as Catherine Keener, then it's true: It is never too late!<br/><br/>10/10"
"nmeaton_7","8","264","388","27 July 2005"," A very funny film that really showcases Carell's talent
","Just came out of a sneak preview for this film. It had me laughing every 30 secs. The ending was so funny that tears were rolling down my face and it had me wishing I hadn't bought that large coke. There are definitely some lulls, but, overall, highly entertaining. The movie lets Steve Carell have a chance to shine after stealing the spotlight from both Jim Carrey in ""Bruce Almighty"" and Will Ferrell ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgendy"" in their movies. Paul Rudd is hilarious as always. I love that he can be so funny in these broad comedies and continues to work in indie dramas (like P.S.). I think that Seth Rogen should be getting more work, because he so freaking talented and engaging. Leslie Mann also had some incredibly funny moments. I highly recommend it for those who just want to laugh like a maniac. However, if you're easily offended, don't see this movie. If you're a rabid feminist, don't see this movie. And, please, not matter what, even if you think you're one of those ""hip"" parents, don't take your kids to this movie. Sure, you should let your teens go see this movie, just don't watch it with them. It would make for some incredibly awkward moments."
"ivko","8","164","238","26 August 2005"," Breakout film for Carell
","Steve Carell has made a career out of portraying the slightly odd straight guy, first on 'The Daily Show', and then in various supporting roles. In Virgin, Carell has found a clever and hilarious script that perfectly capitalizes on his strengths. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. But it's clear that all three have a certain respect for the decent human being that Andy is, and they resolve to help him out by assisting him in ending his virginity. And so begins Andy's quest into adulthood. Andy is the quintessential innocent, and the bulk of the humor derives from his naivetÃ© to the situations he finds himself in throughout the film. Some of the humor is crude gross out stuff, but most of it is just well done intelligent comedy. In addition, I found some parts of the film actually pretty touching as Andy finds himself developing both romantic relationships and friendships perhaps for the first time in his life. I'm not trying to portray the movie as a love story or a drama; it's a rolling in your seats comedy. Still, every good comedy I have ever seen contains enough heart for you to care about the characters. A good comparison would be 'The Wedding Crashers' from earlier this summer. Virgin has a similar humor, but is perhaps a bit more vulgar in some of its jokes. I particularly loved the ending of the film, which I thought was a perfect way to end the flick. Without giving anything away, it reminded me of 'Something About Mary'. Very light and fun; it leaves you laughing and smiling, which is exactly how you should feel when you finish a comedy. I would highly recommend."
"pookey56","9","76","110","15 December 2005"," love, actually
","this is one of the funnier films i've seen. it had it's crude moments, but they were full of charm. it's Altmanesque screenplay, brilliant physical humour, and relaxed friendships were a pleasure to watch, and a slice of life most of us can relate to. and i can say with a measure of honesty that i was afraid for Steve Carell's nipple..i truly was. surprisingly, this is a good-natured, unabashed comedy that is essentially about love, and the many relationships we may find ourselves in along the way. Catherine Keener was terrific as Trish, and all of Steve Carell's friends were flawed but amiable, and so much fun. the idea that they suspected that Carell was a serial killer is a hilarious metaphor for a forty-year old virgin. but the simple truth was that he wanted to be in love first. original, charming, and very funny. highly recommended."
"LivinForMovies","9","226","349","30 July 2005"," It's about time a really funny movie came along!
","I haven't laughed this hard at a movie in a long time. I got to go to an advance screening, and was thrilled because I had been dying to see it. I had tears in my eyes from laughter throughout a lot of the movie. The audience all shared my laughter, and was clapping and yelling throughout most of the movie.<br/><br/>Kudos to Steve Carrell(who I had already been a fan of). He proves in this movie his tremendous talent for comedy. He has a style that I haven't seen before. And Catherine Keener is excellent as always. Thank God there wasn't a cameo from Will Ferrell(love him, but saw him too much this summer).<br/><br/>There were parts of comedic genius in this movie. Partly thanks to Carrell, and partly thanks to the writing(also Carrell). The waxing scene and the speed dater with the ""obvious problem"" were absolutely hysterical.<br/><br/>I will definitely go see '40 Year Old Virgin' when it's released. My advice: go to see it for huge laughs and an incredibly enjoyable movie on top of it."
"dhair59","10","139","210","17 August 2005"," Cute, crude, charming, nasty, hilarious, and more......
","I got a free pass to a preview of this movie last night and didn't know  what to expect. The premise seemed silly and I assumed it would be a  lot of shallow make-fun-of-the-virgin humor. What a great surprise. I  laughed so hard I cried at some of the jokes. This film is a must see  for anyone with an open mind and a slightly twisted sense of humor.  OK.....this is not a movie to go to with your grandmother (Jack  Palance?) or small children. The language is filthy, the jokes are  (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find  anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet  love story. My girlfriend and I both loved it.  Steve Carell is terrific, but (like The Office) the supporting cast  really makes the film work. All of the characters have their flaws, but  they also have depth and likability. Everyone pulls their weight and  the chemistry is perfect.  I can't wait to get the DVD. I'm sure it will be up there with Office  Space for replays and quotable lines."
"Quinoa1984","8","115","174","21 August 2005"," a healthy reminder that sex jokes can be well crafted; Carrell is genius
","Something about the 40 Year Old Virgin and the other comedy hit of the summer, Wedding Crashers, is similar, but they are two different films in some respects. Both are romantic comedies that have that kind of over-the-top, crazy sensibility that keeps the teens and guys in their 20's along with the usual dating crowd to go see the films. Both have some sort of formula to the stories as well. But by the end of the 40 Year Old Virgin, I think I found overall it was more satisfying than 'Crashers'. Although one can guess where the relationship story with Steve Carrell's character Andy and Catherine Keener's character Trish will go to, it isn't too basic for one to figure out like with Crashers, and the characters both leading and supporting are realistic, more rounded than most of the one-dimensional or unexplained people in the other. And, perhaps, it may also depend on how much you identify (or just find the lunacy) in both.<br/><br/>The thing is some people may go into The 40 Year Old Virgin not knowing Steve Carrell as well as Owen Wilson or Vince Vaughn, as Carrell has built up his cult status on The Daily Show (one of my favorite shows on now) and in small but unforgettably riotous roles in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty. This is his first starring role, but it's not treated like some third rate vehicle. He and co-writer/director Judd Apatow treat the character of Andy with a certain level of sincerity that keeps the audience on his side all the way, even early on as he talks to his action figures while re-painting them. It's also a tricky line to walk on- in lessor hands this could be no more or less entertaining than the Lackluster 40 Days and 40 Nights with Josh Hartnett (also about sexual dysfunction). As the title suggests, Andy is the 40 year old who is like the nice guy friend with still a little Pee-Wee Herman in him (the opening over the credits of his his apartment is hilarious, a good sign).<br/><br/>So, his friends (among them Paul Rudd, Romany Mancoy, Seth Rogen, all very good comic foils) try and devise different strategies and tips to finally break the sort of curse over Andy's head to pop his cherry, so to speak. He almost gets with a overly drunk woman, he almost gets with a freaky kind of girl, and almost with his own boss (Jane Lynch, also very funny in the mockumentaries) as a (explitive) buddy. But this soon all starts to fade as he gets into a meaningful relationship with Trish, who works across the street from him. As they build on a relationship not based at all on sex, one might worry that the plot gear of ""how is he going to tell her such and such"" might get in the way of the comedy. It doesn't. In fact, if anything, Carrell and the cast build on it to a very high degree. For practically an hour and a half of the film's two hour length, there was barely a moment I wasn't laughing, whether big or small.<br/><br/>The big laughs though make up for not just any kind of formalities with the plot, or one or two little stray stories (the fellow co-workers have their own relationship problems as well, Rudd's being the funniest). The big laughs come through because of Carrell's reactions, and that the people around him can either back up with their own sort of humor/charm, or that its with some truth. Keener gives a very good performance and makes it so that there is a genuine spirit to their relationship (and, un-like 'Crashers', there isn't as much that doesn't make sense character wise). For someone like me who loves it when a comedian can get laughs just from the way he looks on his face, Carrell gets very high points here. And like with a Farrelly brothers movie, the more raunchy or outrageous scenes are done with total absurdity; the 'waxing' scene (which was done for real, by the way) and the sort of Aquarius musical number towards the very end of the film (the way it comes out at first is a total, uproarious surprise). But if you're willing not to get offended by it, there's more where that came from. This is one of the funniest films of the year."
"howismyfish","10","116","192","22 August 2005"," The best comedy I've seen in years
","Steve Carell comes into his own in his first starring role in the 40 Year Old Virgin, having only had supporting roles in such films as Bewitched, Bruce Almighty, Anchorman, and his work on the Daily Show, we had only gotten a small taste of the comedy that Carell truly makes his own. You can tell that Will Ferrell influenced his ""comedic air"" but Carell takes it to another level, everything he does is innocent, lovable, and hilarious. I would not hesitate to say that Steve Carell is one of the next great comedians of our time.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs (or 4 hours if you see it twice like I did), a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music fit the tone of the movie great, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing.<br/><br/>Filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and a lot of language, this movie isn't for everyone but if you liked the Wedding Crashers, Anchorman, or any movie along those lines, you will absolutely love The 40 Year Old Virgin."
"metalrules31","8","28","41","6 July 2008"," The Modern Definition of ""Serious Comedy""
","I'm not quite sure if the term ""serious comedy"" applies to this movie, Im not even sure if this can be applied. On the last few years movie theaters have become filled with comedy movies which are way too stupid to even make us grin. Therefore, I considered the movies which do not fill these requirements as ""serious comedies"".<br/><br/>Does The 40 Year Old Virgin fit into this guild? That is finally up to you, but in my opinion, this is a very funny movie. You get to laugh a lot, plus it delivers a social commentary through some really great characters and situations.<br/><br/>I'm pretty there is more than one 40 year old virgin out there, and even the people whom do not exactly fit this specifications, may feel identified by one of the characters in the movie, especially men.<br/><br/>The story, as the title says it, is about Andy, a shy, silent guy, whom collects action figures, watches Survivor with his octogenarian neighbors and whose favorite band is Asia.<br/><br/>Kal is Andy's co-worker at SmartTech. He believes Andy to be a psychopath until Andy's secret is revealed. Kal is clearly a sexual pervert but yet he seems to get what he wants with the opposite genre.<br/><br/>David is the passionate guy who is still in love with his ex-girlfriend, whom ran away with another guy. And Jay, a man in a relationship which seems to be affected by his continuous cheating and getting caught acts.<br/><br/>I'm pretty sure most youngsters from 13 to 21 have already watched this film, but it really does not have an age limit to be able to enjoy it. So in case you haven't seen it and will enjoy a little laugh, with social commentary, than go to your video store and rest from those deep and depressing independent films.<br/><br/>It also includes DVD bonuses which you'll really see from top to bottom."
"TheMovieMark","7","176","324","18 August 2005"," Prepare to blush as much as you laugh
","All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. There are some painfully funny moments in the movie, but I probably blushed about as much as I laughed. Actually, I probably blushed MORE than I laughed. And if I wasn't literally blushing on the outside, then I was blushing on the inside. If there is absolutely nothing in this movie that embarrasses you then you simply have no shame. Whether that's a badge of honor or not is in the eye of the beholder I suppose.<br/><br/>I will not deny that I laughed quite a bit, but this is a movie that I simply cannot give a blanket recommendation due to its subject matter. If I were to say, ""This movie is hilarious, go check it out!"" and some sweet, little old church-going lady heads to the theater and has a heart-attack during one of the graphically explicit sex situations, well, that's just something I don't need on my conscience.<br/><br/>So how raunchy is it? Hmm, try about 100 times worse than The Wedding Crashers. Honestly. My mom would've walked out during the first scene. I feel it's my duty to at least warn you of what to expect.<br/><br/>There is some cleverly intelligent comedy here, but that's what I come to expect from the man (Judd Apatow) who had a hand in both Freaks and Geeks and Undeclared. I'm all for making fun of Michael McDonald; the only man whose hair and beard are white enough to give Kenny Rogers a run for his money. Paul Rudd proclaiming, ""If I hear Ya Mo Be There one more time I'll Ya Mo burn this place down,"" is hilarious, but it's one of those things that the majority of the audience won't appreciate.<br/><br/>And when we see a quick 3-second flashback of Steve Carrell singing along to Cameo's Word Up, I laughed for a good two minutes after the joke was over, whereas most everybody chuckled and then forgot about it.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, despite the raunch, there's an admirable moral to the story. The movie doesn't portray Carrell as some freaky loser just because he's a virgin. He's really portrayed as a likable, admirable character. Sure, he's a little weird. After all, he has a framed Asia poster, ""more videogames than an Asian kid,"" and a toy collection that features the Million Dollar Man's BOSS, but we're never led to believe that there's actually anything wrong with the fact that he's a virgin. As odd as it may seem, there's a bit of an ""it's OK to wait"" message.<br/><br/>But man, oh man, please be warned that this pushes its R rating about as far as it can go. That was certainly Apatow's intention. According to him, he just let some of the guys (particularly Rogen and Malco) improv and talk the way they normally talk, all in an effort to find lots of new ways to be dirty. If you can handle that or talk that way yourself, then you'll love the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or fratboy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. I just don't know how interested most women will be in what's discussed by men while playing poker. Honestly ladies, you might not want to know. If you've ever been curious why some girls think guys are gross, well, this gives you a good idea.<br/><br/>There you go - my humble, honest take on what to expect. Be that your guide. It definitely should not be seen with your Sunday School class, mama, grandmama, any family members of the opposite sex, children of any age, or anybody who is easily offended by excessive profanity or explicit sex discussion. If you'd see it with any of the above then you apparently do not have any concept of what it means to be uncomfortable."

His role is perfect for him and just plain ""makes"" the movie. The movie exceeded all expectations I could have had. The acting was great, the writing was wonderful, and the comedy could not have been any funnier for what it was. If you have seen The Office or Anchorman you would know how Steve Carell steals the show and this movie proves it more than ever.

","I was really surprised with this movie. Going in to the sneak preview, knowing nothing about the movie except for the one trailer I'd seen, I thought it was going to be a Dude Where's My Car kind of crap fest.

Instead I got a smart, surprisingly original movie about a decent, average guy who just never had sex.<br/><br/>Yes, the film is chock full o' sex jokes and vulgarity and the occasional hey-look-a-nipple!, but it's done much in the spirit of Bad Santa rather than Sorority Boys.

Hysterically funny high-concept comedy about the titular Andy Stitzer (wonderfully played by perennial second banana Carell in a truly extraordinarily comic breakthrough performance sure to stratosphere him to the A-list), a tech services rep for an electronics store in Southern California who is found out about his secretive identity by a trio of well-meaning yet entirely clueless womanizing co-worker buddies (Rudd, Malco & Rogen, each one degree funnier than the next) determined to get their friend deflowered no matter the cost. What follows is an unlikely yet very warm-hearted romance with a vivacious mother (the marvelous Keener having lots of fun here) leading to add more fuel to the fires within Andy. A surprisingly good-spirited and unapologetically raunchy romantic comedy; the funniest since ""There's Something About Mary"" with a shrewdly observant script by director Judd Apatow and Carell that features some astoundingly gut-busting sequences including a scathingly accurate David Caruso joke, homophobic debunking ribbing, send-ups of 'date-a-paloozas' and demystifying the war of the sexes with cheeky aplomb.

","If you liked ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" you will love this movie. In fact, it rejoins a couple of the supporting cast of that film, starring Steve Carrell, who played ""Brick"" who, in my opinion, stole that show with his clueless stares and inane ramblings.<br/><br/>In this film, Andy, the 40-year-old virgin, gets a lot of unwanted help from his male coworkers, who are all so completely dysfunctional that they really don't have any business trying to repair anyone else's private life. The fact that Andy also still rides a bicycle and is chided by his coworkers for that, too, just seems to emphasize that modern society has turned virginity into a stigma similar to not being able to pass a driving test. Instead of wanting to lose his virginity, though, what Andy really wants is a relationship with the nice woman running a store across the street from where he works. His virginity is just a byproduct of him not finding a good relationship with a woman yet. The resulting story is actually a rather sweet romance buried underneath all of the Man Show style humor.<br/><br/>It carries a rare message in modern film - that chastity before marriage is not a bad thing, and that everybody is running on their own schedule."

","Wow! This film is truly awful. I can't imagine how anyone could have read this badly written script and given it the greenlight. The cast is uniformly second rate with some truly horrendous performances from virtually all of the cast. The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent. The telling, leaden and predictable. No wit, no charm, no humour. Not sexy in the least. The characters remain as flat as the proverbial pancake. There's also a strong current of misogyny which became increasingly hard to stomach as the film went on. When your lead (Carrell) is unfunny and unappealing it's uphill from there. Despite it's phony turn-around ending where love triumphs over lust I was left with a sick feeling in my stomach. If this is what passes for humour and social comment then we're definitely doomed."

","I know this will be very unpopular, but I found this movie to be mostly unfunny, way too long, incredibly predictable, and very base. For anyone seeking humor that does not insult one's basic level of intelligence, this is not the movie for you. There ARE some hilarious scenes, but they are very brief and sandwiched in between big fat loaves of the most low-level frat/high school humor I've seen in a while. It doesn't involve you enough to really want to see what happens, also because it rambles on for about a half hour too long.<br/><br/>I'm a big fan of humor like old Woody Allen, The Office, Spinal Tap, and Airplane!, and this just wasn't inventive enough to hold my interest. Toilet humor does not require good writing, it just requires an audience who likes toilet humor. I'm cool with people liking it, but it does nothing for me, personally. Occasionally a bit of random, absurd humor would pop in, which was good, but it was mostly relying on cheap humor tricks that got old after the first 15 minutes, for me.<br/><br/>Also, I don't mind people swearing at all, but after a while, I actually got bored of hearing it so freaking much.<br/><br/>Sorry, two thumbs down here."

A world full of raging and offensive stereotypes of ethnic minorities. And a world without any funny jokes! I am absolutely shocked at the seeming chorus of viewers who liked this movie.

","I admit that isn't a precursor for a bad film there have been plenty of no-brain comedies over the years that I thoroughly enjoyed. The main fault I'd have to find with this film is it's dreadful writing. It is terribly tired and formulaic i.e. shy guy seeks girl, friends give bad advice and embarrass shy guy, shy guy learns to be himself. None of the so called 'jokes' hit the mark notably any contributions from Andy's Indian/Pakistanii co-workers and his boss singing a Guatemalan serenade. WTF was that about? I suspect it was a cynical attempt by Steve Carrell and Judd Apatow to inject some Will Ferrell-style craziness into this terribly mundane comedy but it failed miserably and was just embarrassing. Anchorman was one of the best comedies in years. 40 Year Old Virgin highlights Ferrells considerable influence on that film.<br/><br/>The fact that so many people have enjoyed this utterly classless film has shocked me. I hated it. I encourage anyone who regard themselves as having reasonably discernible taste to challenge me on this."
"sharkey197","1","28","54","1 August 2006"," how far we have sunk culturally
","I found this movie's title offensive, to begin with. Immediately, you know it's going to be about some guy who reaching his 40th birthday without having had sex will be pressured or helped by his friends to go out and get some. As if sex was something to be hunted like prey or the partner needed for such an act was just incidental. The humor USN't--it's offensive and vulgar and the dialogue sounds like a bunch of dirty minded 15 year old boys. The fact that so many people on this website are calling it wonderful is disturbing. I think as a society we have sunk pretty low. Why is this man's private life subject matter for a joke? What is wrong with not having sex if that is your choice? And is nothing private anymore? The scene at the end when he's in bed with his wife and the subsequent ""jokes"" is distasteful and so low class. I guess as long as people crave this sort of tripe they will keep making it, but it makes me very sad."

Why people think that you have to be sexually filthy and crude in every sentence to be funny is beyond me. This Movie would be good at a Fraternity Party, or a Bachelor's Party, where everyone is so smashed they don't know the difference.

","I'm all about a good comedy so I was excited for the release of this movie. However, I was extremely disappointed when I realized that this was the least original comedy ever made. All this movie did was take jokes that everyone has told since the 6th grade and slapped them together and added one joke about Kelly Clarkson. Comedy films are supposed to be daring, or at least witty, not comparable to a comedy made by randomly selected high schoolers. To me, this film would have been American Pie 40 if Jim had never gotten laid. I've got nothing against American Pie, but the series quickly went down hill.

The few attempts at jokes were so predictable that nobody laughed. The interviews with the producer promised that the DVD would contain material that couldn't be used in the film.

There are endless topics of discussion and mis-fire situations that seem to pop in from nowhere and leave to nowhere. <br/><br/>Foul-mouthed East Indians maybe amusing initially-only because that type of behaviour doesn't fit the stereotype, but they become tiresome quickly--especially when seen throughout the entire picture. <br/><br/>However, after seeing a startingly high number of very positive reviews it has received--even from reputable film critics--I am somewhat disturbed by how the evaluation standards of filmaking apparently now isn't anything at all like how I think it has been, or close to what it should be.

"oriel-1","1","25","49","27 August 2005"," A parable without inspiration
","I read a number of the reviews and ratings of this dreadful movie before venturing a comment. In fact, I checked the ratings on IMDb before I saw the film - a mistake. I would have done better drawing straws. I can't honestly give this movie a single star. <br/><br/>The movie uses the locker-room stereotype of young American men - constantly concerned with sex and willing to employ any means to have it. The range of sexual experience sought is so extremely caricatured that one character finds watching a Mexican (not American) woman have sex with a horse as boring as making an egg salad sandwich. Men in this film will use any means whatsoever: lying, cheating, drugs and alcohol to satisfy the sexual urge. Homosexuality is shown as just one in the range of sexual options - slightly beyond bestiality. In the pursuit of sex men are portrayed as so dirty and disgusting they are laughable. Degrading people is not humor.<br/><br/>Most American men could not identify with any of the characters in this movie. The majority are decent, honest and moral. They believe in romantic love in which sex has a natural role despite the guilt and fear connected with sex by religion and the state. The male characters in this movie would be excluded socially by men in the real world.<br/><br/>The female characters in the movie are also stereotypes - ""eve and the serpent."" They - unlike the men - are sexually sophisticated, experienced and competent. They exist to tempt men: for example the female store owner's offer to become ""fuck buddy"" of the main character or the bookstore saleswoman?s responsiveness to the star's stupid pickup lines and her auto-erotic session as a warm up to a heterosexual event - with him or any other partner. <br/><br/>In essence, this is a propaganda film. It uses degrading humor and stereotyping to convey lessons based on the biblical interpretations of Jerry Falwell, James Dobson, Pat Robertson and even George Bush: 1. Virginity (abstinence) before marriage is good - if a bit geeky. 2. Sex outside of marriage is dirty disgusting and gross. 3. Sex is addictive and more and varied experiences are required to satisfy the addiction 4. Homosexuality one of a variety of sexual choices.<br/><br/>And of course, the final point, sex education is simply used to teach sexual alternatives to immoral people who wish to be sexually active - ""outercourse"" and ""oral play"" ? while avoiding the responsibility of pregnancy and disease. <br/><br/>As propaganda, the movie appears to be relatively successful, it slipped by the majority of your reviewers. As comedy or cinematic art however, it is unrepresentative, ugly and disgusting."

","........................................................from Pasto,Colombia...Via: L.A. CA., CALI, COLOMBIA and ORLANDO, FL <br/><br/>As often occurs in Hollywood, Movies are made where the main idea seems to be so good, so foolproof, that you react by saying, ""Damn, what a hell of a great premise for a movieNo WAY they can screw THAT up!"" Unfortunately, where there's a will, there's a Way, and, consequently, sometimes even the best of concepts results in a five-alarm disastrous of a film... Thank God that, The 40 Year Old Virgin, is a case of ""The Exception Proves the Rule!"" And this, despite the fact that Universal seemed to do just about everything possible to spoil Virgin, it is definitely worth watching, at least once! <br/><br/>In the title role we have the comedy sensation of recent years, Steve Carell, who entered the Comedy Stratosphere with Bruce Almighty. (Where Mr. Carell was Jim Carey's TV weatherman competitionRemember that now famous scene where Carell's character is trying to break some important news, but all he can manage to get out is a series of weird grunts, groans and assorted sounds!) <br/><br/>It seems that, Carrell, who really WAS around 40 at the time ALMIGHTY was made, attained great comic success relatively late in lifeBut, of course, much better late..! One of Virgin's excesses is that every time the film reaches a rather difficult stretch, it appears that Director, Tom Shadyac (Liar, Liar) places too much responsibility on the shoulders of his leading man, who, despite his great and varied talents, sometimes can't help showing just how much of a struggle it is to carry the film forward.<br/><br/>Another example where VIRGIN is a bit over-the-top, regards the unrelenting profanity in the dialog! If any of you non-native speakers out there were not familiar with some of these words in English, during each viewing, you'll get to practice them at least a hundred times! At some point, it just stops being funny for everyone in the audience. Also, there is simply too much information about too many sexual acts and other kinky incidentals that might have provoked laughter the first, second, or even a bit the third time, but with the umpteenth reference ends up being downright nauseating.<br/><br/>With a run-time of nearly two hours, I think that Virgin would have been even more enjoyable with at least 5 to 10 minutes of strategic editing. But, despite the flaws mentioned here, there are a number of scenes that produce industrial-size laughter, which readily justify the time you invest watching! Also, Virgin demonstrates more than enough originality, both in general concept and in how it has been brought to the screen.<br/><br/>It is well worth mentioning co-star, Catherine Keener (The Interpreter, Being John Malkovich), certainly, a very underrated actress in Hollywood. She plays the competition for love interest to perfection, giving the film a much needed touch of realism and credibility. So here is an interesting and fun film that will probably feel good to both men and women alike! There is almost nothing visually graphic in Virgin, but because of its non-stop hardcore locker room language, I would recommend it for those at least 15, or over, in your family.<br/><br/>No matter if you lost yours at 12 or at 40 or even if you still are...Virgin makes us ALL laugh about an integral component of the human condition, one with which each and every one of us can probably relate to! <br/><br/>7*....ENJOY!/DISFRUTELA! <br/><br/>Any comments, questions or observations, in English o en Español, are welcome!"

"MovieAddict2016","8","12","22","18 December 2005"," A very pleasant surprise - the best ""sex"" comedy in years.
","The key to The 40-Year-Old Virgin is not merely that Andy Stitzer is a 40-year-old virgin, but rather the manner in which Steve Carell presents him as one. In a genre of crass ""comedy"" that has become typified by its lack of humor and engaging characters, The 40-Year-Old Virgin offers a colorful cast and an intelligent, heartfelt script that doesn't use its protagonist as the butt-end of cruel jokes. That Andy is still a virgin at forty years old is not as much a joke, in fact, as it is a curiosity.<br/><br/>Carell, a veteran of Team Ferrell in Anchorman and an ex-Daily Show castmember, uses the concept of the film to expand his character  we get to understand why Andy is the way he is. It's the little things that make this film work. When Andy's co-worker at an electronics store asks him what he did for the weekend, Andy describes his failed efforts at cooking. When Andy rides his bike to work, he signals his turns. He doesn't just adorn his home with action figures  he paints them, and talks to them, and reveals that some of the really old ones have belonged to him since childhood. A lesser comedy wouldn't even begin to focus on all of these things.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly simplistic  Andy's co-worker pals find out he's never had sex and they make it a personal quest of theirs to get him in bed with a woman. It's a childish idea and the film makes no attempt to conceal its juvenility.<br/><br/>Andy's friends are a complement to his neurotic nature: David (Paul Rudd) has broken up with his girlfriend over two years ago but is still obsessed with her, Jay (Romany Malco) is a womanizing ladies' man and Cal (Seth Rogen) is a tattooed sexaholic. Their attempts at getting Andy in the sack backfire numerous times, and each time leaves Andy feeling less and less optimistic.<br/><br/>Finally Andy meets single mom Trish (played by Catherine Keener) and, much to the chagrin of his worrying buddies who claim mothers aren't worth it, he falls in love with her. They begin a relationship and agree to put off having sex for twenty days  Trish being unaware that Andy is still a virgin.<br/><br/>The 40-Year-Old Virgin was directed by Judd Apatow, the man who produced Anchorman and The Cable Guy, and began the short-lived cult TV show Freaks and Geeks. Apatow is renowned for his unique sense of humor, and the script  co-written by Carell  offers plenty.<br/><br/>However, in the end the most interesting and (indeed surprising) aspect of The 40-Year-Old Virgin is its maturity. By now you are probably well aware that the film received glowing reviews from the critics, and even I was surprised by its warm reception. But after seeing the film, it's easy to understand why. We like Andy. We care about him. He's not just some cardboard cutout sex-comedy cliché  he's a real, living, breathing person. His neurotic traits combine the best of Woody Allen with childish naivety. His friends are not unlikable jerks and his romance is tumultuous and bittersweet. It strikes a chord with the audience.<br/><br/>Although this is far from being a perfect movie and definitely contains some rather crude innuendo and sexual humor, it doesn't offend to the extent that other genre entries might have because we have affection for the people on-screen. The best sex comedies work this way  from Risky Business to American Pie  and that is the major difference between something like The 40-Year-Old Virgin and 40 Days and 40 Nights."

","Like a great many people I viewed this film based upon a promising storyline and Steve Carell's fine performance in Anchorman which, albeit its slightly crude nature, was very entertaining.<br/><br/>The film begins with promise but quickly loses steam and falls into an abyss of vulgarity and stupidity from which it never recovers.<br/><br/>This is a dull, painful and hopelessly dreadful film from nearly every point of view that caters either to adolescents or to the basest elements. How vulgar language, rubber penises, vomit and racist jokes pass for comedy is beyond me. I'm very surprised at the relatively high rating given this dreck at IMDb.com, but I suppose that people's judgement has been reduced somewhat due to the relentless parade of similarly wretched offerings spluttering forth from Hollywood."
"FilmSnobby","1","23","48","24 August 2005"," The movie's poster is funnier than the movie.
","The feeling persists that Steve Carell is somehow smarter than this material. Perhaps it was his association with ""The Daily Show"" that generates high expectations . . . or, if ""high"" is too strong a word, our expectations are raised at least some inches above the curb abutting the gutter. And indeed, perhaps the original treatment intended to be a witty and ironic take on what is and is not expected of males in the sexual arena in our modern society. Blah blah blah.<br/><br/>But that's precisely the sort of movie that Hollywood would never bankroll, and so such idle speculations are really a waste of time. Carell and director John Apatow keep the material strictly aimed at the most lucrative target audience of 18-to-25 year-olds, as well as the younger adolescents who will view the DVD later: morning stiffies; ""you-know-how-I-can-tell-you're-gay"" wisecracks; plenty of T & A; a chick barfing in some dude's face. Carell achieves at least one original moment, to put it charitably (others may call it an all-time new low): he literally gets his hirsute chest bloodily waxed before our eyes. Laughing yet? Yeah -- nothing for adults here, even though the title informs us that it's about a 40-year-old.<br/><br/>Then it occurred to me that I was AGAIN witnessing a film featuring both Carell and Paul Rudd. The last time was in *Anchorman*. *The 40-Year-Old Virgin*, therefore, firmly belongs within the Wilson/Vaughn/Stiller/Ferrell/Rudd Nexus of Bad Comedy that I railed about in my review of *Wedding Crashers*. Now, we can add another forward-slash, followed by Carell's name, to the Nexus' lengthy prefix. I suppose one ought to be thankful that Will Ferrell doesn't put in a cameo in this one. Indeed, I almost raised up the rating for *The 40-Year-Old Virgin* to 2 stars out of sheer gratitude for this fact. But! -- Luke Wilson is referenced by actual name when one of the sexy females in the movie compares the Carell character to Wilson, physically speaking. (Carell, who wrote much of the screenplay, proves once again the eternal egotism of writers.) Now that was just one reference to the Nexus too many; therefore, back down to 1 star."

","The 40 Year Old Virgin stars Steve Carrell in pretty much a rehashing of Brick from anchorman. the first 30 minutes or so of the movie were about the least funny minutes in any comedy i've seen in theaters (i say *in theaters* because for some reason i watched ""Guess who"" on DVD... and that whole movie was pretty much the least funny comedy i've ever seen). The whole movie was filled with nothing but poorly written, uncreative, and vulgar cheap laughs. i.e. the old Pakistani guy rambling on about sex acts. nothing remotely witty about it. in all i'd say the last half hour or so and the waxing scene were the only parts worth seeing. there was a small amount of funniness throughout that barely kept the movie going along at a decent pace. but in all, this certainly wasn't the best comedy of the summer. the humor in it is supposed to be shocking or whatever... but saying: sh-t, fu-k, pus-y, co-k, b-ner, etc. really isn't shocking to anyone outside of Jr high schoolers and parents. in summation... it is a movie full of cheap laughs and uncreative to the bone, but a few scenes make it worth it if you're really bored and hard up for a laugh."

"Scaramouche2004","9","9","17","28 August 2005"," Carell is THE comedian for the 21st Century
","I have been very generous with my rating for this film, as I believe it is one of the few films I have seen recently which actually deserve it.<br/><br/>Having first noticed Steve Carell in Bruce Almighty, I had him pegged as a 'one to watch' and have been watching him closely ever since. That coupled with a film stealing performance in the hilarious Anchorman, has cemented my faith in Carell and I am sure now he will become on of the true great cinematic comedians on par with the likes of Laurel, Chaplin and Keaton. Believe me I cannot praise this guy too highly.<br/><br/>Carell plays Andy a 40 year old lonely guy with few nerdy hobbies who lives a routine life. He works in an electronics store, cycles to work and watches 'Survivor' with his elderly neighbours. He is an all around nice guy, which is conceived by many around him as some sort of abject weirdness which accounts for the fact that he lives alone and appears to have very few friends.<br/><br/>As the title suggests, Andy is also a virgin. A few embarrassments and traumatic experiences in his youth, (shown here is some hilarious flashbacks) convinced him to give the whole thing up as a bad job, and now he avoids women like the plague.<br/><br/>This is a deep and well kept secret and it is only when three co-workers reluctantly invite the 'odd' guy for a poker night, does the truth become known. At first there are the obvious ridicule and jokes, but it soon becomes a mission for those around him, to offer their advice and experience in order to get Andy 'laid' as soon as possible.<br/><br/>This is pure comedy through and through as Andy is put in some real cringe worthy embarrassing situations as he once again dabbles his toe in sexual waters. It is almost like a teen puberty comedy without the teens.<br/><br/>However saying that, this is by no means, an American Pie style sex fest executed in an immature adolescent way. Sure we have 'Knob' gags and jokes relating to the female genitalia, we have nudity and we have some gross out smut at times, yet with all, this film handles what is for some a very real and sensitive issue in a mature and sensitive way which never once interferes with the comedy on screen.<br/><br/>For instance Andy could quite easily become a figure of ridicule, yet this film is executed in such a way, that Andy is never anything less than our hero. We like him and wish him to succeed, and although his new found friends try to re-condition him for the female market, we like him just as he is, indeed it is Andy's true gentlemanly qualities and sense of decency which brings the film to an hilarious and successful conclusion. The real and true Andy finding real and true love.<br/><br/>There are so many ingredients in here, and it is in my opinion one of the funniest film of the year, if not THE funniest.<br/><br/>Look out for the final scene which had my girlfriend and I almost busting our guts in laughter. It was such an unexpected twist that I do not wish to spoil it here. In fact I think it was because it was so surprising that it was so damn funny.<br/><br/>I hope we can see more of Steve Carell in lead roles such as this.<br/><br/>Brilliant."
"bwilkening","7","3","4","7 June 2006"," Decent comedy
","Overall, I thought that this comedy contained a good number of laughs and was an enjoyable viewing experience. Steve Carrell was convincing and likable as the title character, and for the most part I liked the supporting cast portraying his coworkers who tried to help him to remedy his ""predicament."" Catherine Keener was also good as Carrell's romantic interest. The couple inexplicably had a decent on-screen chemistry, which made you root for both characters. The sarcastic banter between Carrell and Keener's teenage daughter is pretty funny, although the daughter kind of drops out of the last half hour of the film. While a lot of people have mentioned the film's raunchiness and gross out humor, I actually didn't really notice it while watching the movie. It certainly didn't strike me as being worse than anything out of a Farrely Brother's movie.<br/><br/>I had a few problems with the movie that forced me to detract several points. First, as many have commented, the film is really much longer than it needs to be. There are too many long scenes that don't arouse laughs and that don't contribute to either the plot or the characters' development. I actually would have been fine if the movie had ended right after the chase scene when Carrell finally confesses his secret to Keener. I didn't really need the typical happy Hollywood ending (not to mention the bizarre and spontaneous musical number at the conclusion). Some of the scenes that others have raved about didn't really do it for me, such as the excruciatingly long chest waxing scene. Similarly, the racial banter between the two South Asian characters and Romany Malco seemed out of place. They were funny at first, but they recur far too often and the South Asian guys never develop identities apart from trading racial insults with Malco. Finally, there is a scene in which Carroll criticizes Keener for trying to change him by making him sell all of his toys so that he can open up his own business. It looks for a moment that this is leading somewhere, and that maybe both characters will learn something about being too demanding of others, but then the premise is completely dropped, and we learn at the end that Carrell has indeed sold all of his toys to hold an extravagant wedding, which seems very inconsistent with his and Keener's characters.<br/><br/>Overall, this comedy had its share of laughs, but I was glad I waited until it came out on DVD."
"Superunknovvn","4","11","23","1 October 2005"," This year's ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"", only more vulgar
","""Wedding Crashers"" was an okay movie. I never understood why it got such a high rating on IMDb. I liked it, but I saw nothing special about it. Nothing that elevated it from similar movies, such as ""Dodgeball"" or ""Starsky & Hutch"". Still, I understood why it had become such a tremendous hit. The leading roles were played by big stars, the pacing was fast and the jokes kept coming. Some worked, some didn't, but it was an entertaining way to spend 90 minutes with your brain turned off. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" had no really big names in its cast, but was a tremendous hit anyway. I figured that this must have had something to do with a charming story and funny and original jokes. Reviewers (including Roger Ebert, who once again doesn't have the same opinion about a movie as me) were raving about how lovely this little flick was. And last but not least IMDb users gave this movie an amazing 7.7, a rating comedies rarely receive. Once again IMDb has misdirected me. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" sucked big time!<br/><br/>First off, let me make clear that there's nothing ""charming"" about this movie. The characters are as unrealistic as they are unlikeable. I really have nothing against rude jokes as long as they have a punchline or a point, but ""Virgin"" is full of vulgar talk that's just not funny and often at the expense of ethnical minorities in a primitive way. Within the first 15 minutes the movie gets boring as there is no real development in the story whatsoever. The dialog is predictable and extremely lame. The most painful thing, however, was that it didn't take much more than the mention of the word ""pussy"" or one character asking another to have sex with a goat, to make people in the cinema go wild. God, I hated it when the old couple living above Andy first commented on how Andy was going to get laid that night and then talked about how they were going to have sex themselves later on. Is it that easy to get the audience to laugh? Are people that stupid or am I missing something? Hell, I can even chuckle at the worst mindless sex-comedies à la ""Van Wilder"" or ""TomCats"", but this movie just left me absolutely cold and caused no reaction other than extreme boredom. I hate it when immature comedies like this one pretend to be open minded whilst covering all stereotypes and dragging every little weakness of its characters through the dirt.<br/><br/>I didn't think it was romantic, either, not for a second. The scene with Trish discovering Andy's porn was the worst. It was so implausible, it insulted my intelligence. As if all that wasn't enough, the director did an absolute horrible job. The movie looks like it had been made for T.V. without one creative shot in there.<br/><br/>The cast wasn't half bad. Catherine Keener (who has gotten extremely old in just a few years it seems) does an okay job. Steve Carell acts as natural as he can under the circumstances and thankfully doesn't try to be a cardboard copy of Jim Carrey, Adam Sandler, Ben Stiller or Will Ferrell. I didn't like him too much in the American version of ""The Office"", but he convinced me here.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, that isn't enough to save this horrible movie. Apparently I'm in the minority with my opinion, though. Like ""My Big Fat Greek Wedding"" some years ago the success of this boring mess is a phenomenon, which is beyond me. If that's what people want to see these days, then people have become incredibly undemanding."

","""I'm not in on the buzz on this film. It's too low-brow to be much fun, and everyone in it--from the main character to passing extras--have one driving force: their genitals. ""<br/><br/>I have to say one thing: welcome to the male world and that's just the way it is, I challenge anyone to find a comedy concerning sex that's constantly in a mature nature and is still funny. Also, you went to a movie with the title ""40 year old *virgin*"" not ""40 year old dude"" or ""40 year old introvert"". The film is probably going to be about sex, dear readers, so if you're not ready for some jokes about genitals and putting on a condom the right way the movie may not be for you.<br/><br/>""The inept acting, scripting, pacing, continuity, and direction are as bad as anything I've ever seen. ""<br/><br/>I found Steve Carrol's acting along with his friends very believable... and what exactly does 'bad directing' mean? The only directing involved in this movie is in regular dialog and in some beds, so you have face A, then face B, then back to face A again: can you really screw that up? Also, the scripting was great because you have characters delivering rapid-fire dialog, then can change gears to slow seduction scenes, both appropriate for a comedy. I beg you readers to also ignore this horribly common stock criticism.<br/><br/>""The story is disjointed, fragmented and incoherent.""<br/><br/>I found the opposite to be true. You start with a guy whose friends find out he is a virgin, so they try to give him advice then set him up with several women. He falls for a compatible lady incidentally, whom he starts a relationship with. Eventually he falls head over heels for said lady, things heat up between them... and so on, the events unfold in that order. Do these events really sound disjointed, or fragmented? Do they make sense, or are they incoherent? C'mon...<br/><br/>""This is a dull, painful and hopelessly dreadful film from nearly every point of view that caters either to adolescents or to the basest elements. How vulgar language, rubber penises, vomit and racist jokes pass for comedy is beyond me.""<br/><br/>The content of this movie is immature at times, but it contains genuine feelings over a problem some face. What's wrong with exploiting it in humorous situations ? I've met friends in their 30s and 40s who still found this movie hilarious, so this brand of humor isn't necessarily bound to one age group; why when someone doesn't get a joke make up the idea that teenagers or college-aged students are more gullible and should find it appealing is beyond *me*. <br/><br/>Also, I'm sick of foreigners bashing it because it's ""American Comedy"". You don't see me complaining about the BBC making some very bizarre comedy that I think only the British or others can completely understand, because that is my loss. <br/><br/>So please, if you haven't already, check out this great movie not avoid it because you can't stand a little immaturity."

","Steve Carell is a funny guy. Who could ever forget his anchorman schtick on ""Bruce Almighty""? But here he plays Andy Stitzer, a 40-year-old guy in a little boy's psyche, still collecting action figures in their original boxes, ""because they are more valuable that way."" Not owning a car but riding a bicycle. And, by the way, he is still a virgin. This movie tries too hard to be frank and shocking in its language and sexual references, some involving a woman having sex with a horse. Most of it comes off as NOT funny, but just distasteful. His acting style here could easily be swapped for Ben Stiller in any of Stiller's movies. I definitely would not recommend this movie to any of my friends. I put it in the same category as another similar failed attempt, ""Ron Burgundy Anchorman."" <br/><br/>So, most of the story involves Andy's friends and co-workers trying to help him get laid. But Andy seems to have a genuine streak that makes him reluctant for casual sex just because. He meets Trish (Catherine Keener) who has a small shop across the street from Andy's work, and she shows an interest in nice guy Andy.<br/><br/>SPOILERS. In a totally predictable set of events, Andy and Trish come very close to sex, they agree to postpone it for 20 dates to get to know each other, then she finds out he is a virgin, they argue and split very briefly, he chases her on his bicycle, he crashes, she comforts him, they end up in bed, his virginity smashes, they get married in the end."

"Skaddiction","3","10","21","17 December 2005"," Why God, why?
","Today's Topic - The Horror That is the Cinematic Travesty that is The 40-Year-Old Virgin.<br/><br/>I saw this movie recently. I was intrigued. In out modern society it seems less likely than ever that a 40-Year-Old (40YO) could not have had sex, but the possibility is still there. I wondered if this movie had the potential to tackle a serious issue; is it possible for a person to not have sex. The argument is made constantly that sex is a part of our being, that we are animals and that's how we were made. I have problems with this. One being the idea that my significance in this world is no more than my cat's. I know I am further developed than my cat, but if my reason to reproduce doesn't run any deeper than ""I was programmed to"" then what's my purpose. This heads into some deeper philosophy I don't know how to address, so we'll move on.<br/><br/>I go to see the movie (at a dollar theater mind you. and on 50 cent Tuesdays. please don't begin to think I was about to blow 7 dollars on this...) and my question is answered immediately. From square one, the movie operates under the premise that if you don't have sex, you remain socially awkward and inadequate until you do. I can see this as a possibility, but only because it is possible to remain abstinent, and be socially awkward simultaneously, not because one implies the other.<br/><br/>The movie continues in this vein. A 15 minute set up for a joke that probably functions off the socially dictated humor of hilarity through vulgarity. There is, however, a spot in my ""humor heart"" for vulgar humor. The occasional dirty joke will amuse me, sometimes more than it should. The 40YOV succeeded not. At no time did I feel the set up for a joke was worth it. The joke never became so funny that we forgot about the stupidity we tolerated for 15 minutes to get there.<br/><br/>Relationships form throughout the film, but we never see them develop. As his friends try to do their best to help him finally get laid (as if he hasn't tried in his 40year-old life) they being to learn life lessons from this unexpected source. I know, how is it that a person who has never had sex have any wisdom in relationships? How could this be? Isn't all knowledge learned through intercourse? No wonder I've been so confused for this first 20 years... I better have sex soon, otherwise I'll never graduate.<br/><br/>As I was discussing this movie with others, which was possibly the most immature conversation about film I've ever had, I was blown away to find that they actually liked it. I don't want to be misquoted but I distinctly remember the words, ""awesome"", ""hilarious"", and ""sooooo funny"" being brought up. I was learned though...<br/><br/>I asked them, what's the point? ""There is no point"", they said. ""It's like trying to find meaning in something that doesn't have meaning."" Normally I would accept this as a valid argument, but it's not. There was meaning in this film. The direction deliberately put in ""moments"". Looks that characters would have, realizations they would vocalize, etc. There was a point to the film, but the film itself refused to recognize it. The film ended in an irrelevant song and dance, not addressing any of the issues that they brought up through out the pointless two hours prior.<br/><br/>I also had serious issues with how the film addressed the serious issues. Not having sex is a huge decision. Some people, like myself, choose to live a sexless life (at least not until I am married, which may never be) and although I was not offended by their addressing of the lifestyle, some others may be. Offendeness set aside, I felt very awkward at some moments. The camera was in the room when he and his new wife were consummating their marriage... ::shudder:: ... 'nuff said.<br/><br/>I'm done ranting now. No one will read this, but I can't believe that this movie was made. It's absolutely terrible, the humor (in every brand) is unjustified and mundane, and the producers of the film thought they were the funniest people on earth.... Which, by the way, is a vile lie.<br/><br/>If you feel robbed by this shoddy ending to what may have started out to be a decent review, then you have a rough idea of what it feels like to sit through this movie and feel robbed of not only your money, but your time and mental health."

","A subplot of this movie is that the 40 year old virgin hoards plastic action figures at his home, which he never unpacks. Just like his action figures, he needs someone to ""unpack"": have sex and grow up. But that never really happens, because the other characters are just as much stuck in their plastic packaging. The advice of the virgin's ""buddies"" -- who are not friends but work colleagues from an electronics store -- makes you wonder who really needs to grow up, the virgin or them. So the morale of this movie seems to be that, even if you remove the packaging, the figure is still as dead as plastic. All of this could have been funny if it wasn't so desperate and depressing."

You got to reduce your standards a little bit to enjoy this movie, well a lot, not just a little bit.

I mean, come on! Blabbing Andy's card-game confession to the rest of the store's personnel? Nowhere, in real-life, would Dave, Cal, and Jay have had ANY right to do that! And, if they were really his friends, they wouldn't have even THOUGHT of doing it, in the first place!<br/><br/>Then, there's the scene where Dave--still drunk after some kind of big matchmaking luncheon, where he ran into an ex-girlfriend--starts videotaping his anatomy, front and back, from the waist down. RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STORE, DURING BUSINESS HOURS!!! And, all the female boss does is send him home for the rest of the day? Nah-uh! If I'd been that boss, the real-life remedy would have had a lot more permanence. <br/><br/>But, the last straw, for me, was that stupid soft-spoken argument between Trish and the dorky fat kid over a pair of tin-foil disco boots with goldfish in the water-filled glass soles. Something along the lines of, ""I know your stuff is just an exhibit for what you sell on Ebay. But, since I'm already here, anyway, why I can't just buy them, right now?"" That did it! I went to the men's room, and flipped a coin. Heads; I would return to my seat, and literally suffer through the rest of it. Or, tails; I'd go to the neighboring town of Winsted and see Disney/Vanguard's ""Valiant."" Obviously, it came up tails. <br/><br/>In short: if it's a choice between remaining a virgin you're whole life; and finally getting some action, via the dubious help of alleged friends like Dave, Cal, and Jay, then I say...<br/><br/>BETTER NEVER THAN LATE!"

It's natural audience, I suspect, is horny teenage boys and those cheerleading, sentimentally romantic older critics eager at any cost for Hollywood this bad year to have a megahit. Scriptwriters Apatow and Carell appear to have had their comedic minds violated by a single idea, the notion of the necessary side-splitting hilariousness of a 40-year-old virgin and his buddies whose role it is to help him have first-time sex. Crude encounters and consistently crude language wholly lacking in requisite Aristophanic wit are certain to enrapture at least the aforementioned teenage boys. Two hours of this stuff for many other age groups turns the film into a hackwork exercise of non-incremental repetition. In a late effort, though, to please everyone, the scriptwriters shamelessly turn from gross farce to unlikely, essentially sentimental romance, combining jarring, disparate levels of reality in just the clumsy fashion of the comedic poetasters of old.

And yes, I loved Wedding Crashers too.<br/><br/>Like that Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson laugh fest, the movie is rated R and thank God they're making a comeback after way too many PG-13 stuff. Rob Schneider's Deuce Bigalow: European Gigolo didn't make money but at least it made great use of its rating, and Apatow and Carell do too.<br/><br/>Carell stars in the as Andy, a middle age electronics store clerk who's never had sex. Ever. He tried when he was younger, but after some disastrous attempts he just gave up. It was less humiliating to just forget about it than to keep his hopes up that it may actually happen one day. So he now runs from women and spends his nights watching Survivor with his old neighbor, playing online video games or playing with his many, many toys. He also never learned how to drive a car so he drives a bicycle to work everyday. Paul Rudd (Brian Fantana in Anchorman), Romany Malco and Seth Rogen (he's been in everything Apatow) costar as Andy's coworkers who find out about his situation. How they find out is great, during a night of poker they are telling each other's sex stories and when it's Andy's turn he gives one of the most pathetic tales ever told, and they quickly catch that he's a virgin. They love it though, and decide it's their new job to get him laid. Of course, they tell everybody they know about it.<br/><br/>I won't give out the rest of the story away because there are lots of hilarious situations including a kinky library worker from next door played by Elizabeth Banks, Katherine Keener is also there as Andy's potential love interest Trish (don't worry, the love story doesn't get cheesy) and there's also David Koechner (Anchorman's Champ) who shows up for a scene in which Andy takes Trish's daughter to a sex clinic of some kind for kids who have answers about sex, and it ends up with Andy asking more questions than her.<br/><br/>But one of the absolutely funniest scenes ever is the waxing scene shown briefly in the trailer. You could tell that it was all real pain because his screams were so authentic and you could see it in the other actors' faces that they were not in character, they were really laughing at the situation. And then the blood on his chest. It was really great.<br/><br/>Apatow is a genius and he knows how to write comedy. The situations in the movie are real and the dialogue is hard core, and at times it sounds like it's too much, but is not, that's what those characters would say in those situations. And lots of stuff besides the waxing scene was improvised and so everything looks very natural and so the laughs are truly non-stop. Steve Carell almost stole the show in Anchorman, rules The Office and after this role, he's sure join the elite group of movie comics that Will Ferrell currently tops. Sadly, Ferrell doesn't make an appearance here so there's no Channel 4 News Team reunion but the movie doesn't need it, because again, The 40 Year Old Virgin is the Best Comedy of the Year."
"wkmetzgar","1","14","33","29 October 2005"," Truly one of the worst movies I've seen
","I was embarrassed by the movie's first 1/2 which should have taken place in some 16 year old boys' basements, not 30 something grown men. It was really ridiculous. Steve is very very funny, but the director or producers should have worked to make it a more likable movie. Catherine Keener...now that's a different subject. She was fantastic! I'd love to have lost it to her. How the same actress from Being John Malcovich could have been drawn in to this is baffling. And what was up with the ""Dawning of Aquarius"" dance sequence at the end? Had they found some film left over and needed to shoot it so it wouldn't go to waste? Too bad..they wasted it anyways. They could've saved the day by providing out-takes instead."
"MidnightWarrior","1","10","22","22 December 2005"," The ending ruined the film.
","No, I'm not going to tell you the ending. Although I will say that the ending really killed the essence of what was a pretty good film right up to the part where Andy is about to join Beth in the bathtub. Everything that happens after the Beth bath part pretty much destroys all that you've seen happen in this film. Allow me to back-track.<br/><br/>Meet Andy, the 40 year old virgin; you cannot, not help but feel sorry for the poor fellow who's never had sex in his life - ever. And then meet Andy's social circle - his four male friends and the women Andy tries to woo and who try to woo him.<br/><br/>Clearly the scriptwriters do a fantastic job of letting us know who to like and who not to like; every character seems well defined up to that one place mentioned above, and then all hell breaks loose.<br/><br/>We like Andy's four friends who want his friend to have sex with any female that breathes. We don't like the drunk blonde Andy rides home with who vomits in his mouth and on his face. Nor do we like the transvestite, the older horny lady who manages the store and wants to badly screw Andy on the side, or Trish (his girlfriend). <br/><br/>There's this one girl, Beth, who we really like. We like her because she's young and downright sexy. In her world, Andy's not a loser, but one hell of a stud.<br/><br/>The scriptwriters lay out three instances that show us the mean and psychotic side of Trish which convinced me that she was not right for Andy: a) the whole telemarketer phone-call scene (she's brutal!), b) the scene in which Andy grows some testicles and rightfully confronts Trish about how she's trying to change him into something that he doesn't want to become and c) she's a freaking grandma, for crying out loud - three children and one who has a child.<br/><br/>When Andy and she fight, her lame response is something to the extent of, ""I'm trying to help you grow up."" Ha! Typical woman, trying to change a man. Sheesh. Isn't it enough that she was already withholding sex from him for 20 dates? And now she's trying to manipulate him into becoming something she wants? Ugh!<br/><br/>Emotionally, I was standing behind Andy when he told her off, got smashed and found his way into the Beth's bathroom. I was rooting for him to get laid by the sexy Beth who worships him. Why? Because being a 40 year old virgin entitles him to get laid by a single, young babe who's desirous of him. Not some 55 year old grandma who's given birth to three children, had sex too many times and doesn't want to have sex.<br/><br/>Now that you understand where I'm coming from, you'll see that after Andy's friends burst in during the bathtub scene, everything you learned about the characters changes a complete 360 degrees! Well, all of Andy's friends now ""wisen up"", tell Andy that he needs to stick with the woman he loves (who saw this one coming??), and stop him from joining Beth in the bathtub (WTF???).<br/><br/>Not only that, but then Andy loses his balls and tells the guys that, ""I don't know who I've become."" Of course he leaves Beth and then the film goes downhill from there. If you do see it, I hope you realize that the ending is so very gay.<br/><br/>I almost forgot, the nudity (brief, though shown in multiple scenes) is tasteless and out of place. For these reasons, I give the film 1 (awful) out of 10 stars."

","I am reminded of that old punk song ""..I'd rather cut my wrists and slash my throat, than spend the night with you..."" I am begging you not to see this. <br/><br/>I did not laugh even once. And after all the hype and positive reviews, I am truly dumbfounded. Look, I like Beavis & Butthead as much as the next piXel, but I have a feeling I know what they might say about this. So do you.<br/><br/>If you are 18-25 and want some doody humor, get something good like early John Waters. As for the ""sex comedy"" aspect, stick to ""Green Acres."" This has to be some kind of calculated lowest common denominator appeal to the most amount of willingly wasted cash. More ""sack on chin"" humor? Why? As for the story, you'd have to suspend your disbelief in the value of your time and money to buy any of this nonsense.<br/><br/>Unless you want to fund future Carrell projects, and I have a feeling that would be a worthy cause, go elsewhere. Better yet, just send him the money directly and don't waste your time. He will be doing something much better than this I'm sure. I hope he brings his buddies from Ron Burgundy along, i.e., Messrs. ""Whammy,"" and ""Sex Panther."" Now that was a stupid movie, but it was also 9/10 hilarious watch it over & over funny. If you liked that, you'll hate this. <br/><br/>Howwever, I thought Elizabeth Banks was very good. There was some sex appeal going on there, no doubt. Plus, her character seemed pretty real to me. I might've been married to her once. I liked Romany Malco too.<br/><br/>Still, it didn't gel. Maybe its me. But if you are reading this because you can't believe what you just saw, you are not alone.<br/><br/>Here's a plot question that does not contain a spoiler: why didn't the kindly, old couple upstairs neglect to ""get it on"" to Barry White or something? Now THAT might've been funny.<br/><br/>Run, don't walk away from this delight."
"julioecolon","1","7","14","19 August 2006"," Wilting at the stem.
","I rented this with some reservations and now realize that I should have listened to my gut. There's something fundamentally creepy in the premise of this film: guy-friends so concerned about another guy-friend's virginity that they engage in an all out crusade to get his cherry popped. One hackneyed joke follows another, and there are countless moronic high jinks along the way as the characters trample on positive constructions of women's sexuality, exploit the male adolescent fear of being called gay, and dismiss the possible virtues of celibacy and the single life. This leaves us, ultimately, with very few genuinely funny moments. Good comedy doesn't require such sophomoric antics."
"davideo-2","4","7","14","9 September 2005"," One long tasteless joke and not a very funny one
","STAR RATING: ***** The Works **** Just Misses the Mark *** That Little Bit In Between ** Lagging Behind * The Pits <br/><br/>The gross-out comedy looks like it will strike another hit with The 40 Year Old Virgin, as well as make a big star out of Steve Carrell, waiting for his big break after supporting roles in films such as Anchorman and Bruce Almighty.<br/><br/>He plays Andy Stitzer. Andy works in an electronics store. He fits in with his work colleagues, does his job well and doesn't stand out that much other than his funny dress sense, the fact he rides a bike to work and his virginal qualities that his mates have started to notice. When his 'shameful' secret is revealed, the mates go to extreme lengths to get him to pop his cherry, but as events roll on, Andy discovers it's best to just let life roll on as it will and let things happen in the natural scheme of things, as he develops a relationship with a woman who is set to become a grand-mother at roughly the same age as him.<br/><br/>The film is too long. This might not have been such a problem had the film had more of a sentimental edge to it, a la Mrs Doubtfire, but it entertains it's near-the-knuckle laughs side a bit too much to really make it this way. That's not to mention the NTK laughs that actually cross the boundary into tastelessness, i.e. the drink driving scene with the woman with her own breathalyser and Andy in the car, which the many families of DD victims might want to complain about. You could argue the whole film is like this, but, that's your opinion. Successfully, I found the film to be rarely funny, extremely funny when it is but not that often.<br/><br/>It may have just caught me on a bad day and Carrell does have what seems to be a promising future as a leading man in comedies, but the impression I've initially come away with isn't much of a good one. **"
"Cassiopea_Fay","3","5","9","18 December 2009"," Crap.
","This movie is unfunny, immature, stereotypical, rude, and consists of a lot of unnecessary yelling and swearing. What was so funny about the constant fights?<br/><br/>And it really makes people who actually choose to be virgins look like complete losers. And the topic of sex is completely everywhere, in an non-amusing sort of way. Bad jokes, and really poor/uninteresting characters. <br/><br/>Honestly, the intelligent person would never enjoy such a silly movie. But I guess that speaks a lot for many audiences who do enjoy it.<br/><br/>I honestly thought that perhaps it could of been a cute movie - but no, it really is an immature event."
"Danusha_Goska","5","5","9","2 January 2006"," Too Gross for Me; Very Good Carrell
","""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" Too gross for me, but the audience loved it.<br/><br/>Reviews, articles, and even an interview on Terry Gross' ""Fresh Air"" lead me to believe that this movie was a tad more adult than it is.<br/><br/>In fact it is a gross-out, teen-boy comedy. It opens with a graphic description of a stage show involving a horse and a Mexican girl, probably a sex slave.<br/><br/>It includes graphic scenes of vomit and urine being splashed in the main character's face.<br/><br/>Women's bodies are major sources of humor, with punchlines like, ""Don't put (vulgar term for women) on a pedestal,"" and visual gags like a woman's breast coming out of her shirt, with the completely unlikely result that she is unaware of it and fails to cover it up.<br/><br/>All the male characters, no matter their chronological age, are boys. There is a lengthy scene where two unattractive men (what happened to the cute, young Paul Rudd of ""Clueless""? Is he already fat and balding?) play violent video games while making homophobic ""jokes."" As in all the teen boy gross out comedies, from ""Jay and Silent Bob Strike Back"" to ""Wedding Crashers,"" though these boys are terrified of homosexuals, the only ""love"" they are capable of feeling is for other men.<br/><br/>The audience I was with loved this movie. They laughed out loud in several spots; there was much more laughter than in any movie I've seen in a while -- certainly more than at ""Wedding Crashers."" Steve Carrell was wonderful. ""The Daily Show"" didn't prepare me for how much movie star charisma he has. The scene where his chest hair is removed is an instant classic, and will become a kinky favorite among some fetishists, I'm sure.<br/><br/>Otherwise, though ... I wasn't ready for a gross-out, teen boy, woman-hating movie, and this one left me feeling icky.<br/><br/>I hope to see Carrell in something a bit more grown-up and classy someday."
"aclaus225-2","10","5","9","19 August 2005"," Pretty Good movie
","This movie was one of the best movies that I have seen this year. I didn't see any cameos in the movie, but it is still pretty good. It is similar to Anchorman in the humor department, but I think this is a better put together movie. It actually has a point. If you are going to see a whole bunch of T&A you will be disappointed. Just a well put together movie!!!! If you have nothing to do for the day or you need a lot of humor, you will find this to be a really good movie. I definitely think that Ebert and Roeper's review of this movie is right on. I mean, I don't really like Ebert on most movies, but this is the movie that I will agree about. The movie contains a good enough story that it is actually believable that these type of people are out there. There is definitely something to be said about how they treat virginity in this movie. Yea, sure, you get laughed at when it is found out about, but it still suggests that you wait. Steve did a wonderful job of portraying the person that he did in this movie and yet, it is still funny."
"bfreilly","2","8","17","3 February 2006"," Um... am I supposed to laugh here?
","Since I read Roger Ebert's review of this film, I had been looking forward to it with gusto. It seemed just the sort of humor I could kick back and enjoy without having to tax my brain that much. Finally, just yesterday, I managed to see it on DVD.<br/><br/>Immediately, I could see that I had made a mistake. Throughout the film I found myself continuously glancing at my watch and the time on the DVD readout, wondering how long this movie could go on. I chuckled perhaps twice, but spent most of the time just going, ""Huh. Okay."" Despite what the critics and my friends had told me about the movie, I never really felt entertained. Eventually, I gave up and turned off the movie half-way through.<br/><br/>This movie tries to be another ""American Pie"" by ratcheting up the immaturity and sex jokes to a new level. The result is just sort of a messy, one-joke car wreck of a film that demands its audience laugh at the cheesy quips thrown out every thirty seconds or so. Sure, there are a couple of funny moments scattered here and there, but otherwise it's just a broken record: ""Ha, that is funny. He's so awkward with women. Ha ha ha."" If you must find a immature movie to watch right now, go back to ""American Pie""."
"anhedonia","1","9","20","5 December 2005"," So this is what passes for comedy these days?
","The trouble with watching ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is that you know Steve Carell is so much better than the awful material in this film. Because I've seen him be much funnier on ""The Daily Show with Jon Stewart."" Then again, he was working with some of the funniest writers on TV on that show and had the luxury of playing alongside the likes of Rob Corddry, Stephen Colbert and my pick for the funniest woman in America, Samantha Bee.<br/><br/>What's most surprising about ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is that it was co-written by Carell. It's the reason I went to see the film. And what a tremendous disappointment it turned out to be.<br/><br/>Critics gushing over this film and tossing accolades at it must so starved of good, genuinely funny comedy, that they quickly to embrace anything with even a modicum of humor. The same critics who thought this year's terrible ""Fever Pitch"" was funny stuff.<br/><br/>But this is a one-joke film and the joke runs out of steam within 10 minutes. And from there on, the writers, Carell and Judd Apatow (who also directed this embarrassment), simply keep regurgitating the same joke over and over and over and over again. Notice how many times the opening visual joke gets played in one form or another throughout the film. It doesn't get funnier simply because you keep playing it again. I don't mind scatological humor, even juvenile laughs. But the jokes need to work. They need to be funny. They just aren't here.<br/><br/>I sat there utterly bewildered during this film, wondering why on earth no one involved in this mess realized the film wasn't all that funny. Yes, it's sweet, at times. It tries to be heartwarming, too. But those things don't necessarily make the film good or funny.<br/><br/>But Carell and Apatow's idea of great humor is to have a man film his derrière or have a couple of chaps toss back and forth why they think the other is gay. The trouble is their put-downs aren't even remotely funny in the least. They're juvenile in the worst manner.<br/><br/>The film is riddled with interminable lulls where the story just doesn't move along. The film's sole saving grace is watching Catherine Keener try to rescue it with her inimitable charm. Unfortunately, she's not working with sub-par material; she's working with execrable material. Frankly, Keener could make the afternoon traffic report on radio sound interesting, and she does a brave, but, ultimately, wasted, attempt at trying to salvage this film.<br/><br/>Wasting a talented actress of Keener's caliber on material like this is a travesty. You want to see Keener in a good film? Watch ""Being John Malkovich"" (1999). Heck, even her small role in the Sydney Pollack political thriller, ""The Interpreter,"" makes for better viewing than this awful picture.<br/><br/>Carell's a funny man. A very funny man. I loved him in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy"" (2004) and his bit in ""Bruce Almighty"" (2003). As he's proved so often, he's good as a supporting player. ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" is his first shot as a leading man. He doesn't make a convincing one. And he won't. Not until he works with stronger, funnier scripts.<br/><br/>This purported comedy not only doesn't have good laughs, it's also an utter bore."

","NOT WORTH THE WAIT...a review for The 40 yr. old Virgin<br/><br/>The 40 yr. old Virgin Universal 2005 Color 116 mins. Comedy Steve Carrell, Catherine Keneer, Paul Rudd, Elizabeth Banks and Kat Dennings star. Written by Judd Apatow and Steve Carrell Directed by Judd Apatow Rated R for raunchy language,sexuality, nudity, drug use and vulgar toilet humor. After a few good reviews and some once trusted recommendations I persuaded myself to attend a mid afternoon screening of the late summer comedy hit the 40 yr. old virgin. I went with my very good friend Melanie who can make anything into a good time. Despite the trailer making it look somewhat entertaining I just got a bad feeling about it and decided to skip it and see Red Eye a few more times. Boy was I right! Joining the ranks of other uncomfortable comedies such as The American Pie trilogy, The Meet the Parents films and The Analyze This films among others. Now don't get me wrong this is not a wretched review for this film. it's not a bad film it's just far from being a good one. Steve Carrell of Anchorman fame stars as Andy Stitzer. A homebody, sweetheart of a guy whose a 40 yr. old virgin. he spends his time working as the stock manager at a electronics store, collecting toys, doing solo karaoke, reading comic books and riding his bike. He tries his best not to interact with very many people especially the opposite sex. Than one night when the guys are short one for poker. They invite him along and discover his big secret. Immediately becoming alarmed they decide to take action and influence him to loose his virginity as quickly as possible. Crude situations follow. And this film is crude. Thats mainly the reason why it exists. The depiction of virginity, women, sexual intercourse and humanity are all degraded to the fullest. And not with a winking eye or guilty chuckle but with a devilish stare none the less. Carrells characters is put through one humiliating situation after another. Now I never get offended and when I do there is good reason. I know people like the title character and although I myself am not a virgin I do hold their decisions in high regard. And I would never endorse anything that exploits that, especially for trashy, mindless humor. To assume that you can take an individuals physical awkwardness towards their sexual awakening personally insults me. And than to handle it's touchy subject matter so shamelessly and carelessly with not a speck of originality or intelligence. The film packs it's sluggishly paced 2 hours with raunchy language, ridiculously drawn life lessons, nauseating bathroom humor and immature revelations. Add that with a particularly lame chemistry free romance between the underused Keneer and Carrell and the finished product is one of regret. Although not a total waste of film Carrell's performance is one of comedic promise still and he must search for a better comedic vehicle.Despite all the film's problems there are a few gags that still inspire a giggle or two. But in the end the 40 yr. old Virgin is just a mediocre lay a grouping of wasted potential. What could've been a heartfelt, hilarious little comedy. ends up being an immature, chauvinistic romp that lacks any real conviction in it's subject matter and the laugh department. My suggestion is if you must wait for DVD and catch The Wedding Crashers again cause this film just ain't worth the wait. ** (out of five)"

","The 40 year old virgin is a film for college guys. This film encompassed every perverted joke that the male college mind can think of. It had sex,of course, and perverted jokes sprinkled all around. The guys in the theater had tears coming from their eyes at times. The chest wax was the only part I could laugh at without feeling like an average college guy. Every movie has its flaws and this film had plenty. I could not imagine looking at this screenplay without thinking 'what a sick mind'. BUT, it kept the audience laughing and definitely got it's purpose, butts in the seats. All in all the film was not that impressive, though tickets are being sold and people are laughing."
"Boggman","10","6","12","23 August 2005"," The funniest film of the summer!
","""The 40yr Old Virgin"" emerges not only as 2005's best summer comedy, but probably the best comedy of the year! This is one crowd pleasing, feel good movie that starts off with a laugh, and ends with one too. Steve Carell does a magnificent job of bringing Andy Stitzer to life. Whether YOUR a virgin or not, there is a little bit of Andy in all of us. Andy is a great comedic triumph for Carrell, considering it's such a departure from his shovanistic ego-centric Michael on the NBS hit comedy ""The Office"".<br/><br/>The plot is simple: 3 of Andy's coworkers find out over a game of poker and some sex swapping stories that Andy is a virgin and set out to make a man out of him once and for all! Nuff said.<br/><br/>What ensues is Andy learning the masterful art of picking up woman, making friends (which he doesn't seem to have to many of), dealing with the fact that everyone at work knows about his non existent sex life, and learning to fall in love.<br/><br/>This movie has so many laughs it would be a shame to list them here. The chest/waxing scene emerges as pretty darn funny- and there is a lot more to it than what you get on the commercial previews. This is also a great buddy movie that paints an honest/relatable portrait of friends, new romances, and workplace relationships. It's just a funny frieken movie all the way around!! This film is a masterpiece. It really is. You definitely will laugh your A*S off!! Worth the price of admission and more! Forget the rest of this summer's ""so called"" comedies because ""The 40yr Old Virgin"" trounces them all!!! VERY HIGHLY Recommended!"

","i got the DVD of this movie very recently hoping for a outrageous farce like 'death at a funeral' or ' the heartbreak kid' . sorry but do not think it should be talked about in same breath. the genre is a bit more of the rom com (romantic comedy )variety .<br/><br/>it is more a heartwarming movie in which the protagonist is looking for - and is in the process of getting- his true love. the fact that he is also a 40 year old virgin seems incidental. of course the team of horny/love lorn co workers get into the act of helping our man get some action.this results in some smarmy dialogue with verbal banter bonding the boys. its got a mild smattering of outrageous humour thrown in for measure. don't get me wrong it is not a bad movie but watch it if you are in the mood for a sentimental romantic comedy with a happy ending and bits of funny stuff . <br/><br/>as an aside - the interactions between the Asian and the African American character seemed a bit forced to me.<br/><br/>i guess it depends on what you are in the mood for. i repeat good if you like this kind of sugar and spice .<br/><br/>6 on 10 from me."

","One of the worst wastes of film, money and time in the history of cinema. I am only glad that I didn't see this in a theater and waste my money in it only to be associated with it in any way. From the promotions you'd think it was a light-hearted comedy. There is nothing light-hearted (the only thing light about this movie is the amount of brain matter in the skulls of the so-called writers) or funny about this trash. From the start it is a matter of endurance to see how many filthy, obscene or embarrassing phrases, words or images can be thrown at the unsuspecting audience for absolutely no reason as if not being a virgin means you are a demented pervert with a proclivity for spouting every vulgar word known to humanity.<br/><br/>You should not only never see this trash, you should take pains to make sure no one you know ever sees it and that your local stores and rental spots don't stock it.<br/><br/>I fear for the future of humanity when I read rave reviews (including a professional critic who one hopes only recommended this garbage as a result of a disabling stroke) for this dreck.<br/><br/>I only saw this movie (and was actually looking forward to it) because I am a big fan of ""The Office."" Now I may never be able to watch or enjoy ""The Office"" again because of having images of this trash.<br/><br/>To be honest, I put a ""spoiler warning"" on this review just in case but could not stand sitting through it (even at home) to see how it (mercifully)ends. But if the trivia section is true that Carrell literally had his chest hairs pulled out during the making of this film it could never approach the painfulness of sitting through it."
"rogergoldsmith2","4","7","15","29 August 2005"," Grossly OTT
","Given the premise I thought the film could and should have been much better. Yes, if you cut through the unlikely attention given to Andy's virginal state by all and sundry, the number of women who were attracted to him, not least his Boss at the TV store, his unlikely stance and manner when addressing the babe in the book shop, there was a core story of real substance and meaning. It's not good enough to suggest that sex had just 'passed him by' when he was a good looking, healthy male specimen. For me the piece was played like a farce, and looked for laughs, when a little more depth and subtlety could have given us so much more. Plus it was too long by half an hour. All those meaningless conversations by Andy's 'buddies'. Just not necessary. If more time had been spent on developing Andy as a character' if we had 'seen' more of the guy maybe in flashbacks, in situations, resulting in his state, it would have made his final triumph that more satisfying."

","In a summer of terrible films (Stealth, Dukes of Hazzard, etc) along comes the 40 year old virgin. About 10 minutes into the film I had the feeling that the script was written by a couple of 16 year olds.<br/><br/>When did a huge amount of cursing become the basis for a movie to be funny? Don't get me wrong - I myself use the F word a lot, but this film tries to pull of jokes, which when they fall flat, are accentuated by a slew of cursing.<br/><br/>The movie plays like a 5 minute story synopsis dragged out over two hours. In the case of the Wedding Crashers, two hours seemed to be almost too long for the film to run. In the case of the 40 year old virgin, 2 hours feels like an eternity....<br/><br/>Predictable, overlong, and lacking the courage to really take things to the next level, this film was obviously rated R for the amount of foul language, since there's barely any nudity in the film....<br/><br/>It's painfully obvious that the film will have the ever so popular unrated tag when it comes to DVD and hopefully that will enable them to actually take some chances the theatrical version didn't. <br/><br/>All in all - I felt cheated by this film, which had promise, but just seemed content to go only so far, falling short of what could have made for some truly funny situations. Padding the film out with the silly side stories simply made the picture drag on too long....<br/><br/>Definitely one that you can wait for DVD.<br/><br/>Addendum: After seeing it on DVD in it's unrated version I have a new appreciation for the film and therefore rank it higher now."

","I watched this movie full of expectation having enjoyed Anchorman, Old School etc. but was totally let down!! Don't get me wrong - I wasn't expecting a 'highbrow' comedy, but this movie just wasn't at all funny - bar the odd amusement, such as the chest waxing scene which was perhaps due to the fact that the expression on Steve Carells face was real.<br/><br/>This movie would have perhaps been a lot more amusing had I consumed 8 pints of beer before entering the cinema - but I actually found it a chore to sit through the full 116mins of this film. Maybe I just wasn't in the mood, but a good comedy should be able to generate that mood, and having failed to do so, I can only conclude that this is not a good comedy..."

","What I hated most about this movie was the stereotyping of what a grown man who's never done it before would be like. Steve Carrol looks like a 10-year-old kid on the front cover of this movie. In the movie, it's no doubt that he's nerdy, and socially backward. There is absolutely no correlation between virginity and being a socially backward klutz.<br/><br/>I would have liked this movie better if the 40-year-old virgin would have been a doctor who runs a successful practice (having to answer patient's sexually-related questions would have been humorous!) He lives in a classy condo that looks like something that a 40-year-old professional would live in (without action figure toys and posters all over the place), and he drives a BMW or a Mercedes to work, rather than a bike. Everything's going well in his life, except for one thing - he's never had sex."

","This movie was so funny. I just got out of a sneak peak (where they had goons outside checking EVERYONE for camera phones and making them put them in their car), and I could not stop laughing. Steve Carell's impeccable timing and almost missable subtle actions were absolutely perfect. The supporting cast was also perfect, especially Seth Rogen(Cal), who will definitely be getting some exposure from this. The banter was awesome, it didn't drag at all, and didn't lose you for a second. The plot was pretty outrageous but you totally bought it with the awesome performances by the cast. I'm actually surprised it passed the R rating standards as there is a LOT of bad stuff in there. This is the new Old School!"

I was worried that it would be puerile or lame. Yes, there's some low comedy here but there is also so much more brilliant set-up and amazing pay-off. This is an ensemble effort that builds a joke giggle-by-giggle to horse-laughing finish. I've never been in a room full of so many laughing people.

","Dreadful 'sex' comedy that only the most repressed among us could find shocking. It's like being stuck on a bus with a bunch of fourteen year-olds. The plot makes no sense (they come after hours to play cards at the Best Buy-like electronics store where they work? And there are no security guards?) and the tone is set right at the top by a simple-minded sight-gag having to do with a morning erection. This is followed by Steve Carrel having trouble peeing, which is an OK idea till one remembers that you can't pee with an erection. That's the reason we have them in the morning. And so on. I only lasted about 20 minutes before the witlessness got too much for me. To judge from this, Steve Carrel doesn't have a funny bone in his body.<br/><br/>Compare this amateurish bilge with a real sex comedy like The Closet and you'll see what's missing. Talent."

","THIS MOVIE WAS BAD! The script was amateur and the acting by Carel was poor and uneven. Steve Carel is great in, The Office TV series. But, in 40 year Old Virgin, he was uncharismatic and uneven. There was no ""ring of truth"" to the performances any of the characters or the story-line, which was as hackneyed as it could possibly be. There were, of course, at least a few funny moments (jokes that worked) and a few laughs. The attempted ethnic humor was quite heavy hitting and simply trite, not funny. It came off as racist without any of the requisite humor to justify it. The director must be largely to blame for this film's failures, but the script did not give him much to work with. It seemed an amateur attempt at best.<br/><br/>The oddest thing to me is that it is a huge financial success and in being so, there is no incentive to not make crappy unfunny movies of this kind.<br/><br/>Adam Sandler's movies are often guilty of some of these same short comings but at least he can be genuinely funny and you can like and sympathize with his characters enough to forgive the poor script and direction. The 40 year Old Virgin has none of the charm of an Adam Sandler film and all of the short comings.<br/><br/>This is one to miss.

","This movie is funny. This movie is very funny. In fact, this movie is so funny, that it would break the most intelligent computer that tried to count exactly how many HUGE laughs were in it. Steve Carell stole a major scene in Bruce Almighty, played a hilariously random retard in Anchorman, and now, he finally gets a big break in The 40 Year Old Virgin, which recently beat Wedding Crashers as what I consider the funniest comedy of the 2000's.<br/><br/>You can guess what the movie's about. Andy is 40, and he's a virgin. He has a major toy collection, a good job, and is just an all-out nice guy. He's just so hopelessly nerdy, that he has never succeeded with girls. When his friends find out about his celibate life, they set out to help him lose his virginity. They recommend that he hit on the most drunk woman he can find, but Andy doesn't think it's right. He sets his sights on a single mother, Trish, and when they start going out, Andy's friends are proud that he's going to finally do it. But Andy doesn't care about sex. He and Trish form a no-sex policy.<br/><br/>This movie while fall-down, flat-out hysterical has it's share of drama. It's actually got a good message, that says you can wait to have sex for as long as you think is necessary. There are some fairly serious moments. The trailers make it look like a dumb, vulgar, and random sex- comedy. But it's not dumb. It's actually so intelligent, that some people may not find it funny. But I sure did. The waxing scene, and the poker game are my favorites. Also, this movie is FILTHY. Sex dominates every scene, and even when it's not actually happening, it's being discussed in the most graphic terms imaginable. The profanity is non-stop as well. It was however to see some good R rated comedies lately, and I hope for more to come. This movie was so funny, it's hard to believe a movie can actually be this funny. 10/10.<br/><br/>It is rated R for Pervasive Sexual Content, Language, and some Drug Use.

His writing on The Daily Show was always a high point for me. <br/><br/>A hidden gem of both writing and acting was the actor who played the little Indian man with some considerable ""street skills"".

","I'm not in on the buzz on this film. It's too low-brow to be much fun, and everyone in it--from the main character to passing extras--have one driving force: their genitals. Now, sex comedies can be good, provided there are some non-sexual sub-plots (even ""Porky's"" had some political intrigue, however lame, to relieve the pressure), but ""Virgin"" just keeps going and going, with no light at the end of the tunnel. Even 90% of the SIGHT gags are sexual! Steve Carrell plays the ""Virgin"" in the title, and finds himself being ""coached"" through the art of the pick-up by his libidinous, juvenile co-workers. He fails repeatedly but, in the end, finds true love. And sex. And apparent happiness. The implication that love, sex and happiness are all tied up in the same bundle is insulting and dumb. Does celibacy necessarily mean misery? Don't tell the Dalai Lama! So if you'd find 2 hours of sex jokes funny--with plenty of the ""P"" word to savor--then this is the film for you. If you have a library card (and a sober brain), maybe you should consider skipping it. I give it a D.<br/><br/>Things to look for: locked in with porn, earth bong, plenty o' weed."
"axopnk","5","5","10","12 January 2006"," Wasn't that good
","You gotta give a hand to Steve carnell and Paul Rudd for trying.Unlike other movies, comedies are usually hard to rate or sum up when there really good (like wedding crashers) but easy to criticize if there bad(like this movie). The movie started out with a good concept, and progressed pretty nicely, but by the middle of the movie, i felt like the comedy just ran too dry. Lets face it, Steve carnell doesn't have the star power or comedy laughter of a will Ferrell, Owen Wilson, Vince Vaughn. He did have his moements, but after a while he seemed whiny and irritating. Paul Rudd tried to help his buddy out and did a pretty good job when it counted but thats only because he acted like he did in anchorman. Otherwise than that, he didn't have much comedy elements to work with (the whole breaking up thing got old kinda quick). Another problem of the movie is the progression, just too slow to get to the end, lets face it, comedies like this should only go about an hour and half or and hour and 45 minutes at best. The movie went way to long, and you knew that when he met ""the one"" that they'd have a big fight. Unfortunately it took to long to get to that fight, which made you think ""why is this movie still going?"". The ending was strange, really really strange. You knew by that point that Steve needed some help, but he didn't get it (whether by the actors themselves, or by him being to independent, i don't know). Probably the biggest shocker and disappointment is the fact that they had no other comedians in the movie. Usually in movies like wedding crashers, when you think the comedy is about to get old, they throw in will Ferrell or some comedian to get you rolling again. This movie desperately needed a will Ferrell, or Vince Vaughn to make a cameo appearance to spice up the movie. Don't get me wrong, this type of comedy has really taken off since zoolander, dodge ball etc. But Steve just couldn't cut it by himself. Overall not that great of a movie."

","So I went to this movie hoping to get a few laughs, and came out of it very disappointed. While I believe Steve Carrell's character was pretty funny, I found his band of misfit friends a headache. I know we're in the 21st century here, and I know cussing is a normal thing. However, saying the f word 500 times in a movie doesn't make it more interesting. In fact, it kind of degrades the script quite a bit. The material was funny, but would have been funnier without the language.<br/><br/>Coming from a woman's point of view, the way his friend's talk about ""pussy"" was quite annoying. I can take a crude joke like the best of them, but again the endless string of comments get tiring after a while. I mean how many times can you say ""you're putting the pussy on a pedestal""? Sadly, I know some guys talk like that and that's pretty pathetic. But seriously, a few ""p"" jokes would have been sufficient enough.<br/><br/>However, the only thing I will give it credit for was the underlying message. It's okay to be who you are, virgin or not. I found Steve's character rather endearing and more attractive than his loser friends who try to change him. And as it turns out, the ""nerd"" won out in the end.<br/><br/>But seriously, unless you think it's cool to cuss all the time and make offensive jokes about women, I wouldn't sit through this one. You'll be very disappointed. It just might be too much for your virgin ears. (oh the pun!) ;)"

In between spurts of bad taste, we find some genuine emotions and get to enjoy the rapport between the principals. The rest of the time, we could be watching a remake of ""Porky's"". Way a minute! That only means the original is truly better than the remake...<br/><br/>There are moments when it appears as if this will take off, but it never catches fire like ""The Wedding Crashers"" did. There is no chemistry and good will left here.

I've never heard the word ""pussy"" so many times in 2 hours. It stopped being funny. I started feeling kind of creepy. I was glad I was not on a date.<br/><br/>If you like skin flicks, the movie will disappoint you because it is 99 1/2% free of nudity. The main characters are all guys who do not have any sex successes. The main female character is definitely NOT hot (she's a grandmother, honest).<br/><br/>To summarize, on a light insubstantial level, movie kind of grosses-creeps-weirds you out by hearing ""pussy"" and other pre-teen slang for a woman's bottom maybe 200 times. On a more serious-quality movie level, the movie never even pretends to have any meaning."
"johnwvoss","5","5","10","25 August 2005"," Overall didn't live up to hype. Although Carell is pretty funny he's not funny enough to make up for the rest of the cast's lack of improv skills.
","The 40 Year Old Virgin was an OK movie it didn't live up to it's hype or advertising. I feel it's in the same Genre as Wedding Crashers but Wedding Crashers was much funnier due to Vince Vaughn and Owen Wilson just being hilarious and their improv abilities. Which brings me to why 40 year old Virgin wasn't very good. You could tell there was a lot of improv and it wasn't very good. I know Judd Apatow is known for letting people improv but you have to have people who have the talent to do it because not just anyone can be funny and improv. The acting was really bad for the most part and when people are trying to improv and they don't know what to do they start swearing which is why I think this movie had so much swearing that wasn't needed at all. With the exception of Steve Carell the actors in this movie just weren't funny It was like they were all competing to be funnier than the other. It's kind of like the saying to many chefs spoil the soup I think that's what happened here. To effectively improv you need a few hilarious people who can improv and then the other actors just play off of those people staying within their abilities. Carell did have some hilarious parts and his comedic timing is pretty good. I also found for such a large budget movie the editing in this movie was horrible. For example when Carell is yelling at his co workers girlfriend telling him to check his ho and stuff all the sudden the camera switches to something else in the store and then the girlfriend has just disappeared it didn't flow right. Then there was a seen in the ebay store where the kid was trying to buy something and it was totally random unfunny and not needed, what were they thinking.

Instead of focusing on how many one-liners ending with 'penis' can be crammed into the span of about 2 hours, Apatow should have ordered his writers to create characters and situations that didn't make me want to vomit.<br/><br/>Movies don't have to be artsy or uber-intelligent to be successful in the theater; movies DO have to have some semblance of a plot not based on dirty jokes found at a frat party.

","The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a typical Hollywood comedy. There are a few laughs, but I found the majority of the film to be stale. Most of the characters are unlikeable, thinking only about sex and trying to set up their geeky friend with a few one-night stands. I didn't know whether or not this was Hollywood making fun of society, or whether it had some other meaning behind it. This movie struck so close to home and some of the comments and characters reminded me a little bit of reality. I'm not sure if there was a deeper meaning behind this film other than society and peer pressure put too much on sex, and if you haven't done it, then you're probably unattractive or a geek. However, my rating of this film isn't down to any meaning that may or may not be behind it - I felt that this film had little to offer except for a few cheap laughs, most of which are not even memorable a day after having seen it. And I must blame myself for a part of this rating because I don't particularly care for romantic comedies but thought I'd give it a try because it was rated well on here.

"dfranzen70","5","6","13","8 September 2005"," Dull in most spots, although Catherine Keener is great
","As the clever title might indicate, Steve Carell (late of Anchorman and ""The Daily Show"") plays a man who's sort of missed out on the amorous adventures of one's youth. Carell is Andy Stitzer, a low-wage lackey at a Circuit City-type store who ashamedly reveals to his three coworkers that he has yet to do the deed. Naturally, they view this as a challenge.<br/><br/>Andy's never really grown up, as evidenced by his extensive video game and action figure collections and his habit of riding a bicycle to work every day. He never interacts with anyone outside work, so when he's asked to play poker with his coworkers, Andy accepts. Imagine his embarrassment when he's kind of forced to admit his ""problem."" Andy's stereotypical in many ways, which allows the audience to identify with him somewhat. We've all either been or known That Guy, the one who was still as dorky as an adult as he was in high school. Andy's extensive ""toy"" collection is his pride and joy, and one look around his small apartment indicates a stage of arrested development. It's not that Andy's not a nice guy, of course; that's actually the trouble. He never had much (any) luck with the ladies when he was younger, and as he's aged he's more or less given up on the whole idea. Too old, you see.<br/><br/>Various plans are hatched, but the lady who catches Andy's eye is Trish (Catherine Keener), who owns a shop across from Andy's store. Trish is an older woman (at least compared with the ladies that Andy's buddies at work are trying to set him up with), and she seems to sincerely dig the someone naïve Andy. But is there relationship doomed? Will Andy confess to Trish that he's still untouched? I like Steve Carell, especially his fantastic Daily Show work, but I think he's a little underwhelming here. Carell doesn't act so much as react to the madness around him. That might work with some actors in some movies (such as when the chaos is continuously and uproariously funny), but the result here is a sometimes-sluggish mishmash of scattershot jokes and pathos.<br/><br/>The real shining star of the movie is Keener, who's practically unrecognizable as Trish. You might remember her from Being John Malkovich - the slinky sexuality of Maxine gives way to the earthy-dreamy concoction of Trish - and she's as spot on here as she was in that one. Some day, Keener will earn an Academy award. It won't be for this movie, though.<br/><br/>Andy's coworkers and other supporting characters are okay, if not particularly developed. You have the pervy guy, the flashy hip black guy, and the guy who's constantly bemoaning his ex, who dumped him two years ago. All bring a little something to the puzzle that is this film, but none of the pieces fit all that well.<br/><br/>For what looked like a laugh-a-minute comedy about a poor schlub who's about to get off the schneid, Virgin is disappointingly slow in spots; Carell simply doesn't lend enough gravitas to the lead role to be particularly interesting.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin: **"

No way that pick up line works with the bookstore clerk who BTW rehashes her role in Catch Me If You Can of the giggly bimbo in the bank. I dare any guy to try that and see if the clerk doesn't call security or call you a freak. The film just gets worse from there as the offensive, raunchy humor accumulates.

There are no villains and we're really rooting for these people. Normally, I think two hours is too long for a comedy. But I was glad this one went as long as it did, because I wanted to spend some more time with Andy, Trish, and the other characters."
"ellison321","10","7","16","20 August 2005"," Tremendous Comedic Achievement
","This review is not meant to edify the reader's knowledge of what actually takes place in the movie. It is merely meant to advocate the legitimacy of this film as a rare comedic stand-out in an era when Hollywood studios care more about the financial bottom-line than actually engaging their audiences. At a time when the film industry is treating its patrons like HMOs do their patients, it is refreshing to have been able to view a movie that does not sacrifice quality nor demean my intelligence by pandering to conventionally uninspired adult humor. This film is well thought-out and will probably do a tremendous amount of business because it was well-crafted as opposed to the pre-packaged, formulaic soft sell approach of most comedic films today. As a 32 year-old, it was also refreshing to watch a film containing characters who are my age-mates, as opposed to another flaccid youth-obsessed teen movie. The fact that Steve Carell also co-wrote and executive-produced this movie not only makes ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" a tremendous personal achievement, but explains its artistic success, as well."
"bgalligan","8","7","16","19 August 2005"," More vulgar than I expected, saved by Carell's performance.
","I wanted to see this based on all the favorable reviews. I have to remember in the future that most reviewers are male. A man might find the excessive vulgarity and profanity funnier than I did. The 18-25 year old males will undoubtedly love this film. This movie is rated R and it is about a 40 year old virgin, but funny shouldn't mean four letter words in practically every scene. To be honest, some of the male talk left me in the dark. I guess you have to be a guy to know the 'guy speak'. I was expecting sharper dialogue, humor based more on observation. There are a few good one liners, but I wished for more. In the showing I saw, I imagine the 65-70 old woman in front of me was cringing a good deal of the time. Some scenes made 'me' uncomfortable. I'm guessing this movie will play better for men than most women.<br/><br/>Steve Carell, so good in NBC's show ""the Office"", is equally excellent here. I was surprised at his range. He never makes Andy seem dorky, just a little out of the loop when it comes to women. His performance saves the film. The supporting characters are all excellent. I wish they had been given less raunchy material. I still give this movie a thumbs up, but with reservations, especially if you're easily offended."

","He manages not to get real silly like Will Ferrell probably would if he was playing role. He manages to be funny at just the right moment. The story evolves around Andy(Steve Carell), and you knowing the title, is a 40 year old virgin, because after years of unsuccessfully attempts on ever trying to get laid, he just kind of quit altogether. These days he spends his time reading comic books, collecting classic action figures, and working at an electronics store. But then his co-workers(who Carell plays off of in a very funny way) discover he has not had sex, they soon try to help him. But then he meets Trish(Katherine Keener) and begins a relationship with her, but soon becomes worried were to go with it. This movie was great allover, it is a comedy classic."

"pkzeewiz","2","4","8","9 April 2010"," I'm hungry! Let's get some f'n french toast!!
","A movie that could've been good with MAJOR changes.. Many of the main actors sucked and the fact that the story was about changing a person in order to make them presentable is a horrible concept.<br/><br/>This movie is about a man who is a bit of a geek, a single man with an average job who just happens to be a virgin, when his co-workers find out they make it their goal to get him some action. Most of them are the average ""dudes"" who get with the less than average women and are satisfied with that lifestyle.<br/><br/>Steve Correl is the star and his character is fine with the way things are, he's tried a few times in life to get some action but his dorky side won and the women ran out on him, he eventually meets a woman and she has kids and he find himself happy for once, but sex is still nothing he's too anxious about, his fear is in charge. Finally he starts to revolve his life around her and realizes he must change in order to keep her...As one would know before they even start watching the film, it's all gonna work out.<br/><br/>Does it really work out though? This man may be a geek, but no one should ever change for anyone, I mean you have to get yourself out there to get sex, but you don't have to lie or change who you are. By the time this movie is over he sells all of his collectibles and she has him starting his own business. Some people call it growing up, I consider it giving in. I hated that aspect of the movie, When you're a geek or a weirdo you're unique and original and lovable and special, and the aftermath of this movie would be that he's married, he has love but he also now has her kids, her life and a job which takes up his time and he will become boring miserable and pathetic like most married men are..they don't show you that part.. This movies message was a bad one.<br/><br/>Director Judd Apatow did an okay job here, he never impresses, but with this kind of movie no one pays any attention to anything other than acting and story. The story did have some funny moments, Judd himself helped with one of the funniest scenes as an Indian call support hotline voice when Andy calls to get rid of his erection.<br/><br/>Steve is a good actor, so far I have enjoyed his work and he was likable here as well. Jane Lynch did a good job as Paula and some of the other actors were good too. Kat Denning's playing Andy's girlfriends daughter, Jonah Hill as a customer at the We Sell Your Stuff On Ebay store and of course Gerry Bednob playing the old Indian worker at Andy's store was great.Then we have the crappy actors who shared so much screen time and ruined the movie; Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan. WOW does it get any worse than Seth Rogan, where did this horrible actor come from - I hate this guy!!! Paul Rudd, does ANYONE like him, wow what a waste.<br/><br/>Bottom line this movie could've been funny if they had changed so much of the story and not changed Andy, changing people sucks. Thats all Hollywood does is try to tell people they suck at being themselves, you can get laid without being just like everyone else. Also this movie needed some good acting..It had it's moments but I only give it 2 stars because I watched it in a theater and hated it and just watched the unrated DVD and it still didn't add anything great...Most people will like it because people will laugh at anything these days."
"bob the moo","Null","4","8","26 March 2009"," Mostly amusing and funny film that isn't overwhelmed by crudity even if it uses it
","When it was released I never got round to seeing this film and it started to drift away into the mist of my memory until recently when I made an effort to catch it. The reason for this was partly the good things I had heard about it and also the fact that it sort of was the film that started the seemingly endless parade of Judd Apatow films. At times I think this is a good thing but then too often I find his films to be pretty base and lacking the imagination and wit I would like. I thought that perhaps 40 Year Old Virgin would be different because of it being his first hit as director. Of course the title should have given me pause to think on that but I went ahead anyway.<br/><br/>What I found was a film that has a bit of what I dislike about Apatow and also a bit of what I do. The plot is a simple one and does a typical soppy narrative that we have seen from him other places  crude laughs but ultimately love comes through. This allows for essentially a series of sketches where Andy attempts to break out of his rut with his ""friends"" guiding him on the way. Some of these are pretty funny and some of these are quite weak but mostly they are amusing. The only parts that really fell flat for me were moments of comic racism between a black character and an Asian character  these were not funny and they gave me an odd feeling given they were written by white men. Outside of this the film does have the ""sex comedy"" air of geek wish-fulfilment that again Apatow trades in  it does nothing for me this side of his work but I can understand why it does for others.<br/><br/>Part of the reason I did enjoy the film is Carell. Unlike Rogen's turns as leading man for Apatow, Carell has more ""likeablity"" to him and is also a much better comic. Where Rogen blunders Carell is subtle and clever. Of course we are still talking about a sex comedy so I'm not suggesting he is amazing but he is funny and his performance is bang on. Malco, Rudd and Rogen are good in supporting roles though and all three do this well. Keener works well with Carell to make this thread actually work reasonably well, while Banks is just left with looking hot and being sexy  which she does well enough for this film.<br/><br/>40 Year Old Virgin got rave reviews and continues to be looked back on fondly but I'm not seeing it myself. The comedy is crude at times but mostly it is amusing with only one or two failures along the way. It isn't hilarious and it is very much an Apatow film (which means good things and bad things) but is helped by the cast playing to their strengths (eg Carell in the lead, Rogen in support) producing a generally amusing and funny film that dabbles with but is never overwhelmed by crudity or geek wish-fulfilment."
"leetan1","4","4","8","23 August 2006"," Well, That Was A Disappointment
","Having read many good reviews, I looked forward to seeing this film with the promising title. I was expecting a clever and unusual script and, of course, some great jokes. But sadly, in my opinion, this is not what you get at all.<br/><br/>The basic idea is a good starting point but then the film completely relies on crassness and swearing for its kicks. Now don't get me wrong, I do love a bit of swearing but in this film there is overkill to the point of tedium. There is even a sixty year old Pakistani character whose sole purpose is to shout out the rude stuff.<br/><br/>There are some funny moments but you can count them on one hand and the film drags on for far too long. Finally, it culminates in an over the top ending which is as desperate and try hard as a middle-aged man who hasn't had sex yet, and probably won't judging by this performance."
"zsanctuary","9","4","8","29 January 2006"," Like a sick mind in the right place.
","As we all know the sub-genre of sex comedies is pretty crowded. Simply being excessively raunchy isn't enough anymore. I've seen and heard so many disgusting jokes and actions that a sex comedy really needs to have other positive points to appeal to me these days.<br/><br/>Coming into the 40 Year Old Virgin I knew basically what to expect; I did see the commercials after all; ""is it true that if you don't use it, you lose it?"" What I didn't expect to find is a heart and honest attempts at character development. There's still the weird ""off-the-wall"" characters that we see so much in Adam Sandler movies and there's still enough inappropriate language to sink Noah's Ark but somehow the movie has a worthwhile love story and yes even a message.<br/><br/>The main character Andy is (unfortunately for me) a person I can relate to. In the first shot I see that he even shares my love for Mystery Science Theater 3000 (he has a poster for the movie on his wall) and throughout the movie we get to see his really neat collection of antiquities. Andy also has plenty of video games and a working knowledge of films and technology. Andy doesn't want to buy a car because he prefers his bike. Most importantly of all; Andy is a nice person, he doesn't swear and he respect women so much that he stays away from them. Combine all these factors and everybody begins to think he's a serial murderer. It's like my life story.<br/><br/>The other characters each have funny little stories to go along with their slightly exaggerated personalities and they all work on a certain level but not the way Andy does. I felt that it was sort of distracting in a way since Andy and his girlfriend Trish are really the only truly human characters in the entire movie.<br/><br/>I suppose since I mentioned one flaw I might as well bring the other noticeable one to light. The story is clever but too predictable and as far as romances go; it's quite simple. It deals with Andy's relationship with Trish for a long time and we all know what's going to happen in the end. Sure its final detour is a bit different than we may expect but you know what's going to happen in the end, and I assure you it does. These are definitely small stains on the movie but there's so much good here that I can easily ignore it's few faults.<br/><br/>When I say ""good"" I mean ""bad"" of course. This is a sex comedy and it wants to be bad. For the most part I think it succeeded. There are so many hilarious scenes such as Andy trying to get rid of an erection after refusing to have sex with Trish. Or the scene where Andy goes with his Trish's daughter to a sexual education class where he ends up asking more questions than anybody else. Ah and we must not forget the soon to be classic chest waxing sequence ""Ooh! Como se llama!"" An interesting little note about that scene; the actor Steve Carell actually did wax his belly and the pain shown is real. Of course they only did one take but it was still a very brave thing to do on his part.<br/><br/>Actually since we're talking about Steve Carell, I'd like to say that he has now risen on my list of respected comedians which is sort of odd since I didn't even know who he was prior to seeing this film. I was just so impressed by his writing, acting and timing that I now really want to keep an eye out for his future roles. This man has talent it The 40 Year Old Virgin proves that.<br/><br/>To be honest I had doubts about this film but early word was positive and I knew it was something I was eventually going to see. I'm glad that I did too since it's probably one of the funniest movies I've seen in a long time and it doubles as something you feel is worth watching. It's not simply a series of sex gags lumped together rather it's a series of sex gags entwined with a very worthwhile character and a truly touching romance. Now excuse me while I go puke my guts out; I can't believe I just wrote that...<br/><br/>My review from Frider Waves: http://friderwaves.com/index.php?page=virgin"

","I saw this movie two days ago. I felt like I want to see a comedy and laugh and I didn't laugh at all. Most of the joke were boring and predictable. Plus the acting was terrible and the story too. The language was vulgar. In American Pie the language is vulgar but the movie is funny. The 40 years old virgin have no good joke and the story is about a retard who didn't have sex in 40 years this story is stupid and unfunny don't waste your time and your money. I'm surprised that so many people have give more than 4 stars to this crap. If you want to see a really good comedy rent '' American Pie'' or if you want a see something more recent rent '' Guess who'' I thought this one was funny."
"BrigitteD","5","4","8","17 September 2005"," Save yourself for ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"".
","The rites of passage from boyhood to manhood have often been a cinematic staple, in such memorable titles as ""Animal House"", ""Porky's"" and ""Revenge Of The Nerds"", to the more recent ""American Pie"" films. Adding to that, are most of the Farrelly Brothers productions which have further tested the boundaries of sexual humor.<br/><br/>While the majority of these examples depict a high school or college demographic, the latest trend seems to focus more on grown men who have not quite reached that one specific level of maturity in their juvenile pursuit of sexual gratification.<br/><br/>Following the breakout success of the similarly raunchy comedy, ""The Wedding Crashers"", comes this film, which has also managed to defy the curse of the sanitized PG-13 rating that has plagued and minimized so many potentially good films.<br/><br/>Steve Carell whom we have previously seen in television sketch shows and in supporting roles opposite comedy kings Jim Carrey and Will Ferrell, co-wrote alongside director Judd Apatow, and stars in his first leading vehicle.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer is socially challenged, living his life with childish innocence. An electronics store employee, he also boasts a vast collection of vintage action figures, plays video games, entertains himself with solo karaoke sessions, as well as watches reality shows with his elderly neighbors. Also, his method of transportation is a bicycle.<br/><br/>During a poker game with his coworkers (Paul Rudd, Romano Malco, Seth Rogan), it is revealed that Andy has never engaged in sexual intercourse. Of course, he's had plenty of opportunities which always failed to meet his expectations, so he eventually just stopped trying.<br/><br/>From that point on, his friends, who are also all dealing with relationship issues of their own, become determined to initiate Andy to the world of dating and eventual mating, leading him through both his physical and psychological transformation, introducing him to nightclub outings, a body-waxing appointment, and a various assortment of pornography material.<br/><br/>Eventually, Andy meets Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a bookstore clerk, and furthermore, Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who runs an independent business selling merchandise to Ebay. Andy begins developing feelings for Trish, but has to struggle with posing restrictions in his relationship with her, and not revealing his state of prolonged ""celibacy"".<br/><br/>Had this film starred Tom Green or Rob Schneider, for example, the result would have undoubtedly been less effective. Carell offers refreshing insight into a overused plot subject, presenting Andy's situation with sincerity, sensibility and endearing awkwardness rather than turning his performance into one of chauvinistic exploitation.<br/><br/>Like ""Wedding Crashers"", this film turns its third act into a showcase of moral sentimentality, and despite all its strong attributes, the material unfortunately begins wearing thin before it finally reaches its satisfying climax (No pun intended)."
"TheNorthernMonkee","8","4","8","5 September 2005"," crude and obsessive, but often hilarious and Carell is superb
","SPOILERS Sex huh? It's one of the most basic parts of human life. Yet, do we ever take it too seriously? People always want more, even those who get it on a daily basis, and if you are unlucky, there are potential life changing (creating) consequences. Ironically people claim we are all starting to have sex at a younger and younger age (despite Victorians getting married and having children in their early teens), so it must be increasingly difficult for those who get to a point as virgins. In Steve Carell's first big screen lead, he plays a man who has gotten to 40 without managing it. Treating us to countless lude and extreme sex related incidents, not to mention more profanity than an episode of ""Eurotrash"", the general plot of the film and it's principle doesn't sound funny. It's a pleasant surprise therefore that for all the inappropriate, failed jokes, there are an incredibly large number of ones which hit the mark and leave the audience in hysterics.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a nice guy with a good job and a pleasant temperament. At the same time though, he blatantly takes life too seriously and after being invited to a poker game as a necessary fifth member, Andy's friends discover his secret. At the age of 40, Andy is still a virgin. Now, for multiple reasons, but mostly pity, the three men (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco) all offer Andy advice with one goal in mind. To put him out of his misery and get him laid.<br/><br/>One of the few good things about ""Anchorman"", it was only going to be a matter of time before Steve Carell got himself a lead of his own. Impressively, in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" he doesn't disappoint. Showing the hopeless, shy virgin to perfection, Carell is a revelation as he gradually grows increasingly confident as the advice begins to help.<br/><br/>Carell is not alone however in his performance. Rudd, Rogen, Malco and Catherine Keener as the love interest are all superb. Rudd is a personal favourite as the love sick David who falls apart at multiple times and shares the finest scene with Rogen as the two argue over homosexuality.<br/><br/>The biggest surprise about this film is not the way that so many of the jokes hit the mark, but actually the clever way that it flips the message on it's head. Obviously designed for conservative America, the film's entire tone evolves from a simple story of sexual conquest into one of safe sex and abstinence. The virgin doesn't need sex to make his life complete, he just needs confidence and true love. A worthy message to preach, and a considerable improvement on the one you expect to see at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>It's weird to see a crude comedy which is consistently funny and well acted, but low and behold, ""40 Year Old Virgin"" is just that. Throw in a well meaning message too and you're well on the way to a top class comedy. A surprising joy."

","From the very beginning I was so excited to see this movie. The poster is possibly the funniest I've ever seen for a movie. I immediately bought one for my dorm this September.<br/><br/>Every element came together in this movie so beautifully. It's not often you see a movie with so many penis, gay, and racial jokes so praised by critics. Carell and the rest of the cast deliver each raunchy joke sensationally. Carell remains sweet throughout the entire movie where by the end of the movie you're rooting for him to succeed in his relationship more than you are for him to get laid. The supporting cast is brutal, each of them having some problems with the ladies themselves.<br/><br/>One of the things about this movie is the abundance of memorable scenes we're given. This is what makes a movie easy to remember fondly. This movie will often be brought up when the words ""chest waxing"" and ""condoms"" are mentioned in conversation.<br/><br/>Watching it in the theater I was surprised how many older people were there to watch it. I saw a group of four mid-60s women come in. Despite an older audience, this movie still filled the entire theater with laughter.<br/><br/>I think the type of people who will like this are the fans of the Office and Steve Carell. A lot of the jokes remind me of the type of jokes you'd see on Family Guy, too. The movie is shallow enough for adolescent boys and still sweet and clever enough for middle aged women.<br/><br/>I don't recommend going to this movie if you aren't a fan of profanity or if you are easily offended. However, when you are at the movie, just remember this movie is all in good humor. The jokes aren't ""gay jokes,"" they're just jokes. And they're funny."

(Well, I'll modify that somewhat -- Kat Dennings turned in an honest and touching performance as Keener's daughter, without appealing to any of the usual stereotypes of teenage girls.)<br/><br/>It's sad in a way. While it's understandable that a movie with this theme would include some crudity, it's obvious that far too much is simply gratuitous.

The great thing is that this movie could've gone in a really bad direction, and not have had any depth to it, but while being funny and goofy, Andy and Trish's love story and the lessons he learns from his first real relationship are life lessons that can apply to anybody going through a relationship, whether they are virgins or not. <br/><br/>The first half of the film might be uncomfortable for feminists.

It didn't have me reeling from laughter, but it made for a nice, light romantic comedy in its own sense."

","This movie is really funny and although it runs long (even longer on the extended cut on DVD, which I haven't watched), it is funny and with the exception of a few little ""bumps"" in the story or drama, it works fine! Steve Carrell is very funny and believable. And he also shows us, that he can carry a movie as a lead. Of course his partners in crime are very well casted, too.<br/><br/>Some jokes are a bit childish, but they're played with so much gusto, from the cast, that you don't really mind. There's a particular scene, involving Carrell's character and his back. You could call it a ""torture"" scene, if you like! ;o) If you watch the movie, you'll know what I'm talking about.

","This comedy was better than I expected, although considering the questionable quality of movie comedy coming out of the States these days, that isn't saying too much. The writers set themselves something of a tricky task in a way: making Andy nerdy enough to still be a believable virgin and yet still likable enough for his workmates to want to help him lose his virginity rather than simply make them the butt of their jokes (which, let's face it, is probably what would have happened in real life). The film's quite likable in that respect, always sympathising with its main character while making him the subject of its humour which, for the most part, manages to rise just above the gross juvenile level you might expect. Having said that, there's no belly laughs here, just a lot of wry smiles. And at nearly two-and-a-quarter-hours, this film, like Andy's virginity, lasts for way too long..."
"Logic404","9","2","3","28 September 2006"," More for men but I think an open mind is all it takes to laugh here.
","Just about every scene here is laugh worthy. The reason I think this is more for men is you don't see a lot of the woman's side of things. Could be almost in the same ballpark as a chick flick but reversed. That is not a slam on this movie mind you.<br/><br/>Most people would be offended by the graphic sexual talk and the language but in this one it's not WHAT'S said, it's HOW it's said that made me have a steady stream of laughter.<br/><br/>Steve Carell plays his character just perfectly especially if your familiar with his work. Paul Rudd had a funny part to. The love interest couldn't have been better.<br/><br/>Only thing I had a problem with was some of the later scenes seemed forced like the argument but I guess they had to end the movie sometime. I thought Steve's character had the right idea on how to treat women right but the rest really showed what value sex has in today's society.

There is rarely a serious moment in this movie and when there is the laughs come roaring back. Steve Carell's performance in this movie is brilliant, call me insane but I even think it's Oscar worthy. The whole cast in this movie are all funny.

","Enjoyable self-explanatory film that surfs a tone between ribald new-school US sex comedy and 70s influenced, humanist US indy character study.<br/><br/>There's an interesting article by the filmmakers, who include the lead actor Mr Carrell, in a magazine for screenwriters i saw online. It talks about how they wanted precisely to work that line between those newer more slapstick, ribald films but underpin it with a human story influenced by Hal Ashby and the like... deadpan and concerned ultimately with empathy for characters rather than mockery of them. Well, they more or less pull it off. The script slackens at times and is weakened by the fact that he's not that unlikely to 'get laid' from the off, but then, that's partly their decision not to make him unbelievably weird and geeky.<br/><br/>As a friend said, though, ""you can;t imagine a film about a female 40 year old virgin taking the same tone."" perhaps she's right. Male sexual inadequacy is amusingly commercial, female undesirability is a whole different kettle of fish.... debate."

"Flagrant-Baronessa","7","2","3","2 August 2006"," Nice end product; often ridiculously funny
","On a poker night with three bawdy colleagues, the geeky toy-collector Andy (Steve Carell, where have you been?) reluctantly reveals that he has never done the dirty. Thus, they begin a mission to get this 40-year-old virgin laid and efforts such as chest-waxing, dating services and loose women ensue. This is harder than it sounds, because Andy isn't exactly Casanova. He rides a bicycle to work. He collects action-figures. He talks to his action figures.<br/><br/>I never quite prepared myself for just how funny The 40 Year Old Virgin was. The dialogue is some of the most dynamic, quick, interactive and downright hysterical I have ever heard in a comedy, and this elevates the whole film above generic formula. Carell brings refreshing charisma and comedic timing to his performance, and I have never heard a funnier, better screamer since Macalauy Culkin in Home Alone (""I'm SHY!!!""). It is also nice to see Paul Rudd back in comedy action, as I greatly missed this guy when he seemed to depart from fame post-Clueless. Someone else whose comedic skills are worthy of a great deal of praise is Romany Malco, playing Andy's friend and pimp, always there to facilitate his mission, but always ending up making things worse. It is these three men that, when combined, are so funny that they just take my breath away.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect to The 40 Year Old Virgin (aside from its philosophy that you can't be happy unless you're in a relationship) is that it is much too long. It has been said before yes, but there is a reason it has been brought up so much and that is because a raunchy sex comedy just does not hold up for 120 minutes. As the novelty of the fun dialogue and sexy situations wore off, I became less and less engrossed in the film. And let's not talk about the final sing-and-dance number. Just... please. 7/10"

Hard to put my finger on but maybe plot of the writing anyway both were weak. Wedding Crashers 4/10 40 Yr Old Virgin 3/10 Anchorman 10/10.<br/><br/>It lacked the BIG laughs I think like Dumb and Dumber have, like Anchormn had and like Zoolander had.

","Here's the deal...if I were to truly write a spoiler for this movie, I would mention the f-word, a derogatory comment describing a woman's anatomy, and be as far from funny as I could possibly be...in EVERY sentence of this review! All while acting completely oblivious to what I'm saying is amazingly profane. That's how pervasively nasty this movie turned out.<br/><br/>Why is it that this movie, with such incredible promise for great laughs in it's plot and cast, just failed completely? I honestly was dumbfounded about midway through the movie by the non-stop vulgarity, that my wife and I had to shut off the DVD player. Let me tell you, that's not easy to make us give up on a movie, especially after we paid money for the rental. I'm utterly shocked that reviewers have said this is a good date movie. I guess if who you're dating doesn't mind being completely degraded by the movie's screenplay from start to finish.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, this scene describes my disappointment: Steve Carell's buddies have him wax his chest at a salon so he will be more attractive to the ladies. The hot wax is administered with tissue paper strips to his extremely hairy chest. When the woman administering the wax strips rips them off, (whoa here come's the funny memorable comedy!), he lets his feelings be known as to how bad it hurts. (This scene was shown in previews a few months ago, showing him blurt out Kelly Clarkson's name randomly - pretty funny) Here's the disappointment - before he says the Clarkson comment, his response to roughly 6 of the strips being removed is nothing other than the f-word. Ha ha, very funny. Real original. By the time he said her name, the moment was completely gone. Wasted.<br/><br/>Bottom line for this reviewer - I was a HUGE fan of Steve Carell before this movie (""Bruce Almighty"" and ""Anchorman""). In the span of watching half of this movie, I went from eagerly awaiting release of a movie starring him as the lead to, honestly, complete disinterest in his next project (no matter the reviews). This movie stunk."

","Here we have yet another first-world comedy from the king of first-world comedies, Judd Apatow, himself. The director/writer/producer crafted, this time, an interesting story with a lead character just begging to be liked. Andy (Steve Carell) is an apparent worry-free, happy, well-groomed respectable man, working at a tech store, but there is something off about him... oh, right, he's a 40-year old virgin (in case you hadn't figured it from the title) and a nerd.<br/><br/>If riding his bike to work and signaling his turns does not make you think that something is off with him, then his enormous collection of toys and action figures definitely will. The plot revolves pretty much around his co-workers and friends helping him to get laid--hallelujah! Despite its comedic tone and its raunchiness, this is a surprisingly insightful film as far as buddy comedies go, even if the information revolves around various echelons of women and naughty theories about sex. The film's misogynistic moments are often necessary, and not everything boils down to sex, but the experience of love.<br/><br/>Andy's buddies, despite being a bunch of hedonists and testosterone driven macho-men, are not worried simply because he never had sex. They want him to experience love, they genuinely think about his emotional future, and the comedy comes from the fact that the only way they know how to teach him is by bringing him to obscene nightclubs, offering him a box filled with pornographic material or simply giving him instructions on how to approach a woman.<br/><br/>There are tons of moments of pure modernity-inspired fun even outside this main plot. One of the most random and best recurring gags is the one in which the only material playing on the TVs on display is a two-year old Michael McDonald DVD of which David (Paul Rudd), makes a bold, funny and perfectly-delivered threat to his boss to be changed. All-in-all, Andy does interact with many women and we see flashbacks of his failed teenager years attempts at popping his cherry, all failing in hilarious ways--this is another thing that I liked: there was no dramatic moment or anything in his life, he simply had bad luck!<br/><br/>Apatow crafted yet another first-world, modern comedy. It is what it is, but by the end of it, despite knowing that ideally Andy should be with a single woman, Trish, who is presented as the one, the film does a great job at confusing you as well as him. Luckily there are many gags to keep you entertained and with such a sweet, human character, I can barely get past the cringe-inducing song at the end."

"AhmedSpielberg99","7","1","1","28 March 2019"," Raunchy and heartfelt in equal measure!
","It may feel overlong, sketchy, and familiar; but all this actually because of one single flaw, which is that the movie completely delivered itself to its message. Don't get me wrong, the message of the movie is one of its best merits (it's well-conveyed, and it makes the movie stand out from the rest of raunchy comedies). But when the plot ends up being completely driven by the moral of the story, you know that there is something wrong here. A lot of monotonous, stretched story-lines, and repetitive jokes made the movie feels as if it has overstayed its welcome. And I kept always wondering why a movie that felt so fresh and genuine, and also has a lot to say (considering its remaining running time and the almost flawless, extremely hilarious and intriguing first act and half of the second). I think I found the answer as the third act kicked off, which is to keep stretching the movie as much as it could until it reach the denouement, and hence delivers its message at the end. It ends up being pretty much a run-of-the-mill rom-com.<br/><br/>However, The 40-Year-Old Virgin completely deserves the cult status it has achieved. First and foremost, Judd Apatow pulled off a something seemingly impossible: a combination of a crude, gross-out comedy and a heartfelt, tender romantic comedy. While these two sub-genres didn't mix very well with each other, glimpses of each of both have managed to be consistent throughout the entire movie. That's largely due to the likable and unbelievably relatable protagonist, Andy, brought to life by an outstanding, star-making performance by Steve Carell, who revealed his massive talent, showing an impressive range he would latter become famous for.<br/><br/>All the secondary characters here have a reasonable depth that prove how this movie is really different from your typical gross-out comedy. They may be stereotypical after all, but the witty rude humor that came from them added an extra, and maybe interestingly contradictory, layer to all of them. I think all the performances are great, but Paul Rudd really stole the show.<br/><br/>Also the movie features a young Jonah Hill in a very funny cameo.

","One thing I love about Steve Carell is that he leaves a good impression in every movie he's enrolled in. His performance and expressions in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" makes the audience believe in the situation that he is dealing with. Judd Apatow's movies are known to include comedian actors such as Paul Rudd and Soth Rogen who played two amazing roles in this movie. Seeing that the movie turned out to be entertaining and well developed, I found it longer than it should have been. I think movies like ""The 40 year old virgin"", or ""This is 40"" (also directed by Judd Apatow) should be plain and simple (about 1 hr 20 min - 1 hr 30 min max). Despite the fact that the plot is amusing, it should have been compressed. Overall, it was a good movie."

","saw a free screening of this awhile back and i have been doing my best to make sure it succeeds by telling everyone i know to go see it. i won't waste time telling the plot, all i knew going in was it was about a 40-year-old virgin and that's all you need to know too. i'd consider probably ""wet hot American summer"" to be the funniest movie i've ever seen, but this might actually be a close second. this has slightly less laughs total but is the rare comedy that is hilarious without being exaggerated at all. i think this is probably Judd Apatow's influence, as well as ditching the Wilsons/Will Farrell/Vince Vaughn/Ben Stiller. none of them has so much as a cameo and the movie is SO MUCH BETTER FOR IT. they are not the only working comedy actors today after all, was there a time when they didn't project the aura of guys sitting around congratulating each other all the time? didn't think so. Steve Carrell proves himself to be the gifted comic we all know he is from the daily show, but he's also a very good actor in the times when he's not playing funny. other than him the most famous people in this are probably Catherine Keener (actually sweet and likable in this movie) and Paul Rudd. they, and everyone else, seem to have been given a lot to do by Apatow but also the freedom to do it the way they want to do it. for example: Seth Rogen--the ""fat kid"" from freaks and geeks--is basically here to be the same sarcastic fat guy, but he piles on the personal touch in a way that is pretty much wholly unique, and still funny as hell. even the smallest characters (the other half of the lesbian couple from ""best in show"" that wasn't stifler's mom is incredible as the 4.y.o.v.'s boss) are given screen time that is almost insanely funny. but all of this with a bare minimum of toilet humor, nary a poop joke, and still the raunchiest thing i've seen in a theater in a long ass time. this movie could not be rated anything lower than R. i hope they don't cut a thing from the print i saw and judging from the lack of questionnaires at the end i doubt they will. so yeah, go see it. you won't be disappointed."
"mxmlln","10","6","15","7 August 2005"," The Big Four Oh, Been There
","Although, I was never privileged enough to be treated to the preview, the movie poster for The 40-year-old-virgin was sufficiently sweet. Alone, Steve Carell looks up like a naive, optimistic virgin who has not entirely unveiled the world and expects the world from it. However, the movie reveals a different character. Steve Carell plays Andy Stitzer, who has altogether dismissed friendship and romance alike. Andy spends his time alone playing instruments and video games, but mostly painting and playing with collectible figures. At work he is sociable, but has difficulty connecting with his peers.<br/><br/>The story begins when the salespeople need another poker player to fill their quota. Though one player believes Andy' strange persona is surely a ominous sign, they have no one left to ask. After Andy's online poker experience forces one player to leave, the play stops and the workers attempt to know Andy better. The discussion turns toward females and Andy is called on to share his dirtiest moment. His discomfort is quite apparent and he simply repeats how dirty the girl talked. No one is convinced and someone insulting asks if Andy has had sex. Andy quickly denies these claims, but the others readily realize its truth and our story begins.<br/><br/>The other workers are quick to help and conform Andy. Though initially Andy is quite excited and willing, he soon grows weary of the chase. He has been accepting advice he does not wholly believe and since there have been no results, he no longer has to participate in these foreign belief systems. Andy has given up on eliminating his virginity and is perfectly content to resume life as it was. The reason this story appeals to me so is that I find conflict's necessity to story difficult to accept. Does every story have to have some pain to be interesting? Is life a series of large and small pains and would that be worth living? 40yov achieves a captivating story and almost too intelligent backdrop for many consecutive laughs. Andy does not accept the conflict. Only the other characters that support him see a problem, just as Chancey Gardiner, the lead in ""Being There"", Peter Sellers final film, was oblivious to his inability to fend for himself. The interesting question is which side the audience participates in. Certainly most more sexually active members of the audience that have great difficulty sitting still for two hours will side with the peers or strongly desire Andy himself. However, the audience will inherently accept Andy's view because he is the story. Thus, we are watching a film that has a brilliant, novel story, but rejects the urgency of the conflict. When Andy does not accept the conflict, the plot thins and we are no longer in an analytic film with normal cause and effect. The film takes a continental approach and the character is not pushed in any direction and picks its actions at leisure. Nonetheless, the modern, reflexive humor will appeal to most audiences.<br/><br/>One of the film creators must have been inspired by ""Being There"" because no film has used such a similar form to escape convention while simultaneously appealing to everyone since. The film is actually and literally a remake of ""Being There"", which is no small project and entirely unlikely to succeed. Chancey Gardiner is not allowed to leave his home until he is at least 60 years of age and those 20 years make quite a difference, but clearly the absurdity needed to be toned down. Chancey likewise has had even fewer people in his life, namely 2.3 composed of his adopter, nanny, and someone who fixed the wall. He is forced out of the home because a lack of documentation leaves him claimless to the house. He is forced into the world, while Andy has sidelined the world by choice and blithely so. 40yov can be labeled an intelligent recreation, since it rather drastically changes most elements of the film to where most viewers will not see the analogy and actual identity. I recommend a full pardon and fully condone the decision and motivation of the creators. I would go so far as to thank them for the exposure they will be giving to my favorite film of 7 years and creating a perfect experience for everyone.<br/><br/>The second part of the film takes a rather different approach. The story eases back into convention, while Andy struggles to fully understand normality. I am not going to elaborate this section, but Andy suddenly becomes quite fearful of how sex could ruin his first relationship. The filming is cheap, but neutral, never adding or subtracting from the key elements of the film. The set and costume designs demonstrated some mastery and enhanced how Andy's absence from the world has let him escape from it. Of course 40yov had a substantial amount of lessons, all of which were directly related to the film and valid. You may see some good Bergman, Jarmusch-Murray, and Van Sant masterpieces in the next few weeks, but they will have some serious competition in 40yov. Vote: 9.3"
"dr_foreman","5","5","12","5 March 2007"," What passes for a thoughtful comedy these days.
","A lot of reviewers seem to think that this is a thoughtful movie, a film that really captures some elusive truth about - I dunno - male/female relationships, or our society's attitudes towards sex, or whatever.<br/><br/>But in reality, this is pretty much your average sophomoric comedy, with perhaps a tiny bit more insight than you'd expect. The title character is presented in a somewhat sympathetic fashion (I guess), and I suppose that's surprising in a good way. However, this movie only appears sensitive and smart when viewed alongside, say, South Park; it's hardly a great character study like The Odd Couple, or a really novel and intelligent comedy like Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>The problem is that everybody in this movie is grotesque. Carell's character is an endearing dweeb, somewhat reminiscent of real dweebs, but in the end I found him too weedy and bizarre to be genuinely likable. His oversexed friends, meanwhile, are all pathetic jerks themselves, and the various chicks who show up during the film are usually trashy and scary. I suppose the only character who's really supposed to be nice is Carell's main love interest, Trish, but she comes across as bland compared to all the lunatics on display.<br/><br/>But maybe the real problem I had with the movie is that it's not actually laugh-out-loud funny. I thought they really tortured the scene when Carell's chest hair gets ripped off, for instance; it would've been boring enough at half the length. And some of the ""famous"" lines - ""they felt just like bags of sand!"" - really ain't as hilarious as all that.<br/><br/>Yeah, I think this movie ultimately doesn't know what it wants to be - insightful social commentary, or dumb frat-guy comedy. It settles for a middle ground, so it gets a middling rating from me. Just don't be fooled by glowing Ebert reviews or anything like that."

","I bought the DVD on the recommendation of a friend that this was one of the funniest movies in years, and a similar recommendation from a local DJ. But this movie had no redeeming features that I saw. From the awkward dialog surrounding the revelation that Andy was a 40-year-old virgin through the completely predictable ending, the movie went from one uncomfortable scene to the next. Even the scenes that could have been hilarious (the ""waxing scene"") were tainted by Andy's totally uncharacteristic swearing.<br/><br/>I will say that Steve Carell did pull off a very convincing loser. It was actually too convincing -- he stopped being funny and was simply pathetic. Every one of his co-workers was a completely one-dimensional prop (the mopey break-up guy, the horn-dog, the butch boss,) and they never changed. Every joke was either: ""be depressed, this guy is a sadder loser than before,"" or ""hey, let's swear."" While swearing as a punchline can be funny once or twice, basing an entire movie on it is not.<br/><br/>Long before the end of the movie I didn't care if he got laid or not. I just wanted it to end. I tried to switch off the DVD half way through, but my wife said, ""Oh, no, you made me watch this and now you're going to suffer, too. And I'm never going to let you forget it."" So I'm dreading the next chick-flick that comes around."

","If you have a high school degree, even a GAD, or even passed elementary school; you are too intelligent for this movie. The plot is dry and clichéd (not to mention offensive, explicit and slanderous (when he is waxed it sounds like is making a rude comment towards Alex Lifeson of Rush, even if he is not, just sounding like he is, is illegal according to libel laws, as a professional writer I know)).<br/><br/>The concept of a 40 year old virgin is not something to make a good comedy. Men of the church are mostly lifetime virgins and this is highly offensive to priests, monks, bishops, etc. The lines are trite and many are stolen from other comedies such as South Park as only one example(Arrested Devolpment did the same thing) and many other lines are stolen.<br/><br/>The acting is very wooden and once again clichéd. 2005 was a horrible year for movies, with the hundreds of remakes. And the few originals were just as bad, and this is only one example of it. Thumbs down big time."

","I walked into this film not expecting much, and received far less for my effort. And, not leaving WAS an effort. It was pure morbid curiosity that kept me in my seat 'til the end, wondering what everybody was raving about. Have movies really gotten so bad that this was the highest rated comedy of the year? That thought alone was depressing.<br/><br/>This is a film whose funniest moment is watching the protagonist have a face waxed into his chest. Or rather, the reaction of his friends to the wax job. Sadly, this only begged the question --- what's wrong with chest hair. Seated next to my incredibly sexy (and moderately hairy) boyfriend, I cringe at the thought of men waxing their chests. This movie takes a guy with no discernible testosterone whatsoever, and attempts to remove what tiny vestige remains . . . in order to impress women??? Am I the only female remaining who likes my man to be a man? Can we put metrosexualism to bed yet? On a separate note, why didn't his hair start to grow back over the coming weeks (or were they months)? <br/><br/>The ""resolution"" in this movie is of course not for the character to display any growth, but rather to convince his woman that she doesn't want sex either. Again, painful to watch. Rather, why not witness our ""hero"" grow a pair and actually sweep his woman off her feet?"

","There has been a lot of excitement about this movie around (even the video store clerk asked me if I was excited to watch it), so I prepared myself for something truly amusing: and this movie just didn't deliver. It has some good lines, I'll give you that, but overall it is quite bland, despite the spicy sex references splattered throughout. My big thumbs down goes for the vomit scene... it seems no ""comedy"" this days is complete without some such insertion. Oh well... Even the gag collection was not funny at all, and the rest of the special features pretty much put me to sleep.<br/><br/>Only yesterday I watched Kusturica's delightful comedy ""Black cat, white cat"". There isn't much similarity between the two, but I couldn't help comparing them anyway and noticing how inferior this movie was in just about every respect. So watch it if you like, but don't be surprised if you find that it doesn't live up to the hype. But if you want a good laugh, you'll be much better off with some *good* movies.

This is definitely not the worst movie I have ever seen, but given all the hype surrounding this movie, I have never been so disappointed about anything. The main character was likable, I could relate to him. That lasted about 10 minutes. Then his ""friends"" from work entered the scene. Who the hell were these losers? The part with the poker game was horrid. It reminded me of Porky's (the worst movie I have ever seen, by the way). The scene with him lying about his sexual experiences was utterly concocted nonsense of concocted nonsense that was not even remotely funny. I would have walked out (something I have only done 4 times before: Star Wars, Porky's, Police Academy, and Austin Powers, if you are interested), but my wife (who thinks this movie is great) wouldn't leave, and she was my ride home. I usually don't take her too seriously on movie issues because she thinks ""Malibu's Most Wanted"" is wonderful. Since it has been several months since I saw this movie, I can not even remember any more of this utterly forgettable movie.

","When I saw this movie, I was hoping for a halfway decent comedy. I find adult comedy to be hard to come by, these days, and had heard that Virgin would be a good one. I was disappointed.<br/><br/>The humor is adolescent at best. Even though the lead actors seemed to have some chemistry, the dialog was forced, and seemed completely surreal at times. The close-ups on the confused face of our hero (Steve Carrell), although humorous at the beginning became dry and rote. Very dull after awhile.<br/><br/>The interaction at the planned-parenthood clinic was marginally funny, but only marginally, and the ""was that a real question?"" comments from the ""educator"" were offensive.<br/><br/>All in all, I found the story trite, which is hard to achieve with such a concept, and the acting stiff.

Seriously - half of the script came out straight from the toilet and half of it - straight from the cliché world of 'phrases we use in Hollywood when we make a film about love'...

"ametaphysicalshark","Null","3","6","30 March 2009"," A masterclass in raunchy humor with a touch of class and humanity
","Sure, Kevin Smith did Judd Apatow before Judd Apatow did it. Sentimental relationship drama surrounded by raunchy dude humor. However, as much as I like some of Smith's movies, Apatow is in a whole other league, and makes a much more successful argument for sex jokes and excessive swearing being a valid form of comic expression. We talk about sex all the time, it's in our nature, yet somehow comedy heavily focused on the subject is relegated very often by major, respectable critics and more highbrow audiences to the lowest of the low. In 2005, by making a sex comedy centered on a 40 year old (virgin) and with a female love interest played by a 46 year old, Judd Apatow made the sex comedy respected again. Thanks to critical raves from places you'd never expect them from and an appreciative audience and successful theatrical run, admitting to liking ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" doesn't make you an idiot, apparently.<br/><br/>Of course Judd Apatow already had quite the cult audience thanks to the seminal teen drama ""Freaks and Geeks"", which puts to shame any other exploration of teenage angst, and remains one of the sweetest, classiest TV shows ever made, and his several other notable projects. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" has a great screenplay. I see no reason to dispute that claim. It's a tight, well-crafted story, the central characters are well-developed for the most part (and the tertiary, deliberate caricatures are also brilliant thanks to perfect delivery of perhaps iffy dialogue), and there is a perfect harmony and balance between the comedy and the drama. <br/><br/>But let's boil this thing down to a simple sex farce. On that level it is, honestly, quite brilliant. As stated before I find it an absolutely idiotic idea that sex is so frequently seen as a childish, juvenile subject for comedy, given how it is not only a driving force in the lives of many of us, but generally the one thing which connects us as a species, and, though debatable, probably really the main purpose of our existence: to procreate and reproduce. Simple biology. Now, of course, sex jokes can become exceptionally dull and tiresome, but Apatow is brilliant at creating an aesthetic where the vulgarity doesn't overwhelm the story. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" contains vulgarity, but is not a vulgar movie. The conversations are real, they're funny because they're real, they're funny because they are occasionally very fresh, they're funny because they are grounded in an emotional story for these characters.<br/><br/>They are also funny because the comic timing of the cast is flawless. Seth Rogen, not really just being Seth Rogen on autopilot here (it's a slightly different character than his others if you think about it), is terrific and he's the weak link the film. Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Jane Lynch, Gerry Bednob, Elizabeth Banks, and oh my lord Steve Carrel are absolutely, absolutely PERFECT here. Credit to them, but credit to Apatow as well as a director for getting them to do such amazing work. There's not one line that's even a tiny bit off. Apatow's visual sensibility also really helps. There are actually several bits of extremely clever film-making here, and just when you think he could be losing you he pulls something off again which makes you rethink that. <br/><br/>Where ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" fails is, as far as I'm concerned, in the clumsy climax of the film. It's not really funny, it suddenly becomes very typical and obvious, and what Apatow chooses for the final scene just didn't work for me at all, although it probably gets praise from a lot of people just for being different. I thought it lazy and unfunny. But it doesn't really matter because until the final five minutes ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a comedy masterclass. Perfect writing, perfect direction, perfect comic timing. It contains no great insights into human nature, but is a phenomenal, phenomenal example of its craft. I'll have to see it again before deciding, but this might be one of my favorite movies. I have almost no interest in the sillier stuff Apatow does (""Walk Hard"", ""Zohan"", etc.), but I can't wait for ""Funny People""."

","One observing the title of this movie for the first time would be under very much the same impression I was upon seeing the trailer for it; that it would simply be the newest in a string of the increasingly popular slapstick sexual comedies that never fail to please the numb-minded audience. You would say that I was surprised upon viewing it, and the experience was quite different, but its duty as a comedy never reached trough.<br/><br/>Being introduced to Andy brought forth an infinite potential of pleasing jokes but his evidently completely disoriented self, in terms of realizing the simple nature of a normal person, was only the target for the best of what the movie has to offer; Andy's small group of sadistic and apparently sexually experienced friends who after clearing up the theory that their action figure-collecting friend was homosexual, realize with much pride that their dear co-worker is a virgin and it immediately becomes their duty to ""help"" this person who was to become an even poorer soul upon their efforts.<br/><br/>Unintentionally antagonized by the prolonged description of the purpose of life, with a substantial bit of graphic sexual references, from his Middle Eastern co-worker Mooj, hit on by his seemingly sexually well- endowed boss, Paula, given pearls of wisdom about growing pot from his simple minded buddy Cal, adrift in the notion of deep romance from slacker Dave and utterly sent in the wrong direction by the ""well laid"" plans of the ladies man Jay, Andy meets only further confusion to be directed in the right directions when he falls for a woman running a ""We sell your stuff on Ebay"" store.<br/><br/>You might say that through these utterly painful learning experiences (and waxing sessions) that the viewer would be sympathetic for Andy, but in reality, the specter of the simple power of your friends to make feeble attempts at assistance (pioneered so brilliantly in The Big Lebowski) and engaging in malevolent pranks (such as locking you in a display room with a porno on) brings you to the notion that this comedy is one you are all to familiar with, and it is just Hollywood that allows this simplicity to unfold into a plethora of flawed personality demonstrations and sexual jokes whose roots you have already seen in past works, but come out in a more ingenious way than ever could have been thought to be conceived.<br/><br/>The sustained use of profanity to convey the utter comedies that unfold through the dimwitted friends and their Middle Eastern coworkers who just further substantiate the situations drastic effects on Andy's ""adult growth"" becomes a second language, one to be quoted again and again, and one that brings you up to think of Andy as someone just as common as anybody's friend and seemingly cheered on on the sidelines by a group of misfits who seemingly seek benevolence and end up inadvertently flushing you down the toilet (or sending a transvestite prostitute to meet with you).<br/><br/>The measure of how much you liked the recent comedies that have attempted to make sexual humor flawless has no effect on your attraction towards this movie.

"mOVIemAN56","8","3","6","16 July 2007"," Solid film. Shows Carrell has talent and that the rest of the brat pack is just as good
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is one film I've been wanting to see for sometime now. I've been a huge fan of Carrel since seeing him in Bruce Almighty and The Office (US). Carrel has shown his talent through his various projects over the past two years and The 40 Year Old Virgin was the one that first brought him to the public. Let's face it, The Office wasn't well liked in the US until '06 and he had a small role in Bruce Almighty. I went in with high hopes for Carrel and The 40 Year Old Virgin and I must say I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The film follows that of Andy Stitzer, a well meaning electronics store worker. Also working at the store are his three good friends: David, Jay, and Cal. One night while playing poker, his three friends discover that Andy is still a virgin and take it upon themselves to help their good friend to lose his virginity. Andy is very reluctant and confused by the whole ordeal but goes along with his friends not exactly knowing what to do or even if he really wants to.<br/><br/>4/5 Stars Carrel really does show his talent off in the role of Andy Stitzer. He brings out the character of Andy very well. He shows that Andy is a very innocent, very pleasant individual who is well meaning and really a new-bee to the whole situation on the more physical aspects of relationships. Andy is meant to be a sweet guy and Carrel makes him that relatively easy while bringing tons of laughs. An overall very strong performance from Steve Carrel.<br/><br/>In support are three great actors: Paul Rudd (Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy) Romany Malco (Blades of Glory) and Seth Rogen (Knocked Up). All three attempt to give Andy advice the whole movie and all three make hilarious remarks and have memorable scenes. Seth Rogen really helped his career by taking a supporting role in this, now he's in the biggest comedy of 2007. Paul Rudd has always been hilarious and he holds nothing back as the goofy and ex-girlfriend obsessed salesman. Romany Malco is rather new to me though he was hilarious throughout the film yet still the least funniest of the three friends. Overall a good combo to play the three friends.<br/><br/>What makes me like The 40 Year Old Virgin is how much unsuspecting humor there is throughout the film. A good portion of the film was improvised by the actors and this makes for the best humor I think. Also the film is very wise. It doesn't have too many 'dirty' jokes and the ones that are present aren't exactly overly offensive. The jokes are well thought out and, while the language is strong, there is nothing else to really turn a person away. There is barely any potty humor and most of the jokes come from the character Andy's inexperience and failure to understand certain things about women.<br/><br/>Carrel really breaks through with The 40 Year Old Virgin. He is quickly becoming a star in Hollywood with his role on The Office and Little Miss Sunshine. He really gives a lot of laughs in the movie and with the help of a strong supporting cast, makes the film work. The writing is very good, the directing is solid, and the actors are top notch. I had a great time watching this though the first 20 minutes I nearly fell asleep. The rest of the film is golden though and will keep people laughing until the end."

All the scenes were just great and so hilarious, like the waxing his hairy chest, I'm not a guy, but I was screaming for him! That looked so painful! I think in some sick way I gave guys a few more points after watching that, the things they go through just to make women happy.<br/><br/>It's a heart warming and very funny story that anyone could enjoy.

","Best. Comedy. Ever. Maybe not the funniest but the best none the less! Oh my god!!! How can a COMEDY be this good? I had no idea what kind of an actor Steve Carell was a after seeing Bruce Almighty but judging from that film I'd say he was nothing special. This movie sure proved me wrong! All the references to other movies were great and very funny to watch. And my favorite the ""Dawn Of The Dead"" remake playing on the TV in the background was very funny and great to see for fans of the movie (like me). The fact that they had nudity and it is a comedy and it's not a teen comedy is the most remarkable thing I have ever seen! It was done in such a classy way that I wouldn't even be embarrassed to show this movie to my mom.<br/><br/>Now i do admit that i was extremely embarrassed watching this during the first few scenes with the awkward moments and when they all find out that he's a virgin but you know what? That's just credit to Carells acting and the directing. I tell you Judd Apatow is now one of my favorite director/writers. I can't wait to see Fun With Dick And Jane! Paul Rudd the guy from friends who plays David was quite funny in this. You know I always knew he'd make it after I saw him on that show. He's actually very funny. And his acting here in this movie is actually very good and funny! I actually think that the character Andy Stitzer is a character who a lot of people can identify with. I mean at least teenagers who haven't had sex yet. The way he acts and talks to himself like getting all psyched up about every small little thing in stead of just stop thinking and to just do it. Which he does do in the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Apparently most of the dialogue was improvised and i gotta say....I didn't notice it that well. I mean the dialogue did seem a bit more natural than in other movies so if you just stop and listen to it closely for a moment I guess you can tell. But this is in no way a bad thing of course. Another thing I loved was the small skit-like scenes with just funny dialogue. I tell you sometimes I thought I was watching a Kevin Smith movie. Like the guy who wanted to buy the high heels shoes or the whole ""Do you know how i know you're gay?"" thing. Now I mentioned this being like a teen comedy right? Well it really isn't but it has the same feel as a teen movie but the difference is that this movie was actually good.<br/><br/>All the main actors in this are not teens but in their 20s 30s and (of course) 40s. Such a great movie! I definitely recommend it to everyone because not only is it funny but it's very encouraging to people who haven't had sex yet."

","To be honest, despite the appalling title (but at least it does exactly what is says on the tin), this movie is not a bad way to waste a couple of hours if there's nothing on TV. The premise is harmless enough (well, by modern standards), the performances reasonable and and writing marginally funny (though at points is bordering on offensive). <br/><br/>The main problem with this film is it is painfully mediocre in every way. It lacks the biting edge of There's Something About Mary, similarly the ability to push humour to the very edge of acceptability which saved potential disasters like Scary Movie is also absent. Considering the subject matter, this film just wasn't, well, extreme enough in any sense of the word.<br/><br/>While it's nice to see Catherine Keener on screen, this is a far cry from her genius turn as Maxine in Being John Malkovich. Her character is painfully sweet and nice, even when she is supposed to be losing it, and as a result she is likable and forgettable, just like Steve Carell, who seems acting's equivalent of mashed potato - filling and pleasant but ultimately bland. <br/><br/>Potential mines of comedic gold, such as Andy taking his girlfriend's daughter to a family planning clinic, veer away from potential jokes so as not to cause offence. We are supposed to accept that a girl pleasuring herself with a shower head is the height of kinkiness- this may have been so twenty years ago but now we can't see what the fuss is about. The only thing provocative about this film is its title.<br/><br/>We are confronted by scene after scene which could be axed with no scarring to the remainder of the film - conversations between Andy's co-workers which are not only irrelevant to the plot, but also completely unfunny and not even interesting, and as for the transvestite prostitute - talk about inexplicable!<br/><br/>That said, there are laughs to be had - usually to be found in the supporting characters who are unfortunately sidelined once they begin to distract from Andy's dull journey on his quest to lose his cherry. Andy's nymphomaniac iron-lady boss, his unbelievably bitter co-worker and his 'freaky' pot-smoking friend are all good for a giggle or two, but, like the rest of the film, lack enough oomph to pull the screenplay from its mediocrity.<br/><br/>The finale is also a complete farce - as if the screenwriters ran out of ideas and at 3am after smoking a lot of pot and wanting to head out for waffles came up with this claggy and utterly unnecessary denouement. I could have sat on a keyboard and produced a better close to this film.<br/><br/>See this movie if you find There's Something About Mary too offensive, and have two hours to spare. Otherwise, there are many better comedies out there."
"bastard_wisher","4","3","6","1 January 2006"," Better than usual for the genre I guess... but still not worth the hype
","As this type of film goes (for lack of a better term, I'll say the ""lowbrow teen humor comedy""), ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" really isn't bad. It does it's best for what it is. To it's credit it is much less lowbrow than other films of it's ilk, such as the Farrelly Brothers' stuff (even the essentially sweet-natured ""Something About Mary"" had it's fair share of gross-out sight gags, nearly absent in ""The 40 Year Old Virgin""), or the putrid recent Ryan Reynolds vehicles, for example. I suppose it is much closer in spirit to the recent Will Farrell/Vince Vaugh/Owen Wilson/Ben Stiler films, although admittedly of those I've only seen ""Old School"", so it really isn't much to go on. Like I said, the usual gross-out gags are surprisingly scarce, thankfully. If anything, the film plays more like a romantic comedy, although a particularly goofy, unsentimental one. All that said, nothing can help the film overcome it's greatest obstacles. More than anything the film just can't escape it's own average, mainstream-ness. As much promise as the film shows, it never amounts to anything above conveyor-belt standards. Quite frankly, it just isn't artistic or well-crafted enough. It never manages to seem as much like a labor of love as it does a piece of product. It certainly isn't shot at all remarkably, although I saw opportunity. Likewise, I couldn't help but re-imagine the film with a superior cast of actors like John C. Reilly, Don Cheadle and Philip Seymour Hoffman. On one hand, this indicates that the film definitely has potential. But it also makes clear that the film never rises above convention. From it's well-conceived but ultimately place-holder characters to it's formulamatic montage-and-music matches, the film never manages to become anything truly distinctive. Really, I think the film would have been much better off if it had been directed by someone with true talent like , say, Paul Thomas Anderson. Oh wait, wasn't that called ""Punch-Drunk Love""?"

Andy is a nice guy who has not had much luck with women, but as the film progresses he discovers that maybe sex just isn't as important as people make out.<br/><br/>This is a nice sex comedy and Andy is very amiable played superbly by Steve Carell who will surely hit it big after this movie. Then there is great support by the sexy and likable Catherine Keener. Paul Rudd also adds humorous support as one of Andy's friends.<br/><br/>As you'd expect there are plenty of low brow gags as well as some great one-liners and overall this is a charming and funny film, while Carell will certainly be one to watch for next year, and may star in his own sequel to Jim Carrey's Bruce Almighty which Carell was a co-star. ****"
"The_BIGGEST_Critic","4","3","6","17 December 2005"," Hit and Miss movie, ignore the hype
","I kept hearing the hype about this movie and decided to finally rent it on DVD to find out if it was really that funny. It's mostly not that great, at least for me. There were a few complaints along the way, as well as some good things: <br/><br/>1. Why did I know, before I even saw the first frame of this movie, that the ""40 year old virgin"" was going to be a dork/nerd/geek/weirdo? Oh my god, people, do you absolutely HAVE to be so predictable? Isn't it POSSIBLE for a virgin to be a normal, functioning member of society? Instead, this guy is a typical dork, a loner stuck in a 1977 time warp where he still collects toys and paints toy figurines. He has no friends, dresses badly, and doesn't have social skills. Let's not forget that he also still rides a bicycle and never learned to drive a car. Hmm, any other stereotypical stupidity we could trot out, while we're at it? Oh yeah...<br/><br/>2. Don't forget, a 40 year old virgin man would also know NOTHING about sex, right? After all, he's a virgin. WRONG. This guy would be the MASTER (pun intended) of porn. He would have the world's largest collection of porn videos and would know all about how to ""pleasure one's self"". Yet, this movie assumes that he knows so little about the female anatomy that he thinks a woman's breasts feel like...sandbags?? Puhleeze. And the way his friends find out that he's a virgin in this movie is so forced that they would have been better off if they had just paused the movie and had the director do a voice over that says ""...and here's where Andy's friends find out he's a virgin. And now, we'll go to our next scene."" <br/><br/>3. The movie makers would probably tell you that the message this movie sends is that it's ""okay"" to be a virgin. But the message they actually send in this movie is that it's not okay, because you'll end up as a unhappy, maladjusted, single dork who collects toys.<br/><br/>4. Jane Lynch does a great, understated job of portraying Paula, Andy's boss. No over-the-top performance here, but seething with sexual frustration...nicely done. I would like to point out, however, that what her character does in this movie would be considered sexual harassment of the absolute highest order. If it were a male doing it to a female, N.O.W. would have their panties all in a knot.<br/><br/>5. Kudos also to Gerry Bednob, who plays Mooj, a character that they could have made an entire movie around...LOL! Although the ""cursing Indian guy"" has been done to death and is kind of a trite character, he was very well done here and hilarious in every scene he was in. I want more of Mooj! <br/><br/>6. Steve Carell was endearing as the lead character, and Catherine Keener was serviceable as his love interest.<br/><br/>7. SPOILER- Trish comes over to Andy's house to tell him it's okay with her that he's a virgin, only to find that he has a porn video collection (previously forced on him by one of his co-worker buddies). Could someone please explain to me how she suddenly comes to the conclusion that he must be some kind of serial sex killer because he has porn videos? That particular plot point was so WEAK that the writer/director should be embarrassed that it was left in the film. I would be more worried about a 40 year old man that DOESN'T have a porn video collection of some kind. Yet, this is supposed to be the event that causes the big conflict in the movie...LAME. END SPOILER.<br/><br/>Overall, it was an okay movie, but only as a rental on a slow night. The humor was mostly low-brow, an obvious effort to be ""Something about Mary""-ish, and some of the characters were forgettable. There was potential here as far as the concept goes, but the ""40 year old virgin"" ultimately didn't satisfy me."

","I really don't see why this got such a high rating. To me it was very average, and nearly bored me to death. There was not a single actually funny moment in this 2+ hours drag, just some slight chuckles here and there. Perhaps the movies of recent have gone so bad that people don't recognize what's actually good anymore.<br/><br/>This film doesn't know if it wants to be a gross slapstick movie or a romantic comedy. Sadly it fails at both. Actually from the other reviews, i expected this to be a comedy with really gross humor, but there were none of that, just utter boredom. And this was the unrated version. Just one mildly sick joke involving a woman and a horse. The language used a lot of the F word, which is just a sad attempt to make it look 'funny' or gross.<br/><br/>Only thing good was the ending, which had this pretty humorous dancing sequence. So to put it short, don't waste your time with this. Watch Airplane or some other actually funny comedy instead."

Then things are well enough for Andy to fall into his first relationship but Andy is too frighten to tell Trish that Andy is still a virgin.<br/><br/>Directed by Judd Apatow made an original comedy with fresh gags about porn, speed dating and the gross-out perils of hooking up with drunk girls. The film is clever enough to never takes leave of humanity. Carell gives an excellent comic performance in this movie. Keener is well match as Carell's first love. Making Carell and Keener a believable screen couple. Rudd, Malco and Rogan are fun as Carell's buddy. This is actually the most satisfying sex comedy in years. It is also probably the best comedies of 2005. The movie is buoyantly clever and always entertaining. Written by the director and actor:Carell. (**** ½/*****)."
"almonetts","10","3","6","11 September 2005"," Extremely humorous and full of heart
","Directed by Judd Apatow and co-written with the movie's leading man Steve Carell, the 40-Year Old Virgin is extremely humorous and full of heart.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer (Carell) has never done the deed and it becomes known to three co-workers, who make it their duty to correct this anomaly. Andy prefers to compensate by creating seemingly healthy obsessions such as collecting action figures (including the Six Million Dollar Man's boss), gaming and the like. Just in case you forgot, he is 40-years old. As we come to learn through flashbacks, he really has tried, but just has not been ""successful"". <br/><br/>Until now Carell's possible career highlights have been as a ""Daily Show"" correspondent and the lead on one of the most under-looked and great groan-inducing comedies, ""The Office"" (American version). He has also stole scenes in ""Anchorman"" and ""Bruce Almighty"". This role showcases his expert timing, charisma, knowledge of constructing a joke and romantic/dramatic reach. <br/><br/>Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco are cast as the co-workers and eventual buddies who insist on passing on their collective wisdom, baggage and mistakes. Each character is perfectly honed, project great matter of fact sensibility and hilarious in every scheming scene/disaster. The stage is then set for two crazy encounters, which continue to reinforce his decision to remain a virgin for all eternity. I must mention Leslie Mann (the drunk), Elizabeth Banks (the sex freak), Jane Lynch (the boss) and the elder Indian co-worker, each of whom generates great laughs and support in their roles. <br/><br/>Andy insists that he will do this the right way, which at once is ambitious...finding a perfect woman, building a relationship and making it work (I should take some notes). His buddies come to realize that there is a degree of merit to the approach, which they have come to have forgotten through their encounters over the years. He believes he has found this in Trish, played by the always stellar and exuberant Catherine Keener. Do you want to know why this woman is a star in my eyes? Witness their first encounter...she is effortlessly vulnerable, insecure and sexy. Their chemistry is wonderfully playful, sincere and believable given both their characters' background. <br/><br/>Whilst in one case the film resorts to a low-brow gross out gag, it doesn't allow the crude and now clichéd driven Farrelly-brothers set-ups to ensue and overtake its huge heart. The movie is also insightful as can be seen in the expertly written send-up anti-gay-bashing scene "" I know you're gay because..."" <br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie is a brilliant piece of comedic work and is set to a great accompanying soundtrack, which itself strikes a euphoric chord. However its true worth can be seen in the way it is elevated by the writers' projecting our own bouts of sexual anxiety, their ability to construct jokes beyond a level of crass running gags and the credibility of every single cast member's performance, especially the genius Steve Carell."

","I rate this up there with Wedding Crashers, something about Mary and various other funny movies. I loved all the scenes where Steve Carrel was talking about nailing and what not. The timing is so perfect. Especially when he screams to that black guy in the night club. The movie shows how it's not really that bad to be a 40 year old virgin. Yes, you heard me right, this movie is kind of aimed, in a slight way, to virgins to show them that it is not something to be ashamed of if you're a virgin. The last scene was great and the comedic timing between the pals and Steve Carrel was perfect. I just hope that Steve Carrel continues to make a TON MORE movies that are in this vein.

","Disappointed by ""Wedding Crashers"" lack of true comedy and lame attempt at a love story, I awaited ""40 Year Old Virgin"" with the same hopeful anxiety I attach to the Chicago Cubs, hoping for greatness but anticipating tragic levels of failure. I am pleased to report that this film is more like the Boston Red Sox, every time you think you've seen it all, it's finished, there's no hope left for sex-comedies, it will forever be an endless parade of fart jokes and catchphrases, out pops this gem. Don't get me wrong, this movie is crass, it is rude, it assails your sensibilities and outrages uptight Christians. But it bears a closer resemblance to ""There's Something About Mary"" and not as much to ""American Pie"", it's teenage counterpart. See, this film is produced, written, directed and acted by genuinely funny and intelligent people, and what results is a genuinely funny and intelligent film. It's imperfect, sure, but it aspires to achieve that which it achieves, and that's a lot.<br/><br/>I can't think of a film that makes the non-virgins look sort of uncool too, unlike the equally virginity obsessed ""American Pie"". But this film is a film about four men growing to true sexual and emotional maturity, albeit through some particularly hilarious means. Steve Carell plays the affable Andy, a closet virgin who has tried over the years but just ended up blowing it (pardon the pun). He works at a low-wage electronics store job and is surrounded by other stunted youths. Their obsession with sex is his obsession with action figures; it's pleasurable and it's fun, but they don't realize that they don't get it. <br/><br/>One of Andy's coworkers is a pensive dude who at first seems like the sanest one but soon comes off as the most confused. Then you have his black friend who is convinced he has to be a playa to not be a playa hater.<br/><br/>And Paul Rudd portrays a sympathetic loner who obsesses over a girl he never earned and wishes he was still dating. Compared to these three, who gode Andy into sexual maturity, Andy seems relatively stable. But it takes some real shaking up for the four friends to realize that real sexuality is about more than ""getting lucky"" with hot chicks. And then there's all those parts that are just hilarious. And that's the thing about this movie, it makes its point without sounding like a Republican senator or Pat Robertson. It's a bunch of hip dudes realizing that sexsexsexsexsex isn't all it's cracked up to be, and maybe we should all slow down and wait it out, be careful, see what happens. Andy learns the value of relationships and then is free to explore sex with a clean conscience, something we all would love no doubt, in hindsight after all."
"aqua_swing","8","3","6","29 August 2005"," Everybody likes Andy.
","After years of writing some of the funniest things on the Daily Show, Steve Carell takes to his own, this beast that he and director Judd Apatow penned together, The 40 Year Old Virgin.<br/><br/>We've had a lot of gross-out humor movies come and go in the past few years that have had decent parts to them, but very few (Old School, Something about Mary) have ever been complete films. So many just dig directly for the jugular and try to just make you completely forget about an actual storyline that people can look at and identify with, in the least. But Virgin achieves this. It's character development in Andy, the main character is good, along with all secondary characters trying to help this guy get out and let it all hang out, to find that one who's going to get the years of frustration out of him.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener is a steady love interest in this movie, too. Whenever it seems to slow down or the movie comes to a point of eye rolling, the chemistry between Keener and Carell save it, and bring you back around again for another round (of well placed) silly jokes, including that scene that everyone's seen on the commercial, the done-in-one take chest waxing. Why would Carell do that? Because, he wants Andy to be real, he wants the audience to cheer on his dorky forty year old through all of his action figure collecting quirkiness, and by the film's conclusion, there isn't a person in the house who doesn't like him."

","This movie is great people, you must see it! The cast is wonderful, they all play such amusing parts. I laughed so many times I was almost in tears trying to get my breath back. The language is probably a bit stronger then it needs be, but the humor is right on, and its great to see a film that takes on so many taboos in way that has not been seen, and then even further then American Pie! The amazing thing is although he seems kinda sad in someways, this man is was actually happy the way he was with his toys and bicycle. I thought the message was good, especially in that he waited until marriage. Still that Beth girl was so hot, I wanted her, and probably would have done a Cal myself. The end was just so absurd that I could not help laughing and enjoying it. Great movie, a definite must see!!!"
"Robert_duder","8","3","6","27 August 2005"," A very very big surprise!!
","I have done other reviews of certain films that feature what I have been known to call the Ferrell Comedy Troup. Basically the entire cast of Anchorman. They show up in each other's movies (Wedding Crashers, Bewitched, every Ben Stiller movie) and the lot of them just tend to make movies I can't stand. Steve Carell was one of the more talented members of the Anchorman team although that is saying little to nothing. So I had NO expectations of this film. I assumed it would be of the same caliber featuring many of the same actors from the troupe (after all I already knew Paul Rudd was in it.) I assumed it would be gross out comedy, over the top stupid SNL type skit comedy and I was totally shocked and amazed by what I saw.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin will likely be a classic sex comedy in the same vein as Porky's or Animal House or Revenge Of The Nerds. Yes the film is all about getting laid, yes some of the jokes are pretty tasteless for those that are weak in the politically incorrect department. Still the film deals with the sex topic and being a virgin in a much more compassionate, funny, laugh out loud kind of way. Whereas I full expected Carell's character (the virgin) to be the butt of all jokes, instead he repeatedly comes out on top, above all the other supposedly ""macho"" guys and he is the nice guy who finishes first. A lot of the comedy rather than being the gross out type (which there was some of) was more about the actual script, some great dialog and funny moments. One of the real stars of the film was Paul Rudd who plays one of Carell's best friends David. His character was so incredibly hilarious. I had no idea Rudd had this kind of physical comedy in him. His expressions and dialog were just hysterical. The four main characters played by Carell, Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen have great chemistry, far better and far more real than the annoying Anchormen cast (which three of those four guys were in.) They all had unique characters and had some unique and funny moments with Carell as they try to ""teach"" him to be a lover.<br/><br/>Romantic leading lady to Carell's character was Catherine Keener who I thought was okay. She did the job adequately and had decent chemistry with Carell, I just thought she wasn't the best addition to the cast. Director Judd Apatow who had done mostly TV work obviously knows comedy. He used the right amount of physical comedy, gross out comedy and the sudden rage of politically incorrect stereotypical racial comedy that offends some people and amuses others. Honestly I think I enjoyed this film more than Wedding Crashers and definitely found it funnier. The cast worked well together and more importantly the script is a complete surprise and not brain dead whatsoever which is a complete shock. To discover right up until the very end that this guy who is a virgin is a good thing and makes him a hero of the film is such a refreshing twist to what I imagined it would be like. Key scenes is Carell's chest waxing (which you think would be a drag after seeing it so much on the commercials...it's NOT, it's hilarious), all of Paul Rudd's scenes, Carell's trying the condoms, and all the physical comedy throughout. This is a real keeper and adults will love it's humor and I really think it's destined to become a sex classic. 8.5/10"
"MovieManMenzel","8","3","6","27 August 2005"," It might be raunchy and loaded with sex jokes but underneath it all ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" has a lot of heart.
","I remember when I first watched the trailer for this movie; I said to myself wow that looks like a good movie. I love Steve Carell in everything he has done so far and it's about time in my opinion that he got his own movie. With that being said, I walked into the theater to see ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" expecting a lot from the movie and all of the positive reviews it received. So did it live up to its hype? Well keep reading to find out.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is your typical dorky guy. He works at an electronics store, he collects things, he is always in good spirits, and overall he is a great person. One day at his job, Andy gets an offer from David (Paul Rudd) to come play poker with him and his buddies Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen). Andy is very excited about the offer and accepts but as they meet up that evening for the game, Andy gets more than he expects as his new friends find out that he is still a virgin and will stop at nothing in order to get Andy laid.<br/><br/>I typically don't like sex comedies because they are brainless and seem to use too many recycled jokes in order to get a laugh. Now granted this movie had a lot of brainless and raunchy jokes, probably too many for my tastes and in fact after the first 10 minutes of the film, they fire off at the audience probably every other minute. Some however do work and are actually creative and funny. But its more of the non sex gags that get the laughs, the famous chest waxing scene from the trailer and TV spots is probably one of the funniest scenes in the film and is even more so now knowing that Steve Carell actually had it done to him, there were no special effects involved there.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best part of the movie was the second half, after the film got past all the lets get Andy laid crap. The movie really took off, at least for me, when Andy found someone interested in him because it seemed very realistic. I really enjoyed the main character Andy because it seemed like a real character, and in fact even reminded me of myself at times. I like movies where you can relate to the characters or a character; it makes a film more enjoyable.<br/><br/>Despite the overuse of sex jokes, the movie works because of several reasons. The first and most important reason for me was that the characters in the film worked. They were real characters with real problems and the movie actually had character development. Reason two is even though the movie does end happily, it ends realistically. Andy may in fact get involved with someone but it's not a supermodel or a drop dead gorgeous woman but a single mom with three kids. It seems very believable to me. Also, the movie never really pokes fun of the main character for being a virgin and to me that was very refreshing because like Andy says in the movie ""it's a choice"" and the movie never seems to make fun of his choice. And finally, the movie never takes itself too seriously because while the story on the whole is very touching and sweet, the movie never gets mushy or soft and the ending which is my favorite scene in the movie shows that. It ends so randomly and hysterically.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow who wrote and directed the film has a future in film. He knows how to write comedy. I am looking forward to his next film ""Fun with Dick & Jane"" which he wrote the screenplay for. I think this guy will be around for a while.<br/><br/>In the end, there wasn't much about ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" that I didn't like. With Carell in the lead and the witty yet touching script really made this movie what it is. The jokes like I said are little too much at times but other than that this movie is really great. It could be quite possibly the best comedy of the year. I highly recommended it too all who want a good laugh and those who want to actually see a comedy movie with good characters.<br/><br/>MovieManMenzel's final rating for ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a 9/10."

In this you have the misadventures of Andy Stitzer as he tries to 'grow up'. Despite the pressure from his friends, he is in no hurry to change.

I would never recommend this film to anyone and I hope Americans wake up to problems in this film.<br/><br/>When it comes to analyzing the plot, this film falls short.

This movie had more bad language, nudity, sexual situations, and everything else that made it funny. The audience caught on to the feelings of confusion, hope, and nostalgia for everyone's first time and also had developing relationships with friends, co-workers, family, and neighbors.<br/><br/>There were many great laughs, lots of opportunity to skewer the singles' scene and modern relationships, but there was also a story of people seeking love.

I can't say I am a Steve Carell fan from his show ""The Office"" on NBC -something about the networks seems to make them adept at taking something cool and making it so...not cool. I think it would play better on cable. But I digress, this movie made me laugh until I wanted to stop. I think my only critique would be the run time seems a little long (206 min, I think). The supporting cast is great, the story avoided falling into the cliché third act conflict that you might expect. Steve Carell is a master at subtle expressions, which makes for half the humor in the show in my opinion. A study said recently that the best way to get women in a receptive emotional mood is to take them out where they will laugh -leaving the theater I have a habit of checking out people's expressions- I noticed the women's faces last night had a BIG afterglow on the way out. I bring that up, because male humor doesn't always have the same effect on women. ""Three Stooges"" -need I say more? Guys, you are safe on this one with her. I gave it a ""9"" out of ""10""."

Intoxicated women throw up on him and his own attempts to be cool and suave come out just as bad.<br/><br/>Anyway, despite profane talk, sexual situations, some comic drug use scenes and a little lag time (they could have cut at least 10 minutes), Andy comes to the conclusion that he isn't such a freak, while his buddies eventually re-evaluate their relationship with women.<br/><br/>Carrel, as the goofy man-child, shines here, going from vulnerable to sarcastic to frustrated while trying to please everyone but himself. As a co-screenwriter (with first-time director Judd Apatow, producer of ""Anchorman,"" ""Kicking & Screaming"" and TV's ""Freaks And Geeks"") Carrel is a young, dry Bill Murray with hang-dog expression and wide eyes. His efforts to woo women go from hilarious to pathetic (I mean how far can you get when your only mode of transportation is a Schwinn bicycle?!).<br/><br/>Also excelling is Catherine Keener (""Being John Malkovich"") as Trish, the first steady girl in Andy's life. All is not perfect in this relationship - she has three children and one grandchild - but it's a firm base for him to build a solid foundation on.<br/><br/>In the R-rated comedy vain of The ""Wedding Crashers"" and ""American Pie,"" sex  if done right  can be pretty funny.

","Being a virgin was best for Christ's mother, but losing virginity is a right of passage for most American males. For Steve Carell's Andy Stitzer it's a nightmare he has avoided for 40 years. He's a reluctant virgin traumatized by more than one aggressive girl in his youth, but his buddies think his time has come. Thus begins a tortuous journey to love and maturity for an electronics store salesman whose idea of a good time is making a perfect omelet or rearranging his perfectly stored action figures.<br/><br/>I thought ""Must Love Dogs"" with John Cusack and Diane Lane was the best romantic comedy of the summer, and more than I hoped for. But Virgin goes beyond just middle-aged dating; it explores the value of holding out for a higher level of meaning when engaging in sex;, and it satirizes the social norms that foster promiscuity. Ultimately it settles on the right mixture represented by Carell and his business neighbor, Catherine Keener's Trish.<br/><br/>Along the way is some insightful writing, often delivered with understated irony, by Andy and his two buddies. For instance, those who haunt video stores for offbeat memories know immediately that when Andy is counseled to be tough like David Caruso in Jade, the writers are geeky and knowing. The setup in the waxing salon, with Carell actually having his chest hair torn off and bleeding, reminds me of the outtakes of Peter Sellers as Chauncey Gardner in ""Being There,"" where he keeps trying to swear but ends up blowing the scene because he finds himself amusingly out of place. Andy swears at each rip of the adhesive, each time funnier than the last.<br/><br/>This is my first experience with Steve Carell; I hope it won't be the last. The same can be said of first time director Judd Apatow. Both are not virgins when it comes to delivering sophisticated comedy."

","I have to say I liked the film, the (somewhat stereotyped) characters and the funny set - up to the last 15 minutes. Here it got ridiculous as we are forced to believe good sex can only come from love relationship (it may but no it does not have to!!!) and the thrill seeking young temptress should be avoided like hell (except if you are the stoned loser of the gang). Will anybody believe the friends who wanted to get him into ""it"" would turn up at the lady's place to save him? What kind of rubbish! And to top all of this nonsense we are made to believe that the first time should only happen after Christian marriage ceremony. Ripping off the HAIR dance scenes to underfeed the sour morale. What a waster! To disguise this lame hypocritical nonsense we are over fed with rude language and some toilet humour scenes.<br/><br/>If any male virgin may read this: do yourself a favour and avoid this flic. Go out, meet the girls and have fun - this will be a better investment in your life.<br/><br/>3/10 for some good acting."

","Funny what packs the crowds in today, with this box-office hit another head-scratcher. Put four guys in a roundtable, have them talk like one-gear hormonal high schoolers, and ka-ching! Endless references to vaginas, breasts, conquests, along with F-words tossed in every other line of dialogue, and you have this dead excuse for a comedy. I'm not a prude by any means, but when jokes aren't mixed into the language, it looks more desperate than anything else. A bit of steam is picked up around the speed-dating montage, but not nearly enough to give this any life. Heavily populated by unrealistic characters and ridiculous outcomes, it was trial to sit through the whole thing. Sure, credibility is stretched in movies, but when every girl's a slut, employees are allowed to smash flouressent lights, videotape their butts, and get into car accidents with no repercussions, you only yell at the screen instead of laugh at it. Close it out with a stupid and forced musical number, and you can dive for the remote and end your misery."

"Pookyiscute","4","3","7","4 June 2006"," One of those happy endings...
","I'm not about to go ga-ga over this film, even though I appreciated the ending. It's not a film that I would recommend to anyone, even those who find the stupidest of comedies amusing, because it's not even one of those. <br/><br/>I found the film to be slow, and really unfunny at times. Although, the moments that were entertaining, had you in a midst of non-stop laughter. But, there was no force behind it. Steve Carrell, although portraying his part really well, and quite realistic (but, let's face it. How hard could it actually be to play a virgin?), he didn't have enough physical or written comedy in the script. The film is about a forty-year old man, who lives alone, collecting action figurines and works at an electronic store. He has never had sex, and after a lot of persuading by his male co-workers, he has decided to give casual sex a try. The next 90 minutes of the film, are dumb, and full of crazy little adventures that the poor man has to go through in order to ""get some"". I will admit, that there comes a point in the film, where you just want the guy to get it over with already and just have sex. But, you know that it's not that easy, and you wouldn't have rented a film like this, if it were. I found Paul Rudd, exceptionally funny in this film, since I've really only seen him in a couple of previous films, including ""Clueless"".<br/><br/>The zany ideas that go on in the film, are a bit ridiculous at times, and you find yourself waiting for the punch line, or in this case the end, to see what we've waited for the entire 116 minutes to find out.<br/><br/>The end is of course, sweet and cute, and in my opinion was written for all the sentimental girlie girls out there, like me, who like sweet and cute endings like these. Cathrine Keener is also very good, and very funny as she usually is. I love Catherine Keener, but what I like the most about her in this movie, is that she's not gorgeous, but quite real, and maybe not an average woman, but certainly not a playboy centerfold, which is what most leading ladies in these sort of films tend to personify. The acting was good, the directing was fine, but the script could have been a little bit juicier and more full of jokes. It lacked something, and although I would have no objection to watching it someday again, it's not a film that I will add to my collection.<br/><br/>The funniest line in the film, if I may quote, is when all the men are talking about the women that they've ""done"", and when it comes to Andy (Carrell), he's describing a woman's breast, and it's one of the funniest moments in the film. ""I love breasts. Yeah. They're like, bags of sand."""

Who could have envisioned a day when a man urinating in a tumescent condition -- and the resulting mess -- would make it into a mainstream comedy?

"fwomp","4","3","7","29 March 2006"," A Bit Too Shallow For My Taste
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is an adult comedy that tries too hard to be funny by infusing vulgarity and crude anti-social male behavior at nearly every turn (ala THE ARISTOCRATS).<br/><br/>It doesn't miss the mark completely, but the attempts at portraying a message of some significance get consistently marred by foul jokes that pull the viewer away from any true meaning. I realize this is a ""comedy"", but the message of what it's truly like to be a 40 year old virgin is never fully realized. All we know is that Andy (Steve Carell, The Daily Show) is a pretty boring virginal guy who collects action figures, works at an electronics store, and has never had sex with a woman in all his 40 years. This seems like a pretty shallow character representation ...and it is.<br/><br/>Where the comedy comes in is when Andy's fellow male coworkers discover his lifelong secret. They try to help him out by giving advice, introducing him to loose women, and trying to change his body image (the chest waxing was painful to watch, funny, and gross).<br/><br/>Andy finally meets Trish (Catherine Keener, CAPOTE) and falls head over heels in love. But his attempts to get close to her are stifled by his coworkers' advice and his lack of understanding of sexual behavior. This is where the comedy really could've gotten a leg-up on other shallow comedies (ex. DATE MOVIE) but doesn't take advantage of the opportunity. Instead we're given continual bathroom humor obviously directed at the teen movie-going crowd.<br/><br/>After finishing the film I had to ask myself if I really cared whether or not Andy got laid. And the answer was ""no."" I also felt that the ending of the film was very forced; a last ditch effort to make the 40 and over crowd somehow feel more connected to the character by putting in a musical number from the 1979 musical HAIR."
"PizzicatoFishCrouch","8","3","7","27 March 2006"," A sweet romcom about love (yes, I'm serious).
","Better late than never, so they say...<br/><br/>On a night playing Poker with three bawdy men, Andy Stitzer (the excellent newcomer to the Frat Pack scene, Steve Carell), a geeky toy-collector reveals that he has never done the dirty. Digs and mockery ensue, but the men also vow to get Andy to end his shameful virginity and find him a woman. Chest waxing and loose women follow, as well as a whole lot of male self-deprecation in Jud Apatow's silly, sweet and appropriately raunchy romantic comedy.<br/><br/>As a protagonist, Andy is a deeply likable, if slightly kooky guy. He rides a bicycle to work. He carefully paints his toy figurines, whilst chatting to them. And he only has eyes for Trish, an eBay entrepreneur from across the road. Trish is played by Catherine Keener, and it is her chemistry with Steve Carell that elevates this film above the generic gross-out formula. Their romance is presented in a careful, convincing way, without holding back on the jokes, but cleverly using Andy's virginity as both a convenience (the couple spend their time doing other things, such as conversing, flirting, or kissing) as well an obstacle (Trish cannot wait to get into Andy's pants, but he's still scared), that, only solidifies the belief in the pair's love for each other.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, whilst not quite to the standard of the leads, hold their roles well. Paul Rudd is funny is the guy who is still hung up on his heartless ex-girlfriend, whilst Romany Malco also amuses, though his character does nothing to dispel the African American infidel stereotype. However, despite that little hiccup, 40-Year-Old is extremely well written, for it blends comedy, drama and romance deftly, as well as creating two leads that we care about, amongst the bawdy humour, which, at some points, proves to be the movie's low point.<br/><br/>There are other flaws too, of course. There are lines that begin ""I know you're gay because"" which only manage a raised eyebrow, and the less said about that weird singsong at the end, the better. The running time of 2 hours is also to be questioned (romcoms are always like, 90 mins. Didn't you know that?) But for its faults, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a hilarious film, sometimes painfully so, but one that never fails to entertain.<br/><br/>B"

","There is a reason I always wait to see a film when its hype surpasses its use. I have done this before with the same results. The hype surrounding this film has died of course and it is still hanging in there. I choose to see this film tonight because I am, after all, curious and because I saw an add for the film today and the add was touting it's financials: $175m worldwide box office and $115m pay per view (and climbing)/rentals/sell through and any other way to get viewers to view. Those are astounding numbers...especially when the production budget is pegged at 26m. This film, and I choose to watch the 'unedited' version on pay per view, is AWFUL!! It is stupid, it is insulting, it is slow, it has mostly bad dialogue, and I could not wait for it to be over. I sat through the entire end credit roll as well. I was subjected to one of the most idiotic endings ever in a film. HELLO WORLD> I guess I am not part of it. I gave it a 2 rating because I was lucky enough to work on a major feature film and experience the tremendous work level it takes, the sense of community being with the same people daily creates and the let down when you hear 'It's A Wrap', I don't like saying any film is not worth the bucks to see it but this one is exactly that. I heard one line that actually made me laugh: ""Man, this place is packed."" ""Yeah, that's cause it's $9 a beer night"". I saw one scene that got my attention other than the luscious 'chicks' and that was the one where they were using an apple as a BONG!!! That's it. Not much else made me happy, laugh or feel like I was experiencing what could have been a very funny and touching experience. The main female interest WAS very good but she had to work hard to save even a small portion of this film. I will bet there were many who walked out of the theater on this one. Not only is it overly stupid but also it is hard (excuse the pun) to take all the idiocy of the characters. I understand it is suppose to be on that level but man, this one tops them all so far. The Farrelly Brothers (I may not have their name spelled right) sort of started this 'genre' and I have no clue as to how far it can go in grossness. And I am not a 40 yr old virgin. I have had my share and continue to have yours too! Do not waste even the $3.99 I had to pay."

A generation ago a priest could have refused to marry two people who had sex outside of marriage, and now he is flabbergasted that someone could actually make it to the altar a virgin. 'Go and consummate already!' as if the act had been long overdue, even though the two weren't married before, and therefore committing a deadly sin under the church's dogma."

Immediately now his three friends (I guess you can call them that) are doing everything in their power to get Carell to have sex for the first time. There are loose women abound in wild clubs, the super-kinky Elizabeth Banks (arguably the best performer in a sexually-charged role) in a nearby bookstore and single mom Catherine Keener who works at an EBay specialty shop. Carell quickly likes Keener, while his pals give him loads of advice (mostly awful) as a thin line develops between having a sexual relationship and just having a meaningful relationship. Super raunchy, disgusting, verbally graphic antics all the way, but still strangely a film that has loads of emotion and heart. The characters all have a list of quirks, but ultimately they are likable and totally believable. Like ""Wedding Crashers"" there is really not much of a brain to be found within, but I liked the final product anyway. Carell and Keener have a subtle chemistry that works. The friends (led by Rudd) are comedic tidal waves and Banks continues to be one of Hollywood's best kept secrets. Over-achieving adult-oriented comedy that is a little too heavy for youngsters, but an admittedly hilarious film for those of mature ages. 4 stars out of 5."

","The 40 Year Old Virign is a refreshingly raunchy film. This film, and The Wedding Crashers, are a sign that the R-rated film may be making a comeback. In a tepid desert of PG-13 films, we adults need a true oasis of mature comedy every now and then.<br/><br/>Already a profitable venture after only a couple weeks at the box office, this film is sure to launch actor/writer Steve Carell into orbit as a major star. The film is crude, but in a Blazing Saddles kind of way. Crudeness if done with good intentions can be the most hilarious kind of comedy. The film does a wonderful job of creating multi-dimensional characters the audience can actually care about. The film never bogs down, and that is quite an achievement for a comedy that spans nearly two whole hours.<br/><br/>Steve Carell plays... well like the title says: a forty year old guy who has never had sex. He's had his chances, but blown all of them. After time he just seemed to give up as a younger man. He retreated into his own little world of video games, vintage action figures, and celibacy. Once his friends at work learn his secret, they set out to get him laid by any means necessary leading to one hilarious scene after another. What's odd is that Carell's character seems oddly at peace without the need for sex. He seems happy enough without it, but once he meets a woman he really has feelings for, sex becomes inevitable.<br/><br/>What was crude about it? Well.... there were numerous racial jokes, but you have to understand where they were coming from. There was nothing mean-spirited about any of them, but I'm sure some people would be offended. Some people are always looking to be offended. There are gay jokes, drunk driving jokes, you name it. Maybe we shouldn't be laughing at these things, but dammit I was. Again and again.<br/><br/>It was strange. Not too many other people at the showing I saw were laughing all that much. Maybe it was because it was an early afternoon showing and people weren't geared up to laugh yet. I hate to be the only person in a theater laughing out loud, so I had to try and stifle my laughter but it seldom worked. This film is a hoot, and I'm glad it is scoring as highly as it is so far on this site. Even stuffy critics like Roger Ebert seem to have been won over by this film and its charismatic star.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a truly funny film then go see this one immediately!!! Reward the makers of this classic film by taking your friends, as well. I couldn't ask more from any comedy.<br/><br/>10 of 10 stars. The Hound has spoken."

","""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is ""Animal House"" 27 years later (if the frat boys were 13 then, which is how they acted). Like that film, regardless of the ""R"" rating, the matinée I was at attracted babies up to boomers, with each segment laughing at different jokes (well, the babies mostly cried.) The kids hooted at every frequent use of four letter words, which were used quite naturally in conversations, and didn't get any of the funny musical references to the '70's.<br/><br/>Director/co-writer Judd Apatow and co-writer/star Steve Carell well capture single guys exaggerated braggadocio to each other, with each having a different immaturity issue (while they all share a love of video games) and still oblivious about and inept with women. <br/><br/>However, the trash talking takes an unnecessary racial turn with Asian and African-American co-workers for repetitive jokes that went on too long of other guys talking black that was already classically done in ""Airplane,"" plus the constant gay joshing, that like in ""Four Brothers,"" defensively borders on homophobia. <br/><br/>Carell's character is most believable when he's not parroting these other guys but is genuinely himself. While it recalls HBO's ""Mind of the Married Man,"" it is very funny when it braves original takes on dating and sex education, hair waxing and condom use. Some of the actors' cracking up looks like genuine reaction to the goings on. Paul Rudd's lovelorn depressive is particularly amusing.<br/><br/>The film is bolstered by the strong performances by women, as these are real actresses and not just the usual bland beauties such comedies employ, with the women getting the last laugh on these guys. Catherine Keener's character has a real, amusingly complicated life (with a nice promotion for e-Bay) and past that informs the development of her relationship with the titular character. Elizabeth Banks, notably more bubbly than in ""Heights,"" is charming. <br/><br/>The film does go on a bit long, and while evidently some jokes were cut due to unsympathetic responses of test audiences, more could have been. The credits close with a nice thank you to Michael McDonald - ""You rock""-- as his DVD is a source of a running gag. A lot of pop culture references go by --actors, movies, TV shows--and I wasn't sure if they were product placement or had particular resonances."

Having spent the last two rainy Saturdays seeing ""Wedding Crashers"", this was a nice supplement to a summer of surprisingly funny movies. The previews do not do this movie justice. Generally, TV spots and trailers for summer comedies highlight the funniest parts of the films, and audiences are left with the scraps that somehow made it past the cutting room floor. Not the case with The 40 year old Virgin. This may or may not do well in reviews, it's not ""Sideways"" with scenes that are funny because they are so dark, and yet captured with complete realism. And yet it's not over the top, absurdism like last summer's ""Anchorman"". It's somewhere in between and makes use of the difference.<br/><br/>Steve Carell, as suspected, can hold his own in feature films. His demeanor and delivery are on target in every scene. He's able to capture the candid, sardonic wit that a 40 year old man would possess and yet captures the inexperience, anxiety, and childish nature that are associated with the ""virgin"" connotation. The supporting cast, including Paul Rudd and Catherine Keener, are great and all provide various insight to the connundrums of modern-day manhood and the emphasis placed on sexual experience.<br/><br/>40 year old is raunchy, punchy, and steadily brings in the laughs.

For FUNNY PEOPLE and KNOCKED UP, toying with drastic genre shifts was tolerable because there was at least payoff with good jokes and interesting characters. However, in his 2005 outing about sweet but overly awkward Carell, there is a major lack of satisfaction when attempting to explore the root-causes of why our main character just can't (or won't) ""get any"". The jokes are few-and-far-between, but when they are finally delivered, it is so juvenile that actual 40-year-old virgin aren't even this desperate for a laugh.

"michael_the_nermal","4","2","4","20 December 2008"," Takes Itself Far Too Seriously
","I like Judd Apatow's work before ""40 year Old Virgin"". I LOVED ""The Critic,"" one of my favorite cartoon series ever. Apatow worked on ""The Critic"" as a producer. That was a light-hearted cartoon which never took itself seriously. He also worked on ""The Cable Guy,"" a dark yet paradoxically goofy masterpiece featuring the insane antics of Jim Carrey, with the incredible Matthew Broderick as his nervous foil. Ben Stiller's direction probably had more to do with ""Cable Guy's"" incredible humor, writing and acting than Apatow's participation. Now directing on his own, Apatow has guided ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" a film with a premise with great potential, but which takes its message too seriously, and with characters that are not so much goofy as unlikeable and annoying.<br/><br/>Steve Carrel got his start on ""The Daily Show"" interviewing wackos and weirdos. He is better playing a straight man to guys who fear black T-shirts and Donny Osmond than as an insecure Circuit City worker who hasn't gotten laid. He does his damndest to be a nice guy, a likable virgin with a heart of gold, but his dippiness and naiveté is a far cry from the talents of Jon Lovitz and Jim Carrey. He's simply too sweet and innocent, with no goofy or quirky traits to make him interesting for a comedy. A better actor would have brought fire to this role. Carrel simply doesn't have it.<br/><br/>There are not enough goofy situations. At least another sex farce, ""Deuce Bigalow,"" had 500-lb women with ravenous appetites and giants, whose heads are above the screen, which lends a sense of the absurd to what is supposed to be a comic film. The women in ""40 Year Old Virgin"" are simply too ordinary. Leslie Mann plays a drunk woman, but not a very funny one. She seems too realistic, and it's more disturbing than funny to see her swerve her car around and puke in Steve Carrel's mouth. Her mood swings from happy to depressed are not funny. The beautiful Elizabeth Banks plays a nymphomaniac who works at Barnes and Noble, but again she isn't very funny. Marisa Coughlin in ""Freddy Got Fingered"" (a film reviled by many, but I don't care what the critics think. Shut up!) played a nymphomaniac who was ridiculous to the nines, complete with a childlike demeanor and a masochistic bent. Banks's version of the same stock character has little quirkiness or silliness. All she does that's supposed to be funny is to make Carrel nervous. Ah, then there's Catherine Keener's character, the so-called girl-who's-""right"" for Carrel. She is not funny at all, but seems rather creepy as a pushy single mom who forces Carrel to sell his beloved action figure collection. She tries to CHANGE poor Steve, and we actually feel for Carrel when he calls her out on her attempts to change him. Nothing a man hates more than a woman who imposes herself on him.<br/><br/>Then there are the obnoxious co-workers Carrel has to deal with. They're pushing for Carrel to get laid, but never have I seen a bunch of more unlikeable jerks than this group. They are not funny. They are mean, smug, arrogant, lazy, and obnoxious, with no attempt to be funny. Simple meanness and arrogance is not funny. The characters are supposed to play off of Carrel's sweetness, but since Carrel's character isn't that interesting to begin with, we get little to play off of.<br/><br/>Finally, Apatow seems to take the message of Carrel getting laid far too seriously. The scenes between Keener and Carrel are mawkish and sentimental. Kenner screaming at her teenage daughter, and Carrel's attempts to teach her about sex at a high school meeting seem like they would be better off in a Lifetime Original Movie. Carrel feeling self-pity and drowning his sorrows with drink is more pathetic than funny.<br/><br/>Can this be the same Judd Apatow who collaborated on ""The Critic"" and ""The Cable Guy?"" Judging from the following movie, the equally too-serious ""Knocked Up,"" I suspect he's changed for the worse. Apatow has left his quirky roots behind to guide his films for a mainstream crowd who likes sentimentality. I hope his next projects are more grounded and have more wackiness to them."

","I saw this based on one thing... Steve Carell's funny as hell bit in Bruce Almighty. Watching this film bored the crap out of me. There was a good scene involving chest hair, but other than that I was fidgeting to get the hell out of the theater. Call me a blasphemer, but I hate Martin Scorsese movies when it comes to drama and I hate Judd Apatow movies when it comes to comedy. One takes himself too seriously and the other doesn't take movie making seriously. They both also become enamored of actors and overuse them (Robert DeNiro/Seth Rogen). I saw Knocked Up and it sucked, as well. The common theme for the director's movies is they have one vaguely funny set piece and then ""hilarity ensues"" for the rest of the movie based on the ""wacky chemistry"" of the actors. Not a good recipe for entertaining audiences with the limited acting palette Apatow uses, IMO. I haven't seen Superbad and don't intend to; I already know about McLovin and since that is an Apatow film, there ain't much else to see."

","No matter what, there's no denying this film is funny, even hysterically funny at times. Steve Carrell is perfect in the title role as the sweet-natured and reclusive Andy Stitzer, a 40-year old virgin, who works in an electronic store, lives alone in a nice apartment between his hand-painted model soldiers and vintage action figures (in the original packaging, never opened), never goes out on weekends, never meets any women, and never had sex. Everything seems fine and Andy is content with his lonely no-friends, no-women existence, until one day, during some trash talking about women with his randy colleagues at the electronic store (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen), he describes a woman's breasts like 'a bag of sand', and exposes himself as a virgin. Soon, they all engage on a series of well-meant and hilarious trials to get Andy laid, like speed-dating, waxing his chest (Carrel did it for real), and teaching him the fine art of the dating game and the pick-up line. But then he meets Trish (a glorious Catherine Keener), a 40-year old single mom with three children, who works across the street of the electronics store, selling people's stuff at Ebay (???), Andy not only goes for nooky, he also wants a lasting meaningful relationship with this woman.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell touches just the right note here while he manages to get himself in a string of extremely embarrassing situations, and it's admirable how he can play this kind of straight guy loser with a golden heart in such a believable fashion. The supporting cast is excellent. Jane Lynch, Andy's boss at the electronics store, is simply marvelous in a seemingly effortless comic role. Watch that improvisation scene with Seth Roger (it's improv but it seems written, outstanding), or Elizabeth Banks, who works at the bookstore, my god, is she funny! And let's not forget Catherine Keener. Her part was well-written, but she transcends the writing and creates something fully her own, a wonderful character. I loved her in almost every film she was in, but here she not only shows she is one of the greatest actresses around, but also one with incredible comedic skills.<br/><br/>The characters are well-written and well developed. This is in no way the kind of film that looks down on virgins and only vindicates them when they finally do it, more Porky's style, to draw a broad comparison. I could have done without the ""Hair""-like dancing scene in the end, but well, such a gross-out ending is perhaps a fitting way to end a film like this. Amidst the barrage of mediocre and painfully unfunny comedies in recent years, like ""The Wedding Crashers"" (I really hated that one), this one really sticks out. It's definitely not for the easily offended, but despite many of the crude jokes, it never sinks to just tits-and-ass levels or plain crudeness. The film has the courage to believe in its own convictions. Great raunchy fun with a real heart.<br/><br/>Camera Obscura --- 9/10"

Without giving it away, it was the waxing scene!! The language is very rough and sex is the pervasive theme of the movie so there is a lot of nudity.

","This is by far the funniest movie I've ever seen, and I have seen many comedies. The storyline of Steve Carell as a 40 year old man, who is still a virgin is a masterpiece. His comic book and action figure collection define the true meaning of fanatic,and to some extent, hilarious, kind hearted nerd. His performance is hysterical. I also enjoyed his co-workers at the Smart Tech electronics store. From his crew, to his boss, to the hilarious middle eastern guys (very, very funny), they shaped the whole movie. And it doesn't stop here! The whole storyline of his escapades to reach his goal are amazingly funny. First, he gets bikini waxed, and then he has trouble with condoms. Not to mention the speed dating and so called party invite. With help from the middle eastern guys, his peers, and his crew, Andy reaches his goal. This movie is laugh out loud funny. Three Cheers for the 40 Year old Virgin!"

","""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" wins the award for being the dirtiest, most foulmouthed version of ""Pygmalion"" this side of ""My Bare Lady."" As the title explicitly states, this is the story of a man who has somehow managed to avoid having sex for the first four decades of his life, and the attempts on the part of his co-workers to see that he doesn't make it five. Thus, once they get over the shock of Andy Stitzer's little secret, these helpful buddies spend the remainder of the movie coaching and grooming him in the fine art of sexual conquest and romantic seduction.<br/><br/>The problem with ""The 40-Year Old Virgin"" is that it can't decide whether it wants to be a crude, gross-out raunch-fest or a sweet, warmhearted romantic comedy. By trying to succeed at both, it manages to succeed at neither. For all the filmmakers' attempts to meld them, the two very different halves just keep canceling one another out.<br/><br/>Yet, as with any film that aspires to make us laugh, ""Virgin"" must finally be adjudged a success or failure based not on how wild or tame it is, but on how funny. And, unfortunately, there just isn't very much humor to be found in this film, with the setups and jokes feeling mighty thin and painfully obvious for the most part, and the movie never seeming to know when to leave well enough alone. The ""well enough"" are the two lead performers - Steve Carell and Katherine Keener - who are both tremendously natural and likable performers and who could really make us care about their characters if the film weren't so cluttered with extraneous elements and subsidiary characters, and so tedious and drawn out in its execution. For, indeed, ""Virgin"" flies right in the face of that unwritten law of movie-making that decrees that no comedy should ever even approach a two-hour running time, let alone exceed it. Yet, clocking in at a whopping 128 minutes, the film begins to feel aimless and endless, with long stretches of time between all-too-infrequent laughs."
"steve-862","10","2","4","3 May 2006"," The funniest film in recent years
","Quite definitely this is the funniest film I have seen in a long time. There were small parts of The Anchoman and Kicking and Screaming that made me laugh out loud but this movie has by far the most laugh out loud moments of any film I can remember since first seeing The Life of Brian.<br/><br/>This is a well scripted film which is then developed further by a great cast who deliver the script perfectly. Add to that a few quirky bits, like the musical ending and you have a film you will remember when all the other 'comedy(s) of the year' have long been forgotten.<br/><br/>You get the impression that the cast really enjoyed being in this movie and wanted it to be as good as it could be. It certainly proves Hollywood can make a good film still.<br/><br/>I would say this is definitely not the film to put on when the village vicar is coming round for scones and tea and is rightly a 15 certificate in the UK. It's adult themed of course and there is some brief nudity but the film doesn't rely upon a little titillation to keep the attention of the viewer.<br/><br/>At the time I made this report IMDb had this film scored at 7.7 out of 10, not many films get that sort of score. I think this speaks for itself and is as good a reason as any to rent this.<br/><br/>Enjoy!"
"nandu_x","8","2","4","29 April 2006"," Gut-Bustingly funny. Vulgar but not gross.
","This is by-far the most hilarious comedy I have ever seen, and I have seen a ton. I judge comedies by how much they make me laugh, not some snotty pretentious standard. Although I definitely appreciate more subtle satire, like that found in Cohen brothers or Wes Anderson films, those don't qualify as ""pure comedies"" in my book. If you find vulgar humor about sex extremely off-putting, then you might want to stay away from this movie. If you don't have pole up your a**, then you will laugh harder than you've laughed, well ever. <br/><br/>That being said, there is more to this movie than simple potty jokes. The vulgarity is used as tool of storytelling, and not central. Unlike Something About Mary, or Scary Movie, it's not purely done for the sake of grossing you out, and it never reaches that low-brow of a level. In fact the dirtiest parts are the dialog, which are very, very dirty. Some people may be tempted to draw comparisons to American Pie, due to the premise and the fact of it being a romantic comedy. While the story remains realistic albeit over the top, it also avoids suffering by sentimentality that so many other romantic comedies do, by keeping it in the realm of supremely silly yet totally relateable. The jokes are expertly timed and fit perfectly with the plot. But there are heartfelt moments where you really feel for the characters dilemmas. <br/><br/>The acting and characters are really what stand out in this film, and make it special. When comparing it to other films, you will realize that these guys have achieved a new level of comic mastery. Steve Carell as the lead, is a likable nice-guy dork, who just happens to never have had sex at age 40. Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen play his buddies at work who try to help him get the deed done, and are all superbly funny, each in his own way. Rudd is a bitter romantic, still obsessed with the girl who dumped him years ago. Malco is the suave ladies man who's in reality whipped by his girlfriend, and may have sexuality issues. Rogen is the sensitive but masculine alterna-rocker. <br/><br/>What makes this film so much more enjoyable compared to every other romantic sex comedy out there, is that most guys will identify with several of these characters in the movie, or find themselves knowing people just like that. The characters are older and working ordinary low-level retail jobs. They're not teens, they're not in the entertainment biz, they're not too zany or weird, they're just ordinary guys. That's what makes them all so likable. Many of the scenes and situations, as wacky as they are, are taken right out of the real world, being a young single male in today's society. If you are a guy, definitely go out and buy this movie. Anyone who has an open mind and isn't afraid of vulgarity, will adore this film and laugh till they cry."

All of the leads, especially Steve Carrel, are hilarious in this movie. The amazing role, though, is Seth Rogen's. This should be a star-making role for him. The ending of this movie leaves a lot to be desired, but it is still funny in some ways and the beginning and middle more than make up for it.

"EUyeshima","8","2","4","20 December 2005"," Sharp Script and Carell's Skillful Underplaying Make for a Hilarious, Humane Comedy
","The very concept of this movie sent a chill up my spine, as I was preparing myself for the return of Pee Wee Herman and the inevitable man-child clichés that would come with a character bearing the movie's title. Contrary to my expectations, this film is a frequently hilarious, surprisingly humane comedy that goes well beyond the inevitable deflowering process. First-time director Judd Apatow smartly averts the movie from being a one-joke premise and provides instead a perceptive overview of the romantic anxieties and social pressures faced by those looking unsuccessfully for intimacy. That's not to say it doesn't have its share of crude humor and graphic sex jokes, but more importantly, it has a heart thanks primarily to a thoughtful script by Apatow and Steve Carell.<br/><br/>In a sharply comic performance, Carell plays the title character, Andy Stitzer, as a socially clueless, emotionally inert loner in a paralyzing state of arrested development. Surrounded by his exhaustive action figure collection and working in a Circuit City-type electronics store, he rides a bike, doesn't know how to drive and doesn't seem to want to despite living in LA (the one plot contrivance) and can talk endlessly about making egg salad as the highlight of his weekend. Andy works with a trio of co-workers who all think of themselves erroneously as wise in the ways of love, and upon discovering Andy's virginity, they are determined to help him get a woman.<br/><br/>But the film doesn't focus so much on the pursuit as it does in peeling off the layers of Andy's personality - the fundamental terror that has kept him from women, a constant need for order and logic to fill the void, and finally an eagerness for life to stay simple and uncomplicated so that he can live without confronting his fear. In short, he has rationalized sex and intimacy out of his life, that is, until he meets Trish, a nice, eccentric single mom running an eBay transaction store. Their burgeoning relationship is the heart of the story, and it certainly helps to have the always wonderful Catherine Keener play Trish in such a warm, loopy fashion that it's easy to believe the mutual attraction.<br/><br/>The supporting performances are terrific - Paul Rudd portrays Andy's closest colleague David, who cannot get over his failed relationship which he faces again in a chance meeting with his ex-girlfriend at a speed dating event; Romany Malco plays Jay, a married philanderer who eventually gets caught; Seth Rogen as Cal, who thinks he's a ladies' man despite all the evidence to the contrary; and Jane Lynch from ""Best in Show"" as their manager, a power-driven woman who in a very funny scene, discreetly offers herself to Andy and serenades him with a Guatemalan folk song.<br/><br/>There are several great scenes, including the poker scene where Andy awkwardly talks about women knowingly, the already famous chest hair-waxing where Andy yells out a series of Tourette-like epithets, and the surreal musical production number at the end, which will get any baby boomer giggling with abandon. Truth be told, it runs a bit too long and sags toward the last third, but I doubt if I have laughed at a film so much in the past year."

Some scenes made me fall on the floor from laughter and I really felt my ribs were hurting.<br/><br/>The story about a 40-year-old virgin whose younger friends are determined to get him laid ASAP. The story goes on to show you how they try to train him, telling him what to say, when to say it, how to act with girls.<br/><br/>The way the story shows the different types of girls is really brilliant, how each time you see a new one, you would think: ""This one will be normal, unlike the one before!"" only to show you that she is just weirder, that is on the sexual level.<br/><br/>I loved everything about this movie, except one small thing: The way the main character, the 40-year-old virgin talks to new girls/women make him look like a pro, and like he has been doing it for his entire life. There is a scene where is only suppose to ask a girl questions, and the way he asks them really makes you stop and ask yourself: ""So, if he is really that good with girls, how come he stayed a virgin?"" They only showed him nervous when he is trying to contact the woman he liked the most, played by Catherine Keener, but that happened two times, on the third, he just goes in and asks her to go out with him. Now lets face it, someone who hasn't tried to come near a woman for over 20 years will need a lot more work than this. It all seemed to flow nicely. I realize this is a comedy and whatnot, but still, a little credibility would have helped.<br/><br/>I think this is the only reason why this movie doesn't get 9 stars (no movie can get more). Other than that, it has one of the funniest scenes you can ever see this year and the scene keeps on coming and coming without it being repetitive or boring. They took it to the limit, w/o boring the audience."

"richardc020","10","2","4","22 October 2005"," Best Comedy In 40 Years
","This comedy's principal achievement is in its laid back, shrugged shoulders attitude. When you can take life as not-so-seriously, even being a virgin past age 17 is solvable. For those less fortunate (in either sense), this comedy shows the way.<br/><br/>This film combines a gross-out teenage comedy, slapstick oldie, a life-is-easier-without-sex message (i.e. 7th Heaven) and an overarching touching love story whose ever-present cheesiness is kept in check thanks to the actors' sincerity and casual delivery.<br/><br/>The one-liners are so good, you'll share them with friends for the few hours after getting out of the movie. The best part is knowing you share a similar critical review and reaction to the film.<br/><br/>This film pushes the R-rating with bestiality, porn clips, condom installation, legs wrapped around a male pelvis, bare breasts in public, vaginal models, husky seduction (use your imagination on that one), female masturbation, and the standard bed scene, but those watching the film aren't likely to cringe. Except maybe at ... oh, let's not spoil it.<br/><br/>Too many formulaic comedies trained me to expect a twist at any second, but this comedy's not doing so actually bucks that standard and leaves a very pleasant, heart-warming aftertaste. This pleasant nod to reality and real lives raises the film's reality and believability in addition to the aforementioned actors' sincerity and talents. The ease with which the actor's chemistries happen is a wonderful testimony to both writing and casting.<br/><br/>I saw it because Steve Carell was so wonderfully self-effacing in the American version of the BBC's ""The Office"". His talent again shines enormously. This movie is very much not my usual type of brooding, intellectual, and philsophical film which radically and permanently changes one's thinking, but I laughed clear through the entire film. Let's hope Carrell's not type cast into the self-reducing type of role, but even if he is, he brings smiles and laughs to all as he does so. Correspondingly, Keener's bright, shining, simply radiant presence in the film gives such wonderful goodness to the film's believability. She doesn't over- or under-play her part, but it seemingly entirely comfortable as the hot grandma whose temporary romantic woes are the woes of many.<br/><br/>The film's ending credits are stunning in a way in which I hope more movies do so, but I won't spoil it. Seeing is believing."

The last time I laughed so hard and loud was for Blazing Saddles. The cast is superb and I will not single out anyone for special mention. The writing is crisp, the one-liners superb. The language is very rude but not offensive, The sight gags are great and the ending unexpected. Steve Carrell reminds me of Robert Morse in How to Succeed in Business but was that hair real?

","It would seem self-evident that certain things should be avoided during sex, simulated or otherwise: braces, pastries, super glue, zippers. All these items scream Sex Comedy, though, and have featured prominently in big Hollywood scores (no pun intended) in recent years. These flicks have managed to be more or less consistently pretty funny, although getting audience guffaws at the sheer relief of watching mortifying things happen to other people during sex seems like pinning the tail on the donkey with no blindfold. Regardless, now comes ""The 40 Year Old Virgin,"" gamely continuing the palliative formula of sticking our collective carnal neuroses on some schmucky loser, and reaping the rewards of our horrified laughter.<br/><br/>""Virgin"" succeeds largely on the dopey antics of star Steve Carrell, who makes an art form of creating comic centerpieces out of straight men. As Andrew, the titular touch-me-not, Carrell chortles and wheedles his way through innumerable conversations on which he has no expertise with an incompetent evasiveness worthy of Jeff Lebowski. A film that takes its central gag as its title is clearly not into wasting time, and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" rapidly settles into a series of sketches of ill-advised attempts to enter poor Andrew into the world of the violated. There's a disastrous round of speed-dating, a pick up lesson (""just keep asking questions,"" advises Andrew's buddy), and a transvestite hooker, all of which mostly comes off as standard, i.e. not very funny, fare. Even less amusing is ""Virgin""'s insistence on detouring into unnecessary gay jokes, as well as the two caricatured Pakistani coworkers whose only function is to sound funny talking in heavily-accented street patois.<br/><br/>Carrell himself, though, is funny, and ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is at its best when focusing on Andrew himself, rather than his pratfalls or cadre of Wacky Friends. The painfully transparent false confidence with which he equates a breast with a bag of sand, for example, or tells a bar floozy ""I hope you have a big trunk, because I'm putting my bike in it"" is far more restrained and subtly hilarious than any of the genre's more preferred ""semen in a"" gags. The film is smart to go light on the scatology (at least in comparison to its predecessors), instead finding much of its humor in the pathologies of involuntary celibacy. Bike-riding, action figure-collecting Andrew has a lot in common with Steve Buscemi's obsessive schlump from ""Ghost World,"" though he does at times appear as much a victim of bad luck as of a defective personality.<br/><br/>""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is nothing new, but does its thing well, and is a perfect stage for Carrell's deadpan histrionics. The ability to elevate basically mundane material is a too rare gift with which Carrell is evidently blessed. Let's hope Hollywood notices."

","Steve Carell, the guy who stole the show in both ""Anchorman"" and ""Bruce Almighty"" is someone who was just recognised by face by most, but ""40 Year Old Virgin."" It's a rare occasion when I see a romantic comedy that I really liked, but this one is one of those. Carell is hilarious in his first leading role, and the extremely strong supporting cast is fantastic too. Part of the movie is a raunchy type of comedy, kind of like American Pie but with 30-somethings, but mostly, this is a sweet comedy that's really rude at the same time, which HAS to be a rare occurrence.<br/><br/>It's the most quotable comedy movie since the likes of ""Dodgeball"" and ""Anchorman"" and it also has one of the best soundtracks I've ever heard for a comedy, (the ""Aquarius"" cast recording is hilariously reminiscent of ""Afternoon Delight"" in Anchorman, and make for a great Bollywood spoof ending.) Absolutely unmissable and as enjoyable as the first time that Carell's character strives to achieve here. One of the funniest comedies of the year."

","What I don't like about many comedies is the almost guaranteed fact that though they may start out amusing (Hitch, Wedding Crashers) by the end of the film they've always managed to make some sort of moralistic, 'slushy' (dare I say it - American) point. This film doesn't. Okay so it may have a 'happy' ending but at no point does it lose its comedy and at no point does the 'slushiness' overshadow the fact that this is essentially an amazingly funny, dirty and 'real' laugh fest. I honestly feel the only people who will not find this amazingly hilarious are self absorbed pretentious critics who wont allow themselves to be 'lowered' to the level that some of the comedy in this film descends to. Yes its rude, totally non pc and presents some fairly blatant racial and ethnic stereotypes. It is however an incredibly hilarious movie, it is consistently funny throughout the entire 2 hours, the acting is superbly done and actually believable and I would recommend everyone go and see it at least once!"

","THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN (4 outta 5 stars) A movie with this concept would be so easy to turn into a piece of utter crap a la ""Deuce Bigelow"". It's so rare to find a movie that can actually balance big laughs with honest character development. Steve Carell does a great job portraying Andy, a character quite unlike the loud, obnoxious types that he's best known for. Again, it would be very easy for actor to screw things up by overdoing the stereotype... but Carell does a nice balancing act... playing nerdy without making it too creepy. Catherine Keener has a great role, too... as the single mother of three who begins a relationship with Andy... not knowing the dreaded secret that has only recently come to the attention of his (messed up in their own way) co-workers.

","Watching a classic comedy from 15 years ago for the first time is always a bit risky. Does the humour hold up? Is it going to be wildly offensive? Am I going to understand any of the references? Despite falling into a couple of these traps, The 40 Year Old Virgin is pretty damn funny and holds up well for the most part. The underlying concept is ingenious and has so much comedy potential, which was utilised really well.<br/><br/>First of all the cast. You really can't go wrong with Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd and Seth Rogan. All fantastic comedic actors with spot on performances. The chemistry between them was great, they embodied their characters excellently and were the main attraction of the film for me. Catherine Keener was a great opposite for Carrell, and the story between them was quite charming. The support cast were also all fantastic, with Jane Lynch providing some of my favourite dialogue.<br/><br/>Moving on to the humour... this film is so noughties sometimes it hurts. If we're being honest some of the humour hasn't aged too well. A lot of it wouldn't wind up in a film in this day and age and with good reason, but there are so many parts that really do stand the test of time. ""KELLY CLARKSON"" will never not be funny and there is a great mix of physical, character, intelligent and crude humour. Even when this film wasn't laugh out loud funny I mostly had a grin on my face. It's just one of those comedies you can't help but fall in love with a little bit.<br/><br/>There a some films that are good to have in your locker for a rainy day when you just want to kick back with a comedy, and I'll definitely be adding The 40 Year Old Virgin to that list."

","The 40 Year Old Virgin is about an aging, middle aged man who one day, while playing a poker game with his buddies, starts to get grilled with a bunch of questions about the first girl he had ever been with. The boys want all the gory details, they want graphic descriptions to embed in their heads ( boys will be boys!) When he slips up and describes her chest as feeling like ""sandbags"", the boys start to get suspicious that he's never been with a woman in his life. And they're right, Andy is a 40 year old virgin. Most men, feeling as if their talk about how many women that they've been with, feeling as if its some high score or something, Andy seems to be saving himself for something better....he wants love, not sex. And he's been pretty patient about it. Andy is such a great, nice guy, and has morals. There's nothing wrong with that, the film actually defends guys with this sort of mentality. As far as the 40 year old virgin, he got LUCKY!!! He finds love and romance with the first woman he dates, and its all lighthearted humor from here. We watch as he survives hilarious mishaps, too nice of a guy and shy to mention anything about a nip slip, we root and cheer for the guy who has a positive attitude, and doesn't have to go through a bunch of bad apples to find the good one. I thought the film was handled very well, probably could have done without the racial jokes, but I can give it a pass, this is a great comedy to add to your collection. ( Yes, I think its worth owning.)"

","A delightfully awkward and very funny comedy, The 40-Year-Old Virgin can at times be a bit obvious and formulaic, but it is one enjoyable time. Steve Carell provides a perfect grounded performance in the lead role as Andy, a man who is 40 and still a virgin. The supporting cast is also very amusing, and the best roles are played by Romany Malco, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen. The film can be a bit tedious at times, but it is also wildly entertaining, with you fully rooting for the character of Andy and his journey, despite how obvious it may seem. The film is full of some very hilarious gags, of which are quite impressively pulled off considering most were ad-libbed, or even done in a single shot. Judd Apatow truly shines his directorial brilliance by allowing the movie to feel emotional while also remaining fun, one quality a comedy can not so easily balance nowadays. In the end, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a very fun comedy, that I would not mind watching again. It's full of a lot of great talent and plenty of funny moments to keep you entertained, despite it being repetitive some of the time.

","This movie disappoints in the respect that it was so many things to so many different people, but was marketed all wrong. This would make a new genre called ""light, romantic comedy"" if such a category existed!! This is so light on real, actual humor and redeeming value. The commercialization of this movie was just terrible, such as promoting adult films starring a certain actress I found to be more of the same. The promotion was shameless. It could be considered a teen comedy, I guess... The quirky, somewhat zany acting of the different roles really kept me from giving it a lower rating. Everyone starring in this adds their own flavor and personality, and luckily they blend together on screen very well. Of course, the story is so predictable and sappy-sweet that it makes you want to vomit. I could take it or leave it. It seems to me that with the amount of era-specific comedians who star in this, this movie will lose value over time about as fast as a GM vehicle!"

At well over two hours, it's hard not to notice that the movie is overlong and runs out of steam in the last twenty minutes, but getting there is a downright pleasure every step of the way.

That also hits the cast, with a number of young actors who would eventually make huge success in Hollywood, such as Paul Rudd and Jonah Hill, and of course the funny Steve Carell (which was already well known at the time). Technically, the film is not a good idea, it does not have a profound message, it is purely entertainment, but even so, it seeks a rougher humor haunt, which few have the courage to do.

"ThomasDrufke","9","0","0","29 April 2017"," A Raunchy Romance
","Comedy is probably the one genre that is most difficult to hold up over time. It's the one genre that isn't timeless. Most jokes rely on pop culture references, but The 40-Year-Old Virgin manages to do the impossible, make a timeless comedy.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this is Steve Carell and Judd Apatow at their best. While most Carell roles are filled with goofy and over-the-top humor, and most Apatow films are overlong and too raunchy, this film hits on all those cylinders in a good way. This is one of the dirtiest and raunchiest films that I've seen, but I can't picture it working any other way. Especially because that side of things makes you appreciate the really sweet romance between Carell and Catherine Keener. That relationship only works if you understand the world he's living in outside of his romance with her, and the stakes that the film sets up.<br/><br/>This film also features what is perhaps the greatest comedy ensemble of this generation. You have Carell just beginning to hit his prime, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco all rounding out the work group of friends pushing him to lose his virginity. That's not even mentioning Keener, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks, and a young Kat Dennings and Jonah Hill. All of them create such memorable characters and scenes with the help of Apatow and Carell's hilarious dialogue. And yes, Apatow had done a bit of television work prior to this, but it's his first directorial effort for a feature film. Quite the impressive start.<br/><br/>There are so many infamously memorable scenes. From the body waxing, to the poker table, the condom scene, the shenanigans from Elizabeth Banks, Leslie Mann drunk driving, or the speed dating scene. From beginning to end, this was comedy gold. And surprisingly, every joke hit just as hard as it did when I first saw the film years ago.

","Fans of gross out movies will find plenty of laughs here, but ultimately this film does have a lot of heart and substance. One of the big jokes is that although 40yo virgin Andy (Steve Carell) is supposedly the socially inept one, all his friends who are advising him have disastrous love lives and don't know what they're talking about. The movie does poke a lot of fun at Andy as a nerd and a prude but it does have empathy that he's been traumatised by too many bad experiences and has given up on love. But one piece of good advice he does get is to take a few risks. Enter Trish, the saleswoman who works near Steve. She's played with great energy and wit by Catherine Keener. She is perfect for this role. Trish is a single mother of three girls does her best and makes mistakes, but does put herself out in the world and helps Andy get over his many problems. The supporting cast includes the hilarious Jane Lynch as Andy's blunt boss at the electrical store who can generate laughs just with a facial expression. As Andy's friends, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd's characters are all sleazy towards women at times, which jarred with me. Maybe the filmmakers were just portraying how clueless and inappropriate they are. As hopeless dates for Andy (one a drunk driver and the other a ditsy sex maniac), Lesley Mann and Elizabeth Banks contribute memorable cameos. The movie sometimes descends to smut - do we really need all those porn and toilet scenes? - but overall it's an entertaining and well meaning film. And the final scene is a real joy!"

","In 'A forty year old virgin', the subject of sex was handled with pure ""American Style"" sensibilities. Most of the sex talks bordered on silliness as in an oversexed nation like USA, according to a rough estimate there is a 'one in a million chance' of finding somebody who is a virgin at the ripe age of 40. Director Judd Appatow and screen writer Steve Carrell have made a vain attempt to add drama to their film with the depiction of a futile battle of opinions and an idle clash of ideologies. For this purpose they chose to highlight the plight of a happy-go-lucky person who has absolutely no qualms being a virgin and those who are not happy at this strange person's outlandish ideas. As the film keeps the viewers dangling, it is felt that 2 hours is too long a time to deal with such an ordinary theme. Many viewers would not hesitate to express that it could have been easily handled in the standard Hollywood cinema duration of 90 minutes. As love does have an important place in all kinds of relationships even sex, this film ends on a positive note with the triumph of love over sex.

","On a poker night with three bawdy colleagues, the geeky toy-collector Andy (Steve Carell, where have you been?) reluctantly reveals that he has never done the dirty. Thus, they begin a mission to get this 40- year-old virgin laid and efforts such as chest-waxing, dating services and loose women ensue. This is harder than it sounds, because Andy isn't exactly Casanova. He rides a bicycle to work. He collects action- figures. He talks to his action figures.<br/><br/>I never quite prepared myself for just how funny The 40 Year Old Virgin was. The dialogue is some of the most dynamic, quick, interactive and downright hysterical I have ever heard in a comedy, and this elevates the whole film above generic formula. Carell brings refreshing charisma and comedic timing to his performance, and I have never heard a funnier, better screamer since Macalauy Culkin in Home Alone (""I'm SHY!!!""). It is also nice to see Paul Rudd back in comedy action, as I greatly missed this guy when he seemed to depart from fame post-Clueless. Someone else whose comedic skills are worthy of a great deal of praise is Romany Malco, playing Andy's friend and pimp, always there to facilitate his mission, but always ending up making things worse. It is these three men that, when combined, are so funny that they just take my breath away.<br/><br/>The only negative aspect to The 40 Year Old Virgin (aside from its philosophy that you can't be happy unless you're in a relationship) is that it is much too long. It has been said before yes, but there is a reason it has been brought up so much and that is because a raunchy sex comedy just does not hold up for 120 minutes. As the novelty of the fun dialogue and sexy situations wore off, I became less and less engrossed in the film. And let's not talk about the final sing-and-dance number. Just... please. 6/10"

","Steve Carell is a funny guy. In this film he plays an appealing geeky character who is still a virgin at the ripe old age of forty. The situation is naturally ripe for comedy and the film generally doesn't disappoint, although it isn't a 'classic' or 'the funniest film ever made', as some have suggested. Some of the adult humor comes of as lame and childish. Catherine Keener is a decent romantic foil and she and Carell share a warm rapport (but few genuine sparks). Paul Rudd is quite good as the friend although everybody chips in well. Note: the extended version is a bit of a bore, so stick to the shorter and better-edited theatrical cut.<br/><br/>Overall 7/10"

","This movie was quite a breakthrough for Steve Carrell. He wrote and produced this movie, even the back and forth banter that makes the movie move along so well. The first time I watched it, it was just an average comedy. My girlfriend was watching it a couple days later and for some reason all those jokes I just giggled at before I was full on laughing at this time around. It grew on me. I don't know that it's true for everybody, but that's the way it worked for me. I instantly became a fan of Judd Apatow.<br/><br/>All the characters are perfect for their role. Paul Rudd is perfectly neurotic and Seth Rogen plays the perfect party guy who you grow to love more and more as the movie goes on. It's a comedy that DOES have a plot, albeit not much of one but it's enough of one to keep the movie glued together. The ending seems a bit abrupt and slightly disappointing, but the laughs and hairy(literally) situations that come non stop before it are well worth the watch.<br/><br/>Rent this one, unless vulgarity or nudity makes you uncomfortable. Not my favorite comedy of all time, but very close. One of those that's re-watchable again and again.<br/><br/>And one last side note, I always enjoyed Steve Carrell while he was on the Daily Show and Bruce Almighty, etc. But after seeing this and him on The Office, he has become one of my favorite Hollywood stars."

It's Jane Lynch and Seth Rogen (who also co-produces) who have the most chops. A lot of this is evidently ad-libbed with Apatow shouting out possible dialogue to the actors as the cameras roll. There's a lot of humour here and a lot of talent.<br/><br/>But if Bill the Bard were called in to do a rewrite, he'd probably start by asking why so much sexual and scatological humour for the mosh pit but nothing for the others paying a shilling for a cushion.<br/><br/>And at the end of the day this is a Hollywood film with all that means: shallow, formulaic, and ultimately leaving you feeling the cultural heritage of Tinsel Town is barren."

This is a good movie, but can make u feel uncomfortable at times. It is a funny movie and is defiantly for teens or older, I also think this movie is more for men than women, but I think women will like it also. Some of the jokes in it are rather rude and grotesque. If you are a parent and you don't want your kids to know certain things about sex or to basically watch men with erections, naked women, or lesbian action then don't take your children to see this. Also if you don't want to see these things then don't watch it. This film is very good apart from these factors and does have some very smart jokes."

","For all the potential hi-jinks involved in a movie about a 40-year-old who's never had sex, what really made this movie to me was the subtle humor. For example, the store manager who always has to play god-awful Michael McDonald music on all the TVs in the store, and the ""Age of Aquarius"" spoof song at the end of the movie. Weave those nuggets into what we expect this film to be about, and you have a pretty good movie. Steve Carell is funny as usual, the supporting cast does exactly that -- supports all Carell's goofiness -- and while the main premise has the potential to devolve into locker-room humor, it never really does. If you've done at least a functional amount of dating in your life, you'll appreciate what total disasters some of these dates were. There were a few scenes I thought were a kind of lame (the chest-waxing scene comes to mind, though I realize a lot of people felt that was one of the best scenes in the movie).

","I have been somewhat sceptical about the almost unanimously good reviews I read, review by professional film critics who are understandably more demanding than an average IMDb user. That scepticism continued through the first half of the movie, but then it became gradually clear why these critics liked this movie. There can be a number of reasons but by far the most important are Steve Carell and Catherine Keener.<br/><br/>At the start, Virgin is the sort of movie that is not unlike others in the same genre (Wedding Crashers, There's Something About Mary), in a word, raunchy. Even if you generally enjoy humour that stems from sex, whether you have a good laugh or find the whole thing tedious depends very much on you mood at that particular time. And the title tells all, the movie IS about a 40 year old virgin and the obsession (of the movie, but not necessarily of the protagonist) is with sex.<br/><br/>Through the establishing first half, the laughs that the audience came for are effectively delivered through the help of a good, and good-sized, supporting cast. Then, as the central romance develops, because of the natural, immensely likable persona of Carell and Keener, we soon find ourselves rooting for them wholeheartedly. Individually they are each wonderful. Together, they're magical.<br/><br/>The finale is inspired, showcasing the cast, and will particularly please those who remember the rock musical ""Hair"" from the late 60s."
"Antagonisten","7","0","0","14 May 2006"," Steve Carell
","Just reading the title you know that this movie will depend heavily on comedy based in embarrassment. The embarrassment of being 40 years old without having done the business, as well as the embarrassment of trying at that age. In the worst case scenario this could have been awful, it could have been degrading in a way that makes me at least turn off the TV. This is luckily not the worst case.<br/><br/>I have to admit right away that i for some reason like Steve Carell. His whole appearance is just amazing. Seeing him finally outside the newscaster-role is great. You might say ""But he was already in The Office"". Then i say: i wouldn't watch that crap even if i was paid to. There is only one boss in ""The Office"" and that's Ricky Gervais. Anyway, i got sidetracked. Let's get on with it.<br/><br/>Carell lends a certain warmth to his character here. He's not such a bad guy. He's just an insecure man who lives his life pretty much alone in the same way he has since he was fifteen years old. He collects action figures, plays video games and watches movies. He seldom goes out and never ever meets women. Basically he's the man most guys could have been if they hadn't met that first girlfriend. Which makes him human, and also it makes us pity him and feel for him when he goes through his embarrassing stages on the road to getting laid.<br/><br/>The jokes and comedy in this movie is of a shifting quality. There are moments that are intensely funny and there are also many sly remarks that are great. The most fun are Carells work-buddies who make it the purpose of their lives to get him laid. And even though it becomes too much sometimes and they overstep the line, it never becomes truly disgusting or repulsive. Which is a feat considering the subject.<br/><br/>Steve Carell makes this movie worth a five, his buddies makes it worth a six, and the fact that it's a movie about sex that doesn't end in a disgustingly cute way it's worth a seven. It's a laugh and sometimes that's all you need."

","I consider comedies with trepidation, because they are so overwhelmingly likely to belong at one end or the other of the spectrum: Either not very funny at all, or so silly as to be embarrassing. Like ""Office Space"", this film fits neatly into the middle of the spectrum. No pratfalls, no pies in the face, but genuinely an amusing film. I was, however, disappointed with Catherine Keener. I've long considered her among my favorite actors, but maybe she is getting lazy or spoiled. She just doesn't have the sizzle that I had gotten used to. But then, who does, ten or twenty pictures into their career? I had trouble with character believability in this movie, too. The ending musical scenes were formulaic, and one of the worst examples I've ever seen of that formula."

The movie was extremely poor in the quality, portrayal, and meaning of the story. The movie could have been so much better without all of the meaningless curse words. Of course, this is a rated R feature, and I can see that they were pushing it to be rated R, but a lot of the cursing and various pornographic images and words that were put in there, did not need to be used either. It seemed that this movie was made just to do that, to put all of those words that did not need to be there. I will hand this to them, the movie was funny in some parts, I really did laugh...but most of it was just sick words and bad content. I was really disappointed because I knew that this movie was from the producer of Anchorman and I thought that Anchorman was a really good, classic comedy. This was too, because it ends in a wedding, however, it just seemed very strange when watching it and I really do not recommend going to see it.

I had expected that when I saw current reviews for this movie they would reflect how far we've come on these issues. However the reverse happened. Sure we can think we're making headway but in reality everything is just the same. Women aren't people they're just vagina's to the majority of men, being gay is something to laugh at and a great way to make fun of people, and supporting negative black stereo types. I know what you'll say you can laugh at these things without thinking them. I don't really think that's true. If you were against all these things there's no way you could find them funny and if somehow you still did them you'd be supporting something that you don't believe in. How does that work?"

","From a purely objective standpoint, The 40 Year Old Virgin is probably not one of the greatest films ever made. It is not epic like The Godfather, revolutionary like Citizen Kane, or even a new type of comedy like Airplane! was. From my subjective standpoint, though, The 40 Year Old Virgin is one of the best movies around. The reason is plain and simple; the movie's goal is to make you laugh hard and often and to sympathize with the main character, and perhaps no other movie so perfectly achieves the goals they set out as this one does.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is Andy Stitzer, one of the nicest men around, but a man so hapless with woman that he once kicked a woman in the nose while she was licking his toes. When his co- workers find out that he is a virgin, they begin an epic quest to get him laid. The first half of the movie is pretty much Andy going through a series of hilarious and humiliating failures; the second half focuses on a blossoming romance between him and Trish (Catherine Keener). As their relationship progresses, Andy's fear grows; he knows he will eventually have to tell Trish about his sexual history (or lack thereof).<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin is raunchy and ridiculous, but not in a pure gross-out way. It's not just a movie for foul-mouthed teenage boys; my mom loves this movie. The reason that this movie is loved by so many people is that it's not just a series of pointless gags. The scenes and characters are important; Carell plays Andy so innocently that we feel so sorry for him, even as we laugh at his misfortunes. We're rooting him on just as hard as his co-workers are. The rare combination of hilarity and realism is what separates The 40 Year Old Virgin from your standard run-of-the-mill comedy.<br/><br/>Besides the two excellent leads, the supporting cast is fantastic as well. Standard Judd Apatow players Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Leslie Mann are all hilarious as his two friends and potential hook-up partner, respectively. Of particular greatness is Jane Lynch (Best in Show) as Paula, Andy's boss who is willing to help him out with his little problem.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin is already a classic, a comedy that pushed the envelope and got away with everything. While some people might think that once the romance between Andy and Trish starts, the movie will die down and get sappy, they are sorely mistaken. The movie is hilarious from beginning to end, including an epic song to close things out with a bang. The 40 Year Old Virgin is funny to all people, regardless of age, gender, or maturity. Give this one a shot if you haven't seen it; it's great the first time and just gets better upon multiple viewings."

","I have been a fan of Steve Carell since I originally saw him as a correspondent on Comedy Central's Daily Show though I never imagined him branching out into feature films; I definitely didn't foresee him headlining his OWN movie. Carell portrays Andy Stitzer, the titular virgin who's co-workers make it their ultimate goal to help Andy get laid for the first time. Simple premise, hilarious pay-off. I can honestly (and easily) say this ranks as one of my favorite comedies; it has also brought Steve Carell, Seth Rogan, and Paul Rudd to my attention as some of the funniest actors working today.<br/><br/>A good portion of the movie contains improvised dialogue, which helps give it a genuine feel of chemistry between the entire cast. It really was the cast that made this movie so enjoyable. Steve Carell's great performance is backed up by Seth Rogan (one of my favorite recent comedian/actors), Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch, Romany Malco, and Gerry Bednob. The combined comedic skills of this cast make it one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. Keeping the movie grounded is a Catherine Keener as Andy's love interest, Trish. Keener provides some laughs, but she primarily keeps the movie from feeling completely low-brow by giving the movie it's heart.<br/><br/>This movie also helped me realize just how desensitized I've become to modern movies. I've only ever seen the unrated DVD, never the theatrical release. Before I'd actually watched the movie, I heard all the stories about how raunchy it was and how crazy some of the scenes were. After watching it, sure I'd laughed myself crazy but I still couldn't help but wonder...what's the big deal? I'd recently discovered the ""unrated"" version would've been NC-17. Whoa. Once I thought about it, yeah, I guess I can see where some of the risquÃ© moments might've been a bit much for someone who's a bit more sensitive about the subject matter (i.e. Mooj's relationship advice). So, yeah, if you're more of a conservative person, maybe you should avoid this little gem (though know, you are missing out on a hilarious film).

But if you're Andy Stitzer at age 40 and haven't had sex, it's nothing to be ashamed about.<br/><br/>In Judd Apatow's comedy, Steve Carell plays the title character of the 40 Year Old Virgin as Andy Stitzer. He works at a Circuit City wannabe store where on his spare time he collects action figures and rides a bicycle to work along with other places instead of driving a car or picking up women for the matter. He's a nice guy but doesn't have to courage to come out of his shell; even the workers he associates with from David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogan), and Jay (Romany Malco) find him a bit disturbing thinking to a point where he might be a serial killer. It's not until Andy reveals at a poker game that he's been a virgin all his life due to the fact that he couldn't get it on with chicks during high school. The trio help Andy find women by taking him to bars and giving advice on how to pick up women. Their plans fail where women think of Andy as too odd while one of them throws up on him when getting a lift home. It all changes when Andy meets Trish (Catherine Keener) at his workplace and helps her out in choosing a DVD player where sparks fly and maybe he'll have his opportunity to lose his virginity.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin is not only one of the funniest films I've seen, but it's also one of the those comedies where it doesn't really have to be offensive to the subject of sex or those who never had experience sex and want to try it out. I also love the Steve Carell character where he was believable to make me want to watch the rest of the film without having to walk out on a good-to-be-true comedy that's just a riot from start to finish."

Steve Carell plays a middle-aged kid, a tech-store stock manager into monster toys and video games, who confesses to his buddies at work that he is still, in fact, a sexual novice. Slick, commercial comedy directed by Judd Apatow, who co-wrote the screenplay with Carell, doesn't condescend to its main character (his celibacy isn't something he chose or planned on, it's merely a hurdle in his life--and although he's goaded into conquering the beast, he goes about that in his own way). The movie is alternately a sunny sex farce and a more sympathetic character-comedy about being true to yourself, with colorful weirdos filling the cast and lots of smart, insightful talk. Apatow is a giddy force behind the camera, and while his plot creaks and groans at times (particularly in the last third), it doesn't necessarily strike one as a highly-concocted audience pleaser until just after the end-credits roll. **1/2 from ****"

Apparently, some male virgins in the US were going to sue over it. I saw no reason for such a stance. The film's central character is treated quite realistically and sympathetically. (Spoiler warnings though I expect most have seen the film by now) That he finally found love, and the song of joy (Aquarius) that follows is a delight, though reminiscent of the singing at the close of There's Something About Mary. It is the eccentricity of the more sexually experienced friends around him that make the virgin seem so credible - I love the sequence of his friends saving him from the clutches of a man-eating temptress, only to see one of them jump into the bath with her as the others rescue him for the woman he really loves.

It's kinda cute that Trish, a woman who has definitely been ""around"" - and many, many times over - would fall for an inexperienced geek like Andy...I guess it could happen but it just isn't convincing. The ending is absolutely pathetic and a convenient wrap-up - presumably because Carell and Apatow couldn't decide on a good way for the movie to end...right down to that beaten-to-death wedding music. What's worse, Andy clearly hasn't grown up as the movie has progressed - he's the same guy he always was, a wimp...with one little thing changed. I'd have to give most of the props to Romany Malco, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen. They insist on sticking with him for the long haul...and while it might not be pleasant for them, they prove to be true friends! The best scenes in the film are the ones featuring Trish's daughter Marla...the actress who played her did superbly. Very realistic...unlike the movie as a whole, which is not very realistic."
"Thomas_Veil","4","2","5","5 August 2006"," Cute idea, mediocre execution
","This is an odd film. On the one hand, you've gotta like Steve Carrell. He brings a charm to his character, and the part is written well. He's appropriately down about his virginity, but he deals with it. He's naturally p.o.'d when his friends razz him about it, yet mature enough to accept their apology. And the ending is what it should be: Carrell finally finds the right woman when he stops listening to other people's advice and just acts like himself.<br/><br/>On the other hand, a lot of the jokes in this film are really lame. The morning hard-on? Cute but hardly guffaw-inducing. The crabby immigrant who swears a lot? Been done, and the swearing is OVERdone. The dumb friends who give Steven bad advice? Old, old, old -- at least as old as ""A Guide for the Married Man"" (1967!) and done to death many times since, not only in movies but plenty of TV sitcoms. The boss who secretly yearns for Carrell to be her, ahem, ""buddy""? Nothing ever comes of that plot line.<br/><br/>But then this movie had a rough road to hoe. As I said, it's been done over and over ad nauseam, the only real difference is this time it's buddies helping someone lose their virginity, instead of just helping someone get laid. It'd need a ton of wit to overcome a concept this worn out, and that's why I think I was unsatisfied with this film: the jokes were easy and not particularly witty. Some were just odd. For example, when Carrell winds up finally having sex, he sings ""Aquarius"". I found myself asking, ""Why is that supposed to be funny? It just looks strange."" I'm guessing very young audiences take the song to be a dorky expression of happiness by a dorky character, but a lot of folks older than Gen X won't make that association. To them it's a cool (if dated) song.<br/><br/>In the end I can't help wondering what better writers would've done with something like this. Hopefully made it into something more than a hybrid cute love story/dumb teen comedy."
"pwalker-13","4","2","5","5 May 2006"," A couple of good scenes but that's about it
","Every once in awhile a very average movie has a couple of very funny scenes. In ""The 40-year Old Virgin"", Paul Rudd's character complaining to his boss about the Michael McDonald DVD and the ""yah mo be there"" comment are hilarious. I also enjoyed the angry exchange between the sales guys in the electronics store. Unfortunately, it goes down hill after these early scenes. The rest is the usual sexual formula that we've seen before. I thought Steve Carell was better in ""Anchorman"". Seth Rogan is quite good in this, and I've been a Jane Lynch fan for a long time and wish she had more scenes in this. Overall, if you are looking for a childish, somewhat raunchy sexual comedy, it probably will entertain you."
"rangertimothy","3","2","5","14 February 2006"," Very Disappointed
","This was certainly a disappointment to me. I had heard that this movie was really good. I never even bothered to finish watching it. First off, there was too much swearing for me. I saw the movie Four Brothers, which I anticipated some swearing in that movie, and The 40yr Old Virgin was ten times worse. It seemed like they couldn't think of a good enough story line, so all they did was have swearing in it. Not too mention, I thought it was suppose to be funny. Yes, there was a few funny parts of what I did see, but other then that, it was boring. I watched about an hour of it and that was enough for me. I am certainly glad I did not go and waste my money at the theatre to see it, as I likely would have walked out."
"abrooks123","4","2","5","4 February 2006"," AND ROEPER GAVE this a thumbs up???
","I'm not a prude or an angel, but the swearing really got to me within 15 minutes of the show. It's sad that movies now have to be so saturated with profane, obscene and vile language so as to make it to the ""Box Office"".<br/><br/>Coincidentally right after I watched ""The 40-yr. old Virgin"" last night, 3rd Feb., ABC's 20/20 had a segment on rudeness and how society is failing morally. It was such a juxtaposition of the nature of these two shows, but confirmed the depiction of where ""life"" is heading; indisciplined, fowl and thoughtless behaviour. Yes.. welcome to the age of uncencorship.<br/><br/>For the most part, I tried to make it through to the end of the movie and was glad I did. I felt I had to scrub my ears from the dirtiness. Especially Gerry Bednob's character Mooj's expressions. OMG!!! I couldn't believe an old guy could talk like that.<br/><br/>I think Steve Carrell was feeling a bit anxious in building his acting career, and was desperate in acting, writing and producing this movie so as to establish himself on the big screen and move away from small screen roles. Anyway, he's the one laughing all the way to the bank, huh? Don't get me wrong I love him in ""The Office"" but think that he has such a potential to grow beyond the ""the immature, tyrannical, high-school prank roles"". He has a similarity with the likes of Ben Stiller in these off-the-wall comedies, and could excel to dynamic Oscar-grabbing stardom!!!! <br/><br/>STill a fan of his though! I think the movie would have done better if most of the cursing, swearing and sick slap-stick dialogue was deleted. It was o.k. and funny, but you just have to endure the profanity."
"Roger_Sterling","10","2","5","22 December 2005"," Absolutely hilarious
","I don't think I've ever laughed so hard in my life, and that's saying something. I knew this movie was going to be funny, but I underestimated it. I don't know how Steve Carrell or anyone else in the movie for that matter, can keep a straight face while doing a funny scene. The funniest scene had to be when Andy and Trish are about to do it and Trish's daughter come in and sees all the condoms on the floor. And all Trish daughter's (forgot her name) date has to say is ""teach me"" This IS the funniest movie of the year, and one of the funniest I've ever seen. I don't know if it'll make a difference, but buy or rent the unrated edition. The 17 minutes REALLY pile it on."

","Steve really has it down in this one. He is a true comic gem and really shows his stuff in this funny and surprisingly sweet film. Character development is really well done and rare by todays movie standards. With a society that is so caught up in losing their virginity as quickly as possible, showing that you can wait for love and the right person for your first time is really refreshing for a change. Also showing the many sides of how men look at and chase women from the splendid supporting cast is really a treat. You will laugh hard with this one. I hope Steve has a long and rewarding film career, because he is really one of the few comic actors out there that is shining right now and really deserves a fantastic career in the future. Paul Rudd really is becoming quite a comic actor as well, and is super funny in this one. Remember- Sex is great but sex with someone you love is wonderful."
"valadas","5","2","5","16 November 2005"," Is this supposed to be funny?
","Well is this movie against pre-marital sex after all? Anyway if it's supposed to be a comedy it should make me laugh which it did only 3 times during the whole projection and even so very mildly. The rest of the time I was bored watching the tribulations of a 40 year old guy who reached the age of 40 without having sex in a time and a society where many people seems to begin having it at 14. We never know why this happened (shyness, impotence, lack of libido or opportunity?). As a counterpoint to that we have to put up with the stupid utterances and dialogues of three nincompoops who are job mates of the virgin and supposedly his counsellors on how he should get deflowered since they are supposed to be sex experts. All the time I was thinking on how this theme could be dealt with by someone with the genius of a Woody Allen for instance, with his intelligent direction, witty dialogues and scenes full of real humour including some portion of subtle eroticism without having to resort all the time to four letter words and explicit sex scenes. Well but since Judd Apatow is no Woody Allen and we cannot ask a thicket to give pears, that's what we have here I mean a movie where except two or three well achieved scenes all the rest is merely so-so."
"solidgameboy12-1","10","2","5","24 October 2005"," Steve Carell Does it again.
","Steve Carell did excellent as Brick Tamland in Anchorman. He has outdone himself in The 40 Year old Virgin. This film, pretty much being the 1st film with Steve Carell doing his own role without Will Ferrell (And I can't say Steve Rudd, because he has a part in there too.), which has been one of the most funniest things I had ever seen in my life.<br/><br/>The story involves Steve as the title role, as a guy who has never had anything more than some bad relationships with women in his younger years. As a 40 year old virgin, with barely not much to live for other than his strong nerd fantasies (I'm a Semi - Nerd, so I know what I'm talking.), which has been nothing if real dull.<br/><br/>Then, three worker friends of his invite him to a game and soon find out he's never had a girlfriend in his life, and the possible things that could happen if he ever had a girlfriend. Soon, his friends start to give him tips, about how to get a girlfriend, but they all have their own views on what a woman really is.<br/><br/>The movie from there on is nothing more than probably the funniest scenes, comments, and just great visual gags than anybody could ever imagine.<br/><br/>This is a movie you'll have to see for yourself, but be warned, Within the first 7 minutes of the movie, you'll see why it got an ""R"" rating in the first place, and how good of a movie it wouldn't have been with a ""PG - 13"" rating.<br/><br/>A film I highly recommended. Great for 'tears rolling down your face' laughs. 10/10."
"BlackFilm","Null","2","5","3 September 2005"," Too much ...
","First, let me say, this film is very funny. It had the potential to be one of the great comedies in recent times. But it also had it's shortcomings that for me, and I'm sure for others, were too much to overlook.<br/><br/>Now, I am not over sensitive and I can take a joke. But, did anyone else feel that the black stereotypes were overdone, and the amount of them was overkill, especially considering that there was only one significant black character? I mean, it was fine after the first hit ... even the second and third. The movie poked it's fun at everyone. But the black stereotypes just kept coming, and they weren't funny.<br/><br/>Every other character in the film was new and hilarious. The writing for them was fresh and funny. But when it came to the black character it got very stereotypical. The actor who played the role did a very good job with the material he was given. But I'm sure, at times, he had to feel like the other guys got to be funny and have new material, and he was just there to be a platform for all of the same ""black jokes"" the writers wanted to get away with.<br/><br/>Again, I wanted to let it go. The film was so funny in other parts, and even had more of a story than I expected. But they just laid it on too thick by the end. There was one scene, near the end, where the black guy was selling a stereo to a black customer. It wasn't funny. It added nothing to the story. It was just two black guys being stereotypical using the ""n"" word in an argument for no apparent reason. The scene was gratuitous and out of place, and it was the last straw for me.<br/><br/>Hollywood either needs to bring in black writers for these characters, or the white writers need to dig a little deeper. Their work would be much funnier, deeper, more dramatic ... just much better if they took the time to look past the caricatures that they see in other films and on television. Talk to some black people for goodness sakes. If not, don't write for ""black people"". Just write for human beings. (Black actors can handle those roles too.) Or if you want to use racial humor, be creative and give these characters the same depth and thought that you give your other characters. You know? {END OF RANT} <br/><br/>Despite these things, the movie was funny. I can't recommend it because I'm tired of seeing the previously stated issues in films. So, I'm not looking to send it support. So, yes, if you see it you will laugh. But you'll laugh just as much if you see it on cable.<br/><br/>Also, if you're thinking about bringing your kids, don't. There is much more adult humor in it then I expected, even for the subject matter. That's just a heads up for parents."

The rest of the cast, too, is very funny, each taking a turn.<br/><br/>The overall ""sweetness"" of the mood of the movie is remarkable. It never seemed cloying to me, which I would have though was an impossibility in a movie, which is pretty darn raunchy in places. It is amazing that the jokes in this movie are largely not at someone's expense, and that the story is largely one of love conquers all, and the importance of friendship and human connections.<br/><br/>But the important thing is that this movie is just plain deadly funny.

After seeing this movie with my wife, I felt compelled to comment because this movie is incredibly funny and both of my wife and I were laughing nonstop for the entire movie. Judd Apatow and Steve Carell are going to become big stars as a result of this movie, and they totally deserve it. A smartly written script. The supporting cast was first rate. The plot was good and flowed smoothly. The dialog, although crude at times, is an accurate portrayal of how guys talk to each other about women. You can't help but root for Andy (Steve Carrell's character). Some people might be offended by some of the material and all I have to say about that is lighten up a little bit, the laughing will do you some good. Did I mention this movie was funny?"

Not the guy who is extremely dirty, but dirty to a point where it makes you cry. Great acting in this one and wasn't to much a surprise. **** out of ****.

The motif could not have been better and the characters accurately scripted. I'm a pretty conservative guy and normally, this movie is shunned by my piers and avoided as crap but I must say that the topic was compelling and I related to the obvious pain of being so human in a world where one can be judged way too easy. I took the viewing risk and I'm glad I did. The language was straight from the street alright and the culture clashes were accurate (well... maybe a little exaggerated) and the weirdos were REALLY WEIRD. But, what a blast!

","I won tickets to an advanced screening of The 40 Year-Old Virgin and couldn't have been more horrified when I was told the name of this movie. I recall trying to give my tickets away saying ""There is no way I'm seeing this movie!!' I'm so very glad I decided to go. I've not laughed this hard at a film in too long to remember. I loved the film so much I decided to see it again when it opened with a group of girlfriends. That's right - I'm one of the women who came to see this movie in droves. The film is raunchy and it makes no apologies for it - but it also is a very sweet film. I cared about these characters, which is not what I was expecting.<br/><br/>If you are put off by large amounts of profanity and frank discussions of sex you may find yourself squirming in your seat. There were a few moments I found uncomfortable but given the movie's title what else could you expect? It is funny that the lead character seemed to echo some of my own thoughts when the raunch got to be a bit too much.<br/><br/>I've heard some complaints about the movie's length. It is very near two hours and I did find myself checking my watch about 10 minutes before it was over. I can understand - it is the first starring role for Steve Carell, his first film to co-write along with first-time director Judd Apatow. They were just having too much fun to stop! I'm trying to think of any scene that could have been cut to make it just a bit shorter and the thing is I can't think of one. It all just works so well together.<br/><br/>Initially I was a bit turned off by the ending. No spoilers, but it just seemed to veer off so wildly that it made no sense. Upon seeing it the second time I realized that it made no sense and yet it made perfect sense. How else could it end? Go see this film with an open mind and you will not be disappointed. In fact, you will want to see it again as soon as possible."

","Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell) is living every guy's dream. His apartment is stocked full of action figures, hundreds of video games, posters... everything except his beautiful bisexual supermodel wife who enjoys playing games as much as he does, and his sports car. He's a virgin who rides a bike and lives alone.<br/><br/>He works at SmartTech, a spin off of stores such as Best Buy or Fry's. His coworkers in the stock room are David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen).<br/><br/>The four of them and Andy have very little in common. Andy's idea of an exciting weekend involves egg salad sandwiches in his apartment, and let's just say that the others have more interesting lives than that.<br/><br/>But now that they're in need of a fifth poker player for the game, they wonder if Andy would be a possible candidate. However, at this point, they see him as a mysterious guy and a potential serial killer. They grudgingly invite him to play with them, and he accepts.<br/><br/>As they guys exchange stories about their crazy sexual encounters and David starts obsessing about his ex-girlfriend Amy, all the guys start ragging on him, including Andy. At this point, he seems to be fitting in well enough, but the guys put him on the spot, making him tell a wild sex story.<br/><br/>He stumbles and bumbles, and ends up describing a woman's breasts as bags of sand. The other guys figure out he is a virgin, and decide to get to find a girl.<br/><br/>The relationship between Andy and his three friends is done amazingly well. I personally can relate to Andy. When I was in high school, my friends would often give me random dating advice and how to get with girls, etc. However what was funny, was that neither of them were any more experienced than me. I could totally relate to Andy when he got mad at his friends, and wondered if it was all a cruel joke. I too felt that way sometimes, when people would tell me i was a pimp or a ladies man when I had never been on a date. And they really did care about him, and are true friends, which made the movie all the better. It could have gone the other way, with at least one of them being a cruel prankster, but I was glad 40 year old virgin avoided having any real antagonist.<br/><br/>One amazing thing about this movie is that every character has a little bit of meaning and depth, and every actor is excellent. Wedding Crashers had a couple of characters that did nothing but provide cheap laughs. The homophobic racist grandma, Claire's evil boyfriend and Todd were all exploited for laughs and never really allowed to develop into anything. But EVERY character in 40 year old Virgin is important and allows the plot to develop further. There is no one that stops the scene or drags it with a poor performance that is played only for laughs.<br/><br/>In fact, this movie is so good that it could have been three separate movies, combined into one amazing cinematic performance. The three movies I speak of: 1. Guy has never had sex, friends want him to get laid - This part alone was funnier than similar movies like American Pie.<br/><br/>2. Guy/girl romance, break up, drama, issues, etc - Better than the formulaic movies that have come out like Must Love Dogs or All About Love... or most rom com.<br/><br/>3. Mother/daughters relationship - The relationship between Trish (Catherine Keener) and Marla (Kat Dennings) alone could have been a movie with Andy as a side character. this would have been a much better movie than The Perfect Man, mainly because the plot and characters and acting were much better. Plus, Dennings and Keener... much better looking than Duff and Locklear.<br/><br/>The main point is... this is the best movie since Spiderman 2, and the best comedy I have ever seen in my life. See it now, but see Wedding Crashers first. If you see this first you'll be disappointed in Wedding Crashers... see it first, love it, and then love this one more!"

","Reminds me of the Farrelly Brothers' last few films. It's a comedy that wants to come off as really touching and thoughtful, one that doesn't want to use its pathetic characters for laughs, but then forgets to be especially funny otherwise. The 40 Year-Old Virgin is funny often enough to make it worth seeing, but the laughs are rarely belly laughs. I just never felt satisfied even after its best jokes. It seemed to be pulling some major punches. Scenes go on for a long time without payoff, and other scenes that seem to have golden setups get cut way too short. For example, in one sequence the title character's friends set him up with a prostitute. It becomes obvious from the outset that it's a man, but as soon as that's established, the movie cuts to the next scene. We don't see the virgin try to get out of the situation. We don't see the hooker try to do anything. There's a lot of potential for great comedy there; it doesn't have to be that dirty, either, to be funny. God knows we don't need a second Deuce Bigalow movie in the theaters this weekend. Steve Carell is very good, and all the characters are quite well fleshed out. I wish they would have done maybe a little more with Catherine Keener. She seems like she might be more interesting if we knew more about her. The movie's worth seeing, but wait for video."

","I am astounded at how many great reviews this movie has received. I thought the movie to be horridly tasteless in it's constant use of the foulest language possible. Carrel's scene where he's being waxed appeared to be the funniest scene as shown on commercials, but when the time came, it turned out to be nothing more than a 5 minute explicative-fest that would make Chris Rock blush. Why is it that the male college-aged crowd finds the overuse of the worst possible names for female and male genitalia as cursing names so funny? What happened to the witty and sometimes slapstick comedy of movies like Anchorman, Dumb and Dumber, and even Dodgeball? Now, please realize, I myself am a college-aged student who gets a kick out of the occasional crude humor, drug jokes, or things of that nature. Heck, I even enjoyed quite a bit of ""Harold & Kumor Go to White Castle"". Now given that there was a good deal of crudeness in that, it didn't rely on it to be it's focal point of gaining laughs all the time. To tell you the truth, if I hear about another rated R comedy coming out by the director of The 40-Year Old Virgin, I'll probably hold off on seeing it at least till it comes out on video, if at all.<br/><br/>This movie had a decent plot to hold it together, and Carrel's spaced-out personality kinda makes you chuckle in itself, but I was hoping to see a movie that held itself together through actual FUNNY lines and clever writing, rather than tasteless humor that it would seem you would need at least 4 beers before you would find it remotely funny. I thought Wedding Crashers was a great movie and was a little worried that this movie would step over some of the lines that Wedding Crashers tilted on all throughout it.......and it did. Even my roommate, who enjoys quite a few raunchy movies, thought this one was too much.<br/><br/>I'll spare this movie three stars for the decent plot line and handful of laughs I got out of it, but if you have any morals WHAT-SO-EVER, save your money and rent it."

","Kudos to Hollywood for its skill in stretching one very unoriginal joke into almost two hours of repetitive gags. So how many times are you going to laugh at a morning woody? Or yet another drunken driving sequence? Or a discussion about women's breats? There's about as much original humor here as in the warnings on a package of Trojans, not to mention an utter lack of erotic tension. Romany Malco displays great timing, Catherine Keener shines (as usual) but headliner Steve Carell sinks a notch or two from his excellent corporate jerk role in The Office. He displays a frozen, deer-in-the-headlights stare that becomes tedious after the first half hour or so. Maybe he has come to the realization that there's very little to laugh about in this overblown and blatantly commercial road to penetration --other than the gross-triggered guffaws of gags built around diverse bodily orifices and organs. 40 Year Old Virgin feels like watching the 30 Years War Plus 10 in real time --minus the action and gore."
"lambiepie-2","1","2","6","20 January 2007"," Gosh awful excuse for a ""comedy""
","I loved the poster. And that's the ONLY thing I liked about this hapless farce. When I saw the billboards and posters, it was the funniest thing I've ever seen so I was looking forward to this film. Just like with ""Wedding Crashers"" there is too much hype to what is an non-funny film.<br/><br/>The premise is funny: a 40-something year old man who works at a ""Best Buy"" knock-off shop never had premarital sex. How can that be in this day and time? That's what his friends want to know and try to fix him up with every woman they can find in an 'easy' situation think of doing to help him -- but he just doesn't connect with anyone until he meets the woman who works across the street. He's clumsy around her, goofy - and they fall in love.<br/><br/>So why is this film awful in this reviewer's view? Well, the actors were not comedic - I never laughed - ONCE. Very stiff, very unfunny. I found that with most of the movie, the actors played everything out...pathetically. Instead of laughing with the group, I felt sorry for them all. Somber and displaced looking actors, Steve Carrell being the most somber trying to be ""funny"". You would think being that a virgin the character would be a bit more nervous, but he was just CREEPY. Not 'funny' creepy, not even 40 year old virgin creepy - just creepy. Every time I see Paul Rudd in a film, I cringe for I'm not completely convinced that he can BE comedic - he can be a smart-Aleck, and to some that can mean funny, but not to me. Then there is Catherine Keener - she just does not move me in any film I've seen her in, lately. She seems as though she may be waiting for lines, nervous about delivering lines, surprised when she gives most lines - but regardless when she talks, they are just lines to me. I didn't feel her character here.<br/><br/>There could have been many other hilarious ways to go with this film, but they all would entail better writers and better actors.

","I missed out on this film during its cinema release as I figured it to be yet another sex-comedy with gross-out gags. While the film does contain a little of this it is way more character based and the humor comes from more absurd situations than disgusting. Never judge book by its cover huh? Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell) is a 40-year-old virgin. His life is made up of working in the returns department of an electronics store, collecting toys of movie characters and watching reality TV with his OAP neighbors. The touch of a woman is foreign to him and he is yet to be educated in their mysterious ways. Though he does have the bonus of not having to put up with their moaning, tantrums and bitching 'because they can'! When his secret is wrenched out of him his work buddies make it their mission to help him pop his cherry and think of a zillion, wacky, hair-brained schemes.<br/><br/>But Andy is interested in Trish (Catherine Keener) the woman from the store across the road. Only he's really intimidated and arranges a weird no-sex policy with her that originally makes her relax at not having to live up to expectations but eventually makes her want to explode. Can he keep his secret from her too and perform the dirty deed with apparent expertise of your average porn stud? I'm just not a fan of all these ""Apatow Comedies"". Most of them long outstay their welcome and go on for well over two hours. The 40 Year Old Virgin is no exception.<br/><br/>Despite some crude humor here and there this is more of a light-hearted 'drama-com' than a romantic comedy. Carrell also proves he a far more talented actor and comedian than Will Ferrel or Adam Sandler.<br/><br/>Three stars are for the movie but it gets an extra bonus half-star for including a wonderfully, wonderfully top-heavy actress as Trish's daughter. Man, with women this big-boobed you just know there is a God."

","Huge fan of the quotes in this movie!!!! To be honest i didn't so much like the second half it got really mushy, but that was to be expected. The first half though was hilarious, i cant remember the last time i laughed so much, so loud. I have seen it twice already and my friend has seen it 3 times and we plan to go again its just a fun movie to go see, and i don't usually go see the same movie in theaters so to me that says a lot that i would. I think Steve Carrel (andy) seriously lived up to expectations and i hope to see more from him. I really enjoy his whole style in the characters he plays, all i can say is that i was really impressed and more people should go check this movie out!!!!!

","I have seen this movie twice and I must say it was well worth the money. This is raunchy enough for the men with a sweet under tone for the women. It makes you laugh in all the right parts and the cast could not have been more well assembled. Steve Carell has most definitely made it as a Hollywood star. This movie made me laugh from beginning to end. A warning: this movie is not for those who are uncomfortable with the topic of sex or who are extremely religious. The dialogue is graphic but realistic. Every conversation that took place between ""andy"" and his friends reminded of every conversation I have ever listened to coming from my guy friends. As for the sweet undertone it is there. Catherine Keener was absolutely magnificent and true gem on the screen. She was believable in every way and I am proud to say that she attended both my old elementary and high school. The cast was incredible and the direction of the movie was fantastic. There's only one thing left to say and that is Mr. Steve Carell you have arrived!"

","I think what I had to love about this movie is that, when we went to see it, it was because we have a very close friend that this movie could have easily been written about. We snickered as we bought tickets expecting to find ourselves saying, ""It's ...!. We didn't. While parts of this movie most definitely captured our friend, it also captured ourselves. I think parts of it will capture everyone. While the title of the movie suggests that it's going to be about deflowering a 40 year old virgin, it makes us question our own insecurities about sex and love (mostly love) and there are some really, really sweet scenes. Andy's friends from SmartTech are more experienced sexually, but none really have a clue as to how to have a relationship with a woman. They mean well - they want Andy to experience this part of his life he's been avoiding until age 40, but as his teachers they do some hysterical things to (for?) him that keep you laughing. This one's a keeper."

","The plot: a nerdy misfortunate 40 year old who has not yet blossomed into a man and his jock friends goading him into getting into bed with a girl. And I voted 10 out of 10 on this? Yes, and would go so far as to say this film is a new classic in the comedy aisle of your local video store. Because as much as this film lacks propriety and sophistication, it offers the viewer clever situational comedy, brilliant writing (Carell and Apatow are a pair of geniuses!), and excellent acting to keep you in stitches from the time Andy wakes up to the ""cherry on the sundae-perfect"" ending. This film stays true to the sentimental nature of romance, but isn't mushy. Perfect date movie. Summer 2005 has brought us one of the best comedies since ""Meet the Parents""."

I hate to spend money on a so-so movie, and so this one was definitely worth the 8 bucks. If you are looking for a light-hearted comedy, this is it. My make-up was all gone, because I was crying so much from the laughter. The humor is subtle and for mature audiences. The language and dialog are explicit and worthy of the ""R"" rating for sure. Do not take your kids and do not go see it with your mom. It is absolutely an adult movie."

","You can't walk down the street without seeing something that uses sex as advertising. Clothing, entertainment, and everything under the sun uses some form of sex to sell an product. For men it is hard not to notice and start thinking about it. But some guys live they're lives with not a care in the world. That's where Andy Stitzer comes in...<br/><br/>In The 40 Year Old Virgin, Steve Carell play Andy, your average nice guy living alone with his action figures, comic books, video games, and his bicycle. He works at a local electronics store where his co-workers are primarily guys. When the guys invite him out for a game of poker, he is all in sort of speak. As the game goes on the topic of sex is brought up. With all this talk about sex and erotic adventures, Andy is a little uncomfortable trying to mask his secret. But eventually the beans are spilled...Andy is a virgin.<br/><br/>So what's the big fuss over not having sex? It wouldn't be so bad if he wasn't surrounded by David, Jay, and Cal (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen) who are undeniably infatuated with making Andy into a man. They give him all sorts of helpful ideas like hitting on drunk girls, talking dirty, and getting a full body wax. Andy tries to do what they tell them, but his past sexual encounters have kinda left a scar that isn't easy to heal. His desire has burnt out in a way. He just needs a spark in the form of maybe Trish (Katherine Keener), a woman who runs her own store where she sells stuff on eBay for people. With Andy's situation brightening and his co-worker's love life dwindling the movie really kicks off.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow has written some funny material like Heavyweights and the TV series Freaks and Geeks. But nothing compares to this one. Carell is perfect as the humble yet ready for anything Andy. His side slitting humor is fantastic. Rudd does a great job as a man recovering from a hard breakup...two and half years ago. Malco and Rogen both give their take on women and either way it's hilarious. These four men are without a doubt one of the funniest ensembles put together. They rag on each other and push everyone around, but it's just what guys do. Everyone has met at least one of these characters before at work, school, or just noticed one.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin will have you rolling in the isles and wiping tears of joy from your face within the first two minutes. This laugh out loud comedy is a little too old for young teens so the R rating is necessary. This one perfect for those who like Old School, Wedding Crashers, and all of those recent off the wall comedies. So go out and enjoy this movie. Andy might have waiting 40 years to 'get it on' but you shouldn't wait to see this film."

","Thank god for Steve Carell and Judd Apatow who single (or would that be double) -handedly have saved American Comedy, a dying breed, I know. The 40 Year Old Virgin is the fun, raunchy, and downright heartwarming tale that Wedding Crashers tried, and mostly failed, to be. Steve and the entire supporting cast including the gorgeous Catherine Keener play the movie straight, and the laughs are never forced or farcical. I'm going to go ahead and disagree with other comments that claim the movie's long running time works against it, by saying that it's refreshing to see a movie that isn't always rushing to the next gag, but hitting its marks like a professional. Me and mine haven't laughed so much at a comedy in years, and we're fairly certain that if you don't find this funny and claim to be a fan of movies, you either need to lighten up or get laid. Funniest movie of the year is a given, but it may just be one of the funniest in the last ten years. A real charmer that both guys and gals will enjoy equally.

This film was every bit as funny as advertised but what led me to actually write about it was it's charm, romance, originality and brutal honesty. The honesty is the film's true strength and humor. For my 17 year old daughter, it proved to be an excellent lesson in how many different types of men think and judge all the many types of women. I would pay to see it again in the theater, I may even buy the DVD as opposed to renting. Tons of fun, loads of laughs - the must-see comedy of the year."

","I reluctantly went to see this movie last night with my husband and 18 year old son. I was pleasantly surprised at the way we (the viewers) were brought right up to speed. The characters developed quickly, and even the bit characters had memorable moments-the waxing lady was too funny. We could see that she was absolutely dying with laughter and horrified wonder as the fur was removed from our hero's chest, and I was laughing so hard that my face ached. Actually, I laughed through a majority of the movie. Steve Carrell is endearing- a wonderful blend of honesty, kindness, innocence and wild abandon. I highly recommend this movie to any adult. Of course it isn't for children, and even the teenagers/20ish kids in the theater didn't appreciate some of the humorous parts (like the Asia poster and comments), but the audience that was in the theater when I saw it was overall very appreciative of the humor, the heart, and soul of this standout movie. I'll be telling my other middle aged friends to grab their walkers and get out to see this very funny movie, and to stay for the credits at the end."

The ""general consensus"" was that The 40 Year-Old Virgin was far funnier than Wedding Crashers and let me start off by saying that this movie blows away Wedding Crashers and quite frankly a list of other comedy movies I have seen recently. In my opinion, this film may be one of the best comedies ever created.<br/><br/>The opening scene of The 40 Year-Old Virgin is one that had the whole theater cracking up. This trend of uncontrollable laughter continued throughout the entire movie and there was rarely a period of time without an explosion of laughter in the theater.<br/><br/>I feel that Steve Carell was perfectly cast for the lead and I can't really think of another actor who could have pulled it off. In addition, the supporting roles played by Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen really brought the movie together and provided plenty of laughs.<br/><br/>The 40 Year-Old Virgin is no doubt a laugh-out-loud movie that may give you the urge to see it again right after you leave the theater the first time. Although this film may seem to be directed at a younger crowd I was very surprised to see a good amount of older people in the theater, and they were nearly falling out of their seats like everybody else in the theater. I recommend this movie to nearly anyone who enjoys a good comedy and isn't afraid of explicit sexual themes. Two very big thumbs up!"

I hope that future comedies take a cue or two from this movie.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of Steve Carell for quite some time now because of the Daily Show. This is a guy that knows how to be funny but not in a cheap way. I'm glad he now has had his first moment to shine in Hollywood. Will Ferrell should be worried that the bell is tolling on him.

He goes through training, expert tips, he waxes his chest, and in everything he does the outcome is always mostly on the funny side.

Whether this is because I seem to be more emotional during movies, or just because that's how it's supposed to be, the film sends a strong message. That message? Love wins. I don't normally feel the need to give comedies high praise, but I feel this film deserves it. Not only is it funny, but it teaches an important lesson in life. To my delight, Seth Rogen stars in the film and plays one of the many funny characters. I had only expected to see Steve Carell as the one actor I would recognize, but I recognized quite a few. The chemistry between the core group of characters works and flows naturally. It is quite the experience seeing how things unfold for the 40 year old virgin and I promise it will entertain."

","After decades of being dragged to the cinema by our better halves to watch the latest Meg Ryan or Hugh Grant pap, it was only a matter of time until men fought back in the rom-com genre. Director Judd Apatow, along with co-writer and lead star Steve Carell, went the extra mile and actually created a rom-com that is both genuinely romantic and laugh- out-loud hilarious, but one that members of both sex can actually enjoy. But amongst all the sweetness there are four guys talking like genuine guys. So, this includes lines like ""you need to put the pussy on a pedestal!"" and ""you know how I know you're gay? You listen to Coldplay."" The language is filthy, but the script is heartfelt.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer (Carell) lives a simple life alone with his collection of valuable (and still boxed) action figures and his gaming chair, working in the stockroom of an electronic store. He also rides a bike to work and never socialises, leading his co-workers to naturally assume he's a serial killer. When they find themselves a man down for a poker game, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) invite Andy. After swapping freaky sex stories, it becomes clear that Andy is in fact a 40 year-old virgin, and so they make a vow to get him laid. Amongst his options are the girl from the bookshop Beth (Elizabeth Banks), who takes a liking to Andy after he takes Cal's advice, his horny boss Paula (Jane Lynch), and the spunky Trish (Catherine Keener), a woman who's just opened a store across the street.<br/><br/>The thing that The 40 Year-Old Virgin achieves most is how accurately it portrays its men. Sure, these are extreme versions of people we have come across before in our lives, but men generally talk crap and half- truths to each other about women, movies and computer games. The advice that David, Jay and Cal give is hardly helpful, and is based on their own half-remembered experiences that lead to the assumption that they are the ones that truly understands women. But they are all screwed up in their own way that their advice just leads to some amusing scenes, including the most famous scene of Andy having his chest waxed (which Carell really did, and he's the hairiest comedian since Robin Williams).<br/><br/>The film also succeeds in its honesty and its attention to detail. Andy isn't the badly-dressed, bespectacled nerd that has been seen in the likes of She's All That (1999), that once he's given a makeover, he's a hunk. He signals when he's turning his bike on an empty street and his Monday-morning what-I-did-at-the-weekend stories involve making an egg salad sandwich. He's relatable because he's real, so his quest to get his leg over becomes something ultimately more important. The supporting cast are all excellent, especially Malco, who I'm surprised hasn't gone on to bigger things, and Keener, who is surprisingly adorable after years of playing the bitch. Like many movies churned out by the Apatow machine, it's goes on for far too long, but that's easy to forgive when the film is this funny.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

","""The 40-Year-Old Virgin"" focuses on the character of Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell), a middle-aged introvert who never had experienced the world of sex. He works at an electronics shop with co-workers David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) and their boss Paula (Jane Lynch). Across the street from heir workplace is a store called ""We Sell Your Stuff on Ebay"" where the proprietor is a middle-aged woman named Trish (Catherine Keener) who has three children and is also a grandmother who currently is not dating anyone at the moment. Trish becomes attracted to Andy, but suddenly his colleagues soon discover that he is a virgin and this is where all the verbal hassling comes into play. Due to the constant hassling has delayed Andy from ever getting any sexual feelings from Trish.<br/><br/>I'm sure we have all seen 40 year olds who just happen to be virgins. Yet the leading gender demographics are predominately female. Due to the gender bent more sexual lust, it's very rare to find a male who's a 40 year old virgin. And yet more women seem to get support from others for their celibate lifestyle than men (particularly from men who have been smitten by these women for decades). As a man of 37 years old, I have not experienced what it'd like to be sexual active. If I had a child, I would recommend he or she to lose it sooner than later because I believe one's sexual experience could lead them to a path of glory.<br/><br/>Even though I can relate to the leading character here, I don't have complete praise because I didn't find anything that was out of anything unacceptable, at the same there was also stuff that wasn't very memorable too. The only good advice that I found helpful was as soon as you tie the knot, you must sell your entire comic book collection. The other is once you find yourself in romantic fling with a girl, it's time to throw way all the porn videos.<br/><br/>Even though the movie has all the essential elements of a sex comedy, however, there's only really one sex scene. The fowl language is put into good effect here and the sexual references are handled in a mature perspective. I say I recommend this movie if your okay with the language and the sexual references."

"richy1024","7","1","2","3 October 2012"," Wonderful depiction of the average, boring, middle-aged man but also a virgin! Very innocent indeed.
","Judd Apatow's and Steve Carell's characterisation of a 40 year old man replicates how young adults would brand their old man. Dull, immobile and petulant whilst posing in woolly jerseys. Personifying him as a virgin appends another mode of description. Most would find this amusing as generally most of nation lose their virginity from the day they are legal to drop their pants to fool around. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a charming gentleman but a typical outcast, surrounded by sexual characteristics and hiding a very personal secret. After identifying the bags of sands as metaphor for the chest of a woman, there are those who become apprehensive of his lack of sexual activity. Co-worker David (Paul Rudd) sets out to assist Andy conquer the female anatomy, educating the casualness of intercourse and how to win the hearts of a woman's fine assets.<br/><br/>Carell's stage presence has been a pitch of bits and pieces, cameos in Bewitched and the ever-popular journalism comedy Anchorman, starring Will Farrell and Carell's co-forty year old partner Rudd. This could be Carell's big break; this is a startling and valiant effort. He typifies the stereotypical mid-40's male, minus the squabbling teenagers with a vast style and potential to rise as a lead act in future outings that look almost guaranteed on the comedy front. His knowledge of this character is quite remarkable. Although he is of a similar age, to strip back to convey the formulaic maths teacher image is rather amusing in its own qualities. His tone and pitch are on point with no over-expressive weedy exaggerations. This is a character of wonderful intimacy, nurturing his action figure to a polished effect. In contrast, Steve Carell unravels some sheer talents in the comedy locker, unleashing uproarious waves of characteristic sound-effects and squeals to keep up with the tempo of the true nature of the 'giggle'. The delightfully funny nature of the waxing scene not only typifies Carell's wonderful immaturity, but also pictures the orthodox belief of how all men would react to such a meticulous circumstance."

","The 40 Year Old Virgin has a pretty self explanatory title. Steve Carell plays Andy, a nerdy recluse who has never had sex in his 40 years of living. When his coworkers find this out they set out to get Andy laid for the first time in his life. This, of course, isn't as easy as Andy and his coworkers anticipated and they all find themselves in wild and quirky situations along the way to losing virginity.<br/><br/>This is Judd Apatow's directorial debut and possibly his best and most hysterical film to date. It shows off his uncanny ability to tell an intriguing story and also pack it full of absurd, vulgar, and hilarious jokes. There is not a dull moment in The 40 Year Old Virgin. It's wall to wall laughs with every scenario getting wilder and funnier. Even clocking in at just under two hours, or two hours and 13 minutes if you watch the unrated version, the film is still funny and wildly entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>Apatow deserves a lot of credit for his directing and writing, but the actors in this film deserve just as much. The film is crammed with stars and the amount of cameos is brilliant. Some of the celebrity faces we see in this film weren't even big stars when the film was released, such as Mindy Kaling's cameo as an ex-girlfriend of Paul Rudd's character. In 2005 she was just beginning her role as Kelly on The Office, but today she's incredibly popular. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is obviously hilarious as Andy and the film would not be the same without him. But the star studded supporting cast is just as impressive. Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Jane Lynch, Leslie Mann, Elizabeth Banks, and a brief moment from Jonah Hill give this film comedic life all the way through. Much of the script was improvised on set, which produced hysterical results. This is a perfect cast to pull off this level of improvised hilarity and it gives the comedic stylings of this film a fresh and natural feeling which makes it all the more hilarious.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin is modern comedic genius. It's unforgettably hilarious, incredibly quotable, and shockingly vulgar, but in a good way. It will probably always be the glimmering peak of Steve Carell's film career, even if it was so early on in that career. Apatow will probably never surpass this film in anything he writes, directs, or produces. The 40 Year Old Virgin is simply too funny."

Eventually, Andy comes to terms realizing that Trish is the love of his life and tells her the truth. Steve is great in this and he and Catherine have good chemistry. I recommend this great comedy."

","Spoiler alert The 40 year old man is actually the kind of guy who has had sex with prostitutes. He is not a nut job like a real 40 year male virgin would be. What his problem is, is mostly bad luck. He rarely got a 3rd date with a girl and never was able to go all the way. He has come to the point in life where he has given up on non-professional sex partners. If you are interested in seeing this movie based on the title, it may be a waste of time. On the other hand if you like Steve Carrell and some of the other guys who took part in making this film, then you will probably enjoy this movie. Instead of hiring someone to write a screenplay they improvised. The plot is Carrell tells his poker buddies that he has never scored. They feel sorry for him and try to help him get laid. He does not actually say anything about the prostitutes , that is something he does not want to talk about. The comedy comes from his friends do not actually know why a man succeeds with a woman, but they think they do. Carrell meets a woman who wants some male companionship and becomes her friend. He does not try to seduce her and winds up having sex with her."

","I really wanted to like this movie for two reasons: 1) There was massive hype surrounding it. 2) I like the writers, director, and actors of it. 3) It was considered as the best comedy of the year.<br/><br/>As much as I tried to like it; after the end credits rolled, I asked myself: ""what was supposed to make it that great?"", ""what was the big deal about it?"".<br/><br/>Sure, the plot is pretty inventive and funny because it's character driven and supported by funny dialogs and the occasional and well done scatological humor but that's something you've seen before.<br/><br/>Okay, maybe the mature actors whose starred on it where better than having unfunny ""American Pie""-esquire characters. <br/><br/>Sure, Carrell's performance was very funny mainly because he's an experienced comedian. But it wasn't great by any means.<br/><br/>The ""WTF"" sequences were over the top and at some points fit in the movie's tone but weren't enough to carry on with the whole fun factor.<br/><br/>This is sadly an overrated comedy which may be considered a favorite and an instant classic but it isn't by any means a genre definer."

","I popped my 'Judd Apatow cherry' with Knocked Up, and the experience was less than satisfying: rather awkward, painful at times, and not something I was in a hurry to repeat. However, with The 40 Year Old Virgin, I really got in the mood, and by the time the end credits were rolling (just after the entire cast had performed their excellent rendition of The Age of Aquarius), I was completely spent, having shared two hours of my life in the company of a film that really knew what it was doing!<br/><br/>The plot sees Steve Carell's likable nerd Andy Stitzer coerced by his work buddies into admitting that he has reached the grand old age of 40 without having sex. On discovering that Andy is still a virgin, they vow to help the poor guy get laid. It's a simple premise that delivers plenty of vulgarity, nudity, and childish humour (all of which I am in favour of), but at the same time allows you to care for its characters, even managing to throw in a bit of genuine romance and drama for good measure.<br/><br/>Carell is great as the geek who has to grow a pair and confront his fears in order to find happiness, whilst the supporting cast who play his pals (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco and Seth Rogen) are all excellent in their respective roles. For me, however, Catherine Keener was particularly outstanding as the love interest, looking very hot for a 46 year old.<br/><br/>At nearly two hours, the film is perhaps a little overlong and some judicious trimming could have improved the flow somewhat, but, on the whole, The 40 Year Old virgin is a very funny film and recommended to all open-minded viewers looking for a laugh (unless you happen to be a 40 year old virgin yourself, in which case you'll probably spend the whole movie cringing whilst pretending to laugh at the jokes. If that's the case, avoid it completely or watch it alonewhich I guess you probably would do anyway...)."

","The most important component of a successful comedy is the cast. In this case, we have a well-assembled cast working from an intelligent (though sometimes raunchy) script. Steve Carrell is perfectly suited to the title role. He is able to effortlessly assume an air of awkwardness which is essential in portraying the character. The supporting cast is also solid and play off one another wonderfully.<br/><br/>The story is engaging and does a good job of balancing humour and humanity. I can't recall a lot of 'laugh out loud' moments but I was snickering throughout the entire movie. I should mention that despite being a 'sex comedy' there isn't really a lot of overt sexuality in the movie, even in the 'unrated' version.<br/><br/>I do have one minor quibble about the storyline, though. It seems to me that Andy's eventual transformation is a little too drastic. To me, it would have been more effective (and realistic) if he had retained some of the hallmark characteristics of his earlier persona.<br/><br/>Also, I just didn't 'get' the ""Age of Aquarius"" finale and thought that it was a pretty tiresome way to end to the movie.

","I put off watching this movie for a long time because I assumed it was going to be crass. But it's not. It's well written and, dare I say, surprisingly sweet and touching. I couldn't for a moment imagine anyone other than Steve Carell pulling off the title role of Andy, the guy who has indeed managed to reach forty without getting laid, certainly a feat worthy of a movie in 21st century America. He brings a unique combination of integrity, humor and honesty to the role which actually makes him quite believable. Catherine Keener likewise is perfectly cast as the single parent Trish, who hasn't quite given up on the hope of finding a nice guy. She's attractive and sexy but actually looks like a fully grown woman not a teen supermodel, and we are spared the usual wishful thinking of Hollywood that 40 year old men and 18 year old women are a natural fit.<br/><br/>Andy is a little nerdy but certainly not lacking self awareness. Sitting in his neat apartment, surrounded by his collection of still-boxed (virgin?) action figures, his video games chair and his toy soldiers, he knows something is missing in his life but doesn't quite know what to do about it. His life is not unpleasant, but he's just treading water, wondering what comes next. As played by Carell, he comes across as a nice guy, not a sad loser, and it would have been so easy to reduce this story to that of a sad loser. I'm glad the writers resisted that temptation. Andy's not a middle aged virgin because he is unattractive or dumb, or lacking a libido, but almost because he is too nice. Things just never quite worked out with girls when he was younger, and gradually as the years crept by, it got harder and harder to change the status quo. His colleagues at work, on discovering his pristine, still-boxed condition, are determined to get him laid and throw every cliché in the book at him, trying amongst other tricks, to teach him how to pick up drunks in bars. Some scenes are funnier than others.<br/><br/>The colleagues and other supporting cast are mostly stereotype figures, the horny female boss, and the foul-mouthed ""lads"" who love 'em and leave 'em (and who, surprisingly, come across as the real losers.) But when he actually meets Trish, a potential partner, and gets a date, Andy manages to rise above them all, forming a genuine relationship as he and Trish take time to get to know each other, before he has to reveal the truth to her. The ending is fairly weak, but the whole movie was a pleasant amusing interlude mid week after a stressful day at work, and I enjoyed it far more than I thought I would. I guess I have no excuse not to rent Knocked Up now, do I? I doubt it will be this cute."

I figured this would be just another body for the Lame Rom-Com pile, and that it would disappear from the scene as fast as it had arrived.<br/><br/>But no. This movie is head and shoulders above the rest of its genre. The writing is surprisingly true to life and almost completely devoid of the telegraphed pratfalls and manufactured sappiness that I have come to expect.

","Wow. I didn't know if it'd be possible to mix this much raunchiness and sweetness together in the same movie and have it turn out good. This film somehow manages it.<br/><br/>I suppose the real criticism I have with the film is that it does go on too long. Granted, I was watching the Unrated Edition, which adds on 17 more minutes of footage; I think at least 20 minutes needed to go, because I was getting a little tired towards the end of the film.<br/><br/>But that didn't stop me from liking it. The characters are all very well drawn, have their own foibles and the side characters, as simple as they are, are not entirely stock. The film focuses on an awkward shy virgin, Andy, played by Steve Carrell. What I like about Andy's characterization is that he's not an ""empty"" character, but is surprisingly sociable for being a bit of a shut-in--this is a nerd with depth.<br/><br/>Anyway, I don't need to explain the premise to you, but some of the situations that Andy is put in by his friends or by his own bumbling are hilarious and sometimes they're incredibly disgusting. At the same time, there's a surprising amount of pathos put into even some of the gross-out scenes. The directing isn't exactly brisk, but it keeps the mood and sets the tone of the film well. This isn't a dying-of-laughter comedy, but it had me smiling inside, which being grossed out on the outside, which doesn't happen frequently.<br/><br/>Some of the jokes don't work so well, including the improvised ""You're gay because..."" series that permeate the latter half of the film. Still, the funny is more hit than miss and I really like how the film has something good to say about the pressure to have sex. And then there's the non-sequitar ending--but you'll have to watch it to know what I'm talking about. A solid comedy, but you might consider finding the theatrical version to keep the pace up. 8/10."

"thomas196x2000","7","1","2","19 February 2007"," Funny, and amazingly smart
","Let me start by saying that I am not a big fan of modern day comedies. Gross out films never did anything for me. I didn't like ""Porky's"", ""American Pie"" was rather disgusting, and when I finally saw ""There's Something About Mary"" I could not believe that this was the movie everyone rated so highly...yeah yeah, she's got a guy's ejaculate in her hair, funny. Nah, not really.<br/><br/>So a few weeks ago I picked up ""Anchorman"" and really enjoyed it on a ""non-think"" level. I enjoyed seeing the actors let go and just be foolish in a foolish comedy. I especially liked Steve Carell as the slightly retarded weatherman.<br/><br/>I remember seeing ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" in posters at the movie theater and dismissed it as just another gross out comedy. When I realized that Carell was in it, and co-wrote it, I said what the heck and bought it.<br/><br/>Just for starts, the cover picture of the title character tells it all. There he is, well groomed, a pleasant looking fellow that seems like he would be nice, and you can just immediately believe that he's a virgin. And all captured on that cover photo! At first I thought this might not be what I hoped for, with Carell walking around with ""morning wood"". But those types of visuals quickly give way to a story filled with hilarious characters, not background types put out there for gags.<br/><br/>Andy Sitzer has never had sex, he has tried, just never worked out. And sure he is a bit nerdy, but he is neither a pushover nor a crazy guy. He's a nice guy, and while he'll use the four letter words, he feels bad saying them. He certainly doesn't want anyone's pity, nor is he a pitiful character. He's a hilarious character, and that is one of the strengths of the movie.<br/><br/>Going in, you think Andy has this problem with sex. And in a lesser movie, that would be the whole movie. This movie goes that extra mile and paints a world where EVERY character has a problem with sex, and importantly, love. This gives the movie heart in the right place.<br/><br/>Women may complain that aside from Andy's eventual girlfriend, that women are not painted in a very good light in this movie. Well, as a non-nerdy but nice guy who dated a lot of women in the 80s prior to settling down, the women portrayed here, while exaggerated, seemed to come from the mind of a few fellows like me who have experienced them! Especially during the speed dating sequence. I remember one time myself on a first, blind date, a woman leaning over to me--and I thought she was going to say something romantic or clever--and saying that I perhaps might want to grow a beard to help cover the mild acne I had on my chin. And of course, what guy hasn't had a date with someone who is ""all religion"" or a total whack-job. The picture is painted so clear here that you will certainly be falling off your chair in laughter.<br/><br/>You're in the hands of professionals in this movie. When Jane Lynch and Carell have a conversations about ""F-buddies"", and Lynch goes into a serenade, I don't know when the last time I saw a funnier scene. Their interplay--here remembrance and turning the serenade over to Andy, and Andy nervously wishing he was anywhere but there, are priceless. Carell's ""yo yo master"" scene, the scene with Mooj going on and on about what sex and love ISN'T about, the women at speed dating, the ""Oscar Goldman"" scene. I could go on.<br/><br/>The best stuff is the stuff that isn't too naughty. To me, and maybe this is just the unrated version, the bathtub scene went on long enough to start to become a bit disturbing and weird. What was the point of that scene going on with her and the shower head? Didn't need to see Carell pee on himself, etc. However, these are minor complaints to a movie that is ribald, yet funny and enjoyable.<br/><br/>I always read reviews where people say ""I laughed every 30 seconds"" and I dismiss those typically as from the kind of people that give ""Porky's Revenge"" 10 stars. But truly, this movie has more laughs in it then any movie I can remember.<br/><br/>Get the kids out of the room, expect the bawdy and the risqué, and have an open mind. This is one funny movie."

","An electronics store employee is forty years old and has never made love to a woman. After his co-workers find out, they vow to find him a woman. This film follows the adventures of Andy, his exploits with loose women, and his quest to end his virginity. But will he make it? Like ""Beerfest"", this film suffers from a plot that is very one-sided. The jokes are fairly repetitive since they all revolve around whether or not Andy has been with a woman yet (which is consistently not so). Some of the jokes stand out (Andy making up a time he was with a woman, the running ""I know you're gay because..."" joke) but many aren't so hot. I think some of the humor relies on being at least vaguely familiar with geeky stuff.<br/><br/>What the film has going for it is its heart. I didn't expect heart, but like ""Click"" there is a positive message under the superficial exterior. My friend says to me, the film has not enough smut. She really likes smut. Well, it's true, the smut was lacking for a film about getting it on. But this might be considered a strong point since the film stressed quality of relationships, something probably important (especially for a man who is 40).<br/><br/>Steve Carell is a funny guy, and I admire his dedication to realism. Allegedly, the chest-waxing scene is all real because Carell didn't want to cheat his audience. Thank you! This scene was one of the better ones. Paul Rudd was also funny, and the other co-stars did a fine job.<br/><br/>A shout-out to the daughter in the film, whom I have also seen in ""London"". I feel she has a bright career ahead of her and will be a household name in five years. (Sadly, her name escapes me now... Kit something.) A decent comedy, and with no Adam Sandler, Vince Vaughn or Will Ferrell, which I think is nice. No disrespect to these gentlemen, but it's time to share the stage with another man...

","Following a couple of supporting roles in Bruce Almighty and Anchorman (not to mention a regular presence on Saturday Night Live), Steve Carell rose to fame playing the lead in The 40 Year Old Virgin. The title might make some believe the movie's gonna be two hours of puerile jokes, but that's far from true: it's actually a really smart and interesting comedy, as well as a showcase of Carell's star power.<br/><br/>His character, Andy Stitzer, leads a pretty dull life: he collects action figures, goes everywhere by bike and has no social life (except for a neighbor with whom he watches Survivor). Then one night he's asked to join his colleagues from the hi-fi store for a poker game. Once the guys start talking about their sex lives, it turns out Andy's a virgin (who else would say a woman's breasts ""feel like a bag full of sand"" ?). Since that's a quite embarrassing condition for a 40-year old, his ""pals"" see it as their duty to make sure Andy finally sleeps with someone. Hence a series of increasingly awkward situations involving drunk teenagers, speed dating and male prostitutes (you know, just in case our man doesn't like the ladies). In the meantime, Andy has managed to find the woman of his dreams: Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who sells things on e-bay. There's an obvious spark between them, with only one blatant problem: how long before Andy will have to tell her the inconvenient truth?<br/><br/>The charm of this film lies in the direction the story takes once the premise is set: what started as a mere search for sex turns into a quest for true love, as the protagonist struggles to get to the end of the story without jeopardizing his relationship with Trish (the chemistry between the two characters is truly moving). Instead of another gross-out comedy, director Judd Apatow (who also co-wrote the script with his leading man) has delivered something a little more profound, with the occasional bits of mandatory slapstick (Andy getting his chest waxed... ouch!). The only real criticism I can raise about The 40 Year Old Virgin concerns its excessive running time: being almost two hours long, it seems like some set-pieces were added just to keep the movie going before it reaches its predictable yet enjoyable conclusion. It is, however, worth watching, both for its absurd but believable concept and the hilarious Carell, who proves to be a genuinely funny guy, with hints of an ability to tackle more mature roles as well (as he did superbly in the splendid Little Miss Sunshine). This film deserves all the praise it has received for putting such a talented comedian on the map.<br/><br/>7,5/10"

","Not a great film, but a sincere and pretty funny one as we follow the trials of a good natured middle-aged geek named Andy (played by Steve Carell) who has yet to have sex with a woman. He's an introverted loner living by himself whose idea of an exciting weekend is making egg salad and painting his toy models. His buddies at the local electronics shop where they all work are a fun group of typical horny male characters, each around ten years younger than Andy, who try everything possible to break their inexperienced friend in, setting him up with women and passing on some of their own personal strategies for dealing with the opposite sex.<br/><br/>Much to this film's credit, it isn't afraid to go over the line with occasional non-PC jokes and ideas in a day and age where everyone is so ultra-sensitive to everything. The cheap toilet humor and sex gags actually work very well amidst all this, aided greatly by a charming performance by Carell in the lead part, who actually makes his character of Andy very likable and almost even manages to make virginity seem cool. It was also refreshing to see an older and more down-to-earth love interest as portrayed by Catherine Keener for a change, instead of the usual ""Beverly Hills 90210"" bimbos we're bombarded with all the time.<br/><br/>The audience I saw this with in the theater loved every minute and were in hysterics, adding to the fun. I've never seen my wife laugh so hard either; she howled so much, she was coughing and lost her breath! It's become a favorite film of hers and she's bought the ""Unrated"" DVD. We watched the extended version with 17 added minutes at home again recently and I recall it being a little better in its shorter theatrical version. But maybe that's just me.

"Jonny_Numb","7","1","2","26 August 2006"," Funniest thing to come out of Hollywood in quite some time...
","""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is an inspired comedy, one that blends blue sexual humor, the perceptions of males and females, and an uncommon tenderness to great cinematic success. But perhaps most impressive is how the title--which seems to promise a sex farce in the ""Porky""'s vein--subverts our expectations; against the image of a beaming, plain-clothed Steve Carell, we receive a farce with its own juvenile tendencies, made hilarious and relatable by a character who is seemingly past his sexual prime. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a character that Hollywood often relegates to quirky supporting roles: introverted, modest guy working in retail, surrounded by friends who are as cocky as they are confident. While I'm not quite 40, ""Virgin"" presents Andy as a character most men would be able to relate to at some point in their sexual lives, and is therefore instantly likable. His reluctant efforts to score with women (persuaded by his co-workers), using different methods to pick them up, all while keeping his intended mate at arm's length, is more than a bit indicative of the oft-insecure methods of men. The script, by Carell and director Judd Apatow, is crude but layered, giving us characters who are shaded with quirks that act as amplifications of typical human behavior (one coworker has an obsessive love/hate relationship with his ex)...and when Andy finally meets his mate, the domestic humor stems from a strong sense of realism. Past the wonderful performances and the 'LOL' comedy present, it is this situational realism that gives ""Virgin"" such an endearing charm."

Life seems to be going fine until he meets his match, Trish, who owns an E-Bay store across the street. So his bodies at Smart-Tech help him over come his problem.<br/><br/>The movie is Awesome!

","When I first saw the trailer for this movie, it did not strike me as something I would rush out and see opening weekend. Since I enjoyed Steve Carell's previous work in Anchorman and Bruce Almighty, I knew eventually I would get around to it. Then it happened. The reviews started coming out saying this was the funniest movie of the year etc. etc and although this will probably drop, the 7.9 rating on this site is quite impressive. Needless to say, mildly interested turned into must see and as every experienced film buff knows, high expectations should be avoided at all costs. But then again, a good movie is impervious to being over-hyped. With that said, I soon found myself in the theater anxiously awaiting the best comedy of the year...or so I thought.<br/><br/>As the title of the movie suggests, Andy Stitzer is a forty year old virgin who is quite comfortable in his situation until his secret is exposed during a card game with coworkers. This sets the all too familiar plot in motion as we have seen in films such as Swingers and Sideways. His buddies are determined to get him laid and are quick to impose their insightful advice like ""Tackle drunk bitches"" or ""Don't put the p*ssy on a pedestal"". And so it goes. During this quest to achieve the impossible, a customer named Trish enters the electronics store where Andy works and of course, becomes the main focus of interest...as in every other film of this nature. Carell and Keener do share a convincing chemistry to keep this aspect buoyant through act 2 but loses momentum during act 3 weighed down by unconvincing drama.<br/><br/>Just as the premise is cliché, so are most of the jokes. Andy's introduction would have been much funnier if we didn't already see the stiffie joke in Anchorman or the angry Pakistanian coworker done in Office Space. There were a few really funny scenes in this movie but not nearly enough to adequately supply the lengthy 2 hour running time with consistent humor. The second half of the movie was like watching a bad sitcom - without the laugh tracks. The enthusiastic audience that was obviously enjoying the movie more than I was even stopped except an occasional chuckle. The Age of Aquarius sequence had me eying the exits and was relieved that it was soon over after that disastrous attempt at comedy.<br/><br/>Overall, I'm on the fence after watching this. This was not a terrible movie, it just wasn't that good or funny and certainly does not live up to the massive amount of praise accumulated from various sources. Had I approached this with no expectations without being exposing myself to the hype, I may have enjoyed it more. However, doing a little research on a film before seeing it has proved to be much more effective method than selecting something based solely on trailers...It's just not a perfect science."
"oneloveall","7","1","2","19 May 2006"," Turns vulgarity into sincerity
","Humorously enlightened work from perceptive scribe Apatow, guided by the current master of comedic subtleties, Steve Carell. The lead displays such a knack for inner monologue, albeit it in an overtly comedic way, that he will literally take you to that freshman year place of discomfort that applies to the Andy in all of us. People who are simply too cool, or cold, to know Andy's plight have 3 or 4 excellently fleshed out supporting characters to relate to, ranging the gamut from pot head writer, to playa wannabe- letting everyone, at least every American male, feel engaged dealing with the movie's situations. This movie somehow manages to have the dirtiness of an adult American pie, yet somehow elevates this material to heartfelt sincerity, no small feet indeed. At times the improv heavy scenes could be trimmed a little, especially on the unrated extended version, but if anyone knows how to kill awkward space with even more awkwardness it is Mr Carell."
"LoneWolfAndCub","7","1","2","24 February 2006"," Funny, but WAY too long!!
","The 40 Year Old Virgin is one of the funniest movies of 2005. It is not afraid to actually have some crude, sex humour. This movie also shows that Steve Carell is going to go far. The writing, acting and directing is very, very good for a comedy.<br/><br/>Well, the plot isn't too hard to follow (see title). It is about Andy, a 40 year old virgin. He tells some of his work mates about this, and they make it their duty to get him laid as soon as possible. Along this journey, we encounter some very funny people and situations.<br/><br/>From what I see, The 40 Year Old Virgin is targeted at younger audiences. I found this hilarious, my mum on the other hand, hated it. It has plenty of sex jokes/humour, tons of language and many scenes of brief nudity. There is an Indian who loves to swear, a joke about a horse and a woman and plenty of scenes that will make you squirm with embarrassment.<br/><br/>The one major quarrel I have with this movie is that it is WAY too long. The uncut version, running over 2 hours, is just too long for a movie like this. There are plenty of scenes that could have been trimmed to keep this at around the 100 minute mark. Aside from that, I have no other problems with this superb comedy.<br/><br/>3½/5"
"dromasca","8","1","2","24 February 2006"," A good feeling comedy that is actually funny
","Judd Apatow is at his first big screen movie, and he hits it right. 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was an unexpected success on screens last year and it deserves it. The story of an aging geek who spends a mediocre sex-less life who is pulled by his work fellows into manhood and finds real love on the way could have fallen easily either in vulgarity, or in sweet and false romantics, or worse into boredom. 'Virgin' falls in none of these traps, it plays right most of the time by building a credible action, being sexy without becoming gross, and filling the time with a lot of memorable situations and one-liners. The two principal actors Steve Carell and Catherine Keener are not too famous either, but they succeed better than most of the first rang comedy stars in Hollywood lately to build a couple that has chemistry and makes us care about. The last 15 minutes of the film are maybe too expected, like the script suddenly ran completely out of ideas and borrowed from another thousand of Hollywood comedies, but the final musical like singing brings back the smiles viewers will end with watching this movie."
"triple8","9","1","2","12 February 2006"," a comedy with a heart
","SPOILERS THROUGH:<br/><br/>To bad there's no Oscar for best comedy of the year. I have heard critical raves about 40 year old Virgin and the movie didn't disappoint. Not only is it hilarious, but there's a sweetness to the characters and the story which is unusual for a comedy of this type. Yet it somehow also avoids the ""cheesy factor.""<br/><br/>I personally think Steve Carroll is one of the funniest actors I've ever seen and he's got genuine acting talent as well so he makes this movie work. The supporting cast are great, particularly Catherine Keener who takes on a tough role as the love interest but doesn't fall into the trap of being just the object of desire of the lead actor. Keener plays an individual rather then a cliché and she is a breath of fresh air. All the performers in this movie are excellent in playing characters that have individual personalities rather then being just props for the storyline. Everyone is memorable.<br/><br/>The humor in this movie is obnoxious, crude and rather disgusting at times and is not at all the type of humor that I myself usually like but for some reason it works here. In fact everything works here. The thing that sets 40 year old virgin apart is that it's both constantly comedic and touching without being schmaltzy. It's a comedy with a heart and the movie keeps you laughing but also has a depth that is unusual for a comedy of this nature. At any rate, the movie worked for me and I really enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The end I must mention as well as it was really well done and unique. The 40 year old Virgin is a great movie to see when you just want to laugh and have a good time watching a constantly funny, original movie that also reaches out and touches in a way one might not expect. Comedies if they are really well done deserve nine's and ten's sometimes and my rating of this movie is 9 out of 10."
"russem31","8","1","2","9 February 2006"," Hilairous
","THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN is an incredible funny film, mostly because of the lead character, Steve Carrell (Andy), who also co-wrote. He is VERY believable as a 40 year old virgin who REALLY wants to get some but can't bring himself to do so (because of horrible sexual experiences in his past - which are shown nicely in flashbacks). While the story is somewhat predictable - I knew he would end up with Catherine Keener (Trish) right off the bat when she walked into the electronics store and gave her number to Andy. It was obvious that Andy would take his own advice to wait until he got to know Trish and not the advice of his friends who urged him to have sex first and talk later. The supporting characters were also pretty spot-on, with the most hilarious moments stolen by his manager, Paula (played by Jane Lynch) when she tries to hint to Andy that they could be friends ""with benefits"". This is a great film but isn't for children (especially the Unrated version). Regardless, for adults, a definite recommendation - a strong 8 out of 10."

The characters were all funny especially Paul Rudd and Seth Rogen and even the smallest role characters had great lines that made the movie hysterical. I couldn't help but notice that this was an original but an odd film in many reasons. I watched the unrated version and couldn't notice of how long it was. 2 hours and 13 minutes is pretty long for a comedy!

","I did not expect to like this movie. Let's face it; it looks stupid. I must say that I enjoyed it. I thought the story was very sweet about a man who is well, a 40 year old virgin. Of course he's very innocent and kind and unspoiled. He meets the woman of his dreams but is terrified of the moment of reckoning. Doesn't want to lose her because of his big secret. The guys in the store where he works try to coach him and tell him it's best to get some practice on some other women he doesn't care about so that he'll be ready. There were some great ""guy lines"" and some very funny scenes when the guys go back and forth telling each other ""why they must be gay"".

"tjcclarke","7","1","2","18 January 2006"," Sex Comedy That Keeps Its Trousers On
","I would cautiously venture that not many men who have made it into their fifth decade without doing the deed get the opportunity to break their duck with nymphomaniac, hard-bodied, blonde book-shop assistants, busty, wardrobe-malfunctioning speed-daters or, for that matter, Catherine Keener. But the fact that these are the potential partners put in front of our hero here, reminds us that 40-Year-Old Virgin is, first and foremost, a bawdy sex comedy, despite the critical acclaim and hints of depth.<br/><br/>And our hero's name is Andy. He's polite, clean-cut and conscientious, rides around on a bike and collects action figures, but his workmates at the computer store think he could well be a serial killer. One night, during an illicit game of poker on the shop floor, the testosterone is flowing and Andy's swiftly concocted sex tales are less than convincing. His new buddies twig that he's a virgin and decide to help him rectify the situation.<br/><br/>Quickly, the crux is established: For all their bravado posturing, Andy's colleagues are considerably less fulfilled than he is. Wise-cracking Jay (Romany Malco) may act the player, but he is hen-pecked and insecure; David (Paul Rudd) is still pining over a lost love from the distant past; and wild man Cal (Seth Rogen) lurches from day to day in booze-fuelled, over-sexed stupor (OK, so his life may be more fulfilling) <br/><br/>Despite some false starts with an array of unsuitable though aesthetically pleasing women (this IS a sex comedy, if you remember), Andy eventually finds the perfect partner in ""hot grandmother"" Trish (Keener). Now if only he can get his rocks off <br/><br/>And here's the clever bit. Andy is a grown man. A little repressed, certainly, but he still has the world-weariness of someone who has experienced many of life's petty annoyances. It would have been easier comedically to make him some kind of desperate oaf  a constantly horny dog who humps legs and chases schoolgirls down the street. But if you get to 40 and have never done it, it is likely that you simply aren't that fussed. Steve Carrell plays Andy perfectly with a child-like quality but no sinister perversions.<br/><br/>This can be seen in the very first scene, where he goes about his morning business with a persistent erection. It's a nice parody of Porky's  only here there is no furtive self-gratification, it is just part of the routine. For a puerile concept, this is a film that actually explores sexuality. A bit. Obviously, it loses its nerve on occasion as Carrell lapses into Saturday Night Live mode, but the intentions are good.<br/><br/>Take the time-honoured masturbation scene. Instead of the standard montage of sensitive guy exposed to a barrel-load of smut, mistakes lube for super glue hilarity, Andy can't get into it and ends up chortling contentedly to an innocent episode of Everybody Loves Raymond.<br/><br/>Indeed, these offbeat endings to such telegraphed set-ups are what give the film an edge over traditional preppy skin flicks. The beauty (if that is the right word) of the American Pie franchise, Wedding Crashers et al is that we can see the pay-off (apple pie defilement etc) coming a mile away. Here Carrell's Andy is ambiguous enough to surprise us with the way he handles certain lewdly choreographed scenarios.<br/><br/>It's not all high praise. For starters it is absurdly long for a film of this nature. Some of the scenes in the middle don't go anywhere, and while this adds to the quirky, unpredictable feel, the actual ending (when it finally arrives) is oddly uninspiring. Perhaps this is supposed to represent the inevitable anticlimax of your first sexual experience, which would be an extremely bold cinematic statement, but probably not that bright. Anyway, there follows a bizarre musical post-script that has been cunningly cribbed from every Farrelly brothers movie ever made, and by that stage I was fuming as I had missed most of Match of the Day  so anyone expecting a higher rating can blame it on that.<br/><br/>7/10"
"tnrcooper","10","1","2","16 January 2006"," Generous, funny film
","This is one of the funnier films to come out of Hollywood since perhaps Being John Malkovich. Steve Carell as Andy Stitzer plays a fairly normal but shy and reticent about getting involved with women after being rejected as a youngster. Still, he is not, as I mentioned, particularly unusual unless you think that riding a bicycle in Los Angeles and collecting toys is particularly unusual. However he gets along well with other people and has perhaps even a plausible apartment in Hollywood given how he pays nothing on a car. He has a decent job but seems quite happy in his life. This is one difference between this and other films about someone trying to connect with someone, ore even make sexual conquests (American Pie, Porky's etc.). He doesn't seem like he ___needs___ this contact, but after a couple of hilarious missteps (a terrifying ride with a drunk and extremely needy woman (Leslie Mann) as well as a flirtation with a wild bookstore clerk (Elizabeth Banks)) he finally connects with a woman who has a business across the road from the entertainment superstore where he works, the Best Buy-Smart Tech (the immensely talented Catherine Keener). The film plot in itself is quite pedestrian, but as so often is the case, the devil is in the details, and the film is plotted out quite carefully and with many colorful supporting characters. Foul-mouthed Mooj (Gerry Bednob), thoughtful Jay (Romany Malco), smooth and just maybe obsessed David (Paul Rudd), stoner Cal (Seth Rogen), and sexually frustrated store manager (Jane Lynch) are not cruel to Andy when his secret is discovered. However, his unease is certainly lampooned and he is not immune from the gentle barbs and good- natured ribbing of his co-workers. However, it is always just that-good-natured. In the tradition of American Pie and Animal House, debauchery without malice makes this film lovable and also very funny. The writing is very funny and there are sequences such as Jay's face off with another black man, David and Cal's claims as to why the other is gay, and Andy taking Cal's advice on simply asking women questions. There are some very funny scenes in the film and it is very, very, very funny."

When Andy meets a beautiful woman who is divorced and has kids, he falls in love, and finds it hard to keep his virginity a secret.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is a funny guy, you have probably noticed him in many comedic films as the asshole, Bruce Almighty, the creepy guy, Achorman, and loser, Sleepover. In virgin he wrote the material, so he knows how to play the character perfectly. With it's R rating, Carell and co were able to let anything fly in terms of their sexual innuendos.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow has his directorial debut with Virgin, his previous work including off beat comedy Undeclared and Freaks and Geeks. When the director and actor both write the film and both get what is funny about it, it makes it a lot easier to connect to the audience. It is a raunchy movie. The sex jokes are everywhere, the swearing is everywhere. But it all fits in this movie. Carell is so innocent in the movie, so seeing him curse so much is odd in a funny way. Catherine Keener looks and performance good in this film, but it's Carell's friends that are funny.<br/><br/>The film has many comedic highlights, unlike other comedy films that may contain only one or two. Birgin manages to keep the laughs coming and each time they do, they get longer and louder. Carell wax chest scene had me in tears and the fact that everyone knows that it was real made it even funnier. Seeing the reactions from the actors in the room was priceless and Carells ""cursing"" was hilarious. Another highlight was Carell trying to put on the condoms. He has trouble of course cause he has never had sex. So when the condom snaps and hits him in the penis you can't help but laugh. To add icing to the cake the kids enter and see the ""used"" condoms on the bed and ask how many times they did it. The ending song credits is one of the funniest moments, if you know where the joke is.<br/><br/>Virgin is indeed the funniest movie of 2005. It is hilarious and has a good message about abstinence. The only downfall of the film would be it's running time, it goes over 2 hours and they could have easily cut some of the material out. During the film I had mixed emotions about the length, at first I did not want it to end, then I was thinking to myself, this is a long movie. <br/><br/>Carell's talent in other films and the office were not really noticed. Now that he has a successful film under his belt, his previous work will be acknowledge and his future projects will be plenty. I'm for one glad to see new faces in comedy rising and hopefully others will be fading, Sandler and Stiller.<br/><br/>In the end, Virgin is the laugh out loud comedy of the year and you should definitely check it out if not for the laughs, then for the message."

The film is packed with side-splitting gags that are of the ""sexual comical healing"" material. The masturbating ""hello"", condom for dummy virgins, and most notably the chest hair waxing scenes will be the ""hair apparent"" supreme comical scenes of the year. Carell's subtle but yet magnetic performance should break him in as one of the superb comical actors of our present time. The great Keener always contributes excellent keen thespian awareness to her roles and here is no different as Trish. Rudd also contributes an amusing performance as the heartbroken porno-enthusiast David. Rudd was ""porn to be alive"" to play that supporting role. Director Judd Apatow does have a juicy raunchy appetite for comedy and shows that Judd is no comedic directorial dud. However, his only misfire was to elongate ""The 40 Year Old Virgin's"" running time 30 minutes over its satisfactory climax level.

","Right from the moment you spot the poster for this film, you know it's going to be funny. The unspoiled bright-eyed photo of Steve Carell says it all: this is the kind of movie that he was born to star in.<br/><br/>If you can accept that the character of Andy Stitzer exists, the events that transpire throughout the course of the movie are at least believable if not seemingly honest. Andy's actions are understandably naïve but not so over the top absurd that you can no longer sympathize with his character. This grounding in reality gives the film a day-in-the-life feel that might be unexpected given the sophomoric overtones of the title.<br/><br/>Overall, the character development makes the film. The relationship dynamics between Andy and the other characters maximizes the impact of the story and, more importantly, the jokes. This movie operates on all cylinders, delivering humor on many levels beyond the straight up bawdy sexual humor that's naturally expected.<br/><br/>There are a few significant lapses in reality, most notably when a love interest is inexplicably sparked, and when the usually bumbling Andy suddenly begins spouting sarcasm. These lapses can be easily forgiven given the fact that they would have likely gone unnoticed in a lesser comedy, and, in the case of the latter, add to the overall entertainment value of the film.<br/><br/>This film isn't everything to everyone, but it is funny. Really funny. Also, make sure you watch till the end."

","This movie is nothing more than a comedy. A very good one that is. This is a nice down to earth comedy about sex, or lack thereof.<br/><br/>This is a well written movie. The characters are great. They're charming and believable. You really feel for the poor guy. The dialog is good. There are punch-lines, but it's not the kind of movie where all the characters always say the right thing at the right time, bombarding each other with punch-lines. That's what makes this movie so down to earth and charming. It's also what makes you relate to the character. Never the less, they've still managed to make a good dialog and make it funny. The rest of the story is also funny. Maybe because it's rather simple. You don't need to think or pay very close attention to know what's going on. There's just the storyline with the main character and no other sub-plots. The other characters supports the lead in a good way and it's they who really makes the film move forward. All together this is a funny and well written story.<br/><br/>The actors really got the hang of this. Steve Carell is great in the lead as Andy Stitzer. His performance is down to earth and believable. He really got that little boyish and geeky look and behavior. As for the rest of the cast they do a great job in supporting him. They portrays their characters good and gives a truly good performance.<br/><br/>There is not much to say about the cinematography. It's good, but not fantastic. There's nothing special about it, it's just plain and good. It works well. The sets and decorations are nice. There are nothing special about them neither, but they look good. The costumes are also nice. They forms and gives an impression of the characters at once and work very good.<br/><br/>Lyle Workman scored this movie nicely. It's a score it's there, but nothing more. It builds the mood and does a good job as a score, but there are no special about it. The use of non-original music, however, is really good. It helps to give you an impression of the characters and get to know them easy and quick. It's very effective.<br/><br/>If you're looking for a good comedy that'll make you laugh and have a good time, then this is it. It's a great and hilarious comedy with good story, directing and cast that you'll definitely find entertaining."

","Just by the title you know the story. Andy works at a tech store and when he plays a night of poker with his work mates, they find out he's a virgin. To his friends they think this is some huge disorder and set out to rectify this problem. They set him up with girls, but Andy has his eyes on Trish. After a few dates they make a deal that they wont have sex for twenty dates; this just suits Andy but just halters the ending result.<br/><br/>This was quite a good comedy. Steve Carell can hold your attention and shows us a wider range of acting than what we saw in Anchor Man. He has quite good chemistry with Catherine Keener, who is a grandmother here, you don't see that in many movies where the protagonist is dating a grandmother. All the back characters David, Jay and Cal add another dimension to the story, adding abit of depth.<br/><br/>Though what i found disappointing is it wasn't as funny as i was hoping it to be. Not being a fan of Anchor Man, i thought i would be another rehash of that, but 40YOV is a lot funnier, as you can connect with the characters here. But there are still great laughs, that waxing scene was killer to watch. I don't know how they got that in one take. The directing was really simple as well. The camera sits in one position most of the time, so we're stuck at one angle, and we don't see anything else. Sometimes the attention thats made in the background can enhance the movie, which could have raise this movie even higher.<br/><br/>40YOV does also have a Wedding Crashers format. It started off really awkward, then it really sent in the punches, the laughs kept coming, but then it went really sentimental; really dipping into the clichés and handing out a predictable ending. But the strength of the middle of this movie does pick up a lot of the slack of the start and end, still making this a real enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>A well spent two hours."
"MOscarbradley","7","1","2","25 September 2005"," A Cut Above
","A winning mixture of middle-aged, sentimental rom-com and gross-out frat comedy, this may be one of the year's most pleasant surprises. It's as if the boys from ""Animal House"" never grew up. Women are minefields to be picked through or simply nose-dived and are more mature and sexually aware. The 40 year old virgin of the title is Steve Carell, (the David Brent character in the American version of ""The Office""), who still harbours notions of romantic love while his workmates deride him for 'putting the pussy on a pedestal'. He finds it in the form of the delectable Catherine Keener, (the sexiest grandmother in the movies), and is more than happy when she suggests they don't consummate their relationship, at least not straight away.<br/><br/>Decidedly non-pc for most of it's length and often very funny in a scatological hit-and-miss sort of way, this marks the emergence of two new comic talents; Judd Apatow and Steve Carell, who co-wrote the film with Apatow directing and Carell taking the lead. Not quite in the same class as ""Sideways"", (same school of hard knocks), but a cut above most of what passes as American comedy these days."
"bobbyfletch85","8","1","2","22 September 2005"," Flawless Carell!
","This is a decent comedy picture. Steve Carell performed flawlessly, handling comedy, romance and serious acting with ease - this guy is seriously talented and he's done a fantastic job. I expected the plot to be one dimensional, focused on only getting Andy (Carell) to lose his virginity but there were some decent sub-plots and his character's journey was engaging and flush with original comedy moments.<br/><br/>This to me was a very different American comedy, laughing close to the bone; Andy's loneliness, self-alienation as well as some tough jokes about Al-Queda and Indian-Asians. Plently of inter-textuality; name dropping recent events, pop news and perhaps too many similies to American celebrity's meant a lot of jokes were wasted on an English audience.<br/><br/>A strong supporting cast did well especially Seth Rogen who is sure for bright things, he played his role quietly and had some excellent delivery. But a word on Paul Rudd who played the ex-girlfriend pining David. His story was boring and tedious, his whinging about his ex-girlfriend was empty and his performance in the film was woeful. Timing way off and improvisations weak. Inevitably the weakest parts of the film were Rudd's scenes. I felt actor Paul Rudd had requested more lines and story-emphasis such was amount of weak lines and go-nowhere dialogue he spouted.<br/><br/>40 year old virgin is a strong comedy, the script isn't dynamite but Steve Carell makes weak gags strong with a mockery style tone, he really did an incredible job and he's a name i want to see more of. I feel with out Carell this film wouldn't be nearly as funny, he makes laughs at minutes, turning the bad jokes upside down.<br/><br/>Fans of the Office and Arrested Development will particularly enjoy this film."

","I actually did laugh out loud a couple of times when I went to see this in the cinema, which can be pretty rare for me. The title's pretty self explanatory so no need for any plot summaries but suffice to say, you'll get almost what you expect. For me this movie was a bit over hyped. I can see that the score for this movie is coming down a bit recently from where it was and due to the timing, can only suspect that this has a little to do with US humour vs. rest of the world humour. Also, it must be noted that leading man Carrell is the main character in the US version of ""The Office"" which may (or may not) be lending extra weight to his role here and indeed be contributing to jokes which non-US viewers may not get. The movie, as I say, has its funny moments but these tend to be toward the start rather than nearer the end. Like most comedies, it loses its bite half way through and ends up concentrating more on the emotions and relationships rather than purely on the laughs. I found the ending to this to be especially weak and failed to see the relevance of the ""musical element"", unless the makers were trying to be kooky, which never really works when one tries too hard. Not bad but, due to being about 10-15 minutes overlong because of the repetition of some jokes, not as great as I'd hoped."

","This film isn't going to win awards for originality - for all intents and purposes it's American Pie but it simply transposes the role of Jim and co onto a group of people more than twice their age. The film isn't the funniest that you'll see and at times it IS essentially a teen comedy but it manages to steer clear of more of the lowest common denominator which blights that genre.<br/><br/>In many respects, this has taken the awkward humour from that but aged it up and taken the pointless schmaltz and replaced it with a more realistic and less saccharine romance.<br/><br/>This film is rather gently paced, you won't be reeling from continuous never ending jokes but there is a gentle and pervasive character humour here that is what makes the film more interesting than most. While the ending is pretty obvious from the start, you still will our hero and his friends to it.<br/><br/>All in all, this film despite it's somewhat limited nature, manages to be amusing and at times quite endearing.

","My husband and I laughed throughout the whole movie! The whole theater was cracking up. Very funny! There was a lot of humor that came pretty quickly, and teens and young adults may not even get some of it. The choice of music was funny, too. I loved it that he had an Asia poster and then later they played an Asia song. We are both around 40, so we related with a lot of the humor. I have always been a big fan of Carolyn Keener, and it was fun to see her in a light role. It's not going to win any Oscars, but it was a really fun night out.

All I can say is I'm glad I did. I notice that the bulk of the reviews on the first page of this site concentrate on the leading character and his three male buddies and whilst they were all more than competent/amusing for me the best thing about it was the warmth, not to say gorgeousness, of Catherine Keener who I've seen only in The Interpreter. If you ARE a virgin at 40 - or 14 for that matter -then I can think of no one better than Keener to initiate you into the the pleasures of sexual love.

","The new Steve Carrell (actually the first Steve Carrell) film, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' was a movie I didn't have very high hopes for. Seeing the movie trailer for it both in the theater and on television, it didn't seem like it would be that funny. I liked the premise, but none of the scenes they showed during the commercials seemed to win me over. When I finally got around to seeing at, after hearing extremely positive buzz, all my reservations about it were put to rest. 'The 40 Year-Old Virgin' wasn't just a funny film, it was an absolutely hysterical one.<br/><br/>The movie centers around a guy who has the be the largest geek in the world. He is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carrell), a forty-year old living in a small crummy apartment who works at an electronics store and whose hobbies include watching 'Survivor' with his elderly neighbor and collecting action figures. One day the guys Andy works with -- David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen), invite Andy to a poker game to get to know him and find out he is still a virgin! The three make a pact that they will do everything in their power to try to get Andy laid. The movie from there is all about these three guys trying to get Andy to sleep with different s including a drunk, a psychopath, a and a tom-boy named Gina (a bit-part played hilariously by MADTV's Mo Collins). While all of this madness is going on, Andy falls in love with a divorcée who owns a 'Sell it on Ebay' shop played by Catherine Keener (Being John Malkovich, Full Frontal). <br/><br/>When all is said and done, 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' will have you laughing hysterically through it's entire runtime. Steve Carrell proves himself to maybe be the next Will Ferrell with his performance as the weird loner Andy Stitzer, a performance that is pure comedic genius. Seth Rogen is constantly witty, Romany Malco never ceases to be hilarious, Paul Rudd is solid, and Catherine Keener is perfectly cast as Andy Stitzer's soul mate. The writing is very good for the most part (except for a kind of disappointing first five minutes, in which surprisingly I didn't laugh at all.) All in all, 'The 40 Year Old Virigin' is a good comedy, but nothing Oscar-worthy. It's raunchy, crazy and drop-dead hilarious, but not quite as much as 'Wedding Crashers'. If you are looking for a silly flick, that isn't great but will have you laughing until you either wet yourself or fall out of your chair, spend the time and money seeing 'The 40 Year Old Virgin'. Grade: B (screened at AMC Deer Valley 30, Phoenix, Arizona, 8/19/05)<br/><br/>my ratings guide - A+ (absolutley flawless); A (a masterpiece, near-perfect); A- (excellent); B+ (great); B (very good); B- (good); C+ (a mixed bag); C (average); C- (disappointing); D+ (bad); D (very bad); D- (absolutley horrendous); F (not one redeeming quality in this hunk of Hollywood feces)."

","You can't help but think that this movie is somehow going to fail. Once it starts, you hope you are wrong. Thanks to the fertility gods this movie was hilarious. There is something very special about Steve Carell. His subtle approach makes practically everything he does or say worth paying attention to. Even the scene where he (this harmless, naive 40 year old going through his first childhood still) verbally abuses an innocent woman is hilarious even though all the while you can still feel sorry for the poor lady. But heck, even she is laughing. They must have forgot to tell her to act. The only bad part is not worth mentioning except I don't want to leave the impression this movie is perfect. It is too long by about 20 to 30 minutes because it does have that slow part in the middle and towards the end that just about all comedies have for some reason. All in all, this is as perfect as any comedy can get. I feel if Wedding Crashers had made the Vince Vaughn part for Owen Wilson and given Wilson's part to Steve Carell, I would even have enjoyed it."

","Against my better judgement, I decided to watch this flick with hopes that it would be a comedy worth a few laughs. It ended up being a vulgar, ridiculous piece of trash. The language went way over the top with no real reason to do so. The comedy end was something that a bunch of high schoolers could have put together trying to get some shock value from their friends. I certainly expected some sexual humor and innuendos but this bordered on a poorly written porn film without as much flesh. I can't even imagine what they had to cut out so that they could save this sorry excuse for a move from getting an NC-17 rating.<br/><br/>This abomination makes me really wonder about movie goers these days. I usually trust the IMDb ratings but cannot even imagine how anyone could give this junk a rating higher than a five let alone a seven. If only there were as many laughs in the film as there were vulgar outbursts, it would have truly been funny.<br/><br/>Even with the fast forwards, it was a huge waste of my time!"

Maybe it's something in the packaging of those action figures. Hey, Star Wars geeks, the packaging is bad for you!<br/><br/>Yes, I know, I am probably the last person in America that has seen The 40 Year Old Virgin. I am not a Steve Carell fan. Dude, you don't watch The Office? No, I don't; there was always something better on. Let's just put our cards on the table, I don't watch Arrested Development, either, so there. Although, I don't know what that has to do with it. I just felt like getting it off my chest. I did like Carell as Uncle Authur in Bewitched, which I only watched because I am a Nicole Kidman fan. But, that's it. Nothing else. Sorry.<br/><br/>Neither have I seen Paul Rudd in anything but Friends, and was a virgin on all the other characters, with the exception of Catherine Keener, whom I've seen in The Interpreter, S1m0ne, and Out of Sight, and who I hope to see soon in The Ballad of Jack and Rose, which I immediately ordered, and Capote, when it gets to the hinterlands. She is definitely a fine actress that deserves all the awards and nominations coming her way.<br/><br/>Having said all that, I thought the film was great and I really like Carell's performance.

He's a virgin too (obviously...he doesn't have a Penis) and hangs out with this guy named Alan, who is a womanizer. He eventually finds a doctor who specializes in penis reattachment, but has to find a penis donor before he can be normal. Things get really strange at this point. The performances are incredible in this film and the writing is incredibly witty...much wittier than The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin. And yes, it's raunchy, but it's also extremely sweet (very much like The Forty-Year-Old-Virgin) but the ending is much darker and ambiguous. I've never seen anything like it. Hopefully audiences will discover Ding-a-ling-LESS and appreciate how brave and original and ahead of it's time it actually is. It was called Re-Membering Jack at one point but the title was changed to Ding-a-ling-LESS when it was released on DVD.

","The first time we see Steve Carell (who plays ""Andy,"" the 40-year-old virgin with a vast collection of action figures) on camera, he's waking up with morning wood. Yes, it's vulgar at times (like the story about the lady having sex with the horse in Tijuana), but it's highly intelligent and perceptive vulgarity. When his co-workers learn about his virginity (the dead give-away was when he compares women's breast to ""bags of sand""), they make it their mission to get him laid, and the joke never gets old! Andy's masturbation scene is priceless. He lights candles, gets into silk pajamas, and plays Lionel Ritchie's classic, ""Hello."" But the reason I truly love this film is because it really is a beautiful love story about a guy who had lost all hope at ever finding love, but then finally meets his soul mate. It's not a movie about loosing one's virginity  it's a story about falling in love for the first time even if it takes 40 years."

","VIRGIN tells the tale of an aging and lonely electronics store wage slave who is good at collecting things but has difficulty relating to people, especially women. His store pals, who seem to have materialized out of an old MARRIED WITH CHILDREN episode, decide to do something about his condition and take him in hand, literally and figuratively. The first half of the movie is a raunchy, American PIE-type comedy. The second half, about the guy's romancing of a middle-aged divorcée complete with kids, is a sweet take on adult relationships. The ending, a very funny sendup of the movie HAIR, completes the no-longer lonely guy's journey in a truly bizarre manner. Steve Carrell, a character actor last seen in ANCHORMAN, is the aging virgin and plays the role as if he were channeling Ben Stiller in MEET THE PARENTS. Several other ANCHORMAN performers are on hand for the fun and merriment, most notably Paul Rudd as Carrell's lovelorn best buddy. That DEATH TO SMOOCHY gal, Catherine Keener, plays Carrell's love interest. Highly recommended, but only if you're an adult. This could easily have been an NC-17, and the extended and deleted scenes on the DVD prove it."
"Desertman84","10","1","3","13 September 2012"," A Sex Comedy Classic
","The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a comedy about a middle-aged man's journey to finally have sex. The film was written and directed by Judd Apatow and co-written by its lead star, Steve Carell, though the film itself features a great deal of improvised dialogue.It also stars Paul Rudd,Seth Rogen,Catherine Keener and Romany Malco.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer (Carell) is a cheerfully geeky guy who is settling into middle age with his large collection of comic books, action figures, and collectible models. Andy works in an electronics store, and seems reasonably happy with his life. However, one day his friends and co- workers David (Rudd), Jay (Malco), and Cal (Rogen) discover that Andy has a secret -- due to his rather severe jitters around women, Andy is still a virgin. Andy's pals are appalled at this state of affairs, and set out to find a woman who'd be willing to get horizontal with him. After a number of disastrous dates, everyone thinks Andy has finally struck gold when he meets Trish (Keener), an attractive single mother who takes an immediate liking to him. What the other guys don't know is that Trish has just gotten out of a bad relationship, and has informed Andy she isn't ready to be intimate with him just yet.<br/><br/>Although The 40 Year Old Virgin could be categorized as a sex comedy,it is a romantic drama film as well that the audience could empathize with the main character,Andy.The movie is insightful in the sense that we get to know what's keeping him from losing his virginity and at the same time realize what development and maturity he needs to undergo in order to overcome that.And also,there is his romantic interest in Trish,who the viewer expects to help Andy lose his virginity.But instead of turning into dirty and crude humor,the movie instead focuses on love and middle-age romantic relationship between the two of them.What's also great about the movie is that it is far from offensive.That is one big achievement that the writers have achieved in this film.<br/><br/>The performances of the film are spectacular especially Steve Carrell and Catherine Keener.Both have an undeniable chemistry on screen.Also,they make us care for their characters.Carrell is also on top of his game as a comedic actor.<br/><br/>Overall,here is one sex comedy that could probably be classified as one of the ever best released.Or better yet,a classic that adult audience will surely enjoy."
"secondtake","5","1","3","15 June 2010"," I get why people might love it--but funny isn't always that funny. Oy.
","The 40-Year-Old Virgin (2005)<br/><br/>Director Judd Apatow has his finger on the stupid side of American culture and can make you really laugh about it. But at the same time, you might groan and wish you could escape. I know I did. It's a taste thing, partly (each to their own) and an age thing, too. The humor really is aimed at people in their 20s (or younger), working out relationships (and sex) in an adolescent, bathroom humor way. Getting drunk is cool, and having sex is pure sport, at best.<br/><br/>Of course, the main character, Andy (Steve Carell), doesn't do either one, which is part of the humor. The plot has a long arc, taking us from the realization (from the title) that Andy is forty and still a virgin, to a bunch of guys (very male guys) trying to get him to have sex in various ways, to Andy finding a real relationship (this is laid out in the very beginning, too). There are no real surprises here. Even the connection between Andy's toy collection and ebay is visible after a few scenes.<br/><br/>What makes (or breaks) the movie is the series of funny situations and jokes (clever, stupid, and gross in turns). Different people laugh at different jokes, and a few are going to be funny for almost anyone, if you last that long. It's a smart film, for sure, just with dumbed down jokes. Carell is terrific, and a sympathetic character, and the actors around him are convincingly post-pubescent men, good actors all around. This might be enough if the humor is your speed. And Catherine Keener is really natural, a joy on the screen, and an obvious contrast to the goofy antics of the rest (all the rest, men and women both).<br/><br/>As a ""movie""--which for me is partly about how it sucks you in and makes you feel things, how it is shown visually, how it is interwoven from front to back, how it leaves you feeling the next day--it's very very routine. Apatow comes out of television sit-coms and this feels like an overblown and expensive sit-com. Which means it's slick and funny, but not too slick and not too funny. Depending."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","8","1","3","19 June 2008"," R-rated comedy keeps getting dirtier...and it works
","When this film first came out, I was in total shock that there could be a major film released called ""The 40-Year-Old Virgin."" It seemed so explicit--a film entirely centered around getting laid? Yes, America, we've come and gone this far, and you know what? It's entertaining, hysterical and even good-natured and sweet.<br/><br/>Steve Carrell is the 40-year-old virgin, a tech merchandise salesman named Andy Stitzer whose only life concerns are his job and his action figure collection. He lives by himself, he rides a bike and yes, he's never had sex before. So when his tech store co-workers--who've been laid but still have plenty of other issues--find out, they try and set him up for success, offering him a myriad of advice, most of which is terrible. Andy is reluctant to try, but when he meats Trish (Catherine Keener), that starts to change.<br/><br/>Carrell really gets you to laugh in this film, but mostly because you pity his sorry existence. The dynamic between him and his funnier co-stars really works well here. Cal (Seth Rogen) is a weird, overly blunt friend, Jay (Romany Malco) is the married one who's a player a heart and has some aggressive advice and David (Paul Rudd) is the sap who always talks about true love. The scenes of this film mostly result from the terrible advice these hilarious guys give him and often times the weird girls he picks up as a result. Because these guys have bad advice, the language in this film is graphic and some of the scenes are too. If you prefer to keep sex talk to the bedroom, this film will have you uncomfortable 75% of the time.<br/><br/>This film is good because you feel bad while simultaneously laughing at Andy. Comedy and empathy are two good things for a protagonist to provide. His misadventures trying to get laid and working out a real relationship with Trish is just really well done by the film's creator, Judd Apatow. Keener is also a great choice for Trish. She brings the film down to earth much like Rachel McAdams does in ""Wedding Crashers."" She's a very believable single middle-aged mom. It's a wonder how this film can be so dirty while simultaneous meaningful and Keener's performance helps make that happen. This was the kind of film she needed for people to notice her talents and recognize her in other work.<br/><br/>Though as much as I say this film is sweet, there is no question that this is a dirty comedy first and foremost with some stupid stuff in it no doubt. It's a good date movie if your date can take the R-rated humor, but not just any R-rated humor, generally private R-rated humor. This film is most memorable for the antics--the rest is there to keep it from ever seeming too out of control."

","In today's society being a virgin may sound uncommon, especially being a 40-year-old man. Let's face the facts sex sells in American culture, sex is in music, television and as The 40-Year-Old Virgin demonstrates sex sells in movies as well. For Steve Carell's character Andy Stitzer it is easy being a virgin until three of his sex loving co-workers found out he is a virgin and thrust sex into his life. Can Andy wait, even when he finds a woman Catherine Keener's (Trish), that he loves and cannot resist? The 40-Year-Old virgin shows us that sex is not only just for fun, but instead it is love that we should be a looking for as it is what truly matters. Throughout the movie Andy argues with his co-workers on why it is not so bad to be a virgin. Andy's co-workers led by Seth Rogan's character, Cal, want him not to be the geeky virgin that he has been for the last 40 years. They take Andy on some crazy adventures, and even want him to change his appearance and curb his enthusiasm for action figures that line Andy's apartment.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow the director of this film had a scene that took place in Andy's apartment just before his date with Trish. Andy is shown all alone in an empty room with a medium angle shot with high key lighting to show how empty Andy's apartment is and to demonstrate how empty and alone Andy is feeling at this point in time.<br/><br/>As Andy is trying to find out who he truly is, as well as prove to himself that sex is not just for fun but is something that has to be done with the right person reminds me of Josh Hartnett as Matt Sullivan in ""40 Days and 40 Nights"". Matt was also finding out who he truly was and that sex does not always have to be important, it is more about finding that person who you can love without sex. Every time Matt was faced with a sexual situation he would run from it. Andy and Matt share similar qualities in hiding from what everyone else wants them to be. But in the end they both prove that sex in a relationship does not have to come first.<br/><br/>Sex is very important to a relationship but it should not be the only thing to build a relationship. Instead individuals must build a relationship with another person who is as involved in the relationship as they are themselves. In the end what woman wouldn't want to know that even after 40 years she was the only one to share those special times with her special man???"

","A friend had just watched this and was reliving their favorite scenes a few days ago. I recall liking the movie but my response was continually, ""I don't remember that scene... I don't remember that... or that..."" I had vague positive feelings about it, but had forgotten the entire movie except the waxing sequence, and the ""You know how I know you're gay"" banter. Watching it tonight, I was really stunned at what a loose, aimless string of shock/humor/provocation it is. Like ""There's Something about Mary,"" most of it's value was in seeing it the first week or two, in a packed theater, to laugh your ass off over things that were startling to see on the screen. There are laughs in it, but your interest is frequently lost in obviously extemporaneous dialog, and lots of padding.<br/><br/>Apatows comic style is the one-joke movie, and usually the joke is invoked by the title as in this and Knocked Up. His comedy doesn't revolve around plot, but language and observed behavior instead. There's nothing wrong with that and I'll be forever grateful to him for sparing us from asinine idea-comedies like ""Click"" with Adam Sandler. But in all his movies, the characters just kind of go through the motions once the premise is introduced. We all drank the Apatow Kool-aid but the moment is quickly passing. I'll be amazed if he has more than a year or two left in him. Maybe if he learns to recognize/produce a finished script.<br/><br/>Because Apatow mixes more sentimental urges with raunchy humor, people give him a pass, but all his movies include some really sappy crap. Steve Carell's magic tricks, action figures & the final musical number all make my butt tighten. At this point we still knew so little about Carell that we gave him the benefit of the doubt paying such a dork, because the movie was so edgy. But when you go on to make Evan Almighty in an effort to pander to the lowbrow, bottom-feeding religious dollar, you actually are a dork."
"jaredmobarak","9","1","3","28 May 2007"," You know how I know you're gay?The 40 Year Old Virgin
","I will preface this review by saying I have never been the biggest Steve Carell fan. I love his bit parts, but seeing him in a lead role after having a start on ""The Daily Show"" rubbed me the wrong way. Believing that I would hate his writing/lead role debut as much as I do Will Ferrell's multiple attempts, I shied away from checking the film out. Being that director Judd Apatow's sophomore film Knocked Up is hitting theatres this Friday, I decided to bite the bullet and finally see if the hype was true. All I can say is that this is the funniest movie I have seen since Hot Fuzz, and that says a lot since most American comedies of this ilk are fart jokes and horrible. The 40 Year Old Virgin is definitely the funniest film of 2005 and deserves all the praise it gets. Everything worked and I was laughing out loud throughout its entire duration, from the opening sequence of Carell trying to urinate to the ending song and dance routine of ""Age of Aquarius""absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>As everyone who owned a TV two years ago knows, this film revolves around Carell's Andy and his revelation to coworkers that he is a virgin. The film soon progresses with their attempts to give him advice and his journey to get laid and find love in the process. Usually a premise as flimsy as this would not be able to sustain my interest for two hours, especially a comedy because it would be filled with filler gross-out moments that are so random you have to roll your eyes instead of laugh. The Forty Year Old Virgin never has a moment like this at all. Every gag or set piece is true to the story and nothing seems contrived for cheap laughs at the expense of the real story going on. Andy is a dork who has given up hope and decides to play video games and collect vintage toys rather than join the club scene. Although a dork, his coworkers soon find out that he is a funny guy with a lot to offer and they become close during the crusade. The underlying theme of love over sex and the power of friendship are there for sure, but the jokes are what make it all work. The touching moments are never sappy and when the sentimentality reaches the line of cheese, a one-liner or gag is thrown in to keep the pace fast and the story moving forward without pause.<br/><br/>Sure the writing is top-notch. Carell and Apatow have woven together a wonderful tale here. The jokes are continuous and smart. There are bodily fluid moments, but the film doesn't rely solely on them. Really, though, it isn't always the script that succeeds, but the actors delivering the words. I can't think of a better foursome than Carell, Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen. I have been a Rudd fan forever and he definitely lives up to the reputation; Malco, brilliant in ""Weeds,"" comes in and uses that role with a bit more everyman insecurity and hits it out of the park. As for Rogen, I haven't really seen him in anything. Supposedly he was in Donnie Darko, but don't ask me where. He really shines here and by this performance alone I have made my decision that Knocked Up is my movie choice this weekend and not something more serious and dramatic. Rogen is pitch-perfect in delivery and timing and his facial expressions and body language is fantastic. Mention should also be made for Catherine Keener, an actress whom I am also a big fan of. Her role needs to show her insecurity about dating a ""good guy"" when she has always gone in the opposite direction. There is the right amount of awkwardness between the two leads, but also a perfect dose of chemistry to make the relationship real.<br/><br/>Every supporting role is great as well and there are too many to name. Let's just say that I couldn't believe how many bit-players were played by people I recognized from other TV shows and moviesCarell even gets his wife into the action. With the ensemble assembled and the writing as good as it is, I don't know why I waited two years to finally experience the phenomenon. Even the soundtrack was mindblowing. Using the songs that are, in the context here, is ingenious. The final song and dance moment had me on the verge of crying and will not be forgotten any time soon. Do yourself a favor and see this film if you have not already."
"bigelowam","9","1","3","20 April 2007"," Well, it's a start for Carell...
","What can I say? This movie could have been better. I know a lot people will want to kick my butt for saying that. But it's the truth. Although Steve Carell is funny, this movie uses him wrong. It's a good starring vehicle for him, but the movie does not show his natural talent. If you want to see his comical genius in action, watch ""The Office."" That is freakin' hilarious. <br/><br/>Overall, the movie was only okay. It is certainly no comic masterpiece. The comedy and the plot is overshadowed and muddled by the over-usage of profane language. There is an f-word in every other sentence, which ruins the comedy. The Indian guy is the most annoying character I have seen on screen since the annoying, squeaky black servant in ""Gone With the Wind."" He is so vulgar that he almost ruins the movie, not to mention almost made me turn off the movie during the first ten minutes.<br/><br/>However, the movie is not all lost. Seth Rogen, Catherine Keener, and Paul Rudd save the movie. Rogen is hilarious, Keener is lovable, and Rudd had the funniest lines. The movie even has some funny moments, but it is certainly no ""Hot Fuzz."" (If you're reading this, go out and watch ""Hot Fuzz."" Now.)<br/><br/>So, if you're really, really bored, are in the mood to watch a comedy, and you have nothing else better to rent, rent this one. It'll give you a few chuckles here and there, but be prepared to feel uncomfortable. Very uncomfortable."

","If, mind you, if you can sit through the first 100 minutes or so of this gag-fest (and I stress the word ""gag""), there is a nice performance by Catherine Keener, the real and legitimate girl friend of The 40 Year Old Virgin. She is a lovely and mature actress who injects the only humanity in this mindless, sophomoric garbage. Keener's character Trish falls for Steve Carell (Andy), as timid a man as you're likely to ever see in a movie. There is a budding and emotionally almost-sorta-kinda believable romance that grows between them. It's worth watching, all five to ten minutes of it.<br/><br/>But you have to wade through what seems like an eternity of filth and degradation to get to it.<br/><br/>I must be getting old; I just sat there chuckling every once in awhile, but mostly cringing and blushing. The 40 Year Old Virgin isn't worth your time, even if you're a Keener fan.<br/><br/>Flush this commode . . . and check something out in the grownups section of the video store."
"thatquietboy","9","1","3","16 August 2006"," A good movie, but not because of the stars
","This is one of those movies where i found the main characters annoying... in my opinion the real stars are Seth Rogen (Cal), Romany Malco (Jay), Gerry Bednob (Mooj) and Paul Rudd (David). Their improvised scenes, both in the main movie, and in the DVD extras are hilarious. as far as the stars go, Steve Carrell is just annoying, I really feel he is overrated both as an actor and an improviser. Catherine Keener plays her character well, but she was given precious little to work with. The highlights of this movie for me were the argument between Mooj and Jay over a customer, and the performance of Aquarius during the closing credits. None of the characters is overly sympathetic, and the story is uninspired. But its all in the improv, hence the 9 rating."

","I was trying to work out why this movie works so exceptionally well, and why I enjoyed it so much. It finally hit me: it is a genuinely adult comedy. Not a film that just uses crude language (in which yes, this movie abounds), toilet humour, and sex simply to appeal to the teenage market, but one with richly observed characters and genuine heart, dealing with the subject of sex in an adult way. I think the biggest surprise was that, contrary to what you would inevitably expect from the central plot premise, the film does not rely for its humour on the humiliation of its characters. That is an almost unheard of joy in a present day film like this. All I can say is, if you get to the point where Steve Carell starts singing ""When the moon..."" without a huge idiotic grin on your face, then you have my pity. :-)"

I couldn't help but think, oh my gosh, some nice guy probably took a nice girl to the movies to see this on a date, and it would have been a terrible experience, because it would have been so embarrassing for both people.<br/><br/>There is nothing in this movie that makes it worth watching."

","Compared to the fact that anybody who is still a virgin is often ostracized by non-virgins for not getting. YOu wonder if it's all worth it whether it be the wrong or right person. This movie will please a lot of religious conservatives who make the presumption that you are any less because you are still a virgin. This movie allows a great comedian like Steve Carrell to play the oldest virgin known to mankind because he is so good at acting in general. We grow to admire and like this character unlike his television show. The fact that he has to come forward and admit his virginity is kind of like coming out of the closet. I love Jane Lynch. She is such a great actress and comedienne and deserves to be recognized. She is wonderful in Christopher GUest films and I saw her last night on Charlie Sheen's show and as always, she is wonderful. This movie is good to show for its lightheartedness and its attempt to be different. It's successful at that. It shows virginity in a positive light rather than as a freak show. There a lot more virgins out there but I'm not one of them sadly. I grew up where getting rid of your virginity was a top priority and how sad is that to give it to somebody who never calls you back."

","I knew when I saw that Judd Apatow was the producer on this that it would rock. He's one of the guys behind ""Freaks & Geeks"" which was canceled after only 1 season.<br/><br/>I loved this movie and didn't find it offensive at all (and I AM a female). It was really honest and, at times, hysterical, esp. the ""Know How I Know Your Gay"" scene which coulda been taken right outta ""Freaks & Geeks"" because they sound like two 13-yr-olds.<br/><br/>I especially liked how at first his friends are scared and creeped out by him. Seth Rogen's character thinks he's a serial killer. That's funny because it's also realistic that these guys wouldn't know what to make of him.<br/><br/>The morning wood scenes are hoot and also believable.

The movie dialogue is pretty true to form relative to the subject matter, at least as far as how my friends and I discussed those things. There are lots of somewhat unrelated funny bits that pop along during the story which draw the length out past the magic 90 minute mark. Personally, the movie was funny enough and paced well enough where I didn't mind. There are lots of laughs and comparatively sensitive moments between the more colorful bits to help keep the wives/girlfriends along for the ride. Totally recommended - and the DVD has lots of great extras."
"jpschapira","7","1","3","19 December 2005"," Apatow films
","The ending of this film totally ruins the experience. These guysThey like to have fun with film-making, singing stupid songs like ""Afternoon Delight"" in that scene from ""Anchorman""; but that strategy won't work all the time. It doesn't work at all in the ending of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"", a honestly made comedic film.<br/><br/>So about these guysJudd Apatow has a company that produces films, films like ""Anchorman"". I think the man is proposing a new way of real comedy, with intelligent humor. The intelligence sometimes ironically proposes that stupidity can be the correct way of making people laugh. Apatow knows this, and he knows the people that can achieve it.<br/><br/>""Anchorman"" was written by director Adam McKay and star Will Ferrell. The cast included Paul Rudd, David Koechner and Steve Carell. Apatow produced Will Ferrell's recent ""Kicking & Screaming""; gave Paul Rudd a role; lend David Koechner a cameo; and co-wrote with Steve Carell his first full-length feature, about a virgin with forty years.<br/><br/>Carell stars; he's becoming quite ""the funny guy"" these days. He produced this film, and it seems he wants to make a fool out of himself by playing the fool, but that's exactly the reason; because he knows he has a gift for absurd comedy and he knows he'll make us laugh out loud with character like Andy in a movie like this. It is called self-confidence, and it is a great and basic quality in a comedian.<br/><br/>I don't know any 40 year old man who's a virgin. I know adults that have their toys, adults that have their action figures, but no virgins. It is an issue, a serious one, and one that can be ridiculed in excess. Apatow and his partners deal with it truthfully, from the point of view of love relationships, making the ride very sincere.<br/><br/>Carell's Andy works with pals David (the always natural Paul Rudd), Jay (a funny Romany Malco), Cal (the very promising Seth Rogen) and the foreigner Mooj (Gerry Bednop), who always encourages people to have sex with a goat (situations that repeat constantly so we understand the film's language). Besides being 40, Andy's social situation is difficult.<br/><br/>When Cal talks to him about the weekend, he says he went to Tijuana and saw a woman having sex with a horse. ""What did you do?"", he asks Andy. ""Well, I felt I really needed an egg sandwich, so I bought the egg and spent three and a half hours making the sandwich, but then I didn't feel like eating it; and I didn't even have bread"". Cal pretends to shoot himself while Andy doesn't look.<br/><br/>These situations the virgin experiences with all his co-workers, developing a friendship that originally comes from their objective: getting this man in bed. Eventually Trish comes into his life. She's played convincingly by Catherine Keener, and has kids and Andy starts dealing with them, the relationship grows but with absolutely no sex involved. This is all very well written and is the best of the film; Andy's talks with Trish's daughter Marla (Kat Dennings) and ultimately a scene of a misunderstanding that delivers an unforgettable line, by an unimportant character: ""Dude, teach me!"" It's awesome.<br/><br/>The time will come for Andy to reveal the truth and you'll laugh constantly meanwhile, and in the end you'll realize that this is a good comedy of good intentions, that Judd Apatow is more a planner than a director (he directed correctly and simply an idea he wanted to develop), and that Steve Carell is a natural comedian; and he's got it going on."

","Whether you are male or female, democrat or republican, black or white, gay or straight, bi or thai, there is one thing I'm sure we can all agree on: THIS YEAR'S SUMMER MOVIES HAVE TOTALLY BLOWN!!! Enter The 40 Year Old Virgin, which may rob the title I bestowed upon There's Something About Mary as the smartest, funniest, and sweetest summer gross-out comedy ever.<br/><br/>Granted the plot of Virgin is entirely predictable. By watching the trailer or merely hearing the title of the film, it's easy to figure out that Steve Carrell's character has gone without carnal knowledge for 40 years and his buddies will try to get him laid. In the process, Carrell will find true love...and eventually be deflowered.<br/><br/>What makes this movie so enjoyable then? I'd say it's the following three things...<br/><br/>1) The comedic timing of the entire cast. Everyone is dead on in their delivery of one-liners. And, like my beloved Something About Mary, the best lines come out so effortlessly and spontaneously it seems like half the movie was improvised. Actually, I wouldn't be surprised if much of the movie was improvised. The producers said that they really waxed Carrell's chest in the scene that's in all the commercials and trailers (which is by the way one of the funniest film moments I've ever seen...if you can call squinting through tears of laughter seeing).<br/><br/>2) The men. Hearing four guys talk about sex for an hour and a half is great, especially when it's discussed in such a gross, vulgar, disgusting, and sadly real way as in this film. In short, Carrell and his friends are a male version of the ""Sex and the City"" ladies where the three friends are all Samanthas with the raunchiness taken to an extreme and Carrell's the only Charlotte.<br/><br/>3) Carrell. His innocence and charm makes you want to root for him and laugh at him all at the same time. A scene in which Carrell tries to put on a condom, somehow gets his testicles in it, and snaps it is a prime example. You laugh at him, but you feel sorry for him at the same time. Very few actors can pull off a character like this as well as he does.<br/><br/>So if you're sick of crap like The Island or Madagascar, go see this film. I swear it'll be considered one of the best comedies of the past 10 years. Who knows...seeing it may make you feel like a virgin, touched for the very first time..."

Instead what we have here is a nice blending of ballsy sex comedy mixed with a genuine sweetness,an affinity for the title character whose struggles are as sympathetic as they are hilarious.<br/><br/>Steve Carell,the co-writer as well as star of the show is Andy,a man who at forty seems okay with his life as a seemingly monastic bachelor,working at an electronics store. That all changes when his peers at work discover that their quiet but friendly coworker has never ""completed the deed"". When they decide to try and help him ""pop his cherry"",they only end up getting him frustrated(and themselves in trouble). That is,until Andy meets a single mother(Catherine Keener),with whom he strikes up a warm,mildly sexual relationship. Since she is somewhat reticent about jumping back into sexual relationships,this naturally creates more conflict.<br/><br/>Great performances and a smart script(also co-written by first time-director Judd Apatow) make this film above average for the ""gettin' some"" themed movie. This film could've been so easily mucked-up by lesser talent. As is,this film has the somewhat rare ability to be crass,bawdy and yet gentle at the same time.

The film was also a little slow to get going.<br/><br/>Some great characters added some extra dimensions to the movie.

It's raunchy, foul mouthed, and filled with raucous ridiculous situations no sane person would willingly submit themselves to, but it's funny as hell. Steve Carell of the Office plays lonely Andy, the aforementioned 40-year-old virgin. He works at a generic Audio/Video store; and spends his free time collecting vintage action figures. He even has an obscure Million dollar man figure, not Steve Austin but Oscar! For some reason he's invited to a company poker game, where he accidentally lets it slip that he's a virgin. They take him under their wing, with the expectation that they will find a woman for him, and he will lose his virginity. Hi-jinks ensue. Truly. There's the drunk girl that throws up in his mouth, the hot bookstore clerk that gets lost in Andy's double talk (a buddy told him to answer every woman's question with a question, trust me it's funny) and the quirky grandma with an internet auction store that doesn't sell anything in the store. Loaded with comedic bits, and funny innuendo, a definite don't miss."

","It's rude, crude, and irreverent, and it's one of the best films of the year! It's the Forty Year Old Virgin, a film that is so full of gross-out gags and cheeky humour that most viewers will be aching with laughter. Together with a hilarious, acerbic script, sharp performances, great characters, and a willingness to tackle taboos, it's also a charmingly engaging love story.<br/><br/>Like one of the plastic-encased action figures that line his Studio City apartment, Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is all wrapped up. A stockroom manager at consumer electronics store, in The Valley, Andy's never learned how to drive, never had a steady girlfriend, and, at the ripe old age of 40, has never had sex. His sexual history is a chronology of embarrassing near misses. He certainly likes women; he's just a victim of circumstance.<br/><br/>When his brash, beer swilling colleagues David, Jay, and Cal ((lovelorn Paul Rudd, quirky Romany Malco, and rakish Seth Rogen) invite him for an after hours card game, they find out that he's never been with a woman. So they set out to rid him of his wretched virginity by helping him find a girl  any girl. They are full of stupid schemes, the point being, of course, that they are even more childishly screwed up in their relations with women than he is, and delusional as well.<br/><br/>Amongst the drunken girls, the partying, the dope smoking, and all the embarrassing humiliating moments, Andy meets a Trish (Katherine Keener  just wonderful!). Trish is a real woman, a laid back, middle-aged divorcée, who has been around the block a few times. She's nearly Andy's opposite, Even her job - running one of those we-sell-it-for-you-on-eBay stores - is symbolic: She spends her days trafficking in other people's unwanted goods.<br/><br/>So it comes as no surprise that Trish is attracted by Andy's innocence, even turned on by it - before she knows why he's so innocent. While Andy is inspired by her to finally let go of his childhood childish things, Trish, along with Andy's timid blessing, is more than happy to develop a relationship without sex for a change.<br/><br/>Carell so fully inhabits this role, making Andy a handsome but dorky kind of guy with a too bright smile that flashes nervously. He's is a man who has more testosterone than he knows what to do with; his over exercised chest bristles with thick, dark hair, and one can just see the sexual frustration dripping off him. But Andy's inhibitions go so deep, that he's almost sad to watch: he clings to his childhood toys for safety and closes up with a tense angst at the slightest suggestion of sex.<br/><br/>The romance comes alive every time Catherine Keener is on the screen. Keener has a big smile and a husky laugh, and she's such a warm charmer that it's impossible not to fall in love with her. The supporting players are spot-on and lend their own liveliness to the proceedings: both Elizabeth Banks and Leslie Mann shine as predatory women who terrify the hero, and Jane Lynch, as the tough boss at the electronics store who suddenly softens and takes a shine to Andy, is hysterical, especially when she breaks into a tender Guatemalan love song in an effort to seduce him.<br/><br/>Yes, it's all pretty ridiculous, and some of the scenes verge on the offensive, but the characters are played with such understated charm and extremely quick wit, and there's real chemistry between all of them.<br/><br/>The film has a raw, natural tone that infuses even the film's most outrageous sequences: there's the chest-waxing scene, which mixes authenticity with toilet humour, and the sex clinic workshop which touches on people's real insecurities, even as it maintains a wildly comical tone. Along the way the clever script genuinely taps into issues of masculine insecurities, male obsession, and even female attraction.<br/><br/>Ultimately, The 40Year Old Virgin is the story of a rather lonely, insecure, and reserved man who becomes a better lover for having been abstinent. Yet throughout Andy's journey there are arguments to be had, temperamental adolescents to be contended with, and unavoidable truths that must be revealed.<br/><br/>Along the way, The 40-Year-Old Virgin is mercilessly honest about all this, even as it is being ruthlessly funny. Perhaps then, the movie is ultimately an ode to the benefits of virginity, an irreverent and bawdy advertisement for the saying that ""only good can come to he who waits.""

For that, I thank Steve Carell for his fine acting job, and I would also like to thank his supporting cast. Steve, thanks buddy, you did me a solid on this one. I really enjoy movies, not only watching them, but acting in them, too. I wish I could do more movies instead of sitcoms like Becker and Curb Your Enthusiasm.

","40 Year Old Virgin is the funniest movie I have seen all year. Steve Carrell is not only a genius comedian but he is also a great actor, even in the more delicate scenes. But let's face it, anyone who goes to this movie is going for the comedy, and you'll get plenty of it. From the same director of Anchorman, and also many of the same actors, I personally find 40 Year Old Virgin to be much funnier. With less of the ""stupid humor"" and more of the random silly humor, 40 year Old Virgin makes it good to be crude, rude, and ridiculous. Not for the more conservative members of our society, this film is filled to the brim with cursing, drug content, and sexual innuendo. But, it also has the sweet innocence of its main character and the woman he falls in love with. A great date movie (for those that aren't timid), the 40 Year Old Virgin is a wonderfully hilarious romantic comedy, with all the laughs you could ask for."

But this movie is just funny the whole way through. I wasn't bored the whole time watching the movie and every minute it had something to laugh about.

The back and forth of ""you know why your gay"" was really lame and not funny at all, and the thing is you could tell it was set up to be one of the funniest parts of the movie, but it just did not deliver at all. But the one part that was funny, and was over promoted in commercials was the waxing scene. That scene alone was probably the only thing that made this movie likable for me. There were so many points in the movie they could have capitalized on, especially with the Indian guy.<br/><br/>I honestly expected a funnier movie, but i found the jokes to be just plain dumb and have no intelligence to them.

","There are many humorous moments in this film, and kudos to the creators of it for making an adult movie for adults, but I think the praise heaped on it has made it out to be a much better movie than it is. Given the desultory crop of summer movies we've been subjected to in 2005, it's no wonder that a film that's even remotely original and fresh gets critics frothing at the mouth.<br/><br/>This film suffers from what so many screen comedies do: some jokes and scenes just fall flat, and when they do, the whole pace of the movie is thrown off. It's not riotously funny, but there's enough to keep you chuckling through the dead parts. Probably not the stuff of a comedy classic, but there are worse ways to pass the time.<br/><br/>Grade: B"

","I'm probably not smart in comparing this to American Pie because really they are two different types of movies, American Pie is about teens trying to lose their virginity before high school ends. The 40 Year Old Virgin is about a man (Steve Carrel) who has long past graduated from high school, and college. I don't think I'm spoiling anything by saying that he's a 40 year old virgin. Is the movie funny? Absolutely. Have I seen funnier? Yes.<br/><br/>The performances in this movie are what really kept it going. Steve Carrel is I think, one of the funniest men in the business as of now. He was good in Bruce Almighty, and probably to most a favorite character in Anchorman, and now his biggest role, in the 40 Year Old Virgin will be talked about as a symbol of his comedic genius. Really just a funny funny movie with a great all around vibe.<br/><br/>P.S. This movie has to make EVERYONE feel foolish, either that or you have a really big head to carry on your shoulders.

The racial humor is also abundant, and nothing is held back. I may sound like I was offended, but I have to tell you, in this movie it works! It really is a smart comedy. The relationship between Steve Carrell and his friends is similar to the relationship between the girls on Sex & The City. These people care about one another. They're totally believable. The movie's payoff is extra sweet, because we care. We really care. Steve Carrell has made a movie for adults that adults can enjoy without sacrificing adulthood. Really funny stuff!"

","For us adults - both guys and ladies - this movie is for us. While having some of the same premises as your basic teen-sex romp (dweeb dude trying to get laid) it is done very smartly, and while raunchy certainly, is never mean-spirited towards women or men. Steve Carrell plays, of course, the 40-year-old virgin and while having those virgin/dweeb characteristics, is oddly MUCH deeper than the stereotype of the ""guy who can't get laid."" In addition, the surrounding cast is hilarious - his co-worker buddies, his boss, the women/situations that pop into his life - all done in a very adult, raunchy but SMART way. Hell, your wives will even like this, guys! Mine scolds me for MY tongue, but she was laughing throughout the film. Go see it in the theater for that camaraderie experience - this is one of the rare films in recent years that will NOT leave you thinking you wasted $9 and two hours of your life.<br/><br/>For the younger viewers (17 and under) I'm not saying it's too raunchy - heck, GTA is 100x worse and you get more misogyny out of most music. I'm just saying that you won't get a lot of it - you think you will, but you won't.

","Freak!, i just got back from this dizzy after seeing it with both my parents. As a 26 year old virgin, I must say I was quite entertained by this breezy charmer. T40YOV relies on many of the postmodern comedic techniques of the films nearing the new millennial such as Napolean Dynamite, Office Space, UHF, among others prove influential, while not entirely a low-budget affair.<br/><br/>Evidently this movie is grossing big bucks, which is somewhat surprising given the subject matter. In the age of extremes it is not surprising that the subject of virginity would be explored as an sexual extreme reversal. While at first awkward, our protagonist fleshes out into a full and lovable character. This, in part, operates on the po-mo-com-tech of the validity of the banal and everyday. Other pomcom-techs such as reflectivity are employed at our main character's job at an electronics store where 60 inch flat screen televisions play a variety of movie-land scenes.<br/><br/>Additional laughs are delivered by age stratified multi-cultural potty-mouths who support our lead with narratives of competing ridiculousness. Amongst other things you will see a man pissing on himself, hair ripped off a chest, and a scene involving alcohol and an automobile which will probably upset members of M.A.D.D. While I had a whole shopping cart full of chuckles for the bulk of the picture the film doesn't end very strongly. Personally I'm not sure how I would have ended it and the psychedelic music video reference is decent, but i guess i wanted another large comedic bang toward the end. Another angle which i doubt will be explored is this film within the current political atmosphere such as the administration's attitudes toward sex, who might enjoy this film for it's somewhat obvious statement that saving sex for marriage is a good thing. However, i doubt that this contingency holds the interest to sit through 2 hours of trash talk to get to this message. Chalk up another one for the pomcom!"
"eggowaffl-1","8","1","3","21 August 2005"," Worth the money.
","In a time when even remotely humorous movies rarely come along, 40-Year-Old Virgin was a much-needed and anticipated film. For the most part, the humor was very well done. The Michael MacDonald DVD, the action figures, and the Age of Aquarius ending were were fantastic. Yet, certain elements of the ""humor"" cheapened the movie more than they enhanced it. The token angry-Pakistani co-worker, the excessive cursing, the lame ""hip"" friend covered in tattoos, drunk Beth, ""pussy on a pedestal,"" and the sexually harrasing boss were trite, disposable, and inefficacious aspects of the film. There were, however, several genius moments, with jokes that took a second or two to process. It's hard to articulate, but Carell manages to be uproariously funny in some scenes simply by means of his body language or facial expression. All in all, this movie will have you laughing so much your face hurts. As others have mentioned, there are some lulls...I thought it could've done without the drawn out Trish/Andy relationship. For film that manages to insult essentially every racial/ethnic group, it certainly does it with a touch of class. It's worth the money for the laughs--it's certainly far better than the majority of the crap on Comedy Central. But by all means, do not enter the theater expecting a ""profound"" Oscar-worthy drama. Some of the jokes are indeed puerile and sophomoric, yet the overall structure of the film, as well as references to long-gone pop culture, make this a film that teen boys won't be able top to fully appreciate. No one in the New York City theater that I saw it in walked out; on the contrary, it was rolling with laughter in incessant 30-second intervals."

They play each role exactly as each should be, no one goes over the top and makes their role a caricature. Everything was believable which really makes the comedy work.<br/><br/>One odd note from my own personal experience. Don't ask me why I remember this but I took Spanish in high school as so many of us did. We all probably remember that each new chapter in a Spanish textbook usually started with a dialog between two or more people in Spanish of course. For some reason all these years I remember one of those dialogs which translated ""When they clean my room I can't find anything"". Well, remember the part in the movie where Andy's manager started singing a supposed love song in Spanish? I caught the words and they weren't about love - it was the same dialog from my old Spanish textbook! Guess the scriptwriter and I took the same course!"

I truly think that this is one of the best Apatow movies to have ever been made, this one was truly better than Knocked Up and on the same level as Superbad. This movie is more of an adult movie about a man that is trying to grow up by losing virginity. While on his way up to losing it he becomes the floor manager of Smart Tech and things turn around for him. In the end it all pays off and he truly grows up.

","I have a theory about this type of comedy.<br/><br/>Unless you are an American with some semblance of a normal middle class upbringing, you will neither ""get"" nor appreciate the humor of films like The 40 Year Old Virgin. I identified with Steve Carrell's character, in that I, too, have had my share of bizarre sexual encounters--had there been a ""perfect storm"" of these types of experiences it may have turned me off of sex just like it did poor Andy.<br/><br/>Everyone who has any type of normal working life has ran across these co-workers, the smooth playa, the stoner, the lonesome loser, and the guy who cracked me up the most, the foul mouthed little foreign dude. My little foreign dude was Thai waiter named Sammy, while Andy's happened to be a little Indian guy. The part where he is trying to be all sensitive towards Andy and starts spouting about ""butt love"" and the ""rusty trombone"" and the ""dirty sanchez"" had me in tears.<br/><br/>Andy, who could have been just another stereotypical dweeb is played with surprising depth by Steve Carrell; he's a fairly normal guy, he just never got laid, and like a bad habit its stuck with him his entire life.<br/><br/>The supporting cast, Andy's coworkers, his boss and the various ""hoodrat"" women he interacts with hit at perfect pitch. The secondary roles like Paula his boss, and the drunken girl who takes him on an automobile ride from hell are priceless. Her line about wanting some ""Frrrench toast"" is a classic.<br/><br/>Although Virgin winds down at the end, the total strength of the movie outweighs the anticlimax. If you enjoyed Wedding Crashers and There's Something About Mary you will get a big kick out of 40 Year Old Virgin."

","40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN ""Really? All your girlfriends wanted to have sex with virgins too? That's funny... I didn't even know you g-girls talked like that. I think my first time might be your best time too. Well I knew it, you know what? I knew that you'd react that way and I knew that you would want to lead me through my first sexual encounter will all the compassion and care that someone would give to their soul-mate."" There are so many films about romance. Too many. With titles floating around every year that just make the mark harder to reach for the next batch, where will we be in 15 years? Hopefully, some of the better writer's will always find the new humor, without resorting to current trendiness and eventually retread on the field of romantic film. Romeo and Juliet deserves a better remake? Bah, let the kids take it as they got it, I say. No need to follow the script to a 't', anymore. Too much is on the line with American media for it to admit it, but romantic comedies are so easy that it's actually harder to get attention at the box office.<br/><br/>The 90's were a prime example of the ""way too much of a good thing"" theory. We all need that moment in the theater with a spouse or loved one around one arm, with one in a popcorn bucket. The balance is good. But the quantity of these movies released seems a bit brash. The point is, since ""There's Something About Mary"", we've all been waiting for the next troupe of filmmakers to fill the Fareley Brothers shoes.<br/><br/>""You know what my problem is? I am not interesting. What am I supposed to say I went to magic camp? That I'm an accomplished ventriloquist? Oh, I am the 7th degree imperial yo-yo master."" No wonder, then, that it took a mockumentary specialist of the likes of Steve Carell to bring the life back to the perpetual stream of love-shmuckery in modern cinema. Carell, fresh of his stint on ""The Daily Show"", co-wrote ""40 Year Old Virgin"" with ""Anchorman"" director, Judd Apatow (which Steve also starred in.) Carell, himself has a charisma that allows first name approach to even the most unacquainted viewer. Shortly after ""40 Year Old"", Carell went on to command the reigns of popular TV show ""The Office"", playing in a similar business-type setting as the one in ""Virgin."" It is also probably of no surprise that the film ""Virgin"" contains some of it's most brilliant mockeries of culture in segments that totally exclude opposite gender reactionary stunts. For example, the poker scene near the beginning of the film should be listed, in my personal opinion, as one of the most funny scenes in film-making history. In it, we see five well-ab-led men in their middle ages (late 20's to late 30's) make total asses of themselves for each other around a table of gambles. As the Arabic fellow leaves the scene, we get a real taste of how down-right grungy the characters will be in the movie. How fitting, once again, that a film of such improportionate standards takes on cultural symbology and does a total script-flip on the idea of stereotypes, right? It doesn't do much good to really explore the depths of the film, without viewing it for yourself. ""40 Year Old Virgin"", is certainly one of those few movies that you need to be there to get the humor. Yet, nonetheless, the film remains attractive and utmost hilarious during just about every segment that it rustles out of it's pockets like a forlorn drunk scrambling to pay up his tab after an unsuccessful night at the bar.<br/><br/>The lengths that the actors went to for the sake of comedy are, as such, mostly unscripted and spontaneously set up to explode on impact. Steve Carell even went in for a real chest hair removal job without special effects, for the film. Now where else are you going to get that realness? Objectively, the film demands attention. Subjectively? forget it. I just hope guys who go and see this flick have already gotten their share of play with the female gender. Feelings will get hurt, quite easily, otherwise.<br/><br/>""Do you ever notice how... like, in a relationship... one person's always like 'blah blah blah blah' and the other person's like 'What are you talking about?' and one person's like 'blah blah blalablah...'"" 10/10"

","Just a better than average, creative film by this under the radar now certified auteur! Finally a comedy that's not in the strangle hold of the Stiller/Wilson boot-jack! I like Will Ferrell a lot but when he's just phoning it in . . . The supporting cast is amazingly good! If you have to touch another man's underpants while he's wearing them be sure to put on a repulsed face and disdain your hand as if you had touched flaming snot. This is sexy: picture doing it while she sends you a birthday card with twelve dollars in it. And the hottest of all? Gina. Gigh-nah!

","funniest film ever Steve Carell is probably the best comedy actor around the moment he is hilarious in the office: American workplace and possibly the best comedy character ever, Brick Tamland in anchorman: the legend of Ron burgundy. i really like the scene with all the condoms and his girlfriends daughter walks in and the daughter looks at the condoms and says 'you don't even let me have sex' and she storms out the room and her boyfriends says to Andy 'dude, teach me'. also i think David is another one of the funniest characters as well. one moment hes fine the next he's an emotional wreck.

"fishcakesrus","10","1","4","12 October 2006"," 40-Year Old Virgin
","Steve Carrell is becoming a big thing in Hollywood ,after his ingenious performance in Anchorman, and it's easy to see why in this film about one man who has never had intercourse in the whole 40 years of his life. When his friends from work find out about his little secret they make it their mission to lead him through his first time, but it's harder then they think when it becomes apparent that Andy (played to new comedy heights by Steve Carell) has a hell of a lot to learn. And so the adventure begins as each guy tries to help Andy with their own tips and ways when all Andy really wants is to have a non-sexual relationship with his new love Trish (Catherine Keener). Filled full of hilarious lines and scenes, 40-year Old Virgin is one of the funniest films in the past few years. And if you're still not convinced then take note that it actually contains the line: ""Aye-aye, Captain Yellow-shirt,"" - BRILLIANT"
"Isaac5855","9","1","4","10 July 2006"," The Next Woody Allen?
","Steve Carell, Emmy nominee for THE OFFICE and the only actor who came close to stealing ANCHORMAN from Will Ferrell, lights up the screen in THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN, a completely winning and original comedy, co-written by Carell and Judd Apatow, that turned out to be one of the most refreshing and drop dead funny surprises of 2005. Carell and co-writer and director Apatow, have managed to create a comedy that is not only hysterically funny, but undeniably warm and charming. Carell plays Andy, an anal-attentive electronics store salesman who cooks gourmet breakfasts and has an expensive collection of action figures (when you remove them from their original packaging, it decreases their value)who agrees one night to an evening of poker with three of his co-workers (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogan), who manipulate Andy into admitting that he has never had sex with a woman. We then spend the rest of the film watching poor Andy getting really terrible advice from his well-intentioned buddies about the best possible method of ""deflowerization."" Such a premise would expectedly lead to a smarmy sex comedy, but that's not what we get at all here. Carell and Apatow's razor-sharp screenplay is smart and almost always takes the high road, in the best tradition of the Woodmeister, and every time you think you know where it's going, the story takes a complete U-turn. Catherine Keener, one of Hollywood's sexiest and most intelligent screen presences these days, is sparkling and vivacious, as Trish, the businesswoman and single mom Andy falls for. Rudd has some very funny moments as Andy's buddy who is still obsessing over an ex and Jane Lynch is also amusing as Andy's self-absorbed boss. As I watched this practically perfect screen comedy, which works from start to finish, and remembered that Carell co-wrote it as well as starred, I couldn't help but wonder if Carell is going to be the next Woody Allen. If this winner is any indication of where he is headed as a writer and performer, he is well on his way."

","Age of Aquarius bloody brilliant....<br/><br/>Just seen the 2hrs unrated version of the movie and i'm glad to see the general opinion of this film is positive. Yes the movie was crude and probably offensive to some, but one thing the film had was both heart and great characters, incredibly likable and superbly played by the cast. There were times when the film slowed for a few minutes but in the end i think it gave the film a full fleshed out feel and you genuinely wanted Andy to defeat his problem (whilst having quite a few chuckles at his expense. <br/><br/>The ending scenes had my whole house roaring with laughter!!!"

","After reading the gushingly-positive reviews here, and also getting a lot of good feedback from my usually-trustworthy friends, I braved a snowy night and finally checked this one out.<br/><br/>I simply have to say, ""meh."" It's Steve Carrell's best *acting performance*, but it's certainly not his best *comedic work*. His more mediocre bits on the Jon Stewart Show are much funnier than his performance in this movie.<br/><br/>I won't say I didn't enjoy the flick. It's a good date movie, and there are a few genuine laughs. But the life was edited out of it in order to keep in solidly in the ""cute"" category. A few of the secondary characters, for example, had the potential to provide more laughs than they were allowed. And there were a few sparks of subplots that didn't turn into anything. Finally, the gorgeous Elizabeth Banks was sorely underutilized.<br/><br/>I'm glad to see Carrell pull off the acting thing, but I just wish he could stay away from this mainstream stuff."
"garebuck","9","1","4","2 December 2005"," This culture is seriously screwed up!
","Yes, SCREWED up. In every nuance of meaning. The now cliché ""thumbs up does not necessarily mean OK"" slogan comes to mind.<br/><br/>I almost didn't see this one as I don't typically like raunchy comedies. Forrest Gump says that life is like a box of chocolates...and so on. Well, the other day I saw xXx: State of the Union--big flashy action flick, right?! If you can liken that one to a steaming fresh horse turd carefully hand-painted to look like a Russian nesting doll, then 40 Year Old Virgin is a Rembrandt dipped in sewage. For one thing, the fact that it probably does *not* hold the record for F-bombs in a picture is a sad commentary on movie-making in general.<br/><br/>But I'd rather see a good movie with a crude veneer than some of the dreck that Hollywood vomits up each year. Passion of the Christ (Gibson's ""Holywood"" offering) wasn't a ""pretty"" movie but I think it did OK :-] Not saying that 40-YOV should be compared to this masterpiece but it has a lot going for it. Yeah, Andy's a big goober but I don't recall that this is a capital offense.<br/><br/>Deciding not to have sex is admirable but what amazed me was that he actually got married before the ""big bang"". A very classy touch; score one point for marriage!! I'm not much of a fan of Catherine Keener, especially in the looks department. But you can tell that Andy genuinely likes her character and doesn't want to just do her out of pressure or obligation. It was so cool to see these people have a wedding first and *then* see how much more Andy is able to value the ""celebration""; he turned out to be a real pro in the sack after all! I was 26 and 4 days old (but who was counting?) when I had my first and only woman...on my wedding day, thank you. Now I'm almost 40, and clearly not a virgin (4 kids) but I remember how some bozos would bother me about my previous ""condition"", as if it were a disease.<br/><br/>Like Wedding Crashers, this movie finds itself respecting people's choices to not take sex so nonchalantly. The male sluts eventually figure out that doing everybody becomes shallow and boring and long for meaning relationships. But hey, this is a comedy...is it funny? Yes, and not nearly as brainless as you might think, considering the material. The profanity doesn't add much, as it usually doesn't, except when Andy gets ""waxed"". I understand that Steve Carell really allowed them to rip out chest hair so that he would get the right reaction on film. It works painfully well. Also, showing the difficulty of trying to pee with ""morning wood""; it's so dang true.<br/><br/>You're not a prude if you think this one's rude and crude, dude!

I definitely recommend, not for children though. But definitely for adults. If you liked Anchorman, you will like this movie. When Andy's friends try to get him laid, everything is a disaster and he ends up having a relationship with a no sex policy. The ""Do you know how I know you're gay"" scene is just hilarious. Everyone should see this movie. You can really relate to it. It's not like it's way out there and you can't relate to it. It could happen to anybody. That's what I like about this movie.

"wizard42","5","1","4","2 October 2005"," Not bad once you get past the beginning
","This is the story of two films. The first is a juvenile, film filled with men referring to women in very insulting terms, and trying to take advantage of women whenever they can. The second is a sweet and very good romantic comedy about two people finding each other. The first film is pretty bad, and surprisingly not funny. The second is excellent, and surprisingly funny. If the filmmakers had just spent more time on the second film, this could have been a very good film. Unfortunately, it is bogged down by the first half of the film, which includes finding humor (or trying to at any rate) in a man who is always cheating on his girlfriend, a man who thought he had a serious relationship which lasted all of two months and has scarred him for the last two years. It also contains a guy who might have been an interesting character, but who we have zero back-story for (he is the only one who really seems to be trying to help anyone out throughout the film). We also have two stereotyped Indian or Pakistani's who just pop up every now and then for no reason whatsoever. The funniest scene in the film comes at the end with the dancing and singing to ""The Dawning of the Age of Aquarius"" and ""Let the Sunshine in"" from the movie hair. That scene truly makes you laugh out loud. It's too bad the rest of the film is not so great. The lead in all of this, is actually a likable guy, and that is the films saving grace. Once the film moves to his wooing of the female lead, and the two finally get together it becomes a good film, unfortunately it takes far to long to get there."
"DICK STEEL","9","1","4","1 October 2005"," A Nutshell Review: 40 Year Old Virgin
","With a title like that, it takes little imagination to know that this film belongs to the sex comedy genre which has gained popularity ever since American Pie started it all from 1999.<br/><br/>Virgin adopts a similar formula, even from the start, we are introduced to Andy (the Virgin) in his suburban home, and his stiff unused woody (Yes, it's that blatant. Expectations, remember?) Andy's the guy who somehow couldn't grow up, with his extremely cool collection of collectible toys and comic books, custom made video game chair and home decor adorned with pop culture posters. His predicament would probably be appreciated by many guys - with a life like that, interest from the opposite sex is hard to come by, and not to mention a disastrous experience which left him scarred.<br/><br/>Andy works in an electronic store, which is the setting taking up almost half the entire film. Not that it's bad though, interesting hilarious stuff do happen. And it is his colleagues, upon learning his ""secret"", vow to make things happen and present to him various opportunities and tips. Even his female manager subtly propositions to him as a f-buddy, bringing on some laughs as she delivered it multiple times in a deadpan manner.<br/><br/>So begins various set pieces like the first pick up in a bar with a drunken babe who drives him to her home, the speed dating segment where he meets a butch wanting to go straight, and another who had a wardrobe malfunction, the pain-inducing chest hair waxing session gone awry, and Beth, the demure bookstore chick, who's more than meets the eye. Eye candy galore though in these scenes, so all the hot blooded males out there wouldn't be complaining at all, akin to the strategy adopted by American Pie by featuring attractive actresses.<br/><br/>It works on another level though. With his friends providing weird and sometimes crazy ideas and advice, we are presented the flipside of their own predicament, insecurity, and troubled relationships. This movie seemed to spread the message that sex isn't everything, and while journeying with Andy to his first lay, most can identify with many of the issues and relationship problems presented.<br/><br/>And on that note, this film at some times feels like Will Smith's Hitch. Andy, while listening and accommodating his buddies' advice, instead goes against these well intentions to set his sights on Trish, a woman who works on the opposite side of the street, selling stuff on E-Bay. In this storyline however, it's the usual boy-meets-girl, fall in love, loses girl, gets her back cliché formula. But it's the delivery of both leads Steve Carrell and Catherine Keener that keeps it from being boring.<br/><br/>Despite casting relatively unknowns, just as American Pie did, the actors seem to have loads of fun despite the stereotypical roles. This film should gain recognition for Steve Carrell, just as Pie did for Jason Biggs, Some might have remembered Carrell as the funny newsachorman in Bruce Almighty, and I'll be awaiting in glee for him to star in one of my favourite TV series Get Smart, as Maxwell Smart (somewhat a dead ringer for the late Don Adams I tell ya).<br/><br/>Surprisingly, you'll hardly feel it's a two hour long film. The pace is quite even, despite the meshing of 2 parallel plot lines following American Pie's and Hitch's. I dare say the Virgin does swallow the Pie, with a more mature and responsible feel to it."
"Filmcritic624","9","1","4","26 September 2005"," Terrific, Brilliantly Acted
","I recently caught the eye to see this film in theaters, and when I walked out of it, I had all to say about it.<br/><br/>Before I get into my schpiel on how terrific this movie was, I'd like to say that we will never see a movie that funny, and yet so original ever again, like the greats always say, with great risk comes great reward.<br/><br/>OK, so here it goes. The story begins with a nerdy salesman Andy (Steve Carrell). Andy collects almost every action figure and video game possible and he works at an electronics store with several other execs who are much ""cooler"" and ""in"" than Andy is. One night, Andy is invited to a Poker game with these guys, and when the topic of sex is being discussed, its Andy's turn to reveal his dirty secret. And, so the secret is revealed, the guy hasn't gotten much (I apologize, NONE)time in the sack with a woman, other than the other times that he's tried and failed.<br/><br/>Immediately, the group tries to get him laid by doing all means necessary. They start with the basics, using pick up lines, forms of masturbation (forcing him to watch a box load of porn), and taking him to bars with brilliantly pretty woman to waxing his chest and actually talking ""suave"". Eventually, it all cans out when he meets an EBay Marketer (Catherine Keener), who, after a series of dates with him, is dying to give him the time. Problem is, she's unaware of his issue. Will the issue effect the relationship? There are absolutely some good laughs in this one. As always, the funny Steve Carrell puts on a nice show as the scared, boyish Andy. He foils out Andy Stitzer, and shows why he is the way that he is. A man afraid of change, stuck inside his own little world, and afraid to crawl out of it and explore the meanings of adult sexuality, something he has never experienced.<br/><br/>As for the lovely Catherine Keener, she plays the pretty Trish exceptionally well, as the innocent, yet pushy single mother. As for the rest of Carrell's supporters (Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, and Seth Rogen), they are terrific as the bozo's that they are, and make the movie even more funnier to support the already chuckle burner in Steve Carrell.<br/><br/>Don't keep this issue a secret. I certainly won't if you don't.<br/><br/>9/10."

This is a movie that likes all its characters and treats them well, unlike some that use ridicule to generate humor. And for those who might want to debate this movie's ""moral message"" -- though I can't imagine why you'd want to -- it gets even that right, managing to have fun with sex without trivializing it. The main character truly struggles with his dilemma, and you're pulling for him all the way. My only, teeny-tiny complaint is that the product placements are frequent. Luckily, they're not very distracting. You're too busy laughing. Highly recommend!"

I went with my brother and fiancé, and we did not stop laughing. I normally don't do this, but i even spoke to the screen a couple of times. (Of course, I was high, so I spoke up during the weed references!) Even though I was the stoned one, my brother laughed harder than anyone. I would go see it repeatedly if I had the time to do so. This movie also boasts an excellent cast of supporting actors, who took their turns to shine. I still can't get enough of Paul Rudd.

"FMACDONALD","10","1","4","21 September 2005"," The Funniest Movie I've ever seen
","For many years The film American Pie was my favorite comedy of all time. then a few weeks ago I saw Wedding Crashers, and American Pie was having some serious competition. then just two weeks later both American Pie and Wedding Crashers was dethroned by the new reigning champ The 40 Year Old Virgin. Holy crap is this movie funny as hell. in the first two minutes I was laughing my ass off. I was skeptical on this movie at first because everyone I knew that saw this movie was telling me how funny it was and how much I'd love it. I was weary because everyone told me the same thing about Napolean Dynamite and Anchorman: The Legend Of Ron Burgandy. words can not describe how much I hated those movies. So I figured what the hell I'll give The 40 Year Old Virgin a shot. I'm glad I did. The story is simple, Andy (Steve Carell, who also wrote the movie) works at a store called Smart Tech (It's supposed to be Circuit City/Besy Buy) with David (Paul Rudd) Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogen) who he becomes friends with. Then they find out the shocking news that Andy is a virgin at 40 years old. Now David, Jay, and Cal have one goal in life, get Andy Laid. Andy is more content with sitting at home playing his video games, reading his comic books (this angle aggravates me because it make people like me look like jackasses) and collecting his action figures. Even Andy's elderly neighbors who he watches Survivor with every Thursday knows Andy needs to get some. Andy doesn't even have a car, he rides a bike to and from work. After failed attempt after attempt from his friends Andy meets Trish (Katherine Keener) and realizes that she could be the one. The problem is Andy doesn't want to tell her he's a virgin because he's very embarrassed about it. The 40 Year Old Virgin is rated R for a reason. Like Wedding Crashers there are a ton of swears and I haven't seen more jokes about sexual content since Porky's. This movie is HYSTERICAL! I was laughing pretty much from the minute it started to the minute it ended. It's not for everybody though. The movie relies heavily on jokes about sexual content and sexual references, plus some people might be turned off by the swearing. especially in the scene where Andy's friends decide he needs a good waxing because he's to damn hairy. Personally I thought this was the film's second funniest scene. If stuff like this offends you then wait for rental because you won't spend as much as going to the theater and you can turn it off any time you want. If this stuff doesn't offend you then by all means see this movie. This movie is in my top 5 films of the year list at number 2. Batman Begins comes in at number 1. On a scale of 10 I give The 40 Year Old Virgin a 10. As I said before it's the funniest movie I've ever seen. Long live the king."

","It's a tragedy how many comedies just aren't funny anymore...however, The 40 Year Old Virgin was a shining star in the black hole of comedy space. Crude, offensive, poor-taste sex humor generally make for a good film, but in this movie the jokes were so driven and so unapologetic I was a Persian kitten's whisker shy of urinating in my jeans. Funnier than any one of the American Pie movies, Steve Carrell scored big with his humble character stricken with no lady luck. When his friends from work find out he's STILL a virgin, their mission becomes getting him some lady loin. This is not just another situational comedy or reconstituted drivel we've all seen a thousand times. The 40 Year Old Virgin was probably the finniest film of the year and it wouldn't surprise me if it remained funnier than comedies for the next five...all I really want to say is, ""See it!"""

It uses all the clichés you can think of for 40 year old virgins and plays them up. The main character is well done and as much as you laugh at him and with him, you have to respect him for being who he is. The buddies and co-workers are a hoot too. At first you can tell it's a game to them but they end up truly wanting to help and of course it just gets worse then. The part in the trailers you see with the waxing is better in full length. The little gags and subtle things are what make this comedy work. The script is funny too, but the whole package is what does it for me. The only downside was the ending. It gets a little hokey, but it's a comedy and they have to sum it up somehow. Overall, it's fun. Even 40 year old virgins will laugh."

","Taking out untouchable comedy classics (mainly Coen brothers' works, Monty Python stuff, Young Frankenstein, and Annie Hall which I think are flawless and beyond compare at this point) ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" might be the funniest movie I have seen in my entire life. Better than recent screwballs: Wedding Crashers, Old School, Elf, and There's Something About Mary. All of which I loved. In 40V, there's not a bad bit or wasted gag or line of dialogue in the whole thing and it's riotously funny and bawdy from the first minute to the closing credits. Clearly, you have to be in the right mood and probably need to be in the target audience (as the title suggests children of the '80s). If you were born between 1965 and 1975, can handle a little modern Vaudeville and are impossible to offend, this movie is damn near perfect. It's just wrong on so many levels.

","I'll make this short and sweet - this movie was extremely well scripted, and just as well acted. I think Jon Stewart said it best when he interviewed Steve Carrel about this movie and said: ""You were on the Daily Show for several years, and you were not good. This movie was amazing. What happened to you?"" My stomach hurts from laughing out loud so much. There were countless quotes and statements that I wish I could remember because they seem like the kind of natural expression that needs to become part of my day to day repertoire. I was really watching the movie and thinking to myself, man, how did I not think of saying that when situation X presented itself to me. Definitely seeing it again. Only thing bad was the first 10 minutes - but I have a suspicion this was deliberate to make you think the rest would suck too, or at least ease you into laughing your brains out. 9/10."

","Given the generally dire state of cinematic comedy it is not saying that much to call 'The 40 Year Old Virgin' the best comedy of the 21st century (so far) but it probably is. Indeed it's probably the best since the inexplicably under-rated 'Kingpin'. For comedy to really work it has to come from character and not just from situation and what sets this apart from 'Wedding Crashers' and even the mighty 'Anchorman' is that the characters are genuine and there is real pathos (although not sentimentality). Steve Carell is excellent as the hero, and it is surprising and refreshing that his virginity, whilst used for comedic purposes, ultimately isn't sneered at. The supporting actors were all well-cast and the movie, while a shade overlong, managed to maintain a pretty high level of laughter throughout - the chest hair scene is a classic."

","Instant classic! Steve Carell is the new Steve Martin, and this movie is the new Porky's. It doesn't show much nudity per se, but the dialogue and scenes are WILD. It made me horny (and I'm a girl)! Whatever your gender, I'd advise seeing it with pals rather than a date because it's so brutally honest that you might be able to enjoy it more without wondering if you're busted. But definitely go see it. It's an eye opener. :-)<br/><br/>P.S. Watch the esthetician's face in the waxing scene... because the waxing was 100% REAL (God bless Steve Carell), she almost ruined the take because she was trying so hard not to laugh!

","Greetings again from the darkness. Although Steve Carell has shown flashes of comedic genius in ""Anchorman"" and on TV in ""The Office"" and ""The Daily Show"", my expectations for this one were very low, given the subject matter.<br/><br/>Pleasantly surprised at how Carell (as writer and lead actor) and Judd Apatow (as writer and director) delicately handle the topic and the situations that Carell's character finds himself, I found myself smiling, more than laughing. Much of the movie is downright sweet and charming.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong. There is much raunch and uncomfortable content when the boys are in full planning mood. It is interesting that two of Carell's three buddies on a mission both appeared in ""Anchorman"" with him (Paul Rudd and the very funny Seth Rogen). Scene stealers include an almost predatory Jane Lynch and an insatiable Elizabeth Banks (Spider-Man movies).<br/><br/>The ""Aquarius"" segment at the end of brilliant and a vast improvement over a similar type ending to ""There's Something About Mary""<br/><br/>With all of the nice supporting work, there is no mistake that this movie belongs to Carell and a truly terrific Catherine Keener. Keener displays none of the harshness that has made her famous, but instead is full of grace and charm and vulnerability. We like her and find ourselves pulling for them to make it (pun intended) Is the storyline built in? Yes. Is it executed well? Yes. This is usually a pretty good foundation for a comedy. Apatow and Carell turn a one trick pony into a pretty nice film that is definitely worth seeing."
"jon.h.ochiai","9","1","4","21 August 2005"," Fresh Virgin
","We first see our hero Andy (Steve Carell) waking up, and at attention (so to speak) in his tidy apartment. His ""crib"" is populated by hermetically boxed action figures, Play Station Games, and a framed poster of '80's rock group ""Asia"". He cooks a healthy breakfast, dresses geeky, and rides a bicycle to work. Andy is a supply clerk at an electronics super-store somewhere in West Los Angeles. The guys at the store need a fourth for their ritual poker night after the store closes. The delivery guy, Cal (stoner funny Seth Rogen) suspects that Andy might be some closeted serial killer. He really does. However, the rest of his crew, David (Paul Rudd) and Jay (Romanny Malco), invite Andy. Andy accepts. In an inept technical story, Andy comes out. No, not gay. He is a 40 year-old virgin. But instead of ridicule, Jay (slick street funny man, Romany Malco) declares that his life's mission is getting Andy laid. David and Cal are also enrolled in his community project. This is what is so charming, hysterical, and unexpected about Writer/ Director Judd Apatow's ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin."" Along with star and co-writer, Steve Carell, ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" is absolutely raunchy and graphic funny, but it is never mean-spirited. Never. In fact, the movie has a sweet love story, and an off-beat sense of true friendship. Much like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" is a smart, absolutely funny R-rated comedy with the romantic foreground.<br/><br/>The story by Apatow and Carell is clever, hysterical, surprising, all with a light touch. In an unexpected scene Andy asks the always together Jay, ""Do you think that I am good-looking?"" Jay tells him, ""...Yes."" The exchange is sincere. Yes, Andy is some sort of loser with the action figures, video games, and zero fashion sense. Well, at least initially. But with the good-souled and so very earnest Carell as Andy, we get that there is perhaps more to him. Perhaps, Andy gave up on sex and really on love a long time ago. Carell pulls off Andy as some sort of celibate hero, not so much pathetic, rather really a good guy. Like his co-workers, the audience has a genuine affection for Andy. So when his Viking-like boss Paula (an imposing funny sexy Leslie Mann) personally offers to make Andy a man, the effect is hysterical.<br/><br/>There are hilarious bits involving speed-dating, porn, body waxing, and projectile vomiting. Eventually, Andy meets Trish (quirky and completely charming Catherine Keener). Trish is a 40-ish mother of three, who owns a ""sell it on E-Bay"" business. She has an office across from the electronics store. Andy meets her when she comes in looking for a VCR. Yes, VCR. His crew is behind Andy, and he musters up the courage to ask Trish out on a date. It goes so well, that they agree not to have sex for 20 dates as they get to know each other. No, this is not a big deal for Andy. Managing the rest of his life is.<br/><br/>""The 40 Year-Old Virgin"" runs a little too long, so to speak. Perhaps, it's only short coming. It is predictable, though completely hilarious with a universally satisfying charm. Steve Carell as Andy has a geeky charisma, for what could have been a pathetic characterization. Carell instills a great humanity and vulnerability in Andy. Catherine Keener is an amazing surprise as Trish. She is smart, funny, and extremely sexy. She is so believable as a 40 something single Mom, running her business, raising her kids, and looking for love. The rest of the cast are outstanding. Paul Rudd has great presence as David, the heart-broken guy who waffles between new age man, and woman chaser. Romany Malco is so versatile as Jay. He is the ultra slick dude, who ends up being a true friend to Andy. Seth Rogen is hysterical as the guy's guy Cal. There is a lot more to Apatow and Carell's ""Virgin"" than drop dead laughs. It's got a good story. Definitely see ""The 40 Year-Old Virgin""."

","When you see a movie title like ""The 40 year old virgin"", you usually don't expect anything particularly surprising or extraordinary. What this movie delivers is exactly what it promises: 116 minutes of comedy centered around Andy Stitzer (also known as Steve Carell from the Daily Show), a 40 year old virgin. His co-workers try to help his love-life, while also experiencing troubles of their own. This movie is not extremely hilarious or extremely boring, but when I went the theater was bursting out laughing many times. There were also many subtle jokes in the movie that you'll have to spot to get,If you see this movie, I guarantee you'll be laughing at least for a good portion of the movie.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to anyone over the age of 14 or 15.

","OK the movie started out very slow. OK the whole movie was slow and the only good reviews that i heard came from guys. The movie was way to long they could have cut out at least a half hour. It was so boring in parts that i wanted to die in fact i had to watch it twice because the first time i fell asleep. This movie is also giving ugly guys hope that they will find hot chicks at bars and fall in love. Well I'm sorry but not every woman is a slut and i have no respect for this film and i know there is lots of movies like this but this was one of the worst. This movie had no point from the very start and i don't see why it is so popular. I also think that the swearing didn't need to be in there because not everyone in the world says F***. I will save you three hours of this film well thats what it felt like. Guy is a nerd has lots of toys. Bunch of guys that work with him need him for poker he agree's they figure out he is a virgin laugh and make fun of him. They decide to help him get laid. Nerd meets hot girl at his store and gets her number. They make the nerd not call her but he does anyways and finds out she is a mom the guys at the store laugh at him again. Before he dates her has tried to have sex a few times but cant go through with it. The nerd and the hot girl make a deal not to have sex for 20 dates in this amount of time she gets him to sell off his toys he agrees and on the 20th date they get into a fight(shocking) he gets mad about her selling his toys and leaves. He then goes to a bar and gets drunk and goes home with yet another slut that looks like shes barely legal. When hes in her bathroom with her he freaks out and realizes yet again that he loves the hot mom. His friends some how know that he went there and go into the apartment and tell him to go get her after the whole time of making fun of him why didn't they just do it in the first place we will never know. He goes to his place were she went to tell him that she was sorry as he goes in she finds his porn that his friend gave him she freaks and leaves he goes after her on his bicycle. He flies through the side of a truck and she gets out and he tells her that he is a virgin and the hot mom says its OK even if she looks like she would have has sex a million times. They get married and the nerd finally has sex for a minute then for two hours. She asks him how it was and he starts singing. And thats it the end don't see it thats all i will tell you"

If you don't get a kick from this movie go to your room and never come out. Too bad just 5% of the movies are this good and the other 95% aren't worth the buck and-a-half rental charge at the video store. So if you want to spend what seems like 15 minutes watching the coming of age of a 40 year old guys and want to smile a lot see it on the big screen.

","Steve Carell has all ways been funny,he was great on the Daily Show and let's face it Anchorman belonged to Steve. Steve plays Andy Stitzer an extremely likable character,that's why the film works so well.Yes the comedy is crude but it works and Carell never makes his character dirty for the sake of laughs.Andy is innocent through out the movie,he has a care free life he rides his bike to his job at the local electronic store,and comes home every night to his museum like toy collection.Andy is invited to a poker game with his co-workers,where dirty sex stories are being told.Andy reveals he is a virgin,and his friends begin a crusade to get him laid.His friends aren't so understanding and Andy begins to fear the worst.He meets Trish a women who runs a sell your junk on Ebay store.Andy gets her phone number and time goes by before he can muster the courage to call.The film is very fresh and funny.The best laughs come from Andy's curiosity,the condom scene is laugh out loud funny.The movie works because we were all like Andy at one point or another and Carell makes the material funny,but not disgusting(It is still dirty by no means take children) Steve Carell will have a very successful career in movies and I welcome him."

John Stewart gave it a good review on his Cable Network show ""Comedy Central"", and the plug was well taken.

","Don't be fooled by the poster or poor trailers, this is a wickedly funny film that surpasses Wedding Crashers by a long shot. Hopefully word of mouth will bring people into the theatre so that audiences can discover that the film is not the one punch line, purely slapstick humor that the trailers make it out to be. The film is saved from such a fate with a very well written script which brings out the humor in richly fleshed out honest characters and situations we can all relate to. Steve Carell shines, bringing an added depth to his typical ""straight man"" comedy and showing that he can certainly hold his own in a leading role. The supporting cast excels with just the right touch of absurdity and truth, even without the big named stars found in every other comedy these days. The film actually feels all the fresher for not having the requisite cameos."

Plus, I loved Steve Carell on the Daily Show, but I found his movies lacking, but he was never the star. Here, he has a writing credit. His performances are getting better as his roles expand. Much to my surprise, they pulled it off after all, to an interesting, and unexpected closing after the closing which adds a significant element of sweetness to the story.<br/><br/>The subject of the movie is more serious than the comedy this is billed to be. Andy Stitzer (Carell) is the virgin because he ""choses to be""; actually, because he's socially inept and afraid of the opposite sex. I was wondering how he would break the news to his girlfriend in the movie, who eschews sex with him, apparently to avoid the pressure.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is a hoot, the dialog is well written, and entirely believable, as crazy as his co-workers seemed to be. We've all had them. I also loved the interesting choice of music, which adds an interesting layer to the movie one doesn't usually notice.<br/><br/>Not the funniest movie of the year, as some reviewers say, because it isn't intended to be, considering the subject which needed to be dealt with seriously and not frivolously.

Compare it to a typical Adam Sandler movie where there is no one besides white people. In ""Virgin"" Paul Rudd's character can't stop thinking about his ex, who turns out to be of Indian origin (I'm guessing, it isn't actually discussed in the movie).

","I saw this film once before, but I needed to see it again to give it a more accurate opinion, especially as it was the big boost for the leading actor, after making an impression after Bruce Almighty, from director Judd Apatow (Knocked Up, Funny People). Basically Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is forty years old, has an average job in an electronics superstore stamping invoices, and has an average apartment full of treasured old and valuable action figures and comic books, he is just an average guy. The only thing that doesn't make him average is that he has not yet lost his virginity, and when his work colleagues David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen) and Jay (Romany Malco) find this out they see as a really big deal. They at first saw him as odd and hardly worth hanging out with, but with his revelation they are determined to help Andy do it, whatever way is possible, but all of which has pretty unsuccessful results. This includes drunk Nicky (Leslie Mann) driving and terrifying him before getting to her apartment where he changes his mind, speed dating with people he cannot relate to, and the guys hiring a prostitute who turns out to be a transvestite. Andy finds himself his own possibility of a date with customer Trish Piedmont (Catherine Keener), who owns an eBay selling shop across the street, and she gives him her number, which he does ring but gets nervous when she answers. Eventually, after more failed attempts from his chums, he asks her for a date, that goes very well, and she invites him back to her place, but he experiments with loads of condoms, e.g. blowing them up, and they get interrupted by her teenage daughter Marla (Kat Dennings) before they can have sex. Andy likes her so much that he was planning to tell her he was a virgin, but Trish suggests that they should get to know each other more and have twenty dates before they have sex, and he agrees, and at the same time his good work gets him promoted by boss Paula (Glee's Jane Lynch) to floor manager. While his friends deal with their own relationship issues, David is obsessing over Amy (Mindy Kaling), Jay splits up with girlfriend Jill (Erica Vittina Phillips), but she takes him back after she is pregnant, and Cal helps attractive Bernadette (Marika Dominczyk) to get hired to distract David. As the twentieth date draws near Trish is happy to know that Andy has ambitions to set up his own shops, so she suggests he should sell his valuable and treasured action figures, and for a while he goes along with it to make the money. The twentieth date arrives, but Andy is still unwilling, and this turns into an argument him and Trish, and he leaves to go and get drunk, and he runs into Beth (Slither's Elizabeth Banks), a woman he met earlier, and they go to her apartment. His friends stop him from doing anything with Beth, and he had changed his mind anyway, and Trish is waiting at his apartment, but she has spotted all his suspicious stuff the guys gave him, including pornography, and she thinks he is some kind of psycho. After a chase down the street, in which Andy ends up crashing his bike and going through a truck billboard, she goes over to him, and he finally confesses that he is a virgin, and she is not only relieved, but surprised that this is his reason all along. In the end Andy and Trish are happily married with all their friends attending the lavish ceremony, there is mention of his action figures making half a million dollars, and of course the newly wed couple consummate, he is no longer a virgin, and in happiness there is a big musical number to ""Aquarius/Let the Sunshine In"". Also starring Jonah Hill as eBay Customer, Final Destination 5's David Koechner as Dad at Health Clinic and Scary Movie 3's Kevin Hart as Smart Tech Customer. Carell gives a good oddball performance as the man who is geeky and desperate to pop his cherry, Keener is sweet as the attractive woman that he has true feelings for and is nervous to do anything with, and the supporting cast, especially Rudd and Rogen are great as the ones giving mixed and useless advice about sex. Obviously if you not lost your virginity you can relate and feel empathy for the lead character, it is not just a funny film mocking this fact, and creating silly and at times bizarre situations relating, but it is a sweet story with a love story and a man trying to take this big step for any person, a fun romantic comedy. Worth watching!"

","Steve Carell (Anchorman, The US Office) stars as Andy Sitzer who's work mates discover one evening is a virgin, a 40 year old virgin.To Andy this has never been a big deal but to his colleagues it is and they are determined that he should 'score'.Now this could have turned into a Road Trip/American Pie style 'sex comedy' but instead is quite a thoughtful and charming comedy.This is mostly due to Carell who really is the nice guy, and throughout the movie, yes, you hope he gets his 'oats', but above all, you hope he finds the partner and love he deserves.<br/><br/>The only slight down part to the movie was the length. I thought Hitch and The Wedding Crashers were fine comedies but suffered from a drawn out final third, this film suffers the same problem with it's running time of well over two hours.<br/><br/>Never the less it is still a very funny and charming movie and is highly recommended ."

","There was a time when this movie was ubiquitous on a bunch of cable channels, and even then I never got around to watching it. I finally broke down the other day and took a look at it, and in a lot of ways my suspicions were confirmed. There's a lot of pandering to the lowest common denominator, but at the same time, Steve Carell makes his character likeable enough whenever he's agonizing over his love life or lack thereof, which is basically all the time. His buddies carry most of the hedonistic baggage in the story, but surprisingly, aren't as demeaning as I would have thought given the premise of the movie's title. They're actually quite supportive in Andy's (Carell) attempt to cure the problem that compounds his daily existence, while trying to deal with their own issues in affairs of the heart. I thought Catherine Keener was a well cast love interest for Carell's character; they had a nice chemistry once all the interruptions plaguing their love life fell away. It's too bad Jonah Hill didn't have a larger part than his quirky role as Trish's (Keener) persistent Ebay store customer, but this was one of his very first movie roles, so it's not surprising. With a little more experience under his belt, he would have qualified for one of Andy's poker playing pals. Over all, the movie has it's share of laughs at the expense of all those comic book and sci-fi collector nerd types, and anyone who hasn't been able to get the deed done within a reasonable time frame, forget about forty. It also adds a new word to the wide ranging alternative solution to regular sex. The writer who came up with the expression 'outer-course' deserves a bonus."

"j-76096","9","0","1","1 June 2018"," Very good movie
","The 40 year old virgin directed by Judd Apatow was a very funny movie in my option, the use of very crude humor throughout the movie made it a very enjoyable movie. Steve Carell played the part of Andy perfectly, he is a very lovable main character with a good heart. The character of Andy likes his life a certain way and is organized down the the way he gets ready every morning. Andy is content with his life of collecting action figures, riding his bike to his job at a tech store, he even signals his turns on that bike. 
 The film starts out with a morning in the life of Andy Stitzer ready for his job and then biking there. Later in the day a few of his coworkers invite him for a poker game at the store after hours, it's there where they discover he hasn't even had sex in his 40 years of life. The next day his coworker and soon to be friend David promises to help him get laid soon, so he invited Andy for a night out on the town. After a couple unsuccessful nights out with the guys Andy meets a woman named Trish who works across the street who gives him her number. After a couple more nights out Andy realizes that the woman he wants to be with is Trish. But the fact that he is a Virgin is a huge problem in his mind, thinking that Trish won't accept him because of that fact so he hides it. Until after a problematic fight where Andy storms off and picks up a girl at the club but before he is about to seal the deal he realizes that he loves Trish. In the end they have a beautiful marriage and Andy finally has sex. 
 The acting of the movie made it great, it has a relaxed feeling of hanging with the boys. Steve Carell along with his supporting actors Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen and Romany Malco have great chemistry together creating a sense of togetherness in a group of long time friends. The director Judd Apatow did great things by introducing Andy by the way he gets ready in the morning and then bikes to his job. The character of Andy is like a lost puppy when it comes to women, especially when his coworkers are talking about them he nods along as if they are speaking in a different language. This helps the audience empathize with Andy and turn him into an almost underdog in the movie, everybody is rooting for him. The director also allowed the actors to improvise, this again allows for the movie to have a relaxed and friendly feel to it, like the person watching the movie is part of the action with the guys. The writers Steve Carell and Judd Apatow made the plot in a way that also allowed the movie to be great, it starts by showing how much Andy is missing out on without knowing it. Then it morphs into a part where Andy knows what he is missing and he wants to do something about it but doesn't know how exactly. Then finally he figures it out and ends up happy, this allows the watcher to experience a wide array of emotions from frustration to sympathy to anger to joy and happiness. 
 All in all the movie The 40 Year Old Virgin was a wonderful movie that made me happy to watch it. Steve Carell played the part of Andy marvelously he always seems to fit the character who's a little bit off like in The Office when he plays Michael Scott. The supporting actors who made up his friend group made the movie relaxed and easy to watch, especially since they made the watcher feel like one of the guys. The plot allowed for Andy to become an underdog who the audience could root for. All this made The 40 Year Old Virgin a very good and funny movie in my opinion."

","The 40 year-old virgin is a romantic comedy film directed by Judd apatow and stars Steve carell, Seth rogen, Paul rudd, and Catherine keener. it is about a man Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) who is an amiable single guy working at a big-box store. Living alone, 40- year-old Andy spends his free time playing video games and curating his action- figure collection. Despite his age, Andy has never had sex, so his friends, including the laid-back David (Paul Rudd), push Andy towards losing his virginity. While attempting to get over his awkwardness around female customers, Andy meets local shop owner Trish (Catherine Keener), and they begin a tentative romance. <br/><br/>this is a very funny movie that i haven't laughed so hard at in a long time. right off the bat it has a good character development. everyone has a backstory that you can see or can't see, and it all concludes with a happy ending for each of them. what's great about this film is Steve carell, the supporting cast, the humor, and the writing. it all blends together to create a funny and sometimes heartwarming film about having whoopee cushion. it has great timing and solid comedic performances from the likes of Paul rudd, and Seth rogen just to name a few. you laugh with Steve carell and you yell at the screen saying, ""don't do this"" or ""don't do that!"" <br/><br/>the love triangle is very believable and very real. it is there and it isn't forced at all. Catherine keener and Steve carell have great chemistry and it never outstays it's welcome. it's sweet and very romantic. you really get the feeling that they're in love, and it's a great romance.<br/><br/>what this movie does well is that it's aware that it's a comedy and it takes that advantage and makes a said comedy with it. watch it. you'll have a fun time with this movie if you're single, or on a date night."

","The 40 Year-Old Virgin (2005): Dir: Judd Apatow / Cast: Steve Carell, Catherine Keener, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Romany Malco: Hilarious yet stern comedy about identity. Steve Carell plays a virgin at forty. He is an electronics salesman whose friends try to advance him in his sexuality when they learn of his inexperience. Inventive screenplay plays out with a celebration of marriage. Director Judd Apatow does a superb job at creating a worldview through the eyes of the sexually depressed. Carell is hilarious as a virgin who collects action figures and rides a bicycle to work. The film is at its hilarious best when he is presented with various methods of communicating with women, which mostly leave him frustrated. Catherine Keener plays an Ebay worker who strikes up a friendship with Carell. She is a mother of three and questions his unwillingness to progress sexually. Carell's co-workers include Paul Rudd who is depressed after his last breakup, Seth Rogan, a writer and pot smoker who directs Carell to greater sexual conquests, and Romany Malco as a player whose girlfriend suspects his cheating ways. They all have different approaches and advice to Carell that all leads to frustration and somewhat personal detachment. Strong theme regards the pressure of sexuality and the embarrassment of lacking sexual knowledge or experience. It is one of the funniest and best comedies of the year. Score: 10 / 10"

","Steve Carrell is a middle-aged man who works in the stockroom in an electronic store, who rides a bike to work, and who has never had sex with a woman. It just never happened. He probably only half-heartedly tried, but was always awkward with women and never felt secure enough to really be the aggressive type. So I gather from his disposition. Then he meets Catherine Keener, who has an eBay store, to sell your items online! Is she the one? I am reviewing this movie, despite the already numerous reviews, to add my two cents and to encourage people to see this really funny movie, which started the raunchy film craze such as ""Superbad, ""Knocked Up,"" ""Forgetting Sarah Marshall,"" and ""I Love You, Man."" (Not counting the ""American Pie"" film series.) ""Wedding Crashers"" was made around the same time as ""Virgin,"" I believe. But while these other films may have their defenders and fans, none of them can claim to have the heart this film does, and the presence of the disarmingly funny Steve Carrell helps. Granted I did like ""I Love You, Man,"" too, but this film just has everything right with not a single false note, and the performances by Catherine Keener, Seth Rogen, Paul Rudd, Jane Lynch and Elizabeth Banks were right on track and made the whole film complete. I don't mean to repeat myself, but this film is just so genuinely funny. Some may be turned off by its unChristianlike language, but other attempts to replicate this success of the film really failed in my opinion. I give it a 10 for the best time you can find in movies where the adults are behaving badly."

If you like Steve Carell and his type of humor, you will probably love this movie. I found that it lacked humor. I am sure I am totally wrong, but then, what do I know? I actually have a real life. Genuflecting at the daily at the local nabe just so I can proclaim myself some kind of cinema dilettante, is just not for me.

"crimsonandsilver","5","0","1","17 February 2014"," Good acting can't make up for horrible writing
","The first thing I found grating about the movie was how stereotypical almost all the characters were. First we have Andy, who is a 40 year old virgin that lives in what appears to be a toy museum, reads comic books, and works with electronics in the storeroom. Then we have his friends, the pot-smoker, the porn-enthusiast that moons over his ex, and the black guy that cheats on his girlfriend almost constantly. As for the ladies, aside from Trish, they're all pretty one-dimensional. (Ok, maybe Trish and Paula, but I think that's because Jane Lynch was just told to be Jane Lynch)<br/><br/>This movie is supposed to be a comedy. Half the time, I was just weirded out by the circumstances into which Andy's friends dump him. For example, the waxing parlor was cringe-worthy, especially when I noticed there was blood on the places that had been waxed. And Andy's flash backs on why sex isn't an option were *shudders*. <br/><br/>If I disliked the movie so much, why is it still getting a 5? Because despite being given horrible parts, the actors sold those parts as best they could. I liked Catherine Keener's facial expressions, her body language, and her general portrayal as single-mother Trish. And having seen Carell in other roles, I know how well he played that part (because it's quite different from anything else I've seen him in). The movie was also one of the first movie debuts of Kat Dennings, and she's just adorable. I think the acting that put me off was Seth Rogen (who plays the same character he always seems to play) and Paul Rudd (again, same character, different film). <br/><br/>Since the movie is all about Andy's adventures in dating and trying to get laid, there isn't much else to the film. The scenery could be replaced by any generic city in the US and nothing would change. <br/><br/>I'd say skip the movie if sex jokes aren't something you want thrown at you every 2 minutes of a film. However, I would recommend the film to anyone that likes a Seth Rogen film, or to anyone that wants to see Jane Lynch singing a Guatemalan love song (that isn't really a love song)."

","This is one of those dark comedies meant to be outrageous or intentionally absurd. Nerdy Andy (Steve Carrell) who at 40 is still a virgin meets a single mother whom he falls for and is coaxed by his buddies to go after her.<br/><br/>From the sound of the title, it is no doubt that this movie is loaded with crude sexual humor and off-the-chart references. With comedian Steve Carrell in the main role, there is no short supply of silly humor, helped by stupid jokes from his oddball friends, in this film.<br/><br/>Aside from all the sexual references, it is pretty entertaining watching Andy chase after his love interest, and Carrell did a descent acting job.

","If ever there was a one joke film...So as you may have guessed this is all about a dude who is the ripe old age of 40 and has yet to have jiggy jiggy. Just looking at the cast line up and director for this film you know exactly what to expect comedy wise, there's gonna be infantile toilet humour and lots of sexual innuendos.<br/><br/>But wait! its not all like that, its not gone completely down the 'Deuce Bigalow' route, beneath all the visual gags and nerd references there is actually a heart warming rom-com here. The film kicks off as you would expect and its really quite amusing, Carell is perfectly cast as the simple lonely virgin in his amazingly decent and spacious flat, How does he afford that place with the job he's in?!. Naturally Carell's character has been given the stereotypical nerd look, the silly childish way most males would perceive a single middle aged man with no girlfriend. <br/><br/>'Andy's' home is a haven for all sci-fi comic book merchandise geeks everywhere, a treasure trove of collectibles, action figures, boxed action figures, posters etc...the rather over used and clichéd stereotypical view on single guys that might play Dungeons & Dragons too much. Admittedly it is amusing but it does kinda wane quickly to be honest, much like the humour. At first it is funny watching Carell struggle to fit in with his alcohol consuming friends, its probably awkward for most as I'm sure many of us have actually been in that position. Trying to fit in with your mates and not stick out like a sore thumb, we can all relate to these things at some point in our lives and this is why it does hit home and make you cringe and smile at the same time.<br/><br/>Problem was for me it all got very old very fast. The whole infantile college boy type humour, trying to score and pull birds, drinking whilst mocking Andy for the fact he gets more aroused by movie collectibles rather than women (at times). I do like Seth Rogan so that did help along the way, he always comes across like a lunatic about to flip which is hilarious. Thing is once we've had the 'outing' of Andy and the first few attempts to get him laid it just becomes boring.<br/><br/>As we get towards the end of course things get mushy as Andy does find the right woman, they have spats, realise they are meant for each other and eventually naturally become an item, happily ever after. Yeah yeah spoiler alert but who cares, like you can't see that coming a mile off. As for that song n dance routine at the very end...what the hell was that about?!.<br/><br/>5/10"

","I tried Apatow's 'Knocked Up' before, but that turned out to be boringly unfunny, and why Seth Rogen gets any roles is completely beyond me - not exactly a comedy genius, but more like a crew member who slipped onto the set and nobody dared ask what the hell he was doing there. I knew he was in this one, too, but because the lead was played by Steve Carell, I decided to give it chance.<br/><br/>It's been a while since I saw a film that I wanted to turn off at so many moments, but I finished it somehow. A lot like 'K.U.', this is full of supposed to be funny dialogues, feeding off a given that is quite far-fetched, but not unthinkable. But beside the awkwardly unfunny Rogen, Malco and Rudd also had nothing good to bring to this, let alone their terrible lines and characters. Here and there it made me smile though, for instance the drunk driver chick, and near the end the story gets more focus with Andy and Trish, leaving the guy-drivel deservedly behind - though I can't say I liked their dialogues or even their (lack of) chemistry.<br/><br/>2 out of 10, and let's quickly forget about it."

Apparently this doesn't seem to be a quality comedy, but the positive reception had me feel this gap. The first half of the movie is average, with some laughs along the way, but as the time passes The 40 Year Old Virgin keeps getting more boring and uninteresting. Steve Carell's character fortunately is not the ""dork"" one would expect, but as the movie tries to make him believable he just ends up being bland, and you won't really care for him. The movie attempts to be more a less a dramatic comedy, just as the follower Knocked Up did, but it really doesn't succeed. The idea of a 40 year old main character that's still a virgin soon dries up. Then sexual clichés start to appear, the f word starts being overused, and worst of all: moral tries to be taught to the audience. Unfortunately the only fun I had with this was with the characters played by Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd that really play a minor role... Visit the fading cam blog for more!"

If you want to enjoy his work, try ""Seeking a Friend for the End of the World"". His role in this particular film is little more than a buffoon, a Homer Simpson character nowhere near as entertaining as The Simpsons. He's a 40 y/o virgin, and everyone at his blue collar electronics store decides to play jokes on him and make it their personal mission to get him laid.<br/><br/>Catherine Keener is unremarkable to put it mildly.

"ElMaruecan82","9","0","1","21 October 2012"," Never cruel or mean-spirited, sometimes crude and raunchy, but always endearing and heart-warming ...
","""Father of the Bride"", ""Honey I Shrunk the Kids"" or ""The Hangover"" most of the successful comedies originated from simple ideas with great comical potential; you got the original idea just by reading the title. And Judd Appatow's ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is one of these comedies.<br/><br/>Yet, relying on an excellent premise wasn't enough to be considered one of the funniest films of the year. Had the screenplay tried to mock the hero's condition and featured desperate attempts to have sex with a girl, in a sort of cross between ""American Pie"" starring the kind of characters that Adam Sandler could have played, the film would have been 'another mindless sex comedy'. Instead, it's a witty and heart-warming little gem centered on one of the sweetest and most likable characters: Andy, played by Steve Carell. The critical success depended on one factor, simple but vital: the main character and I guess the surprise of ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is even more pleasant when you expect a raunchy slapstick comedy with no heart.<br/><br/>But as soon as we meet Andy, all the suspicions are swept off. He's a bachelor who works in a TV store and after many failures that suspended his trust on his own capacities, he abandoned the idea of ever having sex, and filled his life with toys' collections, virtual games, on-line poker, music and little-figurine paintings. He's not the typical dork with no-life, on the contrary, he has too much life, too many occupations working as time-fillers not to think about sex. He doesn't even compensate through masturbation or pornography, he is not mono-sexual but asexual. But Steve Carrell has a way to incorporate the flaws and the shy mannerisms of Andy with the right balance between charm and pathos. We feel sorry for him but we don't pity him, and never does the rooting process ever stop.<br/><br/>And while the script, written by Appatow and Carell, could have take Andy's personality for granted as a source of gags, the masterstroke came with the peripheral characters, especially Andy's colleagues. David (Paul Rudd), Cal (Seth Rogen) and Jay (Romany Malco) invite Andy for a poker. And the inevitable happens, when invited to share a sex-related memory, Andy loses all credibility when he compares women's tits to bag of sands. This is a cleverly written scene, not just as a pivotal moment but because it's all in the reactions and the way we expect the male conversation to turn to sex, and from sex to the revelation. It's also a very well acted moment, where you can also notice the subtle performance of Rudd, and the way he observes Andy as if he already understood.<br/><br/>The pay-off doesn't work on a comedic but rather on a human level. Cal is happy to learn that Andy is not the creepy 'serial killer' he expected, while Jay doesn't mock him, on the contrary, he believes it's an opportunity to help Andy, not help out of pity, help out of a feeling of true virile camaraderie. The point is that Andy is less a freak than a guy who didn't get his break, and each buddy, guided by his own view of life, elaborates a personal diagnosis and remedy to Andy's condition. Andy should learn to stop putting women (a subtle anatomic metonymy is used) on a pedestal, to go to parties where the drunker a girl is, the easier she'll be to get, all naturally, all these strategies end up failing, providing some hilarious gags in the process.<br/><br/>And it's fitting that they fail, because the point is to provide insights on male perceptions about sex and women but it's only by controlling the situation that Andy has to succeed. And he finally meets Trish, an e-bay vendor working in a neighboring store. Keener delivers a sweet and tender performance as a woman who's not your typical cynical single-mom but rather kept her faith on men, and developed with Andy, a mutual fondness. She sees, like us, something in him. He's a good man who doesn't see sex as an Alpha and Omega, Trish also believes that they should put sex on stand-by, a convenience that naturally satisfies Andy. And that's the core of the film, sex doesn't make happiness like money, but like money, its lack can be handicapping. And Andy's friends welcome the new relationship but still advise him to get a sexual experience not to disappoint Trish. <br/><br/>We know it's inevitable that she'll suspect something, but meanwhile, the film unveils some other aspects on the supporting characters. David can't get over his ex-girlfriend, Jay admits his lacks of self-confidence, the boss, Paula desperately needs sex, this puts their advice into perspective and show that no one is better than Andy. At the end it's just a wonderful and colorful gallery of characters that the film assembles to provide some insights about sex, gender and race, in an adult and never offensive way. Whether it's the staff mocking the two Oriental workers or the unforgettable ""I know why you're gay"" exchange between Rudd and Rogen, the film has a way to take risks and never sounding offensive, quite a performance in our era poisoned by the tyranny of political correctness.<br/><br/>""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" starts with a cruel premise but the treatment of Andy's social handicap is never mean spirited and only works as the occasion to approach sex, and the way it helps or undermine love. It's an endearing love story between two sympathetic characters, and a wonderful casting celebrating in apotheosis the triumph of love through a hilarious musical parody at the end. It's one of the best comedies of the 2000's that didn't get any Golden Globe nomination, not for Carrell, not for Keener, not even one for Best Comedy and that's the only feeling of disappointment the film inspired me."

","Many argue that ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is hilarious or laugh out loud, but I argue otherwise. I will admit that this film had me laughing for the first half-hour to an hour. But after that point, it really just becomes a sappy love story with occasional humorous lines from Rogen and Rudd. Throughout the film, it felt as if it was trying to portray a message about love more than the actual humor. By average comedic standards, this may be worth seeing. But when compared against other Apatow films such as ""Pineapple Express"" or ""Superbad"", it honestly doesn't compare. One of the plus sides was the cast; putting Steve Carrell, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, etc. all in the same film makes it at least moderately humorous. Although this is not one of Carrell's better roles, he still does a decent job for the first half of the film (especially the waxing scene). Seth Rogen always does a good job doing his usual stoner roll and Paul Rudd plays an interesting and humorous character. Probably the biggest downside was the second half. I don't if it it's just me and I should see it again, but after a certain point it becomes closer to a chick flick than it does an Apatow film. I could have done without all of the sappy parts and pretty much Catherine Keener altogether. If you are into heartwarming romances with predictable outcomes at nearly every corner, then go for it. But otherwise, this film has a lifespan of that of your average sitcom. To sum this up, I will definitely say this is NOT one of Apatow's best films and is highly overrated. ""Superbad"" has a similar cast and characters as well humor and it does a much better job at getting the exact same point across without prolonging an dull and sappy ending by over an hour. Overall, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is basically a slightly funnier version of a Jane Austen book."

The virgin of the title is Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell), who is indeed 40, works as an employee at an electronics store and collects vintage action figures, which are displayed all throughout his nice bachelor pad for all to see. He has a lovely home theater system and watches ""Survivor"" with his two kind elderly neighbors. He's a pretty picturesque definition of the Lonely Guy who needs to go out more and talk to more women. Carell plays Andy Stitzer, a middle aged man living a quiet, lonely life. Andy is a little odd, but in an awkward nice guy sort of way. One night, while socializing with his co-workers for the first time, Andy accidentally reveals that he is a virgin. His co-workers, David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco), and Cal (Seth Rogen) initially tease Andy about his situation. The language is filthy, the jokes are (very) crude, and the sex talk is about as graphic as you'll find anywhere. What's amazing, however, is that the movie is still a sweet love story.<br/><br/>The plot is simple. A man is forty years old and he is a virgin. Yet, behind this simple, five second joke, we are given a deep, complex story that is not only one of the funniest you'll ever witness, but has genuine lessons behind it.<br/><br/>We have known Steve Carell, as, in my opinion, one of the best scene thieves of all time. Stealing hilarious scenes from Bruce Almighty and especially Anchorman, Steve Carell has come a long way, as finally, and proudly, is given his moment to shine as the star. No one will forget his name once they witness this pervasively funny, gut-busting, roll-in-the-aisle hilarious comedy.<br/><br/>The 40 Year Old Virgin is two hours of non-stop laughs, a perfect supporting cast and great leads charm the audience through the entire movie. The script was perfect with so many great lines that you will want to see the movie again just to try to remember them all. The music fit the tone of the movie great, and you can tell the director knew what he was doing. All right, here's the deal: if you're easily offended then you might want to stay far, far away from this one. Filled with sex jokes, some nudity, and a lot of language, this movie isn't for everyone. I'm not a big fan of excessive profanity and sex jokes. I find that subtle, clever humor is much more entertaining than about 200 uses of the f-word or frat boy sex discussions. But that's me. Like I said, there are some absolutely hysterical moments here, but you have to ask yourself if they're worth sitting through one of the most vulgar movies you're likely to ever see at the theater. Strangely enough, despite the vulgar words and conduct, there's an admirable moral to the story."
"dogengenjo","10","0","3","3 April 2011"," The Standard for Outrageously Funny Comedies
","The standard for all screenplay writers can be found within the comedy & hilarious hysterical laugh per minute script & film. The writing and acting is second to none. The comedy and some improvisation from Steve Carell, Paul Rudd, and Seth Rogen are second to none. Including all the other supporting actors and actresses as well. The 40 year old Virgin takes a sociological approach in its well written screenplay, as the film has laughs and all types of comedy from black humor to flat, naive humor that occurs in everyday laugh. By doing so, this movie is a definite gut wrenching comedy with hilarious comedy in its screenplay and acting, by all personnel within the film. At times the humor was so intense, when I watched it the second time, I literally fell out of my chair, trying to catch my breathe from the incredible level of every day happenings, with a twist, which allow one to look at life itself, their own lives, and laugh at it. By far the best comedy film of the year it came out. The first viewing I took my Father, Son and 14 year younger brother who was then 38, which made for 4 generations of humor, with all of us, liking every different type of humor. If this movie doesn't make you laugh all throughout it, then your a bore, lacking the ability to laugh or see life in the humorous eye. Steve Carell has a great cast of comedians around him like Seth Rogen & Paul Rudd, yet its Carell who comes out on top as far as the funniest character by far. This movie is so very important to Carells career as it launched his illustrious career full of great films, such as Dinner For Shmuchs. Carell's participation as the main actor, or shared with the actual writer of the Office, which is played by the actor known as Dwight, in the Office. Personally, I am stunned the OFfice lasted beyond its six showings, in which the show is either canceled or revised for a longer contract. The Office actually brings Carell's comedic abilities & spontaneity improvisation with his characters lines, by pulling him down, acting in a TV Show which is below his true abilities, which does Carell no justice at all as far as his abilities to make people laugh. Although at that time right after the release of the 40 yr. old virgin, Carell needed to stay in the publics eye, until he could make more comedy films. Carells true calling is definitely not in The Office, which bland humor written by the character who plays Dwight, is just too far below Carells true abilities as an actor & comedian. Carell can't and has never failed in bring his audience the highest form of laughter & comedy, in all of his films, as in Dinner For Shmucks or any movie he has had a leading role in. The 40 yr. old virgin not only launched Carells future, it brought him a lot of movie acting offers, of which he is being written out of the TV show The Office, so he can dedicate his work time to making movies full time. Bravo Steve, for making such outstanding movies. This is a must see, with all forms of comedy, from dry wit, to black humor, slapstick, all other forms, including the most important, it leaves us with a sense there is humor in every aspect of life, no matter how messy life is. Bravo, 10 stars out of ten. I've got to mention Rogen tho' as being one of the best comedy writers of his time. Whatever he touches turns to gold. As does Carell in all of his films, this one, I would say is my favorite."
"oneguyrambling","9","0","3","19 November 2010"," The best and funniest sex comedy of the last decade.
","It's pretty easy to describe the plot of this film. There is a guy. He is aged 40. He has not yet had sex.<br/><br/>Am I going to fast for you to keep up? No different to dozens of cinematic abortions that pass for teenage sex-comedies: American Pie, Road Trip, Everyone Must Get Laid Before Graduating 3, Hey Smell My Finger etc only the age of the protagonist has changed, meaning he must deal with different circumstances and impediments than the typical horny teen.<br/><br/>(I'm not saying that there is no place for teen sex-comedies, only that once you are no longer in the target demographic I find it hard to root (so to speak) for the generally loathsome guy to get the hot blond chick. (The Girl Next Door is the only notable example of a smart sex-comedy for a few years.) The 40 YOV also launched several careers, notably Steve Carell (though this is still his high point unfortunately), Seth Rogen (heavily faux-tatted here), Jonah Hill (in a bit role before Superbad) and Paul Rudd as a go-to comedy guy, (he NEVER gets I Love You, Man or Role Models without this, let alone Forgetting Sarah Marshall).<br/><br/>Furthering the plot description. Andy is the titular virgin, an ultra-nice guy who works in the back office of an electronics store, he is conservative, shy and keeps to himself in a home that only a teen-who-won-lotto would consider normal. Let's just say that computer games, karaoke, comic books, action figures and ""army men"" are prevalent in Andy's after-hours activity.<br/><br/>He also rides a bicycle everywhere - and this guy can't pull the ladies!?! One evening in a poker game it comes to light that Andy is somewhat inexperienced and his workmates set about remedying that situation, not realizing that Andy is basically happy with his circumstances and aside from the normal bodily urges has no overriding desire to change who he is, (or who he does).<br/><br/>The remainder of the movie sees Andy have misadventures with drunk women, chat up techniques, speed dating, workplace relations, transvestite call- ""girls"", male grooming and of course self-lovin'.<br/><br/>After a time though he coincidentally meets a woman who works nearby, (played by Catherine Keener in the only straight role in the film) and the two start dating, leading to the inevitable ""next step"" decision.<br/><br/>So I guess The 40 YOV is a non-teen, non-sex comedy for the most part, although it does have as much crude humour as you can poke a ""big box o' porn"" at, and does have various nipple sightings along the way.<br/><br/>One thing it is though is funny. Funnier than every film (excluding Hey Smell My Finger, that was genius!) listed above combined.<br/><br/>The reason for that? The premise is amusing but will only take you so far, the primary reason is that the cast interact in a believable way for the most part, and you actually can see most of the events here happening, but the banter, teasing and ad-libbing that fills every scene here is always amusing and frequently hilarious.<br/><br/>Because early on in the film Judd Apatow chose to go just a little further with character development than normal comedies, we know how each of the four main workmates will react: Andy (Carrell) – Conservative. Will sheer away from confrontation or ""adult situations"".<br/><br/>Cal (Rogen) – Pothead backroom guy. A pervert.<br/><br/>Jay (Romany Malco) – Not the token black guy but an ""urban"" presence nonetheless, a habitual cheater always looking for an angle with the ladies.<br/><br/>David (Rudd) – Acts like he is newly single but in fact has been for 2 years after a brief relationship.<br/><br/>The four guys share most of the first half of the film together and are responsible for almost every laugh in the film, they banter and tease one another in a totally realistic way, and even the step too far ""You know how I know you're gay"" bit is almost replicated by thousands of straight guys in normal conversation on a daily basis.<br/><br/>By the way, it doesn't go too far in any homophobic way, they just kept the joke going too long until the laughs ran out.<br/><br/>This movie is actually to blame for dozens of sh*tty comedies made in recent years, and also indirectly for Will Ferrell's success, as the ad-libbing element that worked so well here has been done to death. Here ad-libbing means ""just keep the scene going until you run out of stuff, then we'll move on and in the edit I'll keep the funniest take. Nowadays it is ""Let's see what inane description Will Ferrell can yell this time, before he runs out of ideas and simply takes his clothes off. Again."" Surely that is still hilarious? The strength of The 40 Year Old Virgin is that the film keeps moving, Apatow wisely keeps the plot moving and allows the actors and the action to create the laughs. There are many scenes that still are funny the 4th or 5th time around, the dialogue is at times gross without overstepping, and the bit parts (MOOJ!!) add to the comedy even if they do little for the plot.<br/><br/>Oh, and it helps that you actually want Andy to do well for himself. So much so that by the end when he is faced with two distinct choices (one a hot young Elizabeth Banks in a spa just gagging for it no less!) you want him to choose the right one.<br/><br/>Even if you absolutely would not in the same circumstances. Final Rating – 9 / 10. Probably my favourite comedy of the last decade, smart, charming, gross, and hilarious, all in the proper proportions.<br/><br/>If you liked this review (or even if you didn't) check out oneguyrambling.com"

","I think this was the movie that changed comedies and the way we see them now. Ever since this movie, there have been comedies similar to this that came out and I pretty much liked them all. But this is the one that started it all. Steve Carell also got famous due to this movie.<br/><br/>This is about what the title says. It's about a 40-year-old who never had sex before and is afraid to commit. But things get interesting when he sees the love of his life. Also he has to deal with crazy crap from his co worker buddies.<br/><br/>The acting is pretty good. Steve Carell was pretty funny and I loved the chest waxing scene. I also enjoyed the performances of Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd.<br/><br/>Overall, I thought this was a decent comedy. They made better over the next few years but this was still a good one. I rate this film 8/10."
"danjakubik","8","0","1","5 October 2010"," A comedy done with charm and sweetness
","""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" / 2005 / Directed by: Judd Apatow / Written by: Judd Apatow and Steve Carell<br/><br/>* * * Good<br/><br/>I like and admire Judd Apatow's story telling style. I was impressed, more than expected for this film. Most Hollywood comedies are ""by the numbers"", juvenile and predictable, best appreciated by adolescents or adolescent minded adults.<br/><br/>This sex comedy, would seem to be yet another mediocre and immature Hollywood comedy, however, director/co-writer Apatow, shows some honesty and insight into human nature and relationships between the sexes. Sometimes ordinary comedy, sometimes special, the film does have moments of genuine charm and sweetness.<br/><br/>This is only the 2nd Apatow film I've ever seen. first was: ""Knocked Up, 2007"". Both films share a lot in common, showing Apatow's signature style. Apatow is good at writing a variety of interesting and relate-able characters and being truthful about the insecurities of dating, sex and heterosexual relationships. Comedian and co-writer Steve Carell does a good job at portraying this sexually repressed, adolescent minded virgin middle aged man.<br/><br/>The story setup of the main character is a little overdone, attempting to show the nerdy life of a 40 year old man stuck in adolescence, with his collection of childhood toys and addiction to video games still with him. Overall, the film is a works, as it balances comedy, honesty, charm and sweetness, which are Apatow's talent and trademark."
"kenjha","7","0","1","28 September 2010"," Amusing but Overlong
","The title says it all. Unfortunately, the filmmakers choose to belabor the point, taking nearly two hours to milk the concept for all it's worth. As a general rule, comedies should be closer to 90 minutes than two hours. There isn't enough material here to support such a long running time, spreading the joke thin. The film is intermittently amusing, thanks mostly to Carrell. The actor brings not only humor but also some humanity to the title role, overcoming Apatow's penchant for focusing on raunchiness and sophomoric comedy. Keener, a terrific actress who has been criminally underused in films, plays the woman who has the opportunity to rid our hero of his distinctive affliction."
"bobbylabonte18","10","0","4","8 September 2010"," The 40 Year Old Virgin: Crude, Funny, and a Must See
","The 40 Year Virgin is one of those titles where if you've seen the film will think of humor, sex and almost everything else but hardcore logic. Steve Carell plays Andy, the 40 year old virgin completely at peace with his life until co workers played by Seth Rogan, Paul Rudd and Romany Malco. After this discovery, his workplace begins a buzz, and it comes to the attention of Paula played by Jane Lynch, who has had attraction to Andy and gives him a little teasing on the side. One day after meeting an assortment of women, he meets Trish played by the always wonderful Catherine Keener, to whom he keeps this secret and keeps her daughter from losing her virginity. In this film, you have raunchy humor mixed with heartfelt storytelling. If the jokes weren't crude and the story wasn't so heartfelt, The 40 Year Old Vrigin wouldn't be the movie it is."
"mohoku","10","0","3","5 August 2010"," Something to remind you that you're not alone in this world!
","I just saw this movie for the first time in like 5 years so basically ever since it came out in theaters and I was also younger and forgot about all the little clever details and all the funny great jokes it had.<br/><br/>The first thing I love about this movie is the cast! The cast has great comedic actors, guys like Paul Rudd who was great on friends and was depressingly funny in this movie. Then you have Seth Rogen and I love his style of dark comedy but at the same time of putting it out there in your face to notice. Then of course Steve Carell who has this way of becoming the character and really making him a funny guy who everybody loves, and not just in this movie many others as well. Then of course you got Catherine Keener who really works well with Carell and Elizabeth Banks who I realized from other movies and the show 30 Rock she doesn't care what she does on screen, she does it because she wants to be great at it and she was freakishly good at being the freaky book girl. Jonah hill comes up for like 5 minutes and is hilariously awkward and of course Jane Lynch who's sort of the female version of Seth Rogen and is really funny especially here and in Glee.<br/><br/>What I also enjoyed about the movie is how it started right away, like it didn't take a while to explain whats going on, it just gave it you right away to understand how Andy(Steve Carell) was a lonely guy and then he gets invited and the rest of the guys try to help him and it keeps going, it doesn't get stuck in one place it evolves and really shows over the course of the weeks how he gets more confident and eventually has to deal with admitting to his date that he's a virgin also the ending was great how every guy sort of kept going their own issues even if there was like 20 minutes where it was all about Andy and then you see how things seem to come around good for everyone which is touching and also funny."
"Bravesfan17","8","0","1","22 May 2010"," Judd Apatow is a brilliant writer & director
","Writer-director Judd Apatow in his directing debut shows a nice heartfelt story with a good message, something that has now become a trademark of his. Steve Carell is in his first leading role as Andy Stitzer, and electronic salesman who has never gotten laid, hence the title. He ends up telling his work buddies (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and Romany Malco) and they figure out that he is a virgin. His buddies make it their mission to get Andy laid, while Andy is trying to find the right girl.<br/><br/>Andy meets many girls, but none of them seem right. He meets one who is a crazy drunk (played by Apatow's wife Leslie Mann). He meets one at a bookstore who is downright crazy (played by Elizabeth Banks). He meets others who don't seem right. Then he meets Trish (played wonderfully by Catherine Keener). Once Andy starts dating Trish, he feels that she is the right girl for him. Andy then keeps trying to get Trish to have sex with him until a conflict comes up. Instead of just wanting to have sex with Trish, Andy falls in love with her and takes their relationship seriously, when he reveals his love to her the feeling is mutual.<br/><br/>Apatow knows how to tell a story and send out a good message, despite the content in language. He shows us that there is no too late or too old to fins love. Carell and Keener are great together and give believable performances. Apatow wrote this script with Carell, and they know how to make every part have a reason to be in the movie."
"moviesleuth2","7","0","2","5 April 2010"," A romantic comedy that's actually funny and romantic
","In general, romantic comedies tend to be successful because of their ability to generate laughter. This is because most movies are cast because of their star-power, not whether the actors have chemistry with each other. So when a movie comes along that actually makes us care about the characters' relationship (and I mean really care, not just for the sake of the story), people take notice. While Judd Apatow's 2005 film can boast a few funny scenes, it's the romance between the two central characters that really takes this movie to the next level.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell) is an all around nice-guy. He's a little geeky, but a good soul. However, he's 40 years old, and he's never gotten laid...ever. So his co-workers make it a mission to get him some action. Meanwhile, he's attracted to a GILF (grandmother I'd like to...you know) named Trish (Catherine Keener). But will she be turned off by a guy who's never had sex (and will obviously be pretty bad at it the first time)? <br/><br/>Steve Carell become really popular because of the success of ""The Office,"" a show that I hate. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" still has a lot of understated humor, but unlike ""The Office,"" this movie is funny. Carrell is the perfect choice for Andy because he's so geeky that you can't help but like the guy. He's a nerd, but also nice and genuine. His romantic interest, Catherine Keener, is delightful. Keener is so natural in the role that it's hard to believe that this is a performance. It doesn't take long for the audience to realize that these two belong together. His co-workers, Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, and especially Romany Malco are pretty funny as the guys who are egging him on. However, the funniest moments have to go to Gerry Bedknob, who has some hysterical scenes.<br/><br/>Judd Apatow redefined comedy for the 2000's. His trademarks are understated one-liners and raunchy jokes (although I am at a loss to understand why this nearly got an NC-17 rating...it's all talk, and none of it is especially graphic). In general, I'm not a fan of understated humor. Humor has to be energetic, almost manic. The Farrelly brothers got that, Chris Farley got that, but Judd Apatow doesn't. That's not to say that this is a waste; there's some funny stuff here (like the Date-a-palooza scene), but a lot of the stuff just isn't as funny as it should be. What Apatow should be congratulated for is making the romance work. Many romantic comedies spend so much time on the jokes and forget that we're supposed to want the characters to end up together. Apatow remembers this and that's the most effective part of the movie.<br/><br/>Funny, romantic, and endearing, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a good movie, plain and simple."
"dicksosa","9","0","3","13 March 2010"," A great movie anytime
","Full of one-liners and hilarious scenes ""The 40-year old virgin"" is a comedy that delivers. Andy (Steve Carell) has managed to go through life with one mishap after another and as the title implies has ended up a virgin still at age 40. In this day and age with sex as pervasive as it is in our culture it's surprising to think that someone could end up at 40 a virgin if they didn't actually choose a life of chastity as an ordained minister or nun. The film is ultimately a romantic film about love and the relationship that we are all looking for. As part of the film's message that sex definitely complicates a relationship we get to witness the amusing dating that takes place when sex has been moved off the table. Full of a cast of supporting talent; Cathrine Keener, Seth Rogan, Paul Rudd, and others the film is a continuous crack up throughout. Yet it still remains sincere in it's message and depiction of what really is involved in a loving relationship and courtship. Although there is crude humor this is a perfect date movie anytime as men and women will both enjoy it equally."
"JessPumpkQueen","9","0","2","14 December 2009"," Better than it looked in the commercials
","I avoided watching this movie for a long time, because the commercials frankly gave me the impression that this was going to be another sex comedy, when, in fact, it is actually a nice story.<br/><br/>Part of what makes this movie great is that Carell's character is very likable. Carell's ability to play grotesque characters straight comes through very well here. It makes Andy seem very easy to sympathize with, and makes the viewer hope for the best for him. While I don't imagine that his so-called ""problem"" is the norm, I would assume that it's not as rare as people think, especially for someone as socially awkward as this character. Yet, despite (or perhaps because of) his nerdy demeanor and his social awkwardness, he's hard not to like. He is particularly sympathetic compared to the jerks who try to take him under their wing. Seriously, if the nicest guy in your group of friends stalks his ex-girlfriend, you need to find better people to hang out with.<br/><br/>I also enjoyed the ending, where the film reaches the conclusion that his virginity wasn't a curse, and that it was worth it because he eventually met the right person. I liked this message because they don't beat you over the head with an overt moral message, but instead it's just kind of something that makes sense for this particular character. It's kind of a cute ending for a movie that has such twisted humor throughout the whole thing. This is the kind of comedy I like: twisted humor, but an overall good story.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a good movie that I will definitely watch again."
"Electrified_Voltage","8","0","1","30 September 2009"," Another crude and funny sex-crazed comedy
","Just like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is an R-rated romantic comedy that was released in 2005 and turned out to be a box office success. I wasn't too interested in either of them during their theatrical run, but I stated in my review of WC that it was highly recommended to me in early 2006. At the same time, I was told this film, starring Steve Carell, was also a must-see. So, I watched this for the first time shortly after my first viewing of the other crude 2005 comedy, and I think I found it to be the superior of the two, though neither of them was bad. Giving both films a second viewing over three years later, they both improved, as films sometimes do with more than one viewing, and now I can say more confidently that both are funny, especially this one.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer is forty years old and single, living alone with a collection of toy action figures and comic books. He doesn't own a car and rides his bike instead. He works at an electronics store called Smart Tech. One day, several of his co-workers invite him to a game of poker, since they have nobody else to invite. During the game, they figure out that Andy has never had sex, as much as he tries not to let them know, and Cal, Jay, and David soon begin to help him try and lose his virginity. However, despite their efforts, they can't seem to succeed in helping their co-worker. The nerdy electronics store employee finally falls in love when a woman around his age named Trish comes into Smart Tech as a customer and talks to him. Across the street from the electronics store, she runs a business where sells people's unwanted stuff on eBay. Unfortunately, Andy's troubles aren't over yet, as Trish also has secrets.<br/><br/>I couldn't remember all of this film from the first viewing, and that includes the part around the beginning with Cal talking to Andy about a woman ""f&%*in' a horse."" I'm sure a visual presentation of that would have been revolting, but the character just talking about it made me laugh. Mooj and Haziz, two argumentative Indian employees of Smart Tech, have some really funny lines, though just about everyone in the movie does. There are so many memorably funny parts, such as David complaining to the boss, Paula, about the Michael McDonald DVD always playing in the store, Andy in a car with Nicky, a drunk driver (even when she throws up on him, as nasty as it is), Andy on the phone with Trish, unable to tell her who he really is, so she mistakes him for a telemarketer, a lot of conflict amongst various Smart Tech employees, etc. There are way too many to mention! The funniest part is perhaps the chest hair removal scene, which really cracked me up both times I saw it! The film doesn't have the greatest plot, but there are so many good gags, and some likable characters (including the lead one), that it doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>Yes, ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" is a comedy that many people would hate. The crude sex jokes pretty much just keep coming throughout the film, it's quite immature, and as one would probably expect with an R-rated comedy like this, there's also a lot of swearing. I don't mind these things, but obviously, a lot of people do, and they may believe that anyone who likes this type of humour must have something severely wrong with them. The film is not for those who are easily offended and can't stand political incorrectness in comedy. It's obviously not meant to be taken seriously, though many viewers obviously have anyway. This probably includes many politically correct extremists, for whom I cannot feel any sympathy. However, if you don't take it too seriously and you're willing to laugh at crude, immature sex jokes for two hours, there's a good chance this R-rated 2005 romantic comedy blockbuster is for you."

","When The 40 Year Old Virgin came out in 2005, it was a big deal. No one expected people for it to be as funny as it was, and it introduced the world to Judd Apatow and his gang. Apatow would go on to direct better movies, but this was a solid film directorial debut for him.<br/><br/>The reason this movie works so well is because it is so raunchy and crude, but at the same time sweet and heartfelt, and it takes a strong talent to make those two aspects come together in a believable way. Apatow is the one to pull this off, and he does it quite well.<br/><br/>The characters are strong and believable, and this is what makes the film work. Andy, played by Steve Carell, is a 40 year old man who lives by himself and has never had sex. He is quite nerdy and lives in his own world, spending his nights singing karaoke to Word Up. He meets Trish, played by Catherine Keener. She works at the store across from Andy's, and the two fall in love. At first all Andy wants to do is get in her pants, but once she puts on a no sex rule, the relationship aspect comes out, and he starts caring more about her than the sex. It plays out well, and becomes quite cute and heartfelt as the movie goes on.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is good, consisting of the now famous Seth Rogen and Paul Rudd. They play Andy's immature buddies who gode him on to have sex. They add something nice to the story, but it is Andy (and Steve Carell) that outshines his supporting group.<br/><br/>The writing is sharp and witty, the only downbeat part of it being that it could be quite long. At 133 minutes, the film drags in a few areas, and some of the scenes could be considered too long and painful to watch, such as the scene where Jay and Mooj battle over commission. It is long and unneeded, and some scenes in the film scream editing.<br/><br/>The only part of the movie that needs working on is the length, but apart from that, the characters are full and rich and the story progresses into a more heartfelt vehicle than it started out as. It is fun and enjoyable to watch as the characters go on, but Apatow would outdo himself in his next project."

The problems between Carell's and Keener's characters are dragged out just a bit. <br/><br/>Great performances from Carrell, Keener, Rudd and Rogan and from the rest of the excellent supporting cast. <br/><br/>My favourite bits? -The waxing scene - (of course) - Jonah Hill trying to buy the platform heeled shoes in the eBay shop - The Age of Aquarius number over the closing credits"

","Judd Apatow's THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN has a premise which is utterly ridiculous, a story utterly preposterous and a cast utterly hilarious.<br/><br/>Steve Carell is Andy, the eponymous FYOV, enjoying his bachelorhood working at an electronics store by day, painting action figures and playing video games by night. After Andy's friends discover he is a virgin, in a priceless scene played to the hilt by Carell (where he describes breasts as sandbags and offers fake sexploits on the strength of overhearing other people's war stories) they do the only thing good friends should do for a virgin buddy - take him out to a nightclub to try and get him laid.<br/><br/>When Andy meets Trish from the store across the street, (Catherine Keener in MILF mode) he starts dating her on the proviso that they don't have sex until their 20th date, under the pretense that waiting makes it special and worthwhile, but in reality because he is too scared to have sex on accounta being a Forty Year Old Virgin.<br/><br/>Yes, we've all been there at one time - virginity, that is, not 40 - and it was never this funny; wondering just how to cross that bridge and lay that pipe. (Even I, the King-Of-Porn Cucumber, was once close-mouthed about my sex life because I didn't want to get embarrassed; now I'm close-mouthed about my sex life because I don't want to get arrested...) <br/><br/>The movie rides on the back of its supporting cast: Paul Rudd, Romany Malco, Seth Rogen, Elizabeth Banks, Jane Lynch - and Gerry Bednob as Mooj, the resident East Indian with the priceless accent and inappropriate crassness. These workmates and buddies are all so eccentric and so game (coupled with Apatow's laid-back, improv directorial style) that we never quite anticipate what quotable gem they're gonna spew next. (""You're putting the pussy on a pedestal, the Pusilaya,"" ""You framed an Asia poster? How hard did the people at the frame store laugh when you brought this in?"" ""I will pray for your cock."" ""Today's forecast? Dark and cloudy, and chance of drive-by."")<br/><br/>Ultimately, THE 40 YEAR OLD VIRGIN fails because it ends up doing what every ""romantic comedy"" does: lean towards the propaganda that Marriage & Kids is what we're all aiming towards. Tragedy that Andy gets married to the first chick he plonks. For all the sex he's gonna get now, he might as well be a 40 year old virgin again.<br/><br/>--Review by Poffy The Cucumber (for Poffy's Movie Mania)."

The performances are believable and hilarious you i couldn't help but laugh my ass off! The film also has a very good message in how important or not important sex really is.

","The 40-Year-Old Virgin is one of those independent films that comes along, every so often, and becomes a hit. A few years ago it was My Big Fat Greek Wedding that was a surprise hit, and a few years before that it was The Blair Witch Project. This film is superior to both of those earlier films, and has more in common with another sleeper film that predated both of those films, 1998's Office Space, which was one of the first films to flop theatrically, yet become a big hit on the then-new DVD format. The 40-Year-Old Virgin shares a similar sensibility toward the dullness of the work environment (this time a Circuit City/Best Buy like electronics store vs. a computer programming company, but its satire of the workplace is dead on.<br/><br/>The difference between The 40-Year-Old Virgin and Office Space, however, is that the bulk of the newer film focuses on the personal lives of its lead character and his co-workers David (Paul Rudd)- who's stalking his ex-girlfriend, Jay (Romany Malco)- a black, bald Lothario, and Cal (Seth Rogen)- an ugly, bearded wannabe novelist, who make it their mission to get him laid at any cost. Andy Stitzer (Steve Carell, of Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgundy and the NBC TV show The Office) is a collector of 'action figures' from the 1970s and 1980s (such as The Six Million Dollar Man's boss, Oscar Goldman), avid Survivor watcher, along with an old black neighbor, has a framed Asia rock poster, a ton of video games, and has somehow never managed to get laid in his four decades, although he's come close. Any male who has pined for females that he never got to be with will be able to relate to Andy's dilemma- if not to the extent of Andy's angst, certainly the gist of it. His co-worker's advice ranges from the bad to the ridiculous, as each of them could easily be termed loser, as well. He agrees to go out with his pals, and ends up being puked on by a gorgeous, but drunken blond named Nicky (Leslie Mann), who nearly gets them both killed with her driving. He then hits on Beth (Elizabeth Banks), a sexpot at the local bookstore, and succeeds in getting her interested. That's when he meets a sexy and kind divorced grandmother named Trish (Catherine Keener), who runs an EBay store at the same mall where Andy's store isÂ…. It's a chick flick for guys, in a sense, yet better for it. Watch this film at least once every year or two, and it'll never get old, for there always have been and always will be Andy Stitzers. That's a damned good thing!"

","I recently write in my comment for Get Smart (Peter Segal, 2008) that I do found funny Steve Carell but not that funny to get me excited every time he has a new film so I never has real desires to watch Get Smart on the big screen (eventually I do watch it). A similar thing happened to me with this film, back in 2005 when it was released in my country, so I never saw The 40 Year Old Virgin on the big screen but I heard some good things about it and also read in this site good things about it so I had some desires to give it a chance but still wasn't the very first option. I have to mention Get Smart again because after founding a very funny Carell on that film I finally decided to watch this comedy and it was a very good decision.<br/><br/>Well, Andy (Steve Carell) is the mentioned virgin and a worker of an electronics store, a collector of toys and obviously the kind of shy guy who never has a real contact with his partners at work that in this case are Jay (Romany Malco), Cal (Seth Rogen) and David (Paul Rudd). Quickly, during a poker match, the three friends knows Andy's secret ad the first part of the film is just a hilarious search for Andy's first sexual experience, of course with the help of Jay, Cal and David. Trish Piedmont (Catherine Keener) is the woman in who Andy has a real interest but still the guy needs just sex and following the many different advices of his friends he believes that he is not ready for Trish. Finally meeting really Trish makes a kind of more serious movie thanks to this ""serious"" relationship but is still hilarious and again bad luck, karma or whatever but again when sex is near for Andy something always happens. In this case the 16 years old daughter of Trish (Kat Dennings) appears in Andy's life and his relation with Trish turns better but they will have sex till the 20th date. This part has a scene that definitely is not the funniest one of the entire movie but the situation in that scene is the funniest one of the movie. Imagine a 16 years old girl and a 40 years old man together in a orientation meeting about sex and both with a lot of desires to have their first sexual experience, both interested about the meeting and both considered liars when both confess their virginity. Great scene. The conclusion is even kind of sweet and of course is a really happy ending for Andy and in consequence for Trish and with the help of some expensive toys they are a very happy couple.<br/><br/>Cast: Steve Carell is simply terrific and perhaps this is his best work till now. The group of friends is hilarious, even with their simple conclusion, and Malco, Rogen and Rudd are very good. To mention the character of Gerry Bednob, Mooj, that is one of the funniest things of the film. Nothing to write about Catherine Keener apart that she is a great actress and that she has been part of terrific films, my favourites with her are Being John Malkovich (Spike Jonze, 1999) and Living in Oblivion (Tom DiCillo, 1995).<br/><br/>Conclusion: I expected a very funny film but still this was a really pleasant surprise since comedies from the Apatow productions don't looked very interesting to me (with the exception of Walk Hard) and after watching Drillbit Taylor they looked less interesting. Well I really enjoyed this comedy, the unrated version (133 minutes), and I think is time to finally watch Superbad and Knocked Up, after all the hype."

","At first I was a bit unsure whether I should see this film after reading some comments that it contains lots of crude jokes. However,after finish watching, I found that The 40-year-old Virgin is not rude at all, although it's filled with all the sex talks and some graphic nudity. The movie has a point and delivers it well. It doesn't make fun or look down on virgins. It shows us that it's OK for a person to wait and have sex with the one he really loves. Sex comes with love can be a more fulfilling experience. It doesn't judge or preach that this is a way everyone should be, just saying that this lifestyle is possible and we shouldn't make fun of those people who choose this way.<br/><br/>I think Steve Carell did an excellent job. He and Keener have good chemistry. I like the team who play his friends as well.<br/><br/>To summarize, this is one of the best comedies I recommend to both the virgins and the non-virgins. Anyone who wants a good laugh but doesn't want to watch a funny but stupid movie. Trust me, this film has a gut. I really admire the way they take this theme and make it an effective comedy.

It's something that seems down to earth and very funny that most can relate to that's relationships of finding the right one and sex. Only this comedy is a tale of a man that's a 40 year old virgin! You must say how sad and awful, but it's happened I'm sure. You have Steve Carell as Andy Stitzer a nice and shy loner type who can be described as a hard working electronics sales clerk, yet he's a nerd who loves his action figure collection(which his life is built around)and he spends most of his time playing video games and reading comics. Then one night over a game of poker with friends it's revealed he's a virgin! It's so apparent when he compares a females breast to feeling like a bag of sand now how funny! Andy must then go thru torture and shame from friends and co-workers, they try everything to get him to score by taking him to bars to try and pick up sluts and drunks to dating games to just about everything. Then finally he meets a hot and attractive grandmother(played by Catherine Keener) and it first seems so odd, but slowly and surely a relationship develops finally it turns to a pleasure and satisfying end! Really the gags and crudeness of talk don't take away from the film it's entertaining and funny very memorable scenes are the chest waxing, and the scene of Andy's struggles with how to put on a condom! You as the viewer also feel compassion and happiness for a lonely character of Andy's to finally score but more importantly find life long love. Really a great comedy with plenty of laughs even though raunchy the compassion and emotions overrides and produces a memorable comedy. Great acting from Steve Carell and well done and written by Judd Apatow."

","Steve Carrell's charming and believable. The supporting cast is as mature as my college buddies and I were. The movie's pretty entertaining... for the first 20 minutes.<br/><br/>It would've been great if its running time had been cut down substantially, but it just drags on (and on and on), running on the same immature jokes, which get old extremely quick, albeit hilarious the first time. Many have warned those who are easily offended, but someone needs to also warn those who are easily bored by monotony. Case in point: when a shocking joke is told ten times, it ceases to be shocking.<br/><br/>Like ""Knocked Up,"" Judd Apatow's films, for some reason, are filled with hype and redundancy. Carrell did a great job with what I describe as a circular script; Keener likewise was at her best, and it's her performance that makes me wonder whether it was the one factor that carried the script throughout this unnecessarily dragged-out movie.<br/><br/>I won't even get started on the ending because that alone merits a -1 star."

","This movie did not impress me the first time I saw it. However, it took multiple times for me to watch it to appreciate the humor and in conclusion this movie is a piece of comic genius, not only for the puns, punch lines, and one liners; but for the way it accurately portrays each personality type depicted through each character. Andy (our hero played by Steve Carrell) represents innocence and integrity, and is portrayed with naivity, fear, and curiosity. Many kids 16-30 can not only relate to one of the many characters, but ultimately know other people who do as well. None of the characters are mean-spirited or necessarily ""bad people"", but each have a varying sense of morality. Additionally, the situations are real to life and modern day singles can relate to the material as well as the characters. What's scary is that many of these scenes are improvised, and some of the best jokes that have been used in the movie and DVD outtakes are on the fly. Many of the one liners can be heard repeated throughout college campuses everywhere. In conclusion, this movie is a diamond in the ruff and takes a unique personality to appreciate."

Among the standouts: The Joboxers' irresistible ""Just Got Lucky""; the 1970s pop version of ""Jesu Joy"" (anyone else find this a welcome flashback via ""Boogie Nights""?); and the main theme from ""Hair"".<br/><br/>Bottom line: Definitely watchable, rentable, and watchable-again.

My older sister (23) loved it. All my friends loved it, too.<br/><br/>The film stars Golden Globe Winner Steve Carell in a breakout role as Andy Stitzer, your every day nice guy who is 40 and has yet to consummate in a relationship. He reveals it sort of accidentally while playing poker with a few co-workers. Soon, Jay, Cal (Seth Rogen), and David (Paul Rudd) will attempt to get Andy laid, hooking trying to hook him up with a crazy drunk girl (Leslie Mann) and a sexy bookstore employee (Elizabeth Banks). But all this doesn't matter to Andy, for he has found a woman that he's infatuated with: entrepreneur Trish (2006 Oscar Nominee Catherine Keener), a gorgeous single GRANDmother who's business will amuse us. Andy and Trish eventually begin to date, and we see how their relationship is affected by Andy's big secret and his desire to not tell her.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is off the wall hilarious, especially Seth Rogen. This is also a breakout film for him, and he'll be remembered for a while as 'that big, funny guy from The 40 Year Old Virgin'. Of course, the film's success rides on Carell's shoulders, and he is just awesome. He makes Andy such a likable character, and throws in the occasional joke. Most of the humor comes from the supporting cast. Even Catherine Keener has some really funny lines, like when Andy calls her, but doesn't tell her it's him, and she thinks he's a telemarketer. That quick little exchange is really funny. Also a nice surprise is Jane Lynch as Andy's boss, who offers to be a special friend with Andy.<br/><br/>What makes this film so warm-hearted is it's light humor, yet raunchy and hilarious moments. They are all gelled together so well, and it makes the film great. The only downside to the film is that it is far too long for a comedy. The unrated version (which, had it been in theaters, it would have easily been rated NC-17) is even longer, almost 2 hrs. and 20 mins. It is because of this that the movie does drag a bit, but Carell manages to keep it interesting the whole way. The ending is excellent as well. The 40 Year Old Virgin is a comedy cult classic, with stupid, smart, and raunchy humor wrapped around the core that is a great romantic comedy. It's a film you'll watch again and again, just as I have.<br/><br/>8/10 --spy"

","One of the last great taboos left in this world must be virginity, and dare i say, especially male virginity. Often a man's measure is in the sex stories told in poker nights, just as wisely suggested in the movie. The reactions of the characters to Andy's virginity is, if comedic on purpose, still realistic. Andy's ventures into the world of sex have been described with the intention to make us laugh, but incredibly enough, with a certain kind of a respect that does not become cheesy at any point.<br/><br/>Steve Carell's first lead is a success, and the supporting cast is top notch as well. I would agree, Catherine Keener is hot grandma :), Paul Rudd is very funny as always and the little more unknown supporting group did a good job. The Pakistani/Indian jokes are kind of starting to wear out now, though. The best jokes, in my opinion, are put to the table during the first hour of the movie. The second hour is more about delivering the plot and the message. The love story is all too familiar despite the subject, and the certain awkwardness of that familiarity is my biggest minus for The 40 Year Old Virgin. The biggest plusses are actually earned in the 'meaningless but hilarious' scenes (as often in comedies), which the film is full of. This time the winner is the the guy in the 'We sell all our stuff on EBay' store trying to buy the crazy shoes. T40YOV seems to somewhat reach for the same feel good, if anarchist atmosphere of Office Space, but in the end does not quite climb up there.<br/><br/>Recommended for people with normal+ brain capacity who enjoy silly comedies rather than/in between serious drama.<br/><br/>rating: 6/10 - good light entertainment"

In that manner is was surprisingly insightful and was pretty good-natured.<br/><br/>The profanity and the brief nudity was to be expected, so I would question why anyone would go into this type of movie and be surprised. If I had to make a criticism of the movie was it's length. I remember specifically asking my wife what the DVD counter stated at what stage we were at in the movie, and I was shocked that we were only at the 90 minutes mark! I chalk some of this up to the fact that it was the extended version. But still, by the end, we were both commenting about how the joke was starting to run out of steam. I compare it to one of the SNL skits that start off strong, but the writer doesn't know when or how to end it. In this case I think that the writers had so many ideas in their head, they felt like they had to get them all in the picture.<br/><br/>I would recommend this movie to most people that I know, so as long as they avoid the extended version."

","Although it's quite a novelty to see the character of Andy, the virgin who's 40 years old, depicted as a nice and likable guy this movie is fairly one-dimensional all the way. In the instances that a male virgin is the subject they're usually weird and repulsive in some way, so Andy's character comes as refreshingly original. In some ways he's peculiar; his collection of toys and posters etc. but the film doesn't go overboard in that area. I can imagine that this rite of passage can seem like a mountain to climb if delayed too long, and in Andy's case it might just seem like an impossible task. Relatively late bloomers (say; just over 20) are nervous but how on earth would it be if you're 40.<br/><br/>The film has some hilarious moments when focusing on Andy and his ever mounting fear of his impending task. The ""boner"" scenes sure do bring back memories. It's when his friends occupy a lot of screen time that the film isn't as interesting. Andy's friends are all complete stereotypes, straight out of American Pie it seems.<br/><br/>Subtle messages, such as; ""it's really O.K. to wait for the perfect one"" are present but not really hammered on, this film more or less shows you that you truly can't be happy unless you ""do it"". In our sex driven modern atmosphere this movie simply reinforces our believe that sex is the most important thing you will ever encounter.<br/><br/>I had high expectations for this film and on the whole was pretty disappointed. There's nothing that justifies over 2 hours running time, the film drags in the end; some pruning would have helped a lot. Still, it has it's moments and a wonderful comic performance by Steve Carrell."

","The 40 Year-Old Virgin is one of the crudest things ever to hit the big screen, and one of the funnyest of the year. The 40 Year-Old Virgin also has a very sweet ending, very, very sweet. That seems more than a little uneven and a little disappointing, in fact it might have worked better to have an ending that was similar to the rest of the film. Or they could have done the ideal thing and made the whole film have moments of sweetness. The film is none the less well written and the performances by Steve Carell and Catherine Keener are exultant, and I haven't laughed so much in a long time. The film also has a slight problem of using one joke many, many times. It may have some other good jokes but the one about him being a 40 Year-Old Virgin is use way to many times. All in all a hilarious film but an uneven one to and not one to race to see."
"gradyharp","6","0","1","10 January 2006"," An Adult Version of the Teeny Flicks
","Raucous humor, outrageous interpersonal situations, potty mouth, and over the top jokes have long been the successful turf of countless summer movies aimed at the teen crowd, films such as the endless American Pie series, Dumb and Dumberer, There's Something About Mary, etc. Now there is a new trend aimed at the thirty to forty something audiences that mimics the earlier teen subjects. THE 40-YEAR-OLD VIRGIN falls into this category along with WEDDING CRASHERS et al, but there is a difference with this one: empathy.<br/><br/>The story is slight: an uptight, loner, action heroes collecting, non-driving bicycle-riding punctual worker in a boring firm is now forty years old and is still a virgin - a fact that bothers him deeply but his virginity has developed into a phobia for close encounters of the female kind. His work partners discover his secret over poker and pledge to resolve the problem by getting him laid, in some of the most negative possible of suggestions. After endless trials to resolve his sexual vacuum he meets a forty something grandmother and in a mutually agreed pact they decide to date without sex for 20 dates before they allow physical activity to occur. In the process the friends at work (including the seductive female manager) learn a thing or two about their own life styles and the film ends in a bizarre musical number that pushes it over the top while tapping at the heart.<br/><br/>Steve Carell co-wrote the script (with Director Judd Apatow) and it shows. His 'Andy' may be a nerd but his adaptation to his problematic existence is sweet and charismatic. Likewise, his office entourage (Paul Rudd, Seth Rogen, Romany Jay, Jane Lynch) gives us three-dimensional characters each of which shows some personal growth of their own during their experiments for Andy. The real glow of the film is due to the presence of Catherine Keener as the 'grandmother' for whom Andy falls. Whenever she is on the screen lights flash and reality sets in. The real problem for this viewer is that the slapstick portion of the film simply goes on too long. Apatow needs to rethink comedy in a way that reminds him that brevity is better: two hours is way too long for this very short story. Though it has redeeming graces, this is a film for a audience tolerant of the silly and the gross who is willing to wade through the first three-fourths of the film to catch the quietly tender social comment the film contains.

","It was hard to watch this movie with a straight face. This was a strong indication that I found it to be a very funny movie. I enjoyed it from start to finish.<br/><br/>What sets The 40-Year-Old Virgin apart from most other sex comedies is that the main character is both a virgin and, well...40 years old. When it comes to sex, Andy (cleverly played by Steve Carell) is a late bloomer. A very late bloomer. So his goal is to be rid of his virginity once and for all.<br/><br/>I look forward to seeing this movie again, so that I get the same laughs I got when I first saw it.

Steve Carell plays Andy, a geeky 40 year old who lives by himself in an apartment with more video games than your average teenager and an ASIA poster mounted on his wall. He also has more action figures than my son. When his co-workers find out that Andy is a virgin, they make it a point to get him laid and rectify the situation. Keep in mind, that none of these guys are prizes themselves and have their own relationship issues. After all, they work in a stereo store and most of them are in their 30's and some are older than Andy. When Andy does meet a sweet woman named Trish (Catherine Keener) he keeps his secret to himself out of fear of embarrassment. Trish, herself has 3 kids of her own and is a very young grandmother.<br/><br/>There are a lot of big laughs in this. Poor Andy endures some body waxing, a crazy drunk bar pick-up, and some other scary dates before he finally gets up the nerve to ask Trish out. The bulk of the humor is pretty adult and their is also plenty of profanity and nudity. There is a real sweetness to the film though, and Carell's performance is right on and should launch him to A status if he isn't already there.<br/><br/>""40 Year Old Virgin"", along with films like ""Wedding Crashers"", ""Anchorman"", ""Old School"", and ""Office Space"" would make a nice marathon on an evening when there isn't much to do. they're all funny, raunchy, and a really good time.

The focus comes more to knowing there is also the right girl out there. So this is not just full of pointless dribble. <br/><br/>The only complaint I have is I felt it way too drawn out.

Steve is a really good actor when he is with Jim Carrey or the SNL frat pack, and may be also here.<br/><br/>But the worse thing in the movie is there is too much moral, like American Pie. Even if this seems to be completely funny and controversial there is still a direction, a moral and that is what it is so predictable. They say a few toilet humor jokes and they never get beyond this. If you want a break thru, you need to stay always out of the moral thing (without going too far, just because it is cool to stun people), Dumb and Dumbers, National Lampoon's, ZAZ movies, Not Another Teen Movie , Old School were all good because they don't try to give a message every one agrees on.<br/><br/>I think that the reason people have really loved it that there are may be a much higher number of virgins than we think.<br/><br/>The best scene is when he spend all the condoms and even have one on the foot."
"overfedcinemafan","Null","0","2","21 December 2005"," Excellent film despite the protagonists
","This is a difficult film to comment on because, if seen in terms of a storyline with a main character (Andy) and a love interest for the main character (Trish), it's completely demoralizing and almost disturbing. <br/><br/>Andy goes 40 years before finding someone, and everyone around him claims to want to help him do so. Yet, when he falls for a loser with no future, nearly nothing to offer him or any other man, and a mediocre grasp of life (severe emotional and family problems that she tries to off-load onto him etc.) all his good-meaning friends go along with it, even encouraging him! Consider Cal, a master of male issues and pro-male activist: even though he admits the protagonist's love interest, Trish, is ""f#$*ing crazy"" to his boss, Paula, who agrees, neither he nor she warn poor Andy; in fact, Cal ultimately ends up helping Trish's ""cause"" (she calls it ""love"" but ultimately the goal is to suck Andy into her life so he can deal with the mess she's made of it). <br/><br/>However, if the viewer tries her hardest to ignore the two main characters and looks at the film scene-by-scene instead, focusing on the supporting characters, this is an exceptional film! Cal, the ganjaholic lounge warrior; David, the hopelessly romantic prince that holds and talks to a camcorder a la Hamlet before shoving it down his trousers whilst it's filming and projecting onto a bank of monitors; Jay, the free spirit victimized by an overbearing woman who wants to ""change"" him by getting pregnant and telling him his clubbing days are over as a result; Paula, the calm, collected, outspoken woman who wants to have a holiday at home so she can remain stoned for a week and watch ""Gandhi"" on video, and Mooj, the wise, grounded elder from exotic lands (Brooklyn, NY). <br/><br/>Considering the film as a series of monologues or dialogues between these characters, one is inevitably led to the conclusion that his film is truly fine cinema. Mooj's advice to Andy, although inaccurate (for Andy, it *should* be exactly about what Mooj says it's not about...), is heart-warming and will bring a tear to the sensitive viewer's eye. David and Cal's discussion on their feelings while playing a video game is also very well done. Paula and Cal's chat, either the one included in the film or the one in the unrated DVD extras, provides a tremendous amount of insight into the psyches of both characters. <br/><br/>7 out of 10 points for this one. -1 for Trish, a loser that borders on being the villain in the film. -1 for Andy, who changes in order to be with her (this is a very poor example to set for the children that will watch this film). -1 for excluding a number of critical scenes from the release (these are in the unrated DVD extras; for example, the Paula:Cal talk about Cal dropping 4 TVs and being sexually attracted to Barbara Walters (RIP in advance), then asking Paula to steal some hydroponic equipment for him from her new job so he can grow some skunk in his apartment). Another example of selling out one's art for the sake of getting a rating or attracting a specific audience sector -- bah!<br/><br/>This is a very entertaining and funny film and I'd recommend it regardless."

","Without a doubt the funniest film of the year, and the best of it's kind since American Pie. Steve Carrell exquisitely plays the titular prude Andy Stitser, a lovable guy who works at a Best-Buy-like electronics store and spends his free time playing video games and adding to a $500,000 collection of action figures. One day Andy is ""befriended"" by a group of thirty-something's who out of sympathy make it their strange mission to deflower him. What results is pure comic gold, but underneath all the chest-waxing hilarity, is a much deeper interior. In society Andy's band of instigators are regarded as acceptable, even admirable. But beneath all their womanizing, heartless misconduct is an extreme case of arrested development. These guys have never grown past the typical high-school sophomoric rhetoric. On the other hand, you have Andy, a man that in today's over-exposed world is regarded as an outcast simply because he chooses not to have sex. But once Andy meets Trish (Kathrine Keener) we realize that he is capable of a much deeper more intimate relationship than his comrades. Ironically this ""outcast"" is far more emotionally developed than his peers. Steve Carrel plays Andy with a gentle boyish warmth than when combined with his impeccable comedic timing produces the best comedic performance in recent memory."

","This movie is just so good at what it does. It is streets above the likes of 'American Pie' or 'Road Trip' which, whilst very entertaining, have the boardroom touch all over them in their calculated, controlled (commercial) approach to 'gross-out' and nudity. 40-Year Old Virgin, on the other hand, seems to have grown unchecked from the rich material of a guys night out. This is boys talking like boys - and little-known actors having an absolute ball. The aim is not to shock the audience for the sake of it, but merely to give an honest account of male preoccupations. Neither is the tone cruel; you never feel that people here are scornful of the central character, but that they genuinely want to help a repressed and overlooked man discover his potential. This film, perhaps above any other, show that potty talk, machismo and alcohol can be the greatest means through which to communicate real affection between mankind (as opposed to womankind). Conservative America probably wouldn't be able to spot it, but this film is warmer than a thousand and more 'family' films... oh and it's damn funny too."

Where was I? Oh yes - considering most of this film was improvised they did do a good job. The scene where Andy gets his Tom-Jonesesque chest waxed was real.

","Parents, please stop taking your kids to Rated R movies! Okay, now I can continue with my review The 40-Year-Old Virgin is a smart, raunchy yukfest reminiscent of American Pie and There's Something About Mary. While not quite as enjoyable as the latter, it offers a buffet of twisted humor and some sentimental messages to boot.<br/><br/>The film was co-written, produced, and directed by Judd Apatow, best known for his work on one of my favorite TV shows, Freaks and Geeks. The under-appreciated Apatow may finally have a hit on his hands, thanks largely to his co-writer and leading actor, Steve Carrell. <br/><br/>Carrell (Daily Show, Anchorman) plays geeky, electronics store employee Andy Stitzer. Andy leads a solitary life, filling his time and modest apartment with collectible toys and video games. Despite its subtle kinship with Pee-Wee's Big Adventure, Andy is not just a man-child. He's a sweet guy who's reached his 40s without having had a real relationship or the physical connection that typically accompanies it. Once his younger, sex-crazed co- workers learn of his plight, they make it their personal mission to ""get their buddy laid.""<br/><br/>The movie works not only because it's chock-full of laughs, but also because of its realistic depiction of male behavior. We see the demented male psyche from nearly every conceivable facet, which proves both illuminating and frightening. The film's potential classic status is marred only by its lengthy running time. Nevertheless, if you're in the mood for something profanely endearing, this is the one for you.<br/><br/>Rating: B+"

","Steve Carell has been a fixture on Comedy Central for years and had scene stealing minor roles in feature films like Anchorman and Bruce Almighty, but with his first starring role as The 40 Year Old Virgin, he has struck pay dirt. Although crude in its humor and at times graphic in its display of sexual conduct, the film has a core story that elevates it above most gross out comedies and does keep the funny lines coming fast enough to amuse most.<br/><br/>Andy Stitzer, a painfully shy 40 year old, works as a service tech at an electronic entertainment showroom. He is friends with three salesmen who soon find during a poker game that Andy is a virgin, never having had sex with a woman before. It seems Andy never got around to that experience although his attempts are hilariously recalled. Because Andy is humiliated and embarrassed at the barbs and jokes at his expense, his buddies band together to help their fledgling. The aid comes in the forms of speed dating, roaming the singles bars, hitting on book store clerks, and propositioning the showroom's customers where Andy meets an attractive woman, Trish (Catherine Keener), a single mother who has a small business. The two instantly hit it off, but when it comes time to consummate the relationship, things go awry and Andy becomes more despondent when he cannot bear to reveal his deep secret to the woman he loves. It's time for a momentous decision in Andy's life.<br/><br/>Carell co produced and stars in what is his pet project. Judd Apatow (The Larry Sanders Show) directs the script he co-wrote with Carell. True, some of the jokes crash and burn badly or misfire and fizzle, but enough keeps coming to raise some good roaring fun. As Andy, Carell plays an everyman kind of role, and his friends who on surface seem like chauvinistic frat boys, do care and come to his aid in an endearing spirit. He is so adept at the nuances and exaggerated movements of physical comedy that he needs to exploit them further (as he will in the big screen remake of the TV spy show, Get Smart). Among the numerous scenes, the standout and most talked about one is the infamous hair removal at a waxing clinic where Andy attempts to make himself more physically appealing. The results are disastrous, and it is well known that Carell performed the scene for real and suffered for his 'art'. Catherine Keener is a breath of fresh air and quite appealing in her realistic role of a single mother looking for love in the most unlikely of places. The relationship between Trish and Andy develops earnestly and serves to anchor the sillier aspects of the storyline. And there is silly aplenty with some outrageous lines of dialogue and vulgar asides. In some ways, this is about a man who finds his own sense of manhood and maturity after being a boy for a long time. There are subplots involving each of the guys that are amusing but don't really add anything to the story. Also good is the developing relationship Andy has with Trish's daughter. The final scene is pretty nutty and clever as the credits roll.<br/><br/>On the surface, this film would appear to have all the ingredients for an over-the-top comedy like Animal House or American Pie. Indeed, there are a couple of scenes that are quite sexually explicit. It takes its R rating seriously. Don't be misled. This is not a one note comedy but rather a romantic tale. At its heart, it has a well intentioned theme of longing and frustration with some genuine compassion. If you go in knowing you may be grossed out at times but still induced to laughter, then that pretty much sums up the appeal of this energetic film. In a star making turn, Carell is one to watch for quite some time."

Honestly I can buy a pirated version of it but I decided to try the ambiance of the cinema. I became fond of Steve Carell when I've seen Bruce Almighty. I first heard of the movie ""The 40 year old Virgin"" while watching ET, The Insider and the E!. I was so curious that I really wanna watched it by the time it hit Manila Theatres.<br/><br/>My choices: Corpse Bride (This should be next!), Deuce Bigalow (I think I should watch on DVDS instead), and others were serious that I didn't mind what's on the now showing lists <br/><br/>OK, so I watch the ""The Forty Year Old Virgin"". I was surprised to see more people (mostly college students) on a Monday afternoon watching it. I cannot believe myself that I could burst into laughter on its beginning and I actually didn't feel bored watching it and I was really laughing till the end of the movie. It's been a long time since I last laughed on a movie from start to end. Steve Carell was great portraying an innocent man though he got 2 kids and I might believe he lost his virginity during college because of its plot. You know in order to act innocent is when you know the rules of sex. He must have done research on this things. It was a funny movie and it's worth my 120 bucks. Though I only recommend it to the open-minded people who just wants a good funny movie. conservative people will consider this so awful because of the sexual content of the movie. and it is also R13 here in Manila.

","Steve Carell plays Andy the ""40-yr. old virgin"" in this film. No doubt, assessing the title, one is inclined to think that in this day and age Andy must be some kind of nerd/loser/psycho/nut-case to have gone that long in life without getting laid. And, truth is, Andy IS all of the above though none to the extremes. In fact, Andy is doing quite well enjoying his placid, celibate self until his workmates David (Paul Rudd), Jay (Romany Malco) and Cal (Seth Rogan) find out during a card game that he has yet to pop his cherry. His ""friends"" then spring into action, creating havoc in Andy's sterile, somewhat juvenile world. Carell and Judd Apatow wrote the script and not many of their one-liners or sight gags fail to evoke laughter. Their choice of the beautiful and beguiling Catherine Keener to play Trish, the divorcée of Andy's desire, is perfect. She brings an edgy elegance to the role. The script spreads the laughs around, giving just about every actor's character a chance to deliver a hilarious line or two. Chief amongst them are bookends Mooj & Haziz, two wise-cracking Indian workmates of Andy's who are never at a loss when it comes to busting chops or dishing out critiques. ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" despite more than a few continuity lapses, delivers the goods laugh-wise. For once, it is a comedy that stays true to that course, only veering slightly into the sappy, over-played romantic comedy genre to unite Andy and Trish."
"rollio617","7","0","1","3 October 2005"," Not a hint of class, but leaves nothing to the imagination!
","Steve Carell has made his way into the world of comedy with his natural ability to create a lovable and yet near pathetically awkward character, and his first solo venture onto the silver screen is no exception. ""The 40 Year Old Virgin"" provides Carell with a chance to show deeper dimensions (which, ironically seem almost more shallow) to his particular character, as opposed to his rare and laudable role as Brick Tamland in ""Anchorman: The Legend of Ron Burgandy."" The child trapped in a man's body motif works well with Carell's sense of humor, which, in turn, is pretty much exactly what Brick Tamlan was. This is where the movie lost points. The beauty of Carell's character in ""Anchorman"" was that his one-timer lines added just the right amount of completely random and yet necessary humor at key points in the movie. In short less is more. However, with Carell's most recent movie, the writers chose to basically use those bits of genius over and over until they lost their glorious appeal. To my pleasant surprise, Carell does seem to make up for the repetition with some real character. No longer is Steve Carell in the background, but rather in the spotlight, and he adjusted his style accordingly. Unfortunately, Carell's acting ability could not save the movie from its extremely vulgar stretches of humor. There are many scenes of obscene and overworked bits of attempted comedy that do nothing but offer a chance for the viewer to adjust in his seat and look around. Overall, the movie has its shining moments, spearheaded by the talented Carell, but the supporting characters are puppets that offer cheap giggles but add no real substance to the movie. Although mainly still portraying an awkward character, Steve Carell showed some promise of being in more serious roles. I recommend that all those skeptical of the movie's worth rent a copy at the local video store and sit down with a couple friends, and at least have a good time with some friends."

","Forty years old, still not a man<br/><br/>The Forty Year Old Virgin is about Andy (Steve Carell) who is a forty year old man yet to have sex. Andy who is a nice genuine individual works at an electronic store. His fellow employees are, in a sense, mean to him. They think of him as being rather nerdy. When his fellow employees discover that he is a virgin, they consider it their duty to help him. Despite their advice, it did not work for Andy. He just cannot find the right woman. That is until he meets Trish, a mother of three. His friends are excited thinking that this is the one he will lose his virginity to, not knowing that they agreed not to have sex. <br/><br/>I feel that the reason Judd Apatow developed this film is to say nice guys finish last. Andy's friends throughout the film are portrayed as players. They get their women by being completely phony. It is like all they have to do is tell the women what they want to hear and they continued to get lucky. Then there is Andy, a kind hearted gentleman, who is so good and true to these women. Apparently nice is not what these women were looking for. Apatow really shows how hard it is for a good man to get ahead. Andy finally got his chance, but of course he is the last to do so. <br/><br/>This is one of the funniest films of the year. The casting is absolutely perfect. All of the characters are great. I could not stop laughing at Steve Carell's character Andy; it was in most part his friendliness and lack of knowledge of women. His friends from the electronic store cracked me up while trying to help Andy. I felt an emotional connection to Andy due to his authentic personality. Instead of being a stereotypical macho man, he is a kind and considerate person. In the end I felt a sense of pride towards Andy. He is a nice person who deserves a good girl."
"paul-Rocco","7","0","1","29 September 2005"," It was a good see.
","Veryyy funny, this movie got me laughing a lot. Its a cute story about a 40 year old man who's never grown up or taken chances in life. Steve Carell is an excellent actor, he had a very convincing performance. I suggest this movie to anybody who likes any National Lampoon Movies like Van Wilder or of that such. Definitely attracts a older crowd due to its massive adult material and tons of Drug references, Its a good see none the less.. I've seen funnier - but this is a very unique comedy that isn't afraid to step out of the box to get a few extra laughs, and you must respect that. The cast was not filled with a lot of famous faces, but the actors were good at playing their roles."
"tetrafunk","9","0","2","27 September 2005"," Fantastic.!!!!
","This movie is fantastic. There I said it, although when I entered the cinema I was firmly under the impression this would be another run of the mill, nonsensical, slapstick comedy romp. Don't get me wrong, there is plenty of what you would expect...but so much of what you wouldn't!<br/><br/>The strength in the movie, after the brilliant script writing, is the the phenomenal choice of cast and their individual/group performances. From the opening banter between Steve Carell and Seth Rogen's characters, you can already tell this movie is going to supply a much more intelligent and slick form of comedy that is usually expected from Hollywood. Both myself and the audience were laughing pretty much regularly from that point onward until the end of the film. <br/><br/>Steve Carell's ""Stiller-esque"" performance style makes him both instantly likable and funny and the audience is really capable of connecting to his character and his plight. The same can also be said for his supporting actors, especially the group of male friends, who as an ensemble work perfectly with one another. There are a few ""classic"" Hollywood comedy moments, but thankfully they are vastly out-weighed by the script which is fresh, hilarious and beautifully executed. <br/><br/>I defy anybody to watch this film with a straight face. Definitely one of the top comedies of 2005 for me so far.<br/><br/>See this movie if you enjoy any sort of comedy!"
"patrick_bateman_esquire","6","0","3","10 September 2005"," A lot more drama than comedy
","This movie was OK, certainly not bad, although it did drag a little bit towards the end. However, I must admit that I am a bit confused at the glowing reviews. It was nowhere near as funny as ""Anchorman"" or even ""Dodgeball."" I believe the film was a little confused. You had moments of real seriousness and then they would turn around and throw in some juvenile humor. A bit of a mess really. I like Carrill and Rudd, but they did not have the same surrounding talent as they had in Anchorman. I did enjoy the film OK, but it seemed like the film traded off from directly appealing to 40 year olds and then turning around and appealing all of their humor towards 14 year olds. Like I said, an OK film, but certainly not great."
"PWNYCNY","6","0","3","8 September 2005"," It's Okay but it's not ""Sideways""
","Okay, the premise of this movie is somewhat shaky, but the movie is amusing, and at times provokes outright laughter. Yet this movie also has its serious side, which actually detracts from the movie's entertainment value because the main character is neither a social misfit or a buffoon. Instead, he is person who chooses to remain celibate and demands that his decision be respected, which is anything but amusing. For it's not that he can't ""get laid,"" or doesn't want to, it's just that he wants ""action"" on his own terms or not at all, which doesn't make for a funny character. If the main character were goofy, like, for instance, Austin Powers, or were some kind of pompous martinet, like, for instance, Captain Wally Binghamton in ""McHale's Navy,"" then this movie may have been much funnier. But here the 40-year-old virgin is actually quite normal, friendly, and likable. In short, he is boring. It would be like trying to laugh at Abbott and Costello or Laurel and Hardy while taking them seriously. This is an okay movie, but if you want to watch a really funny movie, watch ""Sideways."""
"riderpridethemovie","6","0","3","26 August 2005"," What's the big, hairy deal?
","Perhaps I just answered my own question? Without a doubt the waxing scene in this movie is the most memorable and sure to become a movie legend. Steve Carell's reactions aren't so much funny as cringe-inducing and everyone from the waxer to his buddies give brilliant reaction shots. Of course, the reason this works is because it was real. In fact, all of The 40 Year Old Virgin's great scenes are borne out of reality, which makes you wonder why they felt the need to go all crazy nutso and bring down the picture? For example, the movie opens with Carell's character walking through his apartment with an erection. He then tries to go to the bathroom, but has to contort himself to hit the toilet. Funny. But later in the film he sits down to go to the washroom and pees all over himself. Not funny. Why? Because he's 40 years old, for crimeny's sake. He's been doing this all his life. It's just stupid. Similarly, there is a funny scene in which he can't seem to avoid a bus with erotic images all over it. Then later in the film, he crashes through a billboard with the same image. Coincidence? Symbolism? Or just plain lame. As with Wedding Crashers, which this film will be linked forever to the summer of 2005, there is a goldmine of comedic possibilities that arise out of the great premise. Which makes it particularly galling when the filmmakers choose to go for the easy, sophomoric gag over the easy, intelligent gag. No one is going to be quoting the foul-mouthed grandmother in Wedding Crashers nor should they be quoting the foul- mouthed East Indian in 40 YOV. Sometimes having the least obvious character do the swearing turns out to be the most obvious. That said, I really enjoyed the relationship between Carrell and Catherine Keener's character. It was real, it was touching and Carell especially showed a different kind of leading man. But I keep going over how lame some of these scenes were. The condom scene? Really. A heterosexual, non-religious guy who thinks he should blow a condom up or stretch it out on his toes. It's like these jokes came from the Acme Joke factory. And the screen time used on these lameties could just as easily been used on developing character. Why is this guy a virgin? I know guys like this and this film had an opportunity to really say something about the pressures and fears these guys have, but instead it spent time (a lot of time) setting him up for a ""party"" with what turned out to be a transvestite. I mean, come on, stop pandering to 18-year-olds, who I'm sure are a lot smarter than this film gives them credit for."
"TheMovieCritique","6","0","1","20 August 2005"," Comic-ly timed and so right!
","I admit it. I was laughing, along with the rest of the movie hall, till I was close to tears. All the raunchy and maybe politically incorrect jokes not withstanding - this is a FUNNY movie.<br/><br/>Andy (Steve Carell) is a man whose existence revolves around his collectible toys, video games and his trusty bike (as in bicycle - as he makes clear to a date!) - and oh yes, did I forget the morning erections? As the name of the movie suggests - 40 year old Andy has never ""done the deed"". So during a poker game, that any man would regret, his ""virginity"" comes to light. So from here the loyal friends of Andy aid him in finding a girl to do ""it"" with. Andy falls for a single mom (Catherine Keener) - and wants to get himself ready before he makes love to the woman he loves.<br/><br/>From well meant advice about drunk girls at bar (which ends in a 'shellfish flavored' throw up!) to date-twenty-people in a hour events (where Andy gets propositioned by a ""reforming"" lesbian!) this movie is filled with the misadventures of sex and all things associated with it. The waxing bit, which has been shown in the trailers, is sure to have you in splits.<br/><br/>The amazing thing that the director throws in lot of small funny bits about Andy's friends, co-workers and just about anyone around Andy. So you can see one joke coming from Andy's misadventure, but you're not braced for that unexpected action of his trusted friend. The loser clinging to his broken relationship, the ""dude"" who always the right thing to say, the confident but insecure party animal, the girl with the wild side - all make their appearances! Director Judd Apatow packs in a lot into the movie.<br/><br/>But as with the other raunchy funnie of summer - Wedding Crashers (I know this comparison is so bound to happen!) - the movie falters in the bit when it takes itself a wee bit too serious for its own good. Also pruning twenty minutes of the movie might be a pretty good idea.<br/><br/>The ending is funny too - remember to sit while the credits roll in! Thank god they ended the movie on a light fluffy note! In three words - Go see it! It's fun! It sure is!"
"cdelacroix1","7","0","3","20 August 2005"," There's Something About This Movie
","This was an enormously funny romp of a movie. It has been compared frequently ""The Wedding Crashers"". And mostly this movie seems to be liked better than ""The Wedding Crashers."" I see the comparison, but honestly think ""The Wedding Crashers"" was sharper, funnier, faster. As for ""40 Year Old Virgin,"" think this movie may be much more comparable to ""There's Something About Mary"".<br/><br/>Having said all that, this was truly a hilarious movie about (of course) Sex. There were several parts that were especially funny to me. The chest-hair waxing scene. The ""I know you're gay because "" dialog. The conversation(s) in the bookstore. The scene with the condoms.<br/><br/>The ending of the movie was really perfect, perfectly funny and perfectly high-spirited.<br/><br/>Regarding acting and characterizations, frankly, I did not like Steve Carell as Andy. I guess in a way it might seem like an easy part to play, but who really could have pulled it off? Not Carell in my humble opinion. Catherine Keener as Trish was excellent, on the other hand. Then again, Catherine Keener is always excellent. Paul Rudd as the morose stoner was not to me very appealing. Romany Malco as Jay was very good. Elizabeth Banks was hot. HOWEVER ...<br/><br/>Seth Rogan as Cal was by far the best in the movie! <br/><br/>I really thought Rogan's Cal carried every scene he was in. Yet he never over-reached, never played too far or too fast or too anything. Who is this guy? Blue collar, tattooed, crude, funny, natural, relaxed, playing his part with a cool, confident style that simply never faltered. I see he co-produced the movie. Clearly he had a lot of confidence in the product as well. I really hope to see more of this talent."
