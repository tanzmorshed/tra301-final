","Yeah you heard me... Footloose is based on a TRUE STORY. Unlikely as it seems, it really happened in the small town of Elmore City, Oklahoma in 1980. My dad, Leonard Coffee (a.k.a. Ren McCormack a.k.a. Kevin Bacon...all breakfast items? what a coincidence...lol) was a junior at Elmore City High School. This was a minuscule town, with a population of around 750, and there were about 50 or so Baptist churches...so naturally the town's rules and regulations were a bit extreme. There was an archaic town ordinance that banned dancing in public, and it hadn't been abolished. Elmore had never had a junior/senior prom! So my dad fought the system with the help of his best friend, Rex Kennedy (the junior class president), and they were allowed to have a prom for the first time, and Elmore has had prom every year since. I don't know who sold the story, but unfortunately we got no money lol! There were a few things in the movie that didn't actually happen (Ariel Moore, Reverend Moore, the book burning, oh and playing chicken on the tractors!), but it is mostly accurate. The kids did have to go to surrounding communities like Pauls Valley and Lindsay to dance and party, and my dad drove the exact same car that Ren drives in the movie! So there you have it, the REAL story of Footloose. If you haven't seen it...watch it!"

","Prior to seeing this movie, all I had heard suggested that I was better off not watching it unless it was to ridicule. I looked at my uncle dancing round his living room to some of its music and asked myself if anybody expected me to take that seriously. It's got a place in movie history even for the title song alone, though, so I decided I couldn't live with myself unless I gave it a chance. It was definitely worth it.<br/><br/>The style is reminiscent of a whole host of other '80's teen flicks, but only a handful are better. Most of the cast do great things with their roles. Kevin Bacon actually manages to make the clichÃ©d concept seem kinda cool, here showcasing an easy charm that was to become the hallmark of much of his later work. Crucially, the music is actually pretty good too! (Even if I am torn between wanting to cringe and dance when I hear the theme!)<br/><br/>On reflection it's no cheesier than something like ""All the Right Moves"" (which has a great cast doing their best but suffers from a plodding story) In fact, it's miles better! At least the music in ""Footloose"" gave the makers a viable way to pep things up whenever the story begins to flag. This film is much, MUCH better than I had been led to believe, so give it a chance if you ain't seen it yet but thought you knew the score. Chances are, you don't..."

","This is an absolute classic. The plot is a wonderful struggle of someone who doesn't fit in meeting other people that don't necessarily fit in and attempting to make a difference in the world. Great characters and a great story make this great and all but you remember it for one reason: The Music. Footloose is not by any means a musical, but you could almost consider it one. The plot itself revolves around music and with it comes one of the best soundtracks of all time. The music is so well integrated with the plot and every scene is enhanced by it. Kevin Bacon is awesome, perfect mix of drama and fun."

","I loved it when I first saw it as a teen in 1984 amd felt the same watching it now as an adult all these years later. Great simple story that showcases new kid in town, the rebellion of youth, lust and how gooooood dancing makes you feel and what you'll do to get that feeling."

","Aw, come on IMDb'ers, why the low rating? Where's your sense of loyalty? I can't hear that Kenny Loggins title song and see those pairs of dancing feet during the opening credits without sitting down to watch this whole movie. And even if it's largely to make fun of it, I still love it for old times' sake.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is the tough city kid stuck in some podunk Midwest town where dancing has been outlawed. John Lithgow is the preacher who serves as Bacon's arch nemesis; Lori Singer is the preacher's daughter who has a hankering for the new dangerous kid. Dianne Wiest is the reasonable mom who acts as referee between dad and daughter. The whole thing is sillier than an episode of ""Laugh-In,"" but many of the actors (particularly Lithgow, Wiest and Bacon) are good enough to actually sell the material. And come on, admit it, you know you like the music.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

","OK, maybe I'm giving in to nostalgia here but I rented ""Footloose"" recently and thought it was great. Yes, it's definitely a teen flick, similar to ""Dirty Dancing"", and aging a little now.<br/><br/>But the music is great and the plot and themes do as much for me as ""Grease"" ever did. As teen movies go, it is somewhat original and interesting.<br/><br/>Who should see this film:<br/><br/>-- Teens with nothing better to do on a rainy day<br/><br/>-- People reliving the 1980s, you won't be disappointed to<br/><br/>see this one again<br/><br/>I'll give Footloose a 9 out of 10 because it cheered me up on a day I needed it."
"preppy-3","8","58","91","6 April 2005"," Sure it's silly but it's an 80s teen musical
","Teenager Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves to a small mid Western town with his mom after his parents divorce. It seems the Reverend Moore (John Lithgow), of the town's only church, has totally banned rock and roll music from the entire town. He has a daughter named Ariel (Lori Singer) who is basically a hell-raiser--yet loves her father. Rem decides to stop the ban and bring the town back to life.<br/><br/>OK--we're not dealing with reality here at ALL! A town banning rock music entirely is ridiculous and the town only has ONE church? And the game of chicken using tractors was just silly. And don't get me started on how Bacon, Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker look WAY too old to be high school students--Singer was THIRTY when she did this! And how the heck did all the kids from the town learn how to dance so quickly? But, as a no brain musical, this does work.<br/><br/>The opening sequence alone is great (it shows various feet dancing to the title tune). Also the acting helps a lot. Bacon is just great--he doesn't take the movie too seriously and gives out a very good performance. He also has a big dance number (to a song called ""Never"") which is him and THREE different stuntman doing the more unrealistic moves. Singer is too old for her role but she tries. Penn is pretty good as Bacon's best friend--his learning how to dance sequence is a highlight. Parker did this before she was known and she's not bad. Lithgow and Wiest are just great as the Reverend and his wife--Wiest has a great scene where she calmly tells him off and Lithgow (wisely) does not play the Reverend as a one-note character. You see him trying to understand his daughter and slowly realizing that music isn't bad.<br/><br/>So--this is no ""Singin in the Rain"" but for a 1980s teen musical it's lots of fun. Great songs too. Just turn off your brain and enjoy!"
"alainenglish","Null","50","78","24 June 2002"," Silly, but lighthearted caper
","""Footloose"" is a fun and very lighthearted motion picture that promises a good time and delivers.<br/><br/>The film has a simple, if unlikely, plotline.  Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren MacCormack(Kevin Bacon) arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont.  Enrolling at the local high school, he is appalled to discover the town's adults have imposed a law on ""public dancing"" and rock music, as enforced and practiced by the local preacher(John Lithgow).  Ren quickly sets about changing things, falling in love with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) in the process.<br/><br/>The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched.  The script takes some time to explore its simple theme - dancing and rock music, and what they symbolise for young people.  Three scenes help to lay this out.  The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn; the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance; and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.<br/><br/>As the leading man, Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well.  Ren isn't really a macho hero revelling in coolness, he's a down-to-earth young man trying to the right thing by his peers.  His romance with Lori Singer's character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.<br/><br/>
The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Ren's earnest intentions.  Even Ariel's brutish boyfriend(Jim Young) fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.<br/><br/>John Lithgow's characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy, his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical, just merely uptight.  The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been.  At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wife(Dianne Wiest) are very well written and acted.  In these scenes he excels and his character's development seems very natural.<br/><br/>On the technical side, the film is well-shot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well, bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.<br/><br/>Whilst ""Footloose"" is certainly no masterpiece, it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper, and as such is a very enjoyable movie."

"JayHysterio","8","4","4","18 February 2019"," Kevin Makin' Bacon
","Kevin Bacon is known for two roles; the initiation scene in Animal House (thank you sir may I have another?)...and this film.<br/><br/>He's actually been better in more critically acclaimed films but he'll never shake this one.<br/><br/>As for Footloose, the plot, characters and storyline are questionable and contrived but there's a certain attraction to it all. The best dynamic is actually between Reverend Moore and his wife, two people who are conflicted within themselves as well as with each other...that's about the only real life in this film.<br/><br/>You have to wonder how Moore has the compassion and wisdom to go against book burning but not dancing, something that is way less potentially harmful to the kids. Plus he seemed to not question Ariel about her seeing Chuck, a violent and mean redneck, but forbade her to associate with Ren.<br/><br/>The best part was the final dance scene, precluded by a fight where Ren suddenly develops martial arts skills in addition to a hayseed kid all dressed up but sneaking a nose pick in like he's on a John Deere in the field.<br/><br/>I guess the this film has everything; Religion, breaking laws, hypocrisy, protagonists, antagonists, meaningful sidelong glances, contrived situations and a nose pick. Not bad."
"generationofswine","10","7","9","19 September 2018"," An Honest Review
","It's still one of my favorites and I could hardly walk when it first came out.<br/><br/>And now it's legend, so writing a real review is almost needless. Just about everyone has seen it. It's still regarded as a classic.<br/><br/>So I suppose the best thing to say is that it's like the Karate Kid...only with dancing rather than martial arts.<br/><br/>Single mother and son move into a new town.
Son is an outsider that gets in trouble with the local bully.
Son starts dating the local bully's girlfriend.
Son and bully fight and...resolution.<br/><br/>However, it goes a bit deeper in that it references several cases of high school kids actually taking on town ordinances against dancing.<br/><br/>And Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town, so he's like the Karate Kid, but he also serves in the Pat Morita role as instructor.<br/><br/>And the evil dojo is actually a church and the bad guy is actually a preacher and not a Karate trainer and has a very kind heart and cares a lot for his community. So the main villain isn't really evil he just has a different point of view, and unlike movies today, he is allowed to have a different point of view, to really be wrong in his beliefs, and still be portrayed as a kind and caring person.<br/><br/>So, it's like the Karate Kid only with actual depth and much better soundtrack."
"ComedyFan2010","8","5","6","13 April 2018"," An teen 80's musical for some good mood.
","The main issue people have with this movie is that the story is so silly. A town where dancing is illegal, whaaat? But turns out that it is based on a real story. There was indeed a town where dancing was illegal until the 80's. Only it was more one of those cases where nobody has changed the law for a century and it became a bit outdated.<br/><br/>Besides being silly it is still a feel good movie. ""I"" love the dancing scenes. Mainly that famous Kevin Bacon scene as well as when he teaches his friend to dance.<br/><br/>Another scene that I live is that tractor chicken game scene. Especially because the soundtrack to it is Holding out for a Hero by Bonnie Tyler. Oh that was just perfect.<br/><br/>One of the things I love about big hits from those times is that it includes a lot of well known actors, most at the very beginning of their careers. This is the case here as well. Kevin Bacon is so damn hot and so incredibly young, it was the movie that made him a star. Lori Singer is also there looking beautiful, although as far as I know it is also a highlight of her career. Then there is Chris Penn who will bring a lot of good work in the future but letting us to see him dance in this one. And it was exciting to see Sarah Jessica Parker. She was actually still a teenager in this movie. And I must say I got all giggly when she gave Kevin Bacon a compliment about his outfit."

"tastyhotdogs","8","24","43","15 October 2005"," It makes me feel like dancing
","EVERYBODY CUT FOOTLOOSE As we all know 1984 produced a lot of great things. One of the best was ""Footloose"". Here's my thoughts on this timeless masterpiece which I brought on DVD this week<br/><br/>-Most good movies have a great opening and Footloose is no exception. A bunch of feet dancing showcasing the great footwear of the 80's to the soundtrack song ""Footloose"". Immediately gets you in -Kevin Bacon's character has one of the all-time great movie names: ""Ren McCormack"" -Funny how this is probably Kevin Bacon's greatest role, maybe only challenged by ""Flatliners"". It's amazing how so many actors never repeat their efforts of their first breakthrough movie (See Lou Diamond Phillips, Chris Rock and Madonna for starters) -Also starring in this movie is one of Hollywood's greatest lesser known brothers, Sean Penn's brother Christopher. He's way better than Dan Swayze or Charlie Murphy. -Kenny Loggins will go down as one of the greatest contributors to movie hit songs ever. Footloose's ""Footloose"" and Top Gun's ""Danger Zone"". -This is another one of those movies built around a town's overzealous pastor's. Reverand Shaw (John Lithgow) is even more intense than that guy in ""Chocolat"" -Great action scene at the start with Lori Singer car surfing (watch the slightly impossible way she gets back in the car) -Also look for the great David Hasselhoff 2 second cameo -Great scene where the Rev turns off Lor Singer's ghetto-blaster. Everyone stops talking, eating and dancing. Possibly slightly dramatic -Will (Christopher Penn) tells us several other towns have also banned dancing. How wasn't that fact used as the premise for heaps more sequels with Ren going from town to town and reviving dance? Each time he'd face a new obstacle. -Ren mentions his love for ""Men at Work"" and ""The Police"", yet he only listens in his car to bad 80's electric rock. Strange. -Weird town. Here a face off equals a tractor fight. -One of the funniest moments is when Chuck gets onto his tractor and puts ""I need a hero"" on on his ghetto-blaster. That would be awesome to do at a basketball game when you sub in. -Another great Dianne Weist performance. That girl can just capture the whole audience when she wants. Underrated actress. -""Moment I regret now""- Christopher Penn's dance sequence to ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" (although it's a great sequence in the movie) -Kevin Bacon's speech to the council was possibly the greatest speech up until that time in cinema history. That is until Sly Stallone raised the bar with his ""If I Can Change...."" in Rocky 4. Which was then overtaken by Matthew McConaghuey's ""Can you see her..."" speech in ""A Time To Kill"""

","This movie has got to be one of the best I have ever seen! I absolutely love every single moment in the it. They made a wise choice to put Kevin Bacon as Ren McCormack and Lori Singer as Ariel Moore. I kinda wish Ariel (Lori) would have been a little more the way Julianne Hough played Ariel in the 2011 version of ""Footloose"". I also feel as though Miles Teller played the part as Willard Hewitt better than Chris Penn did in the original ""Footloose"". I wish I could dance as amazing as them. It is absolutely stunning. It makes me want to get up and dance along! How long did it take them to learn all the dance moves anyways??? I also like how Reverend Shaw Moore's (John Lithgow) daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer), is the one who breaks most of the laws! It's like seriously get your daughter under control! But I really do like this movie a lot!"

","After the abandonment of his father, Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) and his mother move from Chicago to live with his Aunt Lulu (Lynne Marta) and Uncle Wes (Arthur Rosenberg) in the small town of Bomont. While there, Ren experiences culture shock in learning that dancing and secular music were against the law due to the death of teenagers involved in an automobile accident after a dance five years prior to his arrival. Desperate to fit in with the town's society, yet unwilling to assimilate to its customs, Ren is compelled to generate a revolution by standing up to the town administrators and proposing a senior prom. With the help of his friends Willard (Chris Penn), Rusty (Sarah Jessica Parker), and Ariel (Lori Singer), the dance is passed and the town is resolved to a positive change. <br/><br/>Within the film ""Footloose"", the themes of courage, bravery, and hope can be found. Ren had to find bravery and courage within himself in order to take a stand against the town council in proposing the hosting of a senior prom. Willard, Rusty, and Ariel had to generate courage and hope in knowing that their support to Ren's cause would show approved and that the oppressive laws would be abolished. <br/><br/>Many found this film to be entertaining with its lovable characters, musical score, and happy ending. Kevin Bacon plays Ren McCormick and portrays him with a spunky, big city attitude. Willard is played by Chris Penn and is the goofy, redneck friend of Ren. Rusty, played by Sarah Jessica Parker, is the longtime sweetheart of Willard and is always worrisome. Ariel, played by Lori Singer, is the rebellious daughter of the minister and teenage love of Ren. I enjoyed this character combination because their personalities cause me to reminisce about my best friends during my high school years. The film also featured the hit singles of Bonnie Tyler's ""Holding Out For A Hero"" and Kenny Loggins'""Footloose,"" which electrified the dance numbers within the movie. Lastly, happy endings are classical ways of ending good stories, especially this one. With the abolishment of the strict dancing laws and the hosting of a dance, Ren fought for what he believed and achieved his ending goal."

","A film of enormous charm. It's about dancing but unlike many films about dancing it doesn't take itself seriously. It's loose-limbed and goofy and it lifts you up. It's set in a high school in a small mid-western town where dancing has been banned; (it reminds me of a joke I heard here in Ulster; 'Why do Free Presbyterians disapprove of making love standing up?' 'It might lead to dancing').<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is the new kid in town who wants the ban lifted. Indeed, this boy seems to live to dance and he's immensely likable. He uses his killer smile to great effect. In this movie the dancing is integral to the plot and it evolves from it naturally and, for once, the director Herbert Ross takes things easy. As well as Bacon, the film has Lori Singer, (the obligatory love interest), and John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest as her parents. He's the bible-thumper who thinks that dancing is sinful and Wiest, with her wan, other-worldly smile, is the wife who doesn't as well as a very young Chris Penn as the over-weight farm boy Bacon teaches to dance in a wonderful sequence choreographed to Denise Williams' 'Let's hear it for the boy'"

","I like the bit where the small town preacher won't allow dancing"
"Tweekums","8","2","2","9 December 2019"," A fun '80s classic
","This eighties classic is centred on Ren McCormick, a teenager from Chicago, who has moved to a small mid-west town with his mother after his parents divorced. He is shocked when he learns that the town council has banned dancing, largely at the behest of the town's minister. Many of the town's adults think dancing, along with popular music and certain books are a menace that lead youngsters to sin... it quickly becomes apparent that the teenagers, including Ariel, the minister's daughter can be fairly wild without dancing. Somewhat inevitably Ren and Ariel grow close, leading to bad feeling with the boy she was dating, and ultimately Ren leads a campaign to allow the kids to have an official school dance.<br/><br/>One might think of this as a music/dance film but it is so much more than that. Yes there is lots of enjoyable eighties music and some fun dance scenes but really it is about the characters. Some may be a little clichÃ©, most notably local bad boy who we just know will ultimately be put in his place by our protagonist. Other characters are deeper than expected, the minister is shown to be a good man despite his draconian views on music; we are given a reason that makes it understandable why he would feel the way he does even if we disagree with him. The actors playing the youngsters may be rather old for the characters they play but they do a good job; most obviously Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer as Ren and Ariel, but also from Chris Penn as Ren's friend Willard. Of the 'adults' John Lithgow stands out for his performance as the conflicted minister. The story is fun; as well as providing reasons for the enjoyable dance scenes, the youngsters dance amazingly well considering it is meant to be banned. Surprisingly the most memorable scene doesn't involve dancing... it involves playing chicken in tractors! Overall it may be a little cheesy but it is definitely an '80s teen classic; a must see for fans of the genre."
"Wuchakk","9","7","12","15 June 2013"," ""A time to mourn and a time to dance"" - Ecclesiastes 3:4
","RELEASED IN 1984 and directed by Herbert Ross, ""Footloose"" chronicles events in the small Western town of Bomont where dancing and loud music have been outlawed because of an accident that killed some kids years earlier. Preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) rebels against the legalistic measures while taking liking to a new student from Chicago, Ren (Kevin Bacon), whom her father (John Lithgow) disapproves of because he perceives Ren as a ""troublemaker"" who wants to change the town laws against dancing.<br/><br/>Also on hand are Chris Penn as Ren's ""country boy"" pal, Willard, and Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend, Rusty. Penn's character is real fun and Sarah was a real cutie back in '84.<br/><br/>I stayed away from this film because of Roger Ebert's scathing review and the fact that I thought the story was about some big city fop moving to a small town and dancing on the tables of the local high school, etc. I was wrong (and so was Ebert). The protagonist, Ren, is no dandy; in fact, he can kick some arse if necessary. And you never see him dancing through the halls of the high school or whatever. He's a professional-class gymnast and his dynamic solo work-out at the factory is simply a matter of blowing off steam, which is a form of healthy venting.<br/><br/>Although I stayed away from ""Footloose,"" the film acquired a respectable following and this inspired me to finally view it. I now understand why it's so popular. ""Footloose"" has that cinematic magic that pulls you in and gives you a good time. This is just a really entertaining movie with an exceptional soundtrack of songs made for the move with no less than six top 40 hits, like the title track by Kenny Loggins and ""Holding Out for a Hero"" performed by Bonnie Tyler, plus a couple of other significant ditties, e.g. ""Bang Your Head"" by Quiet Riot.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, ""Footloose"" also has depth and is actually moving. We understand Rev. Shaw Moore's grief, but his rigid law-ism isn't doing his people or town any good. I like how Shaw isn't made out to be the clichÃ©d villain. This is a good man thinking he's doing the right thing for his town, and in many ways he is, but the legalistic spirit he cops is sapping the life out of him, his family, his congregants and his town. Does he have the wisdom to see his error and re-route?<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Footloose is easily the best of the Big Three 80's dance movies and actually made significantly more at the domestic box office than ""Dirty Dancing"" ($80 million compared to $65 million). It has heart, a great cast, a superb soundtrack, all-around entertainment and real-life mindfood. It's also based on a true story that occurred in Elmore City, Oklahoma. Actually, there were similar towns with the same laws throughout America (and maybe still are). <br/><br/>THE FILM RUNS 1 hour, 47 minutes and was shot in areas 30 minutes south of Salt Lake City, on the eastern side of Utah Lake.

"namashi_1","8","6","10","25 June 2010"," Superb!
","Loosely based on events that took place in the tiny, rural farming community of Elmore City, Oklahoma... Herbert Ross's 'Footloose' is about a small town where rock-and-roll has been banned. You just can't dance over-there! Boy, It's a superb film... as a viewer, you're highly entertained!<br/><br/>'Footloose' is an expression, of how far would you go to make a dream come true. Dean Pitchford screenplay is engaging and Ross's direction is terrific. It has some memorable moments, especially when Bacon dances his guts out or even the penultimate portions that focus on John Lithgow. The soundtrack is foot-tapping, surely 1984 grooved on it! <br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is the soul of the film. 'Footloose' explores the dancer and actor inside him. Despite being a highly-talented personality... he has remained under-rated! Sad to know he doesn't have the fan-following that he truly deserves. A special mention to Lithgow, Lori Singer and Dianne Wiest for their flawless performances! <br/><br/>'Footloose' is a must watch. It's entertaining, foot-tapping and the now-veteran Bacon to keep you glued. Two Thumbs Up!"

","Ah, yes, I did travel back to the 80's this morning watching the film Footloose starring then new comer, Kevin Bacon. The funny thing is that I performed Footloose in my high school, it's now like 5 years later and I realized when I bought this film yesterday that I had never seen the movie. I figured since it was so cheap for 5 bucks on DVD, I'd buy it for fun and I watched it this morning. Footloose is an absolute blast of a movie that I'm sure that anyone could get into. Yes, it's a bit of a time capsule, but it's still all in good fun. I liked how this wasn't necessarily your typical musical, it just had an awesome soundtrack with the movie. The story is just so much fun and original, you just fall in love with Ren McCormick from the start.<br/><br/>Ren is a new guy from the big city of Chicago coming into a small town and now this small town has banished dancing since a big accident that happened years ago that killed several teens after a dance, there were drugs and alcohol involved, so naturally these folks think that it's all apart of dancing. But Ren's getting a hard time from everyone because of his fun loving nature, but he makes friends with a wanna be cow boy, Willard. Soon he also becomes the preacher's rebellious daughter, Ariel's love interest. He wants the kids to have fun though and wants a big dance thrown for the town and must convince them to cut their foot loose.<br/><br/>Footloose is just a fun movie that I'm sure you'll have fun with. It's charming, it's funny, it's just a blast to watch, and it's an 80's classic. The acting was actually pretty good, we have a great cast that looked like they enjoyed themselves. Of course we'll always question how the kids just managed the skills of dancing, you'll see what I mean when you watch it, but it's all good. I would highly recommend this film, it's a fun one to watch. Kevin Bacon is totally cool and a must see for Footloose.<br/><br/>6/10"

It really smoked that stupid pointless remake that couldn't hold a simple storyline. This movie deserves to be looked at more seriously though because it really shows how cool it was to be a teenager in the 80s. R.I.P. to the 80's that'll never happen again. If you want to experience a nice cool breeze of the 80's that says welcome back this is the movie to see. Overall the film is always something to look back on and how classic it really is. The remake forget about it. It's just like another Psycho remake which sucks just as bad and this one's remake. I have to give this film a full 10 out of 10 because it'd be a crime not to."

","i love 'Footloose'. i wasn't exactly a high school kid when it came out, but i was still young and Innocent enough to really appreciate it. like so many from that generation.<br/><br/>there were a lot of films like this, with music, and aimed at a young audience, and like most other young people back then, i saw 'em all with very little critical judgment. but now that i'm older (much older), i have a tendency to analyze this kind of thing more. especially as a lot of these films that were once new have become retro.<br/><br/>i liked most of these films but they could be somewhat problematic at times. 'Saturday Night Fever' was a classic, but it could be too realistic and dreary in it's approach, and the storyline is kind of non-existent and a little pointless. i loved 'Flashdance' and the original 'Fame' movie, but those films, as good as they are, can be strangely cold and detached and make the viewer feel like a spectator, rather than a involved participant. 'Xanadu' is peachy, cute and adorable, but it 's just that, it's for babies. i mean what can you say about a movie where the ""big"" love scene is done with cutesy cartoon animals. i like 'Grease' a lot, but let's face it, that's a pretty silly and brain dead experience. fun though.<br/><br/>'Footloose' was one of the only ones that hit some kind of note of perfection. it is sweet without being corny. musical without being too over done. and it makes a strong message without being horribly preachy and a heavy-handed bore. everything in 'Footloose' clicks and works successfully.<br/><br/>this is a fun, enjoyable film without driving anything into the ground or home too hard.that's rare. also, despite under-age drinking, tobacco usage and mention of pre-marital sex, it's a good coming of age film and not too intense for teens who are weary of too many racy values and notions often injected into teen entertainment.<br/><br/>not to mention Kevin Bacon and Chris Penn are really good here. Chris Penn is actually very sexy and good looking here, it's hard to believe he became the bloated monster thing he was in later years. Penn remained a good actor, but compared with his youthful, sexy image here, he definitely became a trollish monster in comparison.<br/><br/>fun film with a strong Christian base. a teen classic."

","'Footloose (1984)' very much follows in the footsteps of 'Flashdance (1983)', designed specifically to trap teens in a cycle of pop songs and popcorn as the film sells the soundtrack and the soundtrack sells the film. Unlike that earlier piece, though, this actually seems to have had some effort put into its narrative. The story is set around the overtly religious residents of a small town who believe rock music, dancing and, even, certain books to be the work of the devil. It focuses on a transfer student who tries to rally against the system and legalise dancing - because, yes, dancing is literally illegal - so that he can host an end-of-year prom. The set-up is promising, a tried-and-tested 'young against old'/ 'boy against the system' sort of thing, but it isn't really capitalised on. The meat-and-potatoes of the picture doesn't start until far too late, meaning that the movie only really picks up towards its final movement. It's not bad but it's all rather basic, with simple characterisations and no real sense of elapsing time. It doesn't feel like a high-school movie. It doesn't feel like a dance movie, either, because there are actually only a few proper dancing sequences (including a montage that may just be the most singularly eighties thing I've ever seen). The segments in which John Lithgow's reverend has to contend with the fact that his daughter is growing up are probably the most engaging, even if they aren't exactly deep and don't really entertain. As a whole, the film is just fine. It has a few enjoyable moments but it's typically a rather passive experience. There are a number of genuinely great songs on its soundtrack, which are easily the best thing about the entire affair. It's just a shame that the film itself can't live up to these. 5/10"

","I used to LOVE this movie, and I remember I got the soundtrack for Easter when I was like, 11 or something. It really is a crummy movie, but oddly engaging... mainly because it is so incredibly surreal and laughable in how it takes itself so seriously.<br/><br/>*Possible Spoilers*<br/><br/>I remember even as a kid, I thought ""Holy cow, for a town that didn't allow dancing and music for years, these kids sure can dance well.""  What are even funnier are the people who are in it - Lithgow did this film two years after Garp. Did he think that this was going to be a meaty role? But then again, he did willingly star in Third Rock from the Sun. And Dianne Wiest - Woody Allen staple and Oscar winner, who has about 4 lines in the movie. Her job is to pretty much look pensive and pious. I don't think I even need to bring up Mr. Kevin Bacon and his goofy dance through the grain mill.<br/><br/>
While this film is not as inherently horrible as say, Xanadu, it's also not nearly as hilarious because it takes itself waaaaaaay too seriously. Of course, it has its moments, especially the part where the dance is beginning and no one is dancing. Why? Let's pretend it's not because Kevin Bacon isn't there in his stupid outfit to scream ""Let's Daaaaaaaance!!!!!!!!"", (rather, is outside getting his ass beat down by the head redneck until he somehow manages to pull out of it and kick said redneck's ass. How the hell did THAT happen?) But in reality because the song playing is the Loverboy guy and Ann Wilson's ""Almost Paradise."" I think that as kids if we were sexually oppressed and sheltered and that song came on we wouldn't have danced to that crap song either.  Yes, this was the 80's, and mid-80's to boot so the clothes, dancing and dialogue are hilariously dated.  These kids must have somehow obtained pirate copies of Radio Free Solid Gold Dancers or something, especially the skinny white kid doing ""The Robot"".<br/><br/>This movie is up there with 80's `classics' like `Flashdance' where we find that while most of us loved the movie as kids, we see it through adult eyes twenty years later and realize what our parents probably thought:  `What a crap movie.'  The difference being, our nostalgia sometimes compels us to avoid averting our eyes, like a train wreck.<br/><br/>--Shelly"
"jayjaycee","7","0","0","1 July 2020"," A necessary rebellion
","""Footloose"" is a romantic drama directed by Herbert Ross starring Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer. The 1980s were the natal era of the subgenre of dance films as we know them today. Contrary to its parent genre of musicals, of which the dancing was a of course a crucial aspect as well, this one focussed less on the singing and the exaggerated depiction of its subject matter, and despite its odd gambolling, centred more around establishing more or less serious, light-hearted, mainstream oriented romances for the youth instead. While the prime example of this lucrative era was without a doubt Emile Ardolino's box office hit ""Dirty Dancing"", there were two films prior to it that paved the way for it: ""Flashdance"" and ""Footloose"". Both were released around the same time, and as I heard it from the majority, there even was some kind of war among fans, arguing which of the two is the better one. Supposedly, this in fact trivial subject resulted in the fans building two opposing camps. When I asked my parents about it, I knew that this myth was true, as my mother is in team ""Footloose"", while my father considers himself an advocate of ""Flashdance"". That was the moment I knew that I had to explore this strange phenomenon myself, and when I by happenstance was able to obtain a copy of one of those infamous films, I had no other choice than giving both a watch. While I haven't had the chance so far to obtain the other, I was surprisingly pleased with the outcome of this 1984 flick. The basic premise of this film is how one young man from outside causes a revolution in a small town where the act of dancing has been legally prohibited. To be honest, at first, I considered it to be an absurd idea. In what sort of hicksville would something abstruse like that in fact occur? Where would it be actually realistic? The answer was a simple as astonishing: in a small town shaped by religious beliefs and values. What is shown in this film shocked me, as it wasn't just some rules laid down by some clerics, no, the members of the parish council in this film are best described as religious fanatics to me. The way they have imposed a curfew on their children, disallow them to listen to rock music, as they claim it to be the music of the devil (boy, I wonder what they would have said when Deathcore was already existing at that time), the way they outlaw the existence of dancing, ban the consumption of alcohol and drugs in any form, and even the reading of certain pieces of classic literature just made me angry while watching it. This is good old oppression of the personal development of teenagers, and not forgetting, methods used by Nazis in some way (who else burned books stating that it doesn't fit the general ideology?). From the start on, the film wants to establish a classic enemy image and characterizes the town's regime as the hostile that requires to be rebelled against, while Ren MacCormack, a shy yet talented boy new in town, is established as the saviour. I personally like this structure, as Kevin Bacon is really pleasant as the rebellious outsider and becomes the identification figure pretty quickly, someone who doesn't just take what he is said and fights for the freedom of himself and his fellow teenagers who haven't dared to disobey before he arrived. That is what I love this flick most for. The aspect of dancing functions only as a means to an end in this film and is only an exemplary expression of resistance against a system that doesn't want them to be what they want to be. Even if it isn't masterfully executed, I still acknowledge what it aims for. Even if the film tends to express an extremely biased opinion towards the parental generation, it also tries to explain their point of view and why they treat their children with this extraordinary strictness. Kept in perspective, it is still undeniably wrong to oppress children like this, but as it was mentioned that Reverend Moore (decently played by John Lithgow) initiated all this as the result of his own personal trauma after the untimely death of his own son, it took a lot of his apparent malevolence away and gave him a lot of humanity instead. Furthermore, his wife (portrayed by the lovely Diane Wiest) functions as the voice of reason for her vulnerable and overprotective husband and decreases the one-dimensionality even more. What is there worth criticising then? Well, even if the values it wants to convey are powerful and utterly important, the story at times didn't dare to go to the extremes, the conflict could have been more intense and the resistance on the part of the parents could have been more intensive. I mean, this uncouth young boy arrives at their town, starts a revolution and threatens to disturb the peace and destroy the system of oppression they tediously built up and they seemingly tolerate it just like that. Also, aside from Bacon's presentation in the abandoned factory, the montage of him teaching his buddy how to do dance correctly and the final scene at the senior prom, the film has literally no other scenes that involve dancing at all. For a film that revolves about this topic and makes it its primary focus, this lack appears quite inconvenient to me. Bacon and the rest of the cast are apparently extremely talented, no doubt whatsoever, but they just don't get enough time to present their skills, nor the opportunity to shine as they all deserve it to. No, the film has some undeniable flaws in terms of narration, but the thing that keeps me from disliking it, is how it represents the mindset of a whole generation that desired to express themselves and what they believed in, no matter what others say about them. Even if it is far away from being as masterful as the exact film, it is commemorative of counterculture classic ""Easy Rider"", as both convey the ideas of their respective, by parents and the mainstream despised generation. All in all, this classic dance film might lack some narrative strength and a certain kind of conflict potential, but it is utterly entertaining, light-hearted and bares messages too important to ignore. The performances are acceptable, the dialogue isn't all cheesy and makes me feel good the whole time, nevertheless. It has got, heart, rhythm and a catch soundtrack. An essential, light-footed and uplifting drama that knows to be iconic and essential for a generation and knows to bust a move. No masterpiece, but a lovely film that is too enjoyable to be ignored. We'll see how well its direct opponent will do."

","Packed with great music and abundance of energy, Footloose is here to kick off your Sunday shoes! After a tragic accident left a small, religious town mourning, dancing is off limits here. Too bad Ren didn't know. Too bad Ren doesn't care. He's new in town, but refuses to be the one to get pushed over. Going toe to toe with the town preacher is going to be a task all on its own, who helped pass the ordinance years ago, but hows everything going to fall into place when he falls for his young teenage daughter? Highly stylized for its time, and filled with plenty of catchy tunes, Footloose is going to make you want to turn your own living room into a dance floor. Kevin Bacon alone reigns supreme with his spunk, and it can't be denied he had some natural knack for this role as the new kid who is brave enough to turn some of the bible verses against the preacher ( played flawlessly by John Lithgow, surprisingly a great actor for this particular role.) If you're not ready to be energized, stay away from here, because Footloose will leave you losing your blues!"
"gab-14712","8","0","0","5 April 2020"," Cheesy, but absolutely fun!!
","Off the bat, I'll admit that 1984's Footloose is pure, thrashy 1980's silliness. And.....I'm completely down for it. The movie holds dear to my soul because it is a big part of my childhood. My sixth-grade class spent a good portion of the year learning the songs, and our class trip was to see a play based on the hit movie in the lovely town of New Hope, Pennsylvania. The music is legitimately fantastic. Pure 80's music, but absolutely delightful songs. Who can resist the urge not to start dancing when the title song performed by Kenny Loggins comes on the radio, or Deneice Williams, ""Let's Hear It for the Boy."" These songs actually went on to be nominated for Academy Awards.<br/><br/>No matter how preposterous the plot sounds, it's actually based on a real story. In 1898, the Oklahoma town of Elmore City outlawed dancing. A pastor from a nearby town was quoted saying dancing led to alcohol which would eventually lead to death. The city made national headlines in 1980 when a junior prom was awarded to the town and the city's council overturned the law....just barely. Screenwriter Dean Pritchard became very interested in the story, and did his due diligence with his research. He also wrote the lyrics to many of the original songs. Paramount boarded the film and then Herbert Ross (Weekend at Bernie's) was hired to direct the film.<br/><br/>Taking forth the classic theme of rebellion, the film introduces us to Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon), a city boy who moved from Chicago to the oilfields in the middle of nowhere. He also loves to dance and listen to his rock'n'roll music. But he suffers a serious case of culture shock when he finds out they are banned in his new town. His misery is tested when he meets Ariel (Lori Singer), a very popular but troubled blonde. She is also the daughter of Reverend Shaw (John Lithgow) who came up with the law after his son died in a car crash because of the booze. The two have a troubled relationship, which is why Shaw's wife, Vi (Dianne Wiest) is the mediator. Now then Ren is in town, he is ready to rile up the town and bring back dancing!<br/><br/>The performances are solid. Kevin Bacon is your quintessential 80's character. The hairdo, the dancing, the confident teenager and he brings forth plenty of charm as Ren. It looks like he is one amazing dancer, but fun fact! He only did some of the dances as four stunt doubles were used with Bacon. John Lithgow does well as the Bible-thumping minister who is the foil to Bacon's dancing habits. Dianne Wiest, as you may notice with all her roles, is a very soothing presence. As a normal routine for 1980's flicks, keep an eye out for future stars. Such as Sarah Jessica Parker as Ariel's friend and Chris Penn as Ren's friend.<br/><br/>This movie may not be the best musical, but it's one of the more memorable ones. I mean who can resist the toe-tapping dance sequences or any of the music really. The movie throws an exorbitant amount of cheese at you and you have to be willing to suck in the cheese. If not, I have a feeling you may not enjoy the movie. Or you may be one of those who abhors dancing.<br/><br/>Footloose was a major box office hit and one of the highest-grossing films of 1984. It became a cult classic considering how many people are devoted to it now. It's hard to believe this is based on a true story, but it most certainly is. The music is wonderful and never grows old. The performances are sweet. The script is cheesy, but what else can we expect from a 1980's teen musical. I certainly had a fun time!<br/><br/>My Grade: B"
"Diego_rjc","3","4","12","28 January 2010"," At least it's better than 'Flashdance'
","Back in 1984, when 'Footloose' came out, dance movies were very popular. After the success of 1970's productions, like 'Saturday Night Fever', everyone was trying to get some in the 1980's. That's where the problem began. Every dance movie that came out, you already knew what was going to happen, what is it about, etc. And with 'Footloose', is no different.<br/><br/>This movie tells the story of Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon), a boy from Chicago that moves to a small town. There, while falling in love with the Reverend's daughter (Lori Singer), he finds out that there is a law against dancing in this town(!), now he tries to organize a dancing ball for his class and fights against his law. From this, you already know what's going to happen, and it's really boring. The plot is really absurd, if it was set in the 1950's, it would be believable. At least the movie has a few sub-plots, but none of them is interesting or gets your attention, they are all cliché and predictable. <br/><br/>By in the middle of it, I kept thinking ""If this a dance movie, why a plot? What about the dancing?"". And that's where lies the problem of the movie. A dance movie with no dancing! The soundtrack is excellent with great original songs like 'Footloose' and 'Let's hear it from the boy', but you don't get to see anyone dancing in the most of the movie. Instead, what you get are bad-made dialogs and a non-believable story.<br/><br/>The acting here is ridiculous. Kevin Bacon looks more like a gay alien and nothing else, and Lori Singer isn't beautiful at all. Thankfully, the movie has John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest, and they really saved the movie. They are both excellent as the Reverend and his wife. The other aspects aren't even worth mentioning, but Herbert Ross' directing really bothered me with close-ups of people's feet.<br/><br/>Overral, this is a really bad dance movie. The direction bothers you, and the two leads don't act their ways out. But the nice soundtrack and original songs, as well as John Lithgow and Dianne Wiest made the movie watchable. It's better then 'Flashdance', what doesn't say much, but it's nothing compared to better dance movies, like 'Saturday Night Fever'<br/><br/>3/10"

","This movie could have had some serious potential but unfortunately it was just bland. The plot itself is not bad and it's actually interesting but the execution of it was pretty horrendous. A kid who moves from Chicago to a small town, that could actually be an interesting premise to build on but it just did not work.<br/><br/>A plot should be clear and focused, in this case there was just way too much jumping around different plot points to the point where it actually became annoying. There weren't any stand out moments from the film except the warehouse dance scene which was pretty good. The other points such daring each other with tractors, jumping from one vehicle to another and standing in front of the train were honestly just dumb. While teenagers often do stupid things, there's never that much stupidity in the span of a few days.<br/><br/>The whole plot with the reverend and his daughter is just uninteresting and it ought to have been handled differently. The film does a good job of showing character growth but it was so dull that it just didn't matter because we weren't invested in the character.<br/><br/>The final dance scene was okay, although I wasn't too keen on the actual dancing itself. It did lack talent but that's not a major issue. For a film about dancing, there was actually very little dancing.<br/><br/>There were certainly some great parts but I was waiting for the film to pick up and when it did, it was towards the end at which point I had simply lost interest.<br/><br/>The good parts of the film weren't strong enough to overcome the bad and so I think this will remain a pretty dull movie."

","When you hear the premise of ""Footloose"", it's easy to assume that it will be filled with broad cartoon characters, but it isn't. A town where dancing is outlawed?! What kind of madness, is this? I actually found that despite the somewhat contrived premise, the movie really works as a way of showing how dancing is a liberating experience. The main cast is well developed and we can sympathize and understand who they are as they experience growth and change. The dance sequences are full of energy and will make you want to get up and imitate Kevin Bacon's fast feet, while the music and dialog are sure to make you remember what it was like to be a teen in the 80's (or just a teen in general). I also really admired the film's attempt to have its characters solve problems in an intelligent way. A lot of the teenage rebellion movies I've seen go for either a comical resolution, or an overly sappy one, but it's neither here. The rebellion consists of debate and talking, instead of vandalizing and violence. I did have a problem with a scene towards the end that doesn't follow with the non-violent approach, but otherwise I felt like it did try to make a movie about teenage rebellion that has a brain. I think it's very much a product of its time, and it works because watching it today, it is kind of dated, but in a good way, in a way that's simpler than today's overly cynical views. ""Footloose"" isn't perfect but it's a great time at the movies. (Theatrical version on the big screen, August 15, 2012)"
"Michael_Elliott","Null","2","5","7 September 2012"," Fun Teenage Rebelion Picture
","Footloose (1984) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A teen (Kevin Bacon) from Chicago moves to a small city, which has been ruined by a preacher (John Lithgow) and his wife (Dianne Wiest) who have convinced everyone that dancing and rock music are sins. The teen gets in trouble for what he believes in but soon he starts to show the others what a good time can come from dancing. Yes, the story is incredibly silly and yes it's incredibly predictable but who cares when something is this fun? FOOTLOOSE is just like those drive-in films from the 1950s, the ones that tried to explain to parents why rock and roll music wouldn't turn them into evil demons. This type of film was running wild back in the 1950s and I think it works perfectly well when updated to 1984. Again, I don't blame anyone for attacking the story but those who do so are just taking it way too serious when the main goal of the movie was to have viewers just kicking back and having a good time. I think the majority of the success is due to the terrific performance from Bacon who perfectly fits the role of the outcast who tries to take on an entire community. Bacon was exceptionally believable in the part and handled everything from the dramatic scenes to the lighter ones. Even his dancing hits the high marks. Lori Singer doesn't come close to matching him but she makes for a nice supporting player in the role of the girlfriend. Lithgow is his typical entertaining self and it's nice seeing Wiest even though her role is terribly underwritten. Another big thumbs up has to go to Christopher Penn in his role of the redneck who doesn't know how to dance. Another major factor to the film's success is the terrific soundtrack including the hit title track by Kenny Loggins. I'm not sure why anyone would go into FOOTLOOSE expecting some sort of art picture. It's a fast, fun film dealing with teenagers and rock and roll. It might not be a Bergman film but it's still very entertaining and that's the most important thing."

","I really enjoyed watching this movie, but the one thing that irritated me was Ariel, I just DID NOT like her character, and have no idea why Ren would take an interest in her. I know that she was very pretty, but she was annoying and thought that she was the best thing in the world and she was a slut. I know that that's not even what the movie was about, it just really bothered me.<br/><br/>I would recommend watching this movie because it is something different, but in a good way. This small town in Georgia has made dancing illegal, which we all know would probably NEVER happen. It's about this one guy who moves from a big city to this small town and fights against the court trying to make it legal again. <br/><br/>I do live in Atlanta, Georgia, and I do know that people here don't have a strong southern accent because we live in such a big city with many different people from around the world. I do know what people sound like outside of Atlanta, and the way they sounded in the movie was not it, but it didn't bother me that much. Willard was probably the only person who sounded like a true Georgia southerner. I would definitely watch this movie!!"
"zardoz-13","10","2","5","20 October 2011"," A Toe-Tapping Cult Masterpiece
","Kevin Bacon plays a rebel with a cause in ""Steel Magnolias"" director Herbert Ross's teenage dance musical ""Footloose."" Our high school age hero arouses the wrath of the city fathers when he tries to abolish a certain sacred city ordinance. Born and raised in Chicago, Illinois, Ren MacCormack finds himself uprooted when his mom returns to her rural hometown of Bomont, Utah, after her husband abandons her. This oppressive Utah town bans rock 'n roll music, high school dancing sans chaperons, and students out past curfew. The status quo also frowns on 'inappropriate' literature, specifically ""Slaughterhouse-Five,"" and they have fired English teachers for assigning controversial books like the Kurt Vonnegut novel. If our fish-out-of-water protagonist didn't have a hard enough time, Ren must contend with a righteous, killjoy, minister, the latter's rebellious daughter, the local constabulary, and haughty high school administrators. This lively PG-rated tale contains some profanity, a men's locker room shower scene with bare bottoms, examples of suicidal behavior, and some of the most memorable pop tunes from the 1980s. Indeed, the Kenny Loggins' song ""Footloose"" and the Tom Snow song ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"" received Academy Award nominations for best original music. Lyricist Dean Pitchford co-wrote both songs with Loggins and Snow in addition to penning the screenplay. Earlier, Pitchford shared an Oscar statute with Michael Gore for the Best Song for ""Fame."" <br/><br/>After Ren MacCormack arrives in Bomont, he learns to his chagrin that he can get in trouble for playing loud music in his yellow Volkswagen Beetle. No sooner has Ren shown up for school than he encounters his first critic, Willard Hewitt (Christopher Penn of ""True Romance""), but they wind up become pals despite their vast differences. Meanwhile, the preacher's daughter Ariel Moore (Lori Singer of ""Summer Heat"") and her best friend Rusty (Sarah Jessica Parker of ""Sex and the City"") like what they see because Ren doesn't dress like everybody else. These gals aren't the only ones making eyes at Ren. His uncle's adolescent daughter Amy calls Ren 'a fox' and wants to give him a potato at diner. Unfortunately for Ren, he runs afoul of Ariel's hell-raising boyfriend Chuck Cranston (Jim Youngs of ""Hotshot"") and his marijuana puffing pals and Chuck challenges Ren to a game of chicken at his father's property where they drive tractors at each other with Ren on a John Deere and Chuck a Dual. Ren's sneaker shoestring get snagged and he cannot bail out. This stroke of luck prompted Chuck to bail out first and Ren wins. <br/><br/>As it turns out, Ariel is a hellion herself. Early in the action, she straddles Chuck's pick-up truck and her friend's car as they race down a two-lane blacktop highway with an 18-wheeler bearing down on them. This is one of the most exciting scenes in ""Footloose."" Later, Ariel plays chicken with a train and Ren has to knock her out of the way at the last minute. Anyway, one of Chuck's friends try to get Ren in trouble in school by slipping him a marijuana joint and a school faculty member spots the joint in Ren's fingers. He chases Ren into a toilet stall but is too late to confiscate the evidence. This entire scene is handled more adeptly in the remake. Eventually, Ren decides to take Ariel, Rusty, and Willard out of town to a bar where dancing is allowed and he learns that Willard cannot dance a lick. When Ren decides to change the city ordinance against dancing, he challenges Willard to learn how to dance. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reverend Moore slaps his hellion of a daughter during an argument and sets his own wife, Vi Moore (Dianne Wiest of ""The Lost Boys""), against him. She challenges Shaw to improve his one-on-one skills. You see, the Reverend has been a power broker in Bomont in that he helped pass the ordinance forbidding dancing and cacophonous music. Secretly, Shaw finds himself struggling to be a Sheppard watching over the town. Sadly, for Ren, his petition to change the no dancing law fails, but he is approached by his boss who runs the The Lehi Rollermills, a flour mill just outside the Bomont City limits. They fix up the mill and arrange to have the dance there. On the night of the dance, after the Moores have allowed Ariel to attend, Chuck and his cronies show up to spoil things, but they run into more than they asked for and get solidly whipped. Part of the beauty of ""Footloose"" is that Ren doesn't get to change the city ordinance, but he is permitted to throw his dance. Reverend Moore emerges as a round character because he changes during the process and asks for God's blessings and prayers to guide the youth while they are at the dance.<br/><br/>Director Herb Ross doesn't wear out his welcome with this quasi-melodramatic, 107-minute opus, and the cast delivers strong performances. Several barely known thespians who shined aside from the leaping and lunging Bacon were future ""Sex in the City"" starlet Sarah Jessica Parker, Sean Penn's late brother Christopher, and John Lithgow as the minister who astonished audiences with his work in ""Terms of Endearment."" Budgeted at a mere $8 million, ""Footloose"" reportedly coined over $80 million at the box office. ""Footloose"" was one of a number of hit movies loaded with a Top-40 play list, like ""Saturday Night Fever"" and ""Flashdance"" that stormed theaters in the 1980s when MTV was changing the way people looked and listened to music. Hard as it is to believable, ""Footloose"" was almost shot down before it was released. Furthermore, Kevin Bacon was not the studio's first choice. Indeed, Madonna auditioned for the role that Lori Singer wound up playing."
"abundidi1184","Null","2","5","25 September 2011"," Liked it as much as I did when it came out
","In the early eighties there were a few movies like this; Dirty Dancing, Fame, and Flashdance. This was my least favorite of them all. I'm sure there is a town which banned dancing somewhere in this country, but that's why I liked this one the least. Despite the ban on dancing, most of the teens knew how to dance. It just didn't ring true. Don't get me wrong, the acting was very good, especially from John Lithgow and Diane Wiest, who never disappoint. Kevin Bacon was convincing as the rebel, and Lori Singer was good too. I guess the transformation of the late Chris Penn was more like science fiction then a non-dancer turning into a Michael Jackson over night. I would have preferred that he did okay. Then there was the flashback of the last 2 years of high school I spent in rural Kansas. A big Saturday night was spent ""cow tipping"" or swinging off a rope and diving into a river. Of course that was after everyone but me was drunk. I couldn't relate. I didn't participate, and thought it was lame-brained. I feel that the Kevin Bacon would have shown a little bit more of ""I'm in Hell"" than he did. Anyway, I loved the soundtrack. Watching it 27 years later tonight was for the soundtrack. Kevin Bacon has done much better work since then."

","I enjoyed it in 1984 when it came out and I enjoyed it 24 years later, watching it on DVD. As soon as I finished watching the movie again, I watched it again with Kevin Bacon's commentary and then again with the commentary of the writer and producer.<br/><br/>Most of the commentary is just of the he/she is really great variety. However, there are a couple of amazing revelations. First, Herbert Ross, the director, had to fight for Kevin Bacon against the studio. Apparently, Tom Cruise was scheduled to star, but there was a scheduling conflict. Ross forced Bacon to do a screen test and showed it to the studio execs. If they hadn't come around, he would have walked off the picture and that would have been the end of it. Fortunately, the screen test worked. The second big revelation is that Ross originally had a very low key ending with no real dancing in the final dance sequence. It was only when test audiences gave the film thumbs down that he finally agreed to shoot the upbeat final dance number. Fortunately, he was flexible enough to make the change, so we get a terrific ending and one of the greatest and most fun dance movies of all time.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Kevin Bacon and Lori Singer is terrific and Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker are both great in their sidekick, comedian roles. Diane Wiest gets lost, but John Lithgow is amazingly effective as the regressive, but intelligent preacher.<br/><br/>Along with Grease and Dirty Dancing, this is one of the three greatest musical/dancing movies of the 1980's."

","OK, so a town where it's illegal to dance makes no sense, but everything about ""Footloose"" makes it worthwhile. The plot of course has big city boy Ren McCormick (Kevin Bacon) moving to a small town where Rev. Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) has banned dancing, and challenging this. Prior to watching this movie, I'd heard ""Let's Hear It For the Boy"" in a gym class, but I didn't know that it was used in this movie. Also starring are Lori Singer, Frances Lee McCain (the ""Gremlins"" mom), Dianne Wiest, and Chris Penn. All in all, not a masterpiece, but definitely an enjoyable movie.<br/><br/>Banning dancing.

","Of all dance films, ""Footloose"" ranks up there with ""Dirty Dancing."" It is a great film with an excellent Top 40 soundtrack. It was later made into a highly successful Broadway musical. But the story really makes the film a hit.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon is Ren McCormick, a Chicago teenager who moves with his mother to a small Midwestern town called Bomont after his father leaves. Bomont is a conservative, Bible belt community run by Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow). As the new kid, Ren is seen as a rebel and has difficulty fitting in to the straight-laced ways of Bomont, including a ban on dancing. Things get complicated when he takes up with Ariel (Lori Singer), the minister's daughter. Shaw will not hear of this because Ren ""is a troublemaker."" Furthermore, Ren decides the high school should throw a dance, and the town should reverse the no-dancing law! As one can guess, this will be difficult if not impossible. Shaw Moore will do everything in his power to keep the law in place, because dancing ""is a sin."" Amidst this, wife Vi (Dianne Wiest), while supportive of her husband, feels Shaw has drifted away from the family-oriented man he once was, and longs for these days again. Throw in there a humorous subplot involving Willard (Chris Penn), who doesn't know how to dance and befriends Ren. Can Ren convince Shaw Moore and Bomont that a dance will bring not only renewed freedom of expression, but also emotional and spiritual healing?<br/><br/>""Footloose"" is a story that could have taken place, as there are some, however few, real-life communities like Bomont. But the testament of the story rests in the lead's ability to do something different: challenge the ways of the church and the town for a chance at a better life. The soundtrack provides excellent support with Pop/Rock, R & B, and slow ballads. Combine the drama and musical genres, and you have one great story for the stage and screen."

","Footloose was such a popular movie when I was growing up. I just had the opportunity to see it again the other day. I'm a bit mixed on this movie because I did indeed find the corniness undeniable but the overriding message was so sweet and this such an ultimate feel good movie I really would have a hard time completely ragging on this movie.<br/><br/>My problem with this movie isn't that I find it corny now, it's that I didn't like it then either-and I am a big fan, both of musicals and teen movies. I also like feel good movies and appreciate the message of the movie. Still-Footloose never captivated me as did so many other teen movies of this time period. After viewing it again, I find my feelings have not gotten fonder or lessened-it's pretty much stayed the same.<br/><br/>I think the reason why it never captivated me is the music pure and simple. With musicals, one has to like the music being played because the music is as important as the overall message. Phantom of the Opera is a great example, you can't dig the story if the music doesn't grab you. The music in Footloose never got me so I didn't enjoy the musical numbers. Many musicals can be corny while still having remarkable elements to them. I do, however know that so many DID find this remarkable. I have friends who are Footloose purists. In my case, It's not that I liked it and then changed my mind, it's that I never liked it at all. The movie really bored me at times and I found a lot of it cheesy yet I could still appreciate the underlying theme of it all.<br/><br/>I think a 6 is an appropriate rating for Footloose, I'd never rank it below average because I do not think it could be considered dreadful. But I do think it's quite over rated and the comparisons to Grease I find a bit baffling because I don't think it can begin to touch a movie like Grease. Still, I could see where Footloose would be an appealing choice to some and it is considered by many to be a teen classic. This definitely isn't the worst of the genre but it isn't the best either and my rating is 6 of 10."

It starts by taking the teen angst storyline from Rebel Without A Cause and adds a twist of dogmatic puritan religious beliefs. And unlike Rebel, Footloose doesn't just focus on the angst and leave it unresolved; it demonstrates an opening of intergenerational diologue and tolerance. I would say that 2-4% of the script is cheesy, but overall very good and not very dated at all."

The film does star Kevin Bacon though, and he is not the typical lead in a film such as this so he adds something to the film as does John Lithgow.

(I've personally known people that dislike Bacon and has bashed him for everything).<br/><br/>Yes folks, there still are people in the world that think that all rock music and dancing should be banned for their own reasons. Wolfman Jack fought this same issue in his own way. The movie ""Footloose"" fights back with a great story and wonderful film. <br/><br/>""Rock and Roll Ain't Noise Pollution.

","Honestly, I had to revisit this small (minded) town once I saw the 2011 Footloose remake trailer.<br/><br/>The biggest question I have is: how the hell could they make this relevant in today's time? Though it was a 100% iconic 80s movie, it was probably barely relevant then – 27 years ago.<br/><br/>I'm referring to the basic premise of a kid, Ren (Ha – it's so hard to think of the all-around guy, Kevin Bacon, as a ""kid"") moving with his single mother to a small, religious town where it's – GASP – illegal to dance. Heck, it was probably frowned upon the mom being a single mother, but that's not explored.<br/><br/>Well, Ren can't sit still, let alone fit in, until he makes friends (and a few enemies) and he shakes things up, namely with the great and powerful Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow) and his stunning (for 1984, that is) daughter, Ariel (Lori Singer.)<br/><br/>So, they cross many barriers, including county lines to put on a senior dance<br/><br/>Wait, you don't know the premise of Footloose by now? If not, let me also fill you in who Luke Skywalker's father is<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the first half of the movie does NOT hold up wellfor those who have never seen this. I did grow up with this, so none of the (ENORMOUSLY, EXCEEDINGLY) dated scenes really bothered me that much, nor the music – it's one of my all-time favorite soundtracks, after all.<br/><br/>Kids these daysno I mean it: Kids, these days, try and get past the ""ancient"" feel of the movie and at least, dive into the second half, that surprisingly replaces main character Ren and his ""growth"" and shifts to the Reverend Moore's development, with help from his wife, Vi (the always lovely Dianne Wiest.) In a sense, Moore becomes the new main character and it's absolutely believable and touching. You literally stop rooting for Ren, as his character never changes (not that he needed to) and cheer for Moore to succeed.<br/><br/>The movie's a lot deeper than it appears on the surface, or synopsis. Again, it has a fantastic soundtrack and believable small town ignorance. I will say, boy they could get away with murder back then. And, yeah, I noticed this as a kid, as well: in addition to ""guys giving the birdie,"" language and themes, there's a shower/locker room scene with several male backsides exposed. Gees, and it was PG. Today it would be R. Maybe the good, ole Reverend has put his mark on the MPAA in today's times<br/><br/>And speaking of today's timesI must see the latest remake in Hollywood, of this classic. I want to see how they explain how ""dancing"" is so bad when it's so clearly ""okay"" according to Ren who quotes from the same Bible the Reverend uses to speak out against it (in a great town hall scene in this movie.)<br/><br/>Beyond people who grew up with this movie, it's highly recommended to today's kids who want to see what (God, I feel old for saying this) kind of lives and troubles their parents had to endure in their own childhood."
"bkoganbing","7","1","3","1 June 2010"," ""Let's Hear It For The Boy""
","Based on a true incident that happened in a small Oklahoma town, young Kevin Bacon arrives at a small town in one of the reddest parts of the USA. This small town is positively crimson because they've actually outlawed dancing except maybe in the privacy of your own home.<br/><br/>This extreme and probably unconstitutional law started when a few years ago Reverend John Lithgow and Dianne Weist's son was killed after one of these dances. Lithgow himself is not an extremist, but he's letting some of the more extreme rednecks in the town to start in on book burning. As Robert Preston said in The Music Man, ""Gotta keep the young ones moral after school"".<br/><br/>Of course Bacon takes up with Lori Singer who is Lithgow and Weist's other child when he arrives and she's quite the wild child. But his standing up to her old man impresses her like none of the other young men in the town. <br/><br/>Footloose has a nice liberal message about the excesses of religious zeal which is certainly pertinent for today. But it's the musical score in the film that really makes it special, one of the best scores of the Eighties. The title song and Let's Hear It For The Boy both received Oscar nominations for Best Original Song.<br/><br/>This film proved to be Kevin Bacon's breakout role as an actor. Although he never was quite leading man material as his subsequent career has proved, he's certainly had staying power in playing a nice variety of roles of both good and bad and mixed individuals. No question here he's the good guy outsider. Best scene for me is him teaching Christopher Penn how to dance to Let's Hear It For The Boy.<br/><br/>A film quite ground in the Eighties, Footloose still has much relevance for today's audience."
"callanvass","7","1","3","2 April 2010"," Not just your typical 80's fluff, it's got heart.
","Footloose is far from an original movie, but it's got the heart it needs to be an entertaining 80's diversion. What I love about the 80's is the cheese factor, and Footloose has plenty of that, but in a good way, that's one thing a lot of movies lack now a days. Kevin Bacon is pretty solid and charismatic in his 1st lead role, but the heart and sole of the movie in my opinion is Lori Singer. I just found more to relate to her then I did Ren's character. It has all the usual typical 80 clichés, like abusive men, cheesy dance sequences, classic 80's songs, and a happy ending, but that is one of the reason why 80's movies were so great, they have the heart like a lot movies now a days don't have. The best sequence in the movie had to be where Ren|Bacon| teaches Williard|Chris Penn| how to dance, it's funny and quite touching at the same time. Footloose isn't a masterpiece, nor is it gonna make your day, but it will do is entertain you for 100 or so minutes.<br/><br/>Performances. Kevin Bacon is pretty good in his 1st starring role. This is the role that pretty much made him a star, but he does have his green moments. Lori Singer is beautiful, and gives the best performance in the film. I was amazed by her ferocity and how she wouldn't back down from anything, and I felt sorry for what she had to deal with. John Lithgow gives an excellent performance as an over-protective preacher. He will test your patience, but he is so good, you can't help but appreciate him. Chris Penn is really good in a supporting role, as Ren's best friend. Sarah Jessica Parker has a small role as Rusty, she was too cute.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Footloose is an entertaining 80's film. It's great for nostalgia reasons, and it will put a smile on your face when all is said and done. Recommended<br/><br/>7/10"
"g-bodyl","8","1","3","20 March 2010"," Great Film!
","Footloose is a pretty good film. I thought it's better than what people portray this movie to be. I know that this is not Grease, but it's better than Flashdance. I have wanted to see this film since i went on a sixth grade field trip to see a play based on this film.<br/><br/>This film is based on a ridiculous but true story. It's about a town that has banned dancing. But the new kid in town played by an amazing Kevin Bacon is about to defy that rule and get the minister's daughter while he's at it.<br/><br/>My favorite scene in the movie is the very beginning when we see all the shoes dance. The soundtrack is really good. I love Kenny Loggins because he performs great music. Also, RIP Chris Penn! You were good in this movie. I rate this film 8/10."

","Kevin Bacon is ""Footloose"" in this 1984 film which also stars John Lithgow, Dianne Wiest, Lori Singer, and Chris Penn. Bacon is Ren, the new kid in a town that doesn't allow dancing, and he sets out to change that.<br/><br/>That's actually about all there is to the plot, except that Ren gets involved with pretty Ariel, the daughter of the preacher (John Lithgow). Ariel likes to play chicken with things like trains and cars. In fact, all these kids have hormones, impulses, and energy that are in desperate need of an outlet.<br/><br/>""Footloose"" has one of the best soundtracks ever, and some wonderful dancing. Despite its serious moments, it has a relentlessly upbeat and exuberant feel to it. Herb Ross directed; originally, it was supposed to be Michael Cimino. It certainly would have been a different film with him directing. Take ""Footloose"" for what it is, don't ask for ""Citizen Kane,"" and you'll love it."

","Like the ""Special Collector's Edition"" DVD says, ""'Footloose' jumps with spirit, dazzling dance numbers, and an electrifying musical score.

And, Mr. Penn's dance instruction is topflight.<br/><br/>******* Footloose (2/17/84) Herbert Ross ~ Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, John Lithgow, Chris Penn"
"CitizenCaine","6","1","3","26 September 2009"," Bacon's Starmaker Role
","Footloose is the film that made Kevin Bacon a star. The simple premise follows a Chicago teenager and his mother to live in some town named Bomont, and it's unclear where this is exactly. However, we see snow-capped mountains in the distance, and the film was obviously made out west (Utah to be precise). Even though the story was based on a true incident from a few years before, it was probably wise not to identify the town or even state in the movie. What town would want to be associated with banning public dancing? <br/><br/>Lori Singer is the wild child, preacher's daughter who takes a shine to Bacon when he arrives. Trouble is she takes a shine to a lot of other guys as well. Bacon befriends Christopher Penn at school and later teaches him to dance. The kids cross the border into the next unnamed state to see what they've been missing. They rattle the town board when Bacon makes it known the seniors want the no dance ban lifted. John Lithgow, as the fire and brimstone preacher father of Singer, stands in the way, until Bacon fires off a few biblical phrases himself in his appeal with Singer's help.<br/><br/>The dancing is average at best, Singer's character is annoying, and the preacher is a full blown idiot with a mindset from 100 years earlier. Herbert Ross directed the film and wavered little from the formula we've come to expect from an outsider film like this. Like many films of this ilk from this era, many of the songs in it received heavy air play and helped sell the soundtrack as well as bring in an audience to the film. Two of the songs were Oscar-nominated: ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" and ""Footloose"". **1/2 of 4 stars."

","obviously this is one of those teen movies where you don't expect much to happen other than the usual stuff, you know, guy meets girl, guy faces problems and then over comes them and in the end everything turns out okay and everybody's having a good time. it's the same here, though the film is kinda week and has clichés in it, still it didn't bother me and it actually made me wanna dance, which is pretty good. like i said, this film doesn't contain much, but it's good, it's fun, you might enjoy it, so i'd say it's a good choice if you wanna see something that'll distract you for a while. by the way, this is probably one of the first movies where Kevin bacon stars in it, so you can use it as a reference to compare how his movie choices have changed over the course of his career."

","I have always like this movie for its upbeat music and Kevin Bacon. But the big mystery is Lori Singer hasn't done anything since about 1995 and really nothing much since this movie. Reading her biography one can understand that she is extremely talented especially in music, but it's a shame that she didn't continue to do more feature films. She is a beautiful woman. Yeah when I watched the movie last night I saw the big snow capped mountains in two scenes and wondered what mid west town is this? Yes you could say that there is some cheese in the movie, but it is entertaining if not predictable. Watching Dirty Dancing twenty years later gives you that same feeling."
"wbahn","10","1","3","20 January 2007"," Not your typical kids vs. parents flick
","Let's first admit that this movie is not some deep drama or social commentary. It may have a good message, but it isn't shoved down your throat. In the end it is just a fun movie to watch.<br/><br/>Having said that, this is one of my favorite movies because of that good message and, more importantly, because of the way in which it is presented. Countless movies and books have been centered on the basic theme of this movie - namely the intergenerational friction between teens and their parents. Unfortunately, most of them fall into the same trap and paint one (or both) sides as stereotypical in the extreme. Frequently this shows up by having kids that are ultra-clever battling against bumbling adults (Breakfast Club or Ferris Bueller's Day Off - both of which are enjoyable - come immediately to mind, but the list is oh so long). Usually, the kids have no apparent concrete reason to be battling the adults and the adults merely want to be obeyed because they are adults - they don't appear to have any desire to actually do what's best for the kids. In the end, these tales usually have the kids triumphing over the adults.<br/><br/>Footloose largely avoids this. At first, it appears that the adults in town are going to turn out to be cardboard cutouts transplanted from all the other movies in the genre, but it quickly turns out that the adults are not evil, nor stupid, nor uncaring. They are genuinely trying to do what they believe is best for their kids - and they realize that they aren't infallible and that they don't have all the answers. In the end they are willing to consider change not because they are convinced the changes are necessarily right, but because they respect and trust their kids.<br/><br/>For their part, the kids aren't rebelling just to rebel, nor are they trying to deny their parent's authority even as they struggle against it. Quite the opposite, they largely work within the bounds of the system their parents have set up in their quest to change it - and their parents. They do so because they respect and trust their parents. Furthermore, they are willing to accept defeat when it appears their best efforts didn't win the day.<br/><br/>What this film portrays so well is that parents and their children may have different outlooks and priorities and they may come into passionate conflict as a result - but they can do so while the mutual love, trust, and respect endures."

One of Kevin Bacon's best performances as an actor, thats good cuz he was young in this movie. It was just one of my favorite movies of all time.

","Why did I watch it through four times? First, I wanted to see the movie because I missed it in the 80's. Then I got caught up in all the bonus material, which was better than the movie, and told the exciting story of how the movie was made. I watched through once with Kevin Bacon's commentary and again with the commentary of the producer and the writer. Finally I went back and watched all the dance sequences again with the new knowledge I had acquired. So much fun to learn about the creative process by which this went from being one man's idea to being a cultural phenomenon. So interesting to see all the ways the film was almost scuttled, including the ""wrong ending"" the otherwise savvy director insisted on giving it, and the studio executive who said she would never, never approve of the casting of Kevin Bacon because he was not ****able enough. Imagine the movie without the final dance sequence!"

We who grew up in the late 70this and early 80this remember a modern time, but without PCs and play stations.<br/><br/>It was a time of music, video-arcades and fun. The soundtrack from Footloose sucks up memories from the past long forgotten.<br/><br/>Footloose is really about breaking free from conservatism. Dance, and celebrate life. The youth sensed the time. Cold war. The economic developments. Ecological issues. The increasing pressure to succeed. Being allowed to kick loose and just have fun was a way to express ourselves.<br/><br/>For me its a quick trip back to my youth.

FOOTLOOSE is great fun, and is worth seeing. It even contains a redeeming social message about values and tolerance.

The need and joy of partying and dancing , to find some joy from the drab , repressive existance that our Institutions in Britain had planned for us all. Footloose , showed a moment involving the Preacher of what is percieved truth & wisdom as what it actually was ignorance and repression.

","""Footloose"" is the movie that jettisoned Kevin Bacon into stardom by his boyish charisma and the upbeat dance moves.<br/><br/>PLOT: However, this is not a hackeyed musical that doesn't give the starring roles a chance to dance and/or burst into song. It's a mainly serious drama about a Chicago teen (Kevin Bacon) who moves into a town where dancing/rock music is banned, thanks to a pastor (John Lithgow, of ""Third Rock From the Sun"" fame). Infuriated, he decides to rebel and make dancing and rock music legal, when he is helped by new friend (Christopher Penn) and the pastor's rebellious daughter (Lori Singer).<br/><br/>REVIEW: ""Footloose"" is a minor, simple story that, without the dancing and musical interludes, would probably be an unsavory and stuffy drama. But, the charming performances by Bacon and Singer (note that ""Sex and the City"" goddess Sarah Jessica Parker in a minor role as Singer's helpful friend) and the upbeat rock and dance sequences make it a light and entertaining drama/musical. It's also helped by a nice ending that the pastor finally understands why his daughter is so rebellious and decides to make things right.<br/><br/>REASONS FOR PG RATING: Four-letter words. Graituitous male shower scene with plenty of nudity. Some violence, only mild and non-gory.<br/><br/>RATING: **1/2 out of **** stars."

What fourteen year old ""under the thumb of oppressive authority (translation: be home by 11pm, young man!)"" wouldn't love that stuff.<br/><br/>I remember that this was the soundtrack everyone had to have that year. And who didn't have ""Almost Paradise"" played at the school dance that year?<br/><br/>
I remember reading articles in newspapers about the success of this movie. Some said it was a return to making musicals in Hollywood, perhaps overstating and/or misunderstanding the movie's appeal.<br/><br/>Of course, watching it now as an adult I can see that it isn't very realisitc, especially when one realizes that most of the issues in this movie would have been easily solved with one well-publicized lawsuit from the ACLU.

","Recently, our high school just finished production on Footloose The Musical. I was very reluctant about joining, but since it was my final year, I decided why not it couldn't hurt. Joining the crew was one of the best decisions I have ever done with my life. Not only did I have fun, but I really liked the musical as well, mainly because its a musical. Why was I reluctant to join at first though? Because I DO NOT LIKE THIS MOVIE.<br/><br/>Who thought it was a good idea to make a dance movie with literally no dancing?! That's like making Star Wars take place down the street where your friend lives! Also, this becomes a major plot hole because we all know you cannot ban dancing, a physical form of expression from us. <br/><br/>Anyways what is the plot to this? Well, Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves into a town with his mom to live with his aunt and uncle where he learns that dancing and rock music is banned in Bomont. So he rebels against Reverend Moore and decides that is not right so his journey to revoke the law begins.<br/><br/>I can literally remember nothing from this movie. Not even the opening! Take the musical, you got a great opening that you can remember, awesome songs you can remember, and a finale that well, you can remember. What do I remember from this movie?....... The Reverend's daughter gets smacked by him and is assaulted by her boyfriend. Very lovely images.<br/><br/>Also, I can't remember any of the characters. Thankfully the musical helped me remember most of them. Willard I could barely remember from the movie, but in the musical, he looked so colorful in character. Also, The Reverend is so unlikable. You have to have some since that he wants to do the right thing and regrets it. Take for the musical again which I will be still comparing to in this review. You got a song called Heaven Help Me. A Song about him wanting to do the right thing. But no, instead of making this movie a musical, we get him being a big douche and arguing with people which is boring and makes me not care.<br/><br/>The songs... what do I remember, Well I do remember Footloose. A Good song. Lets Hear It For The Boy. Another good song... and that's about it. You know, the only reason I think these songs were nominated for Oscars was because they were memorable and timeless. <br/><br/>Oh and one of the scenes I hate so much is where Ren is given some kind of drug, gets in trouble for it, doesn't fight back, and guess what? HE DANCES IN AN ABANDONED WAREHOUSE. WHAT?! Seriously, if you don't want the drug, why don't you fight back so when a teacher comes in saying whats going on you can say HE TRIED GIVING ME DRUGS and he would get in trouble! Or you could just run away! BUT NO its this forgettable scene where they use one shot like 10 times.<br/><br/>The reason I liked the musical so much was because even when it was almost a decade and a half later, it fixed these problems, it made characters likable and memorable, they made songs memorable that weren't from the movie, they made it look passionate and that's what I like about the musical and not this garbage. To all high schools out there. Please do Footloose the musical! It will be the better decision then letting people watch this forgettable mess.<br/><br/>47/100 C-"

","In this lively adolescent-oriented musical, a city kid attempts to adapt to life in an ultra-conservative backwater Midwestern town. Once there, he ends up leading the repressed teenagers into a rebellion against the town fathers, who have outlawed rock & roll and dancing in Footloose.It stars Kevin Bacon,Lori Singer,Dianne Wiest and John Lithgow. It tells the story of Ren McCormack, an upbeat Chicago teen who moves to a small town in which, as a result of the efforts of a local minister, dancing and rock music have been banned.It is loosely based on events that took place in the small, rural, and religious community of Elmore City, Oklahoma.It was directed by Herbert Ross.<br/><br/>Ren McCormack, a teenager raised in Chicago, moves with his mother to the small Rocky Mountain town of Bomont to live with his aunt and uncle after his father leaves them. Soon after arriving, Ren makes a friend named Willard, and learns the city council banned dancing and rock music after several teens were killed in an accident six years earlier. He soon begins to fall for a rebellious girl named Ariel, who has a boyfriend, Chuck Cranston, and an overprotective father, Rev. Shaw Moore ,a powerful member of the town council. Rev. Moore's son--and Ariel's older brother--died in the crash.After trading insults with Ariel's boyfriend, Ren is challenged to a game of chicken involving tractors. Despite not knowing how to drive a tractor, he wins. Rev. Moore mistrusts Ren, forbidding Ariel to see him and using his influence to have Ren kicked off the gymnastics team. Ren and his classmates want to do away with the ban on dancing and have a senior prom. He presses on despite gaining a reputation as a ""troublemaker""; his efforts cause his mother to get fired on the pretense that she isn't being a good mother, and also cost his uncle business. Moore's wife is supportive of the movement, and explains to Moore he cannot be everyone's father, and that he is hardly being a father to Ariel. She also says that dancing and music are not the problem.Ren goes before the city council and reads several Bible verses provided to him by Ariel in order to cite scriptural support for the worth of dancing to rejoice, exercise, or celebrate. Although Rev. Moore is moved, he and the other council members vote to keep the ban. Ren initially gives up, but his boss at a flour mill tells him that the mill is located just outside the town limits, and offers to let the kids use it for their prom. Meanwhile, Moore has a change of heart after seeing some of the townsfolk burning books that they think are dangerous to the youth. Realizing the situation has gotten out of hand, Moore stops the burning.On Sunday, Rev. Moore asks his congregation to pray for the high school students putting on the prom. Moore and his wife are seen outside, dancing for the first time in years. Cranston and several of his friends show up and challenge Ren and Willard to a fight, but Ren and Willard easily fend them off and go back inside. Ren triumphantly yells, ""Let's dance!""<br/><br/>What is surprising about the movie is that it has very little dancing.Also,it was cheesy to that point that rock and roll music is a devil's music.What's worse,the ending was simply contrived and manipulated as the Reverend accepted rock and roll without any convincing reason whatsoever. The only good thing about it the great acting of Kevin Bacon and Kenny Loggins' music,Footloose."

","In the early days of the South,we found prejudice. People were Conservative and critical of things. The movie sheds light on partiality.<br/><br/>Just as I am critical of today's music style(do not like rap,which is popular) many people were critical of Elvis Presley and disliked His dancing and performance<br/><br/>The focal point of the movie is a bringing to light the issues of personal taste and popular culture. I enjoyed the dancing (Bacon and Penn were really cool)<br/><br/>i feel that there is an issue of personal freedom that the movie brings up. I feel that freedom of expression is a basic right we need to preserve and protect. If it was a factual movie, then the director brought up issues that we see in today's society."

","I saw ""Footloose"" in the theaters in 1984. I was in high school and enjoyed. However in the years since its been released it has left a huge imprint on America. It is easy to understand why. The film itself had a huge best selling soundtrack album that not only included the title song but also classic tunes ""Let's Hear it for the boy"" and the often covered ""Holding on for A Hero"". <br/><br/>People love this film however those who love this need to see it again. Time has not been kind.

The town seems to be ran by a jerk who is not the mayor but a Preacher on a Bully pulpit. The adults act like drones. They think the preacher was right in outlawing ""Dancing"" and ""Liquor"". <br/><br/>Well all of that gets tested when Ren (Kevin Bacon) moves into town and decides to challenge everything that is banned.<br/><br/>The film itself has great moments but on the whole (but even in 1984) the film is campy. Today the camp is now dated but the crazy. Keven Bacon and Lori Singer are good but the film scenes with the Reverend drag this film down! IT makes it boring. In the remake they should have had Ren of the Reverends daughter shoot him! <br/><br/>In real life the Crazy Christians seems to have multiplied across the United States. <br/><br/>I am sure if they read this review they will vote NO about this review being helpful, Well they can suck it!"
"StevePulaski","Null","1","6","19 July 2011"," Cut Footloose
","Footloose is probably the most overrated and least impressive eighties film I can think of it. Without the music, Kevin Bacon, and the end dance scene, there is nothing memorable or special about this one note film. I can't even put it into a genre. It's not comedy because very few moments are funny. It's not a drama because it is too goofy to be one. And it's not a musical because there is no singing. This could very well fit the ""miscellaneous"" section in any film category.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon plays sweet and simple Ren. Ren moves with his mother from Chicago to the small rural town of Bomont. Upon learning that things are much more uptight in the town, he also comes to discover that rock music and dancing is banned. This is because Reverend Shaw Moore (Lithgow) believes that is nothing but a troublemaking nuisance. Ariel (Singer), the Reverend's daughter, begins to catch the eye of Ren so now he has two things on his plate.<br/><br/>The main problem is Footloose tries too hard to leave a mark on the eighties fabric and just ends up being a hodge podge of different things. For one, it's a movie that focuses on a serious issue, the banning of music. But its comical characters and poorly written script dumb it down. The film, also, breaks out into dance sessions with no explanation other than to showcase its soundtrack.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is pleasant to listen to. It's filled with great tunes from back in the day. Including the title song by Kenny Loggins, a favorite of mine. Another thing is tries to be is an awkward love story between the Reverend's daughter and Ren. The Reverend's daughter can be sweet and sincere, but she's not the brightest bulb because she does the impossible and stands on the edge of two cars while a semi comes closer and closer. That's intelligent.<br/><br/>Footloose is harmless because it doesn't offend anyone. No one will take anything to heart, except the fact I think this film is a case of ""talked about too much, resulting in too little."" There is enough here to sustain a movie, but everything is taken in such an awkward, one dimensional manor that it's hard to like.<br/><br/>Some people will be able to find the humor, the drama, and the fun in Footloose and that's great. Unfortunately, because the film is such a mixture of various genres that are all done in an incomplete manor I doubt that will be an easy thing to do. I wonder if Kevin Bacon had been replaced with someone, unknown, like C. Thomas Howell and if the music had been less common, but still boasted the same topic and same name if it would've been half as popular as this is.<br/><br/>Starring: Kevin Bacon, John Lithgow, Lori Singer, and Dianne Wiest. Directed by: Herbert Ross."

","One of the scenes has Kevin's character accosting the mayor of a cow-town to revoke the legislation that barred dancing and any form of conviviality that incensed ""sexual tension"" among teenagers. With palpably weird contortions to his mouth, he looked as if he would decorate the room with the most vibrantly colorful vomit.Or he could be compared to a frog, constantly puffing his mouth as if cursed by Ron Weasley's cracked wand! The enigma remains unsolved. It would be too abstruse to figure out.<br/><br/>I couldn't empathize with Bacon's character at all. His elusive behavior- a stroke of genius or simply amateurish writing and acting? I incline towards the latter. In the beginning, he looks like a new kid on the block, shy, taciturn. Then he plays loud music and is apprehended by the police. Every factor in town sort of militates his obscure passion for dancing, his happiness and acceptance into the society - like Karate Kid sans much sense. His so-called penchant towards dancing was impertinent- the director perhaps couldn't find any good choreographers and this hampered the whole movie. It more felt like a musical, except for an instance where Kevin trapezes around the factory like ""Welder Tarzan""! That makes it a sports movie.<br/><br/>Kevin is too young and inexperienced to tackle this fairly challenging performance. He couldn't emote well at all- courtesy the daffy script which seemed like excerpts picked from various other cheesy movies that were a vogue in the 80's. The 80s in Hollywood was the beginning of a Renaissance - as it gave birth to modern, crass and impetuous 'rebels' or 'iconoclasts'. But it was just the salad days, where little cubs pretended to mime lions and puppies yelped at bull-mastiffs in leashes. It was a bit embarrassing- the barbaric, uncouth bird-nest of a hair (seriously, how much hair can a human bear!), fizzed out jokes interspersed with expletives just to sound cool (Saturday Night Fever), appearing buffoonish in front of equally ludicrous looking peers, eve-teasing (and lots of it), remonstrating established principles of the society, no matter how moral or otherwise, and the most hide-your-face-cos-its-unwatchable part is the tight-fitting, zip-ripping trousers worn by both sexes that could suffocate a human body. People in that town are hypocrites for sure- they disallow convivial celebrations and merriment while they have no worries about girls accentuating their figures in tight-fitting jeans. Doesn't that galvanize the lubricious hormones of guys into action? The writer had imposed so many restrictions, so why not just add another one that forced girls to wear frocks. They could have touched that silly issue too.<br/><br/>I cannot comment much on the performances since they were too scarce in the film, which is a great worry since its based on dance. Even Million Dollar Baby, that took a dramatic shift in the second half at least had a balance of both elements. I could hear lot of sweet cadence though. ""Holding out for a Hero"" is my personal favorite. Anyway, shifting back to Kevin, I feel that he should have worked more on his facial expressions and confidence. Its not about getting fragrantly expressive to an overtly theatrical extent, but more of conviction with a pinch of theatricality. Rubbing the hair frequently, biting teeth, picking nose often etc are habits imbibed by many from childhood. Even repetitive hand gestures in a similar manner- all add to a sense of naturalism. Or, if he did want to keep it simple, an endearing performance would have been enough. Sadly, he doesn't have both.<br/><br/>The priest/mayor is fine though as the self-denying pedant who is antagonized by the young blood. Two short confrontations, one to bury the hatchet, between Kevin and him, weren't enough since they follow different ideologies and should have discussed more about their views with one other. The daughter, also Kevin's love interest, endeavors but sort of falters in her role, even though she's better than Bacon. And her suicidal tendencies were covered in a tacky manner.<br/><br/>None of the others are worth a mention. Sarah is fine (and by fine, I mean compared to others in the movie), Kevin's best friend is unintentionally funny. The worst part was the short brawl between him and the old man and the focus on Sarah and him for about five minutes sitting and watching others dance. It was tedious.<br/><br/>Another problem was the pacing. The movie is laborious mostly, only mildly (and embarrassingly) entertaining in some sequences. The story is downright silly and unnecessarily convoluted. The director took too much into his hands like a bartender trying to juggle wine-bottles starts to sing and dance along and falls flat in all.<br/><br/>My Verdict Performance: 4/10 Story: 2/10 Direction: 3.5/10 Music/ Choreography:5/10 Overall: 3/10"

"dwpollar","4","1","7","2 July 2010"," Fair dance movie...
","1st watched 7/1/2010 -- 4 out of 10 (Dir-Herbert Ross): Fair dance movie with good music and dancing but underdeveloped storyline(that should have been set in the 1950's) that ruins the whole experience. The movie is about a smalltown that abolishes dancing and a few other things after an accident on a local bridge that killed a few kids including the preacher's son. A young pup, played by Kevin Bacon(in a good role for him, actually) arrives in town from Chicago wanting to change things. The preacher is played by John Lithgow(who does a decent job), and has personal reasons for keeping the law in place. His daughter, played by Lori Singer, in some ways is trying to go against her father but in other ways is trying to reach out to him, but can't seem to since the incident. Singer is not very convincing in her role and she just doesn't match up to the other actors as far as her skill level and this weakens the film. The main problem, though, is a script that's inconsistent. The first half of the movie plays like a few MTV moments and outside of the music it's trying to introduce the distance between the characters. The last half tries to bring the characters back together and has more drama, but each half doesn't do a very good job -- although the 2nd half is better. Sure, there's a nice danceable happy ending but you really don't get a feeling like real changes were made. For a summer kids flick this did well, but for the discerning adult this movie doesn't have much appeal. Buy the soundtrack -- enjoy the music and dance to it, but don't worry with the film."

","There is a review that summed up this movie in two words which I couldn't sum up in a thousand words. Teenage Cheese. It is 100% that and more. Teenage Cheese is a movie meant for young adults and this movie does it in spades. However, this movie is one of a few movies which actually holds up over time. It is leaps and bounds better than the reboot which came out two decades later.<br/><br/>The story is about Ren, a young man from Chicago, who moves to a small town which doesn't allow music or dance. Ren has a chance to rebel against the authoritarian leaders of the town by showing them that dance and music doesn't have to be a drug filled orgy of sex and sweat.<br/><br/>Kevin Bacon does a great job of playing the lead part, it was said that Tom Cruise and Rob Lowe were also in line for the lead role but Tom Cruise was doing All The Right Moves, Rob Lowe was injured.<br/><br/>As the lead interest, Lori Singer/Ariel Moore, plays the preacher's daughter, Jon Lithgow, which was originally supposed to be Madonna, or a hundred other famous young actresses which didn't seem to work out. However Lori Singer does a great job as a country girl trying to get noticed by her father.<br/><br/>The rest of the supporting cast does a fine job and there is Sara Jessica Parker (Sex in the City) and Chris Penn (Reservoir Dogs) to name a few.<br/><br/>The soundtrack is loaded with many top 10 songs of the era including ""Bang Your Head (Metal Health)"" by Quiet Riot, ""Hurts So Good"" by John Mellencamp, ""Waiting for a Girl Like You"" by Foreigner and the extended 12"" remix of ""Dancing in the Sheets"".<br/><br/>The soundtrack includes five rock singles—the title song, ""Footloose"" and ""I'm Free"", both by Kenny Loggins, ""Holding Out for a Hero"" by Welsh singer Bonnie Tyler, ""Girl Gets Around"" by Sammy Hagar, and ""Never"" by Australian rock band Moving Pictures (the song played during Bacon's solo dance scene); three singles—""Let's Hear It for the Boy"" by Deniece Williams, ""Somebody's Eyes"" by Karla Bonoff, and ""Dancing in the Sheets"" by Shalamar; and the love theme ""Almost Paradise"" by Mike Reno from Loverboy and Ann Wilson of Heart.<br/><br/>I hear complaints that this movie sucks and that it doesn't hold up over time. Maybe it is my youth, that I graduated in 1985, that clings to the time when I saw this movie. However I do not believe that to be the case. The movie is clean and crisp with a message that applies to all generations.<br/><br/>Yes, it will eventually become dated, but for the time being this movie holds it own against newer films which have a thousand dollars greater budget and still suck."
"TheLittleSongbird","6","0","3","18 July 2016"," A very love it/hate it film- to me it isn't great but can definitely see the appeal
","'Footloose', despite being an enormous hit back in the 80s, seems to be a very divisive love it/hate it film critically now.<br/><br/>This reviewer neither loves or hates 'Footloose', from personal opinion it falls short of being great but the immense appeal is definitely understandable.<br/><br/>Its biggest weak point is the story. Conceptually it's daft, and further hampered by laying it on too thick with the ridiculousness (the drug scene and the basic concept) and over-sentimentality (the Reverend's somewhat tacky reform that didn't really ring true compared to how his character was written in general). Ren's dance routine in the abandoned warehouse was far too randomly placed, coming at an unrealistically weird point in the film.<br/><br/>Lori Singer being too old didn't bother me as much as it did other reviewers, but the overacting, constantly looking as if she was trying too hard, was less forgivable. The script is uneven, sometimes it's humorously light-hearted and feel good and there is a laudable attempt at providing depth with some more mature themes but too much of it is also cheesy and flimsy.<br/><br/>However, the songs are toe-tappingly great, especially the title song ""Footloose"" and ""Let's Hear it for the Boy"". The dancing is spirited, and apart from that one scene with Ren the choreography and dance numbers are finger-snappingly infectious. 'Footloose' is a good-looking film too, beautifully shot and smartly photographed with some inventive visuals in the title song, while the direction is solid enough and the pacing sharp and energetic constantly.<br/><br/>Singer aside, the cast are simply terrific, with Kevin Bacon in the role that made him a star making for a good free-spirited lead and the sadly late Chris Penn proving that he had the talent to make it bigger than he did. Dianne Wiest doesn't seem capable of giving a bad performance, while John Lithgow is effectively subtle and wisely reigns in in a role that could easily have been the opposite.<br/><br/>Overall, falls short of being a great film but the appeal is definitely understandable, because there are a lot of good elements that outweigh the still quite big flaws. 6/10 Bethany Cox"

Between the book-burning scene and the spirited game of tractor chicken (set to ""I Need a Hero"", sheesh), this gets pretty silly. What was odd is that usually movies are able to pull off teenagers with older actors, but everyone looked way too old here.<br/><br/>This is a soundtrack movie all the way, and Loggins is calling the shots.

Of course the reverend's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) is the wildest teen of them all.<br/><br/>This teen movie is hokey and fun starting with the title song by Kenny Loggins. There is some fun cheese like Kevin Bacon dancing in the abandoned factory. But then there are also some very serious issues going on. The reason it works is Kevin Bacon. It's his boyish charm.

","From director Herbert Ross (The Sunshine Boys), this was one of the biggest hits of the 1980's, and it is considered one of the most popular dance films ever made. Basically teen Chicago city boy Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) and his family move into a small village in the West, and he has a culture shock, and he struggles to adapt into a place where rock music and dancing are illegal. He does enjoy getting to know Ariel Moore (Lori Singer), the troubled girl with a jealous boyfriend and daughter of the man who keeps the law going, bible bashing Reverend Shaw Moore (John Lithgow). With his new friends, including Willard Hewitt (Reservoir Dogs' Chris Penn, as Christopher) who he teaches to dance like a pro, they round up all school classmates to do away with this silly law, especially when the senior prom is on the way. Only Ren has the courage to stand up in front of the town council and get this change passed and get the repressed townspeople back on their feet as it were. Thankfully, Reverand Moore sees from his daughter and Ren that young people need to feel free to express themselves, and the students get to the dance the night away at the prom. Also starring Dianne Wiest as Vi Moore, Sarah Jessica Parker as Rusty, John Laughlin as Woody, Elizabeth Gorcey as Wendy Jo, Jim Youngs as Chuck Cranston and Gremlins' Frances Lee McCain as Ethel McCormack. Bacon is a good young lead, his young and some up and coming co-stars add something too, and Lithgow does well as the mean minister. With a great opening sequence of feet dancing to the catchy title theme, the scene with Penn learning during the other great song, and many other fun to watch dance scenes, it a good fun (yes, a little daft, but who cares?) musical drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Song for the title song (also nominated the Golden Globe), and it was also nominated Best Song for ""Let's Hear It for the Boy"". The title song was number 96 on 100 Years, 100 Songs. Good!"
"jpschapira","5","0","5","29 June 2008"," Big holes...
","The opening credits of ""Footloose"" are a blast. The camera shoots the feet of several people doing different dance steps while a catchy music plays on the back. There's a chance you miss the credits because the movement of the feet may distract you; I think that's effective. I also think the first ten minutes of the film are effective: with the camera showing different views of what's clearly a small town and then taking us to church, where Reverend Moore (John Lithgow) gives a speech about how dancing corrupts the spirit of young children. <br/><br/>When the mass is over, we see the Reverend's beautiful daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) and her friends in a car racing tough guy Chuck's van (Jim Youngs), and unexpectedly Ariel gets out of the car through the window and stands in the middle of the two vehicles, knowing that a truck is coming from the other side. She doesn't die, but we understand the movie makes a statement: a girl is angry at her father because he is forbidding freedom among teenagers, and controls her all the time and doesn't let her live her life. <br/><br/>This is not an unfamiliar plot line, and although it's interesting, the movie provides something more interesting yet: Ren McCormack. Played by Kevin Bacon with the enough amount of cockiness and the necessary humanity, Ren is the new guy in this little town and he's about to bring trouble because he dances well and he wants everyone to dance. However, that's as interesting as it gets. <br/><br/>I won't tell you anything else about the plot because I believe everybody needs to experience a film in their own way and draw their own conclusions, but I have to tell you that my experience of ""Footloose"" was a disappointing one. Yes, there's good music and choreographies, and Kevin Bacon's work is risky and worthy of admiration (so is Chris Penn's as his best friend Willard), but there's absolutely nothing more. <br/><br/>As we wait for a new song to start playing, direct Herbet Ross struggles to keep our attention and cover the big holes in Dean Pitchford's script (there are moments where this is impossible and we're stuck with excessive minutes of background music). Take any conversation, any situation; only one is enough to see how narrow-minded Pitchford's writing is. And it's not narrow-minded because the characters inhabit a narrow-minded little town: it's narrow-minded in its nature, and it makes it impossible to us to connect with any of the characters or even remember their names (try to remember the name of Ren's mother by the end of the movie). Matsan asked me one time about the name of a guy that appears a lot in the film, but it seems more an accessory than a character. <br/><br/>After one day in school, Ren is driving the streets with a bunch of guys we don't care about. Okay, maybe we shouldn't, but the script's greatest fault is failing in the development of the one character we should at least relate to. If you think about an instant reason for Ren and his mother to be in a new town, you won't find it. And the movie provides reasons for this situation and many others, but it does it during the wrong moments. Every time an honest confession comes out of a character's mouth, we're not ready for it and we're not able to fully digest it. <br/><br/>I felt there was a problem of connection between each scene; that everything was either moving too fast or moving in an unexpected way, like the confession. Sometimes the unexpected is good: not here. <br/><br/>You seeSatine had feelings, she was trapped in a situation and we felt for her (this is ""Moulin Rouge!""); Roxie Hart had aspirations, dreams (this is ""Chicago""). Ren McCormack apparently has all this things too, but when the film gives him the possibility to stand by them, two times; the first one he's not convincing enough and the second one the movie skips the scene. <br/><br/>Of course you could say it's a musical and the story is less important and not to be taken seriously and other things, and that's why I put the examples above; but this is partly. The fact is, and this can be denied because it's something patent throughout the film, that the story of ""Footloose"" and the emotions of the characters are filled with seriousness: it's the filmmakers' intention for us to take it seriously.<br/><br/>And if that's not so, then I've seen another movie."

","Foot Loose is a film directed by Herbert Ross. It is a film in which we can see the difference of cultures and customs from one that comes from the city, to living in a small town. As mentioned in class, one can use the herocycle represented by Joseph Campbell to explain different steps in a film. To start off, this film represents the idea of not dancing. People are not allowed to dance in the town that young man moved into. He found this to be outrageous and this motivated him to do something about it. At times, of course, he thought about it twice because it could bring him problems. In the beginning of the film, one can see the separation from culture, which falls in the ""crossing the threshold into the unknown"" of the herocycle. One can see the dedication to religion, what seemed right, and what to do to be holy in this town. Throughout the film one can see trials that he faced that determined if he was accepted in this culture or not. For example, one trial that seen is when he races against another guy with trucks. This determined there braveness and manhood, it was determined by who ""chickened out"" and jumped out the truck as they came close to each other in crashing. Another part of the herocycle that I noticed was when he meets ""goddess"". This is interpreted as when he meets a love interest. He starts falling in love with the daughter of the minister of the town. This restricted him even more of his customs and his own culture. In one scene he starts recalling all the episodes he had to face when it dealt with dancing or music. He started getting upset at the customs in the town. Finally one can see the ""Intia"" in the herocycle; this is where he goes from ordinary to a hero, the turning point. He decides to make a difference and let everyone see that there is nothing evil about music or dancing. In one scene, everyone gathers for a meeting in reference to a dance show and here he perceives the role of a hero. Him being the ""new"" kid in town stands up for the class and defends the idea of dancing and the acceptance of a dance show."

","While watching Footloose one can see the different stages throughout the movie that occur to fulfill the 'hero' complex of the movie. The main character, Ren, seems to keep to himself being a new student in school. However, once he begins to warm up to the new people and once they begin to warm up to him he makes many friends as well as enemies. Ren is first seen as an outsider, a person who will only cause harm and nothing good would come of being friends with him. Ren appears to be a strong individual which is seen in the beginning during his first day at the new school. Ren is approached by Willard, but Ren doesn't take any crap and throws it right back at Willard. From there on out the two become friends and help each other through some of their hardships.<br/><br/>Ren is seen as an outsider. In this small town outsiders are not taken lightly. Ren is only familiar with his old surroundings and the way he used to do things. Therefore, when he is told that he is not allowed to listen to music or dance out of his own taste he is very uneasy. This is where the hero circle begins with the 'call to adventure'. He doesn't want to give up something that makes him so happy and in his eyes is simple and innocent.<br/><br/>Aerial soon comes into Ren's life and helps to turn it upside down for a time period. Aerial is the daughter of the preacher of the town. She is also the sister of one of the boys who died in a car accident 7 years before. It is thought throughout the town that music was a factor in the death of those youngsters. The preacher himself stated that listening to music will only influence the youngsters to drink and drive and begin to explore sexuality. This is an assumption he takes on that not only influences the entire town but puts a damper on his home life. The preacher and his wife don't get along as they used to. The preacher and his daughter are torn apart due to their different beliefs and stubborn personalities. Aerial loves music and dancing and grows to care for Ren.<br/><br/>Ren realizes that he is not the only one who likes to dance and listen to music. Ren decides to show Aerial, Woody and Willard what they are missing. The four of them go to a dance club right outside of town. The four teenagers have a great time; they laugh and let loose and enjoy themselves. While Ren was beginning to be accepted by some there were still others who didn't want him around. One student tried to give him some drugs and while Ren was turning it down the coached walked in. Of course because Ren is the new student and looked down upon he got kicked off the gymnastics team. Of course the reasoning was because of low funding but everyone knew the real reason. This incident is the one that leads Ren down the road to a mission. He comes up with the great idea to hold a dance.<br/><br/>The idea of Ren having a dance quickly gets around town. The preacher is angry and swears he will not let this dance happen. The dance approval has to be run by the town during a town meeting. Aerial and Woody pass out flyers and gather people to attend this meeting on behalf of the students. While the girls are rallying the troops Ren is busy teaching Willard how to dance. The scenes are shown with the two laughing and enjoying themselves without any sexual attractions occurring. When it comes time for the town meeting Ren stands up and speaks his mind about the idea. The idea is even pushed my Aerial's mother, which goes to show the differences in the home. Ren's idea doesn't make it much farther than the town meeting. Then another aspect of the hero circle occurs. Ren's boss pushes him to follow through with his thought of a dance. He tells him where to have it and talks him into it. At this point in the movie the hero circle is almost complete. It ends with the 'sharing of the gift'. The gift was prom and the views to the town that they refused to see before.<br/><br/>In the beginning of the movie Ren is seen as nothing but bad comings, but by the end of the movie that all changes. Ren is soon accepted and able to do the things that he loves with people he likes and cares for. Ren is completes the hero circle through hardships with being accepted, accepting himself, and allowing others to see his points of view."
"torigemi3","Null","0","3","6 May 2007"," Footloose Archetypal Review
","Archetypal is the original pattern or model from which all things of the same kind are copied or on which they are based; a model or first form (Dictionary.com). Heroes endure a process to understand themselves and other people surrounding them, including friends and family. This process is the hero cycle which is where an individual gains the courage and ability to over continuous obstacles. Footloose made in 1984 is one film which the Hero Cycle theory, created by Joseph Campbell, can be applied. The main character Ren McCormack, played by Kevin Beacon, stirs up a small town in the West, where dancing and playing modern music is illegal. By helping this town and its citizens Ren ends up finding him self and facing his own personal issues.<br/><br/>McCormack is an insecure city boy from Chicago who moves into his uncle's house with his mother. His uncle has two daughters which Ren is expected to set a positive influence upon. His initial conflict is with the Reverend Shaw Moore, played by John Lithgow. Five years ago a group of teenagers died in a drinking and driving accident, ultimately leading up the illegalization of dancing. This is Rens ""call to adventure"" the first step of the hero cycle. Confused about this culturally stricken town he begins to the separation stage from his cultures leading to his unhappiness.<br/><br/>The next step of the cycle Ren begins to have obstacles and trials thrown in front of him. Being an outsider and unacceptable to the community already set in place Ren has more bullies than friends. One trial is a tractor race. He wins the trial by accident but begins the initiation sequence. It represents a right of passage and also introduces him to a love interest, Arial the reverends daughter, played by Lori Singer.<br/><br/>Another trial in the cycle which brings Ren to rock bottom is being kicked off the gymnastic team. He feels defeated and helpless completely aware of the reason for his disposal. He is being discriminated. He has a confrontation with his uncle which pushes him over the edge. Throughout the film he constantly reprimands Ren for causing trouble, saying ""you didn't cause trouble in the city"". He also blames him for his mother losing her job. The scene in which he discusses the situations at hand with his mother is an extremely important scene. His mother believes in him and offers her blessing to do what is necessary for self fulfillment.<br/><br/>Rens attempt to save himself and the town is to throw a dance. Since dances are illegal it is up to him to introduce the idea to the town council. At the town meeting Ren is nervous but prepared to make his argument. This is the entering of the final stages of the hero cycle, the magic flight or rescue. An extremely strong point is brought up by Ren. He quotes King David, ""and they danced before the Lord"". He explains how he said there is a time to laugh, a time to weep and a time to mourn, and now is a time to dance. It's their way of celebrating life.<br/><br/>The Reverend Shau and the council immediately say no to the idea of a dance. But an incident occurs helping the reverend to see his mistakes. Throughout the movie the constant struggle between the congregation and the reverend. This is noticeable in the fact that the reverend is always preaching higher up looking down at the congregation. The reverend needed to understand his struggle with his own selfishness to understand his wife, daughter and family the community.<br/><br/>In the end the dance brings the town together especially Ren and the high school students, bringing children closer to the parents and the community closer as a whole. The involvement of decorating and preparation shows the positive side of a formal dance. Now that the cycle is complete Ren gained a rise in courage and better knowledge to continue to overcome future obstacles. Footloose provides incite to understand the cycle and seeing its influence in not only movies, television and literature, but in everyday life. It offers an innate appreciation for archetypal stories like the hero cycle."

A very young and unknown Sarah Jessica Parker and then Fame star Lori Singer stars in the movie. Singer plays Ariel, the rebellous preacher's daughter and her boyfriend is a jerk of a bully.

","Footloose <br/><br/>Music was a big part of peoples' lives during the 1980's. Rock and Roll was first getting popular and people loved to dance to it. Some small towns viewed this new music and way of dancing to be dangerous, therefore make it illegal. Within the movie Footloose, the main character Ren, moves from big-city Chicago to a small town in the West where dancing where rock music and dancing are illegal. Ren has to deal with getting used to his new school and new rules, and without realizing it he will become this school's hero.<br/><br/>When Ren first comes into town he meets Ariel, the daughter of the town's reverend, Reverend Shaw Moore, and develops a crush on her, despite the fact that she has a boyfriend. Ariel soon leaves her boyfriend because she wants to be with Ren. This clearly makes Ariel the love interest within this movie. <br/><br/>Ren, Ariel, Woody and Willard to across the boarder into a different town and listen to music and dance all night. They soon realize that they need to bring this ridiculous law to an end. They decided that they should have a senior dance. Ren is brave enough to go in front of the town board and introduce this idea. <br/><br/>Because of Ren's courage he is seen as the hero. Although he does have his inner shadow that makes him feel like he should give up, he continues to try. He explains to his mother why he wants to do this. He tells her how he felt when his father left, like it was his fault, and he just wanted to do something right for himself. So he gets the seniors to have a dance across the train tracks, where his boss (the wise man of the movie) tells him would be a good place to have it, where the police wouldn't be able to do anything about it because it wasn't their territory. His sidekick is his best friend in the town, Willard, who sticks by him and helps him out whenever he gets into fights. The antagonist of this movie can be the town board and the town's views on rock and roll music and dancing, or it can be viewed as Ariel's ex-boyfriend. Either way there was a struggle between good and bad. <br/><br/>Footloose is a dramatic musical directed by Herbert Ross in 1984. It accurately shows the struggles some small towns went through. It also shows the social life of high school accurately when dealing with drugs, peer pressure, and teen rebellion. Overall this movie showed the typical characters that would be present in a hero story."
"RosaCenturion","Null","0","2","10 May 2006"," FootLoose
","The movie Footloose is a movie about teenagers who try to live their normal lives in a small town, however there is one thing, the minister who passed a law saying that you can not dance, or hear music in public or hear music at any time. He passed that law because of an accident that happen years ago, and his son got killed, because of drunk driving. However, Ren who comes from Chicago to live in that small town in the west tries to change the law. He also falls for the minister's daughter.<br/><br/>Ren who is very passionate about is music and dancing, wants to change the rules in the new town where he moved in. When he get's angry he takes his anger out on dancing, his dancing becomes very intense. The love for music and dancing, brings the teenagers together after wards. Although it took hard work for Rent to fit in with everyone else, he got the teenagers attention to change everything. Ariel, the minister's daughter who is a rebel and has a boyfriend who does not go threw the rules also is a very jealous boyfriend. Ariel, also loves music and likes to dance, and really doesn't follow her father's rules. She automatically falls for Ren, and tries to seduce him. At the end they both end up being together. Ren tries to go against the town, and protests and gets a meeting with the whole town. He makes his points about having the freedom of dancing and playing music. At the end the minister changes his mind, and makes them have the dance for prom. I think this is a good movie to watch, to show how people have their own opinions, and how to solve problems.<br/><br/>In conclusion , everyone in the town was finally happy to have music and dancing back, because that was just part of their everyday lives that they didn't have for a while. I think Ren who is a very brave young man, stood up for everyone else from his age, against the town. This was a great movie to watch, and I sure recommend others to watch it too."

","As those of you who know me from the message boards will know, I will have a place in my heart for this movie. On March 10th of this year, I attended my high school's production of the Broadway musical version of ""Footloose"", and loved it. It was one of the best nights of this school year so far (for reasons I should not go into too much detail here). Still, it took about five and a half weeks before I could see the movie on which the musical was based.<br/><br/>The plot, for those of you really want it: Ren McCormack (Kevin Bacon) is a Chicago kid who moves to the small Indiana town of Bomont, where the local priest, Shaw Moore (John Lithgow), has outlawed rock music and dancing (due to the death of his son in a car accident). After turning the local kids (including Lori Singer, Chris Penn, and Sarah Jessica Parker) onto the tunes of Kenny Loggins, Ren decides it's time to change the town's rules about dancing. Meanwhile, Moore grows increasingly sympathetic towards Ren, due to his daughter (Singer)'s feelings towards him, and his being the target of abuse by the local bully (Jim Youngs) and the overly-conservative town council. Does Ren win his fight? What do you think? <br/><br/>Overall, this movie conformed to how I thought it would turn out: it was completely silly, but fun and an entertaining waste of a day off from school. The music was great (though certain songs were hardly used, namely my favorite, ""Somebody's Eyes""), and is alone worth watching it for. The only excessively silly scene is Ren's gymnastic routine in an empty flour mill, which made me laugh my butt off at how stupid it was. Other than that, however, nothing was wrong with this movie, which was successful at what it set out to do: entertain. Just because it isn't ""Doctor Zhivago"" or ""Lawrence of Arabia"" doesn't mean it's a bad film.<br/><br/>The cast was good if unspectacular. Kevin Bacon, Lori Singer, Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker (whom I almost didn't recognize!) were solid and it's easy to see why most of them went on to become stars; they look like they're having fun throughout and are very convincing. But John Lithgow walks away with the acting prize for this film; his character is surprisingly complex and well-developed for a film of this type, and it's to Lithgow's credit that he was able to make Shaw Moore a sympathetic character.<br/><br/>Is ""Footloose"" a great film? No. Is it one I'll want to watch over and over again? No. Did I enjoy it? Yes. And, as I said, for the sake of all of my friends at school who were in their production of it, I will ALWAYS think fondly of ""Footloose"".<br/><br/>I'll give ""Footloose"" a warm seven stars. I don't know what more to say on here, except I hope I get to see the musical version again (and not as the proposed film remake!)."
"daphnemwatson","6","0","2","20 January 2006"," Who is that guy??
","Footloose is a cool movie. I remember loving it when I was younger. Now I can't really stomach the story, but always hold out for the dance scenes. It's great to watch, just for the fun of it and you look at how Chris Penn is twice the man he used to be :)I just watched it a few minutes ago and I need to know who that pop-locking dancer was at the end, he was sick!!! I just wanted to know if he stayed in dance, if he was successful with it. He was so cold, I forgot how much fun the 80's were!! Growing up in the 80's and Reaganomics wasn't all that bad, I guess. It gave us some the most colorful movies and characters which I have yet to see it's equal. <br/><br/>Footloose is definitely great for some laughs, and Kenny Loggins' songs were awesome, he was like the 80's movie song king, I used to love him!"
"mammothtimes","8","0","2","28 October 2005"," ""Wanna see somethin'?""
","I was a senior in high school when Footloose was released. I tripped through the hallways with everyone else singing ""Let's Hear It For The Boy"" because it was on the radio eighty-four thousand times a day. I agree with almost every other reviewer here with the exception of those few who spoke harshly. Cheesy at times? Yes! Never liked Bonnie Tyler. Issues like those can make this film make you squirm a little.<br/><br/>However, no other film of my youth has affected me to this day as this one has. What did it? Compare... ""You think I'm small town?"" ""I think Bomont's a small town."" ""I'm going' away...I'm gonna be gone... Wanna see somethin'?"" Listen to the background music as this scene unfolds. The violin, piano and soulful rock guitar are wed beautifully. Miles Goodman adapted the score so I'm giving him credit for this still mega-emotion stirring theme music. Then, as Ren tells the town ""This is our time to dance,"" well, it still brings a tear of joy and hope. And the background music gives Kevin Bacon's character a rock to stand upon as he gives his speech. Then, there are the snowcapped mountains and sweeping farm valleys that drew me in. The kids, the story, the religious oppression (I'm truly from the Bible Belt where there are no snowcapped mountains) and most of the music all make this film one that I will watch until I'm old and gray, and no longer have the strength to say ""I'm gonna be gone."" P.S. My beloved husband won't watch this with me because he can't quit cringing at the 80's music. He's from Seattle.:)"
"misslv80","9","0","2","28 May 2004"," Fun 80s dance movie
","""Footloose"" is one of those fun movies from the 80s that has a rocking soundtrack and great dancing. The story is about a young man named Ren, played very well by Kevin Bacon, who moves from the big city to a small town where dancing is outlawed. Of course this is absolutely ludicrous to Ren, a guy who enjoys rock music and loves to dance. The law was passed after a group of kids were killed in a car accident after they had been out dancing and drinking.<br/><br/>I liked the performance of John Lithgow as Rev. Shaw Moore, the iron-handed preacher with his rousing God-fearing speeches on morality. I had seen him at the Hollywood Bowl in ""My Fair Lady"" this past summer, and he is an excellent actor. There is Ariel, who plays Lithgow's daughter and Ren's romantic love-interest, played by Lori Singer, who secretly rebels against her father. Although, her character annoyed me a bit at the beginning for some unknown reason, she grew on me once she and Ren get to know each other. I also liked Chris Penn as Ren's friend Willard, whom he teaches how to dance.<br/><br/>I have a problem with one scene in this movie. Early in the movie, Ariel goes off for a joyride with her friends after church and her boyfriend pulls beside them in his truck on a country road. She manages to climb out of the window as they're driving and she actually balances on both the truck and the car while they're driving side by side! Unless you're an Olympic gymnast, there's NO WAY someone could pull such a stunt. Sure, this scene is meant to show how crazy and rebellious Ariel is, but they could have done a better job in portraying her rebellion. It doesn't move the story along in any way, but despite this unrealistic scene, the rest of the movie was very enjoyable.<br/><br/>I liked the quick editing of the dance scenes in the film, it was very much like an MTV music video would have been back in those days. I love the intro of the film with all those legs dancing, a remiscent flashback of what people wore on their feet in those days, high heels with socks, leg warmers, loafers, boots, etc. The scene at the diner where Ariel pops a tape into her stereo and all the kids get down with the music is pure fun, and even a little sexy as well.<br/><br/>It has a good message about censorship and religious hypocrisy. During the 80s there were actually people who were rallying against the ""corruption"" of young peoples' morals because of rock music and music videos, so I'm sure this film must have hit home back then. The main message behind Ren's fight against the anti-dancing law wasn't so much about teenage rebellion, but also about the right for people to enjoy life. Without music and dancing, the world would be a dull and lifeless place.<br/><br/>A must for 80s film fans!"

","this is one of those great Kevin Bacon movies!!! if there is ever such a thing as a ""career movie""...this would be it for Kevin. Kevin played the ""rebel teen"" to a T!!! and he had Ariel (Lori Singer) on his side. Lori played the preacher's daughter (I think this character was cause for the term ""church brat""!) and John Lithgow did a rock-solid job of playing Shaw Moore, the southern pastor who had a field day with the law against dancing and rock music. this movie also serves as a great reminder that NO ONE in the church (ministry or otherwise) is perfect. and this was also a HUGE career ""step up"" from ""square pegs"" for Sarah Jessica Parker. She played the ""life of the party"" girl Rusty (btw...who would name their daughter ""Rusty""????).

","""Footloose"" is a lot of fun to watch.  The main high-school characters are very likable and we sympathize with their ""oppression.""  Even the initially unsympathetic authority characters, led by the Rev. Moore (expertly portrayed by John Lithgow), are given some genuine depth in this movie. They aren't just mindless martinets.  Their beliefs are shown to have some credible foundation, although most of us wouldn't agree with them.<br/><br/>The kids, too, are shown fairly realistically.  They are not portrayed as over-idealized defenders of artistic freedom.  They just want to have fun. And it is fun watching them have fun.  I was particularly drawn to the slightly goofy, yet faithful, secondary characters played by Chris Penn and Sarah Jessica Parker.  I thought to myself, ""Those are the kind of people I'd like to hang out with.""  The picture of adolescent friendship shown in this movie is very appealing.<br/><br/>Sure, the plot is a tad formulaic.  But who says you can't have fun with a good formula, particularly when it presents a decent message embodied in decent characters?  And oh yeah, the dancing and the music are good too."
