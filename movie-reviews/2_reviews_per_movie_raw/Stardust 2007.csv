","I went to a small advance screening of this movie on July 19th, knowing no more than the names of a few of the actors and that it was a fantasy/adventure quest of some sort.<br/><br/>The plot line really is nothing like I have seen, and a unique story is certainly appreciated with everything else that is currently in or coming soon to theaters. In spite of what first impressions may give, it isn't cheesy, corny, tacky, or ridiculous, and is actually highly entertaining and funny. The flow is quite well done, nothing seems rushed or dragged out. The soundtrack, for lack of better words, is magical and adds much to the film, as opposed to simply filling the silence as often happens in movies or TV. And even though I might have known what was coming at points, I still couldn't bear to stop watching the screen; to my knowledge, not a single person left the theater during the entire movie.<br/><br/>My one gripe is that there seems to be almost no marketing for this film, and as brilliant as it is I can't figure out why."
"zetes","9","290","333","12 August 2007"," Provides more fun than all of the summer blockbusters put together
","The 14 year-old in me is immensely happy that they're now able to make really good looking fantasy movies, and that they're all the rage, what with Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter and The Chronicles of Narnia making loads of cash at the box office. This year will see (and already has seen) several more, most notably The Golden Compass, which has the most exciting trailer I've seen this year. Stardust, based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, showed up in theaters this week with little more than a peep. I saw no previews for it, only a couple of commercials. The critical reaction is kind of blah. I wouldn't even have seen it if not for the fact that I have to wait on a friend to see The Bourne Ultimatum, and that nothing else interesting opened this weekend. Well, if you'll forgive the horrible pun, the stars must have been rightly aligned, because I went to see Stardust, and I loved it. It's not a huge movie like Lord of the Rings. The plot line is your very basic fantasy quest (the hero sets out to look for a fallen star) filled with obstacles. But within that basic outline, the story is lively and imaginative. It's simply aiming to be a lot of fun, and a charming little romance. And it succeeds wonderfully. There were a lot of big films this summer, but none of them were nearly as fun as this one. There's a lot going on, but the story is told well and is almost entirely coherent. It isn't a masterpiece, but it definitely can occupy the same kind of ground that something like The Princess Bride has (though I don't like it quite as much as the earlier film). A lot of fun to be had here if you're a fan of the genre."
"songbrd427","10","662","775","2 August 2007"," Previews do no justice...
","Why are the previews so blah for a movie that is so awesome!! Everyone should know what an excellent movie this is. It is engaging and funny from moment one, original, and well-acted. I wish the movie was doing itself as good press as it deserves!<br/><br/>For anyone that loved The Princess Bride, Labyrinth, and other truly funny and original fantasy adventure, this is one of the great ones. Robert DeNiro is hysterical. Relative newcomer Charlie Cox is an incredible leading man. Claire Danes is fantastic as always. Michelle Pfiefer is making quite a splash with her recent returns to the screen. There are also a lot of wonderful moments from minor characters...even down to facial expressions."
"Chris_Docker","9","127","144","26 August 2007"," A magic that isn't puerile . . .
","The power to dream is a wonderful thing. There's a saying, ""Not all dreamers achieve, but all achievers dream."" By exploring our imagination we shape our own futures. Or build empires. Perhaps overcome our fears, limitations and obstacles. Gain wisdom and benefit mankind. Or (put simply) just find our way to true love and happiness. Freud might express such things in symbols. The language of fantasy.<br/><br/>Tristan ventures out of a rather twee English village called Wall. He goes through a break in the wall. A portal. In search of something that will prove his love to Victoria (Sienna Miller). Victoria doesn't take him very seriously. So he pledges to bring back a falling star.<br/><br/>Stormhold is the world outside the wall. He discovers the fallen star has taken the form of a beautiful girl, Yvaine (Claire Danes). To complicate matters, three evil witches want to get hold of Yvaine. If they can eat her heart, it will replenish their youth. (One of the witches is played by Michelle Pfeiffer, who does fabulous young-old transformations of looks and manner.) The 'good guy' they meet on their way is Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro). He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but is a sweetie closet queen underneath. Heirs of Stormhold meanwhile are engaged in a pitched battle over inheriting the Kingdom. Ricky Gervais is an added extras. A buffoon trader throwing in standard Gervais-type gags well. Tristan's purity of spirit arouses the love of Yvaine, so there is a nice little triangle going. Till he achieves the maturity to discern pedestal divas from real women.<br/><br/>Stardust is a full-on, large scale fantasy that does credit to its myriad stars. Wholly positive, and written with a clarity that makes it more worthy of psychoanalysis that a coven full of Harry Potter romps. Production values rival Hollywood, and the storyline is free of the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas than shape and pervert so many large scale fantasies.<br/><br/>That is not to say that Stardust is without its faults. Plot and dialogue have many predictable elements, and the fairytale quality may be too saccharine for some audiences. But if you want an excuse to let your heart fly, this film may well provide it.<br/><br/>As a boy, I remember listening in wonder to albums by the Moody Blues (who practiced in a house not far from where I lived). They made records with names like ""In Search of the Lost Chord,"" and wrote lyrics like, ""Thinking is the best way to travel."" I would fill my head with books on magic and mystery, from Timothy Leary to Aleister Crowley. Shaping dreams. Learning to make them real. Nowadays people might talk of NLP or positive thinking. Adults that remember how to dream with the force of youth but with the vision and application of maturity. Do you still enjoy that feeling?<br/><br/>You are advised not to wait for Stardust on DVD. See it on the biggest cinema screen you can find. And Dolby Digital Surround Sound if you can get it. The actors look like they had a ball. Maybe you will too."
"derjager76","8","432","511","25 June 2007"," A wonderful fantasy tale of action, adventure, and love!
","I was one of about 200 people that was lucky enough to see an early sneak of this film.<br/><br/>Stardust follows Tristan a young man on a quest to find a fallen star and bring it back to the woman he loves in order to prove his love for her. The only catch is that the star has fallen on the other side of the wall, a doorway between England and a magical kingdom known as Stormhold.<br/><br/>This film was just a joy to watch, it has something in it for everyone, all of the action scenes are played out beautifully and the comedy is spread out through the film making it funny without being corny. If I had to compare the likes to another film it would probably have to be The Princess Bride, a classic.<br/><br/>All the performances are outstanding, the beautiful Claire Danes makes you love her in her portrayal of Yvaine the trusting naive star and under rated Michelle Pfeiffer delivers a stellar over the top performance as Larnia...but the performance to talk about is Robert De Niro...In every scene that he is in hands down he steals the show...<br/><br/>If you are in the mood for a funny fantasy love story this is the film. Guys don't get turned off by the description there is enough action comedy and not to mention lots of eye candy with Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer to keep you entertained throughout. The cinematography is dead on and keeps with the feel of the film...nothing about the film seems forced."
"eincline","10","343","410","25 July 2007"," My Fantasy Fix
","This movie has everything a fantasy movie should have, romance, clever witticisms, great acting and a fair dose of magic. <br/><br/>I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and was drawn to its original plot (based on the Neil Gaiman novel which I am now looking to read) and colorful characters.<br/><br/>One of the most striking things to me actually was how self contained the story is. Unlike so many sci-fi fantasy movies out there right now which leave open-endings and such this was a pure fairy-tale, satisfying in and of itself with no need for a sequel.<br/><br/>Original. Fun. Feel-good Fantasy."
"markshark-2","9","264","322","9 August 2007"," If you liked Princess Bride
","This movie is a lot of fun. The actors really make the movie go the distance though. Without giving away the plot, I would describe it as a new Princess Bride cult favorite that should stand the test of time. You get to see a whole different side to Robert DeNiro in this movie! (Worth the price of admission just for that!) All the elements are there from adventure to romance, and well placed comedy.<br/><br/>People of all ages will enjoy it. (My parents even did!) Good special effects, may be scary for the little ones. Good date movie. Great for some escapism.<br/><br/>Deserves an A. (Hope it does well at the box office)"
"rancorrblackmane","8","500","640","18 July 2007"," Stardust -- Another Guarded Review
","Stardust Another Guarded Review (originally written June 15, 2007)<br/><br/>The marketing machine has only just begun for this one (no site yet? wth?), so I doubt most of you have heard about it. In truth, I hadn't either (sort of). When I got the posting, I thought it was another code name and was actually worried it was Transformers, one of the movies I wanted to see when not working so I can enjoy it 100% as a mere mortal movie-goer. Turns out, it wasn't Transformers and I had been aware of this movie way back when as 'that Neil Gaiman movie'. <br/><br/>What is it about? Well, in short, it's a Gaiman fairy tale about a boy and a fallen star. Any more than that and I'd be giving away plot info which is (a) a breach of contract, and (b) spoiling your fun. If you really want to know what it's about, go buy the book. Rumour has it, Gaiman might be something of a writer.<br/><br/>Not knowing what to expect in a movie can be so pleasant if the surprise is worthwhile. And for this one, it certainly was. This screening was 'special' in that it included not just film critics, but also exhibitors (they rarely have a mixed screening) and local sci-fi/fantasy folks. So, you know the expected audience, right? I mean, with this crowd and the title of Stardust, I knew what to expect.<br/><br/>Oh how sweetly wrong I was.<br/><br/>Yes, it is a fairy tale written by an author famed in comic bookdom (and even books without pictures, if those truly exist). But it was not Lord of Rings. It was not even another Lord of the Rings wannabe (ahem, Eragon). It was much more intimate than all that.<br/><br/>But, like Lord of the Rings, it was the, well, humanism of the film which sells the fantastical qualities. It's surely a romantic tale, but with generous splashes of humour. Not slapstick Shrekian humour. It's more along the lines of dramedy than comedy. Before I go on, let's do this movie review thing.<br/><br/>Acting is, in the very least, good. It's always hard to say more than that for fantasy films but I do believe there were significant superbly acted roles. Michelle Pfieffer is not, sadly, one of those. She plays a villain, and she does the job. Nothing special. Rupert Everett, though, he was a real jerk. That is, a great villain. Peter O'Toole is, well, Peter frickin' O'Toole -- which is marvellous. Ricky Gervais is perfectly cast and shows why. Robert De Niro seemed to be having too much fun for the most part. When he wanted to deliver the goods, though, he did. And Charlie Cox (who?) as the lead character was fine surprise from a guy I ain't never heard of.<br/><br/>Claire Danes. Claire Danes. Claire Danes. I've always been of mixed opinion with her. She can be great, and then she can seem to miss the mark. In this, she's the former. And she is, quite literally, the star of this film. Sure, her accent stumbles here and there. And, yes, she's not as good as she can be when Cox isn't in the scene. However ... well, see for yourself.<br/><br/>Special effects are muted yet accomplished, and only significant where they should be. Best flying ship yet -- sorry Potter. Direction is light-hearted and flows nicely. Cinematography could have been better but not everyone films in New Zealand. All else is top bracket.<br/><br/>And now that that's done...<br/><br/>...the writing. Oh, the writing! Neil, you devil. It's hard in today's climate to do anything original and, at first, you begin to wonder. A kingdom, a dying King, a boy out to prove his own worth, witches, ghosts, a quest (or three) -- what's new? But Gaiman's story draws you in with its surface familiarity only to subvert it all into a sweetly original tale of a boy and his heart. And, though you suspect how it's all going to turn out, you begin to wonder in the third act and -- if you're me -- find yourself pulled into the rousing climactic confrontation and hoping for the best. In the end, you'll find this story, this movie, is what all fairy tales should be but all too often are not. Fantastical and real.<br/><br/>(I wish I could talk about Septimus vs Tristan but I won't ruin it for you. For those who read the book, rest assured, it's done properly.)<br/><br/>Those I spoke to afterwards had the same impression I did. A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new {WITHHELD} for this generation. The blank gets filled-in only after the movie is in wide release because, well, you might be expecting it. You'll know when you walk out, anyway. I sincerely hope Stardust doesn't get lost among the tentpoles. Even if it does, it'll be my pleasure to push into the hands of everyone I know.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Forgot to add the {WITHHELD} reveal. I'm a few years late, but ... ""A great film for all ages to enjoy, and the new THE PRINCESS BRIDE for this generation."" <br/><br/>Perhaps a bit lofty an assessment but I'm still confident that years from now, there will be the same ""Oh, I love that movie,"" response to this as there is now for The Princess Bride.<br/><br/>(Edited for grammar and stuff. Still rather spastic in tone and flow. I am not Gaiman. Duh.)"
"Zanahade","10","492","634","27 July 2007"," I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told.
","OK here is how I do this. I grade movies on 10 components. Each component will inherently start with 5 points. It can then lose or gain 5 points for a possible 10 or 0.<br/><br/>Mood: Action, Romance, Comedy, Drama, Suspense - I give this component 10 points. It had a perfect balance of all five aspects. The Action was fun and exiting. The Romance was not overdone, but still very emotional and moving. I laughed hard and long throughout the movie and still I was captivated by the fantastic drama, and riveting suspense.<br/><br/>Plot - I give this component 10 points. I thought all the good fairy tales had already been told. I found my self, sitting in the theatre, returned to my childhood, and in that instant I again believed in unicorns, wicked witches, and falling stars that make dreams come true.<br/><br/>Cinema Photography - I give this component 8 points. While the movie captured the story very well in the majority of the angles, I found my self more than once trying to figure out what happened just off camera.<br/><br/>FX - I give this component 10 points. I love that they used C.G.I. sparingly. The epic scenes were believable. The magical powers were frighteningly realistic. All in all less is more, and this had it ALL! Cast - I give this component 10 points. No names and seasoned actors alike, the cast was amazing! Michelle Pfeiffer was wonderfully wicked, Charlie Cox made Tristan come to life, Claire Danes gave emotion to the stars, and I will never look and Robert De Niro the same again.<br/><br/>Acting - I give this component 10 points. Even the newbie actors played their rolls to perfection. Once again, I will NEVER look and Robert De Niro the same again.<br/><br/>Character development - I give this component 9 points. This felt a little rushed and I think if the movie had been a bit longer they could have done the characters a little better justice.<br/><br/>Dialogue - I give this component 10 points. The dialogue was smart, witty, fun even the mush had good dialogue.<br/><br/>Score - I give this component 7 points. I can honestly remember only one small piece of music from the entire movie. I am not complaining beyond the fact that the music could be more memorable.<br/><br/>Ending - I give this component 9 points. Almost perfect ending! I feel that certain aspects of the ending should have been more pronounced, while others could have been more subdued, but no threads were left untied.<br/><br/>Total: 93% Buy the DVD? HEL YES! See it in the Theatre? Most definitely! Bottom Line: Excellent movie for everyone! EPIC! I strongly recommend seeing it in the theatre, I know I'll be going back for seconds!"
"dmurray-33","10","343","446","9 August 2007"," Great Movie!!
","I was not expecting much from this movie. I was given a ticket for an advanced screening. I had just gotten off of work. It was hot and I was tired. I had to wait in the movie line for 40 minutes and there seemed not to be any cool air flowing through the hallways of the theater complex.<br/><br/>Once seated in the theater, tired and frustrated, the movie started, I did not recognize any of the actors in the beginning, but the flow of the movie was perfect. Right from the beginning I became consumed with the movie, getting more and more excited with each minute passing. I think this movie is destined to be a fantasy/fairytale classic. The actors were fabulous, the pace was perfect, and the ending was magical."
"Rasilio","10","45","55","9 September 2007"," I hate you Neil Gaiman
","This afternoon we took the kids to the movies and saw Neil Gaimans Stardust and all I can say is Wow.<br/><br/>It is rare that I am completely taken aback by anything but this is quite possibly the greatest fantasy movie I have ever seen, maybe even the best movie of any kind and it is all Neil Gaiman's fault.<br/><br/>Sure, I could have been sucked in by the wonderful dialog which was smart, flowed smoothly,and made the characters completely believable.<br/><br/>I could go on for days about the spectacular acting, Charlie Cox is perfect as Tristan, Claire Daines is Brilliant as Yvaine, and Robert Di Nero almost steals the movie as the Deeply in the Closet Pirate Captian Shakespeare.<br/><br/>The pure joy brought about by the humor which managed to be Laugh our Loud funny, Intelligent enough to make the first Shrek look like an 80's Sitcom, and blend in perfectly with the rest of the movie alone would have made this a great movie.<br/><br/>Special Effects were near perfect, true this was no LOTR or Star Wars SF Extravaganza but where they were use they were exactly what was called for, not too much to distract you from the movie itself and blended into the story perfectly.<br/><br/>Then there is the story? What can I say. How often do you come across a story containing all of the classic fairytale formula components that doesn't just come off as another cheap Princess Bride knockoff. It manages to be Familiar and comfortable and yet completely new and refreshing at the same time.<br/><br/>Any one of those things would have made this a good movie, all of them combined make it a great movie but they pale in comparison to the rich enchanting world that those elements combine to bring to life well. Once again Neil Gaiman has done it, he has driven another dagger into my heart by creating a world of fantasy that is so beautiful and enchanting that I would do almost anything to live in it and only given me a short glimpse into it. I didn't want it to end, I wanted to be sucked through a vortex to the land of Stormhold and get to meet Tristan and Yvaine in person, to travel it's fields and valleys, Stroll through it's marketplaces and meet it's residents both dangerous and friendly and stay there forever. It is a feeling that I have noticed whenever I have read anything by Gaiman, The Sandman, American Gods, Coraline all left me with a deep sense of sadness when I finished reading them because it was over, I could not see anything more into the worlds he had created which seemed to be so much more vibrant and alive than the one I am forced to live in and watching Stardust was no different.<br/><br/>In the end I'm sure that Neil's writing and this movie won't have the same effect on everyone but trust me when I say you will not regret the time or money spent watching this movie, it is easily one of the top 5 movies I have ever seen and I can guarantee that anyone at all with a soul will at least like it."

"dave_wright87","9","13","15","12 November 2007"," The most fantastical adventure of the year!
","I went into this film with modest hopes, the director had pedigree, I had seen Charlie Cox in Casanova and was impressed, and literally EVERYONE had been raving about it. As the story started to unfold I was introduced to Victorian England on one side of a mysterious Wall, and on the other a magical land, Stormhold. The actual plot weaves together many strands and I don't want to ruin the surprises for anyone, but at the barest it is the simple tale of a young man (Charlie Cox) in love with the village beauty (Sienna Miller). To win her love he tells her he will fetch back a fallen star from the other side of the Wall. Howver when he arrives at the star he finds not a lump of astral metal as he expected but a beautiful woman (Claire Danes). As the two journey back to the wall they find themselves in the adventure of a lifetime. The visuals are brilliant, England looks stunning, in a similar fashion to New Zealand in LOTR, and it s full of wonderful little flourishes, such as the way that the star shines when she is happy, a very simple effect, but one that looks radiant. As well as this the acting good, especially from the leads and Robert DeNiro, whose turn as the captain of an airship is incredibly memorable. This film is THE perfect date movie, it is romantic without being a ""chick flick"", funny and full of wonderful action pieces that will satisfy any action film fan. All in all it is a truly magical experience from beginning to end, and I now Im raving about it to EVERYONE!"

","There are not many movies around that have given me a feeling like Stardust did all throughout the course of the film. As magically fairy-tale-like as The Princess Bride, Stardust is most definitely the most wonderful fantasy spectacle of the 2000's as well as the 1990's. Exciting, hilarious and equipped with wonderful imagery as well as unforgettable characters, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro's especially, I challenge anyone to watch this movie without a smile. From the first ten minutes of the film you know perfectly well how it will end, but it is the journey and not the destination that enthralls the viewer from start to finish.<br/><br/>Ten stars, and not a decimal less."
"shonamacp","10","17","21","12 November 2007"," Sweetly Funny, a Classic in the Making
","As a massive fan of fantasy in general, and of the works of Neil Gaiman *in particular*, I've been looking forward to this film so avidly, so hungrily and with such a bittersweet mixture of anticipation and fear of disappointment that I can scarcely believe it's finally here. And you know what? I needn't have feared, the film version is bl**dy awesome. Different from the book, but in a good way - less whimsical, more comical, still deeply sweet and enchanting.<br/><br/>The special effects are absolutely spot-on, and make magic feel a natural and proper part of the world of Wall without being overtly spectacular and intrusive.<br/><br/>Proper attention has been paid to storytelling and pacing, and the casting in the main is a triumph, with the ghostly Princes (whose roll-call read almost as a ""Who's Who"" of currently cool British comedy - Rupert Everett, David Walliams of Little Britain fame, two of the blokes from Green Wing etc) stealing most of the best lines and pretty much all of the films' funniest moments, which exist in abundance. <br/><br/>In fact, the one minor criticism I have at all of the film is that sometimes the comedy elements become a little OTT, subtlety goes out of the window to the detraction of the main story.... Ricky Gervais' cameo, for example, was far too much just ""Ricky Gervais doing his usual David Brent from the Office comedy persona"" for my liking, and in my opinion, created an unwelcome and jolting break from the magical spell of the progressing story (though in fairness, from memory I believe the Ferdy character in the original book WAS pretty ""Ricky Gervais""-esquire when I think back on it)....<br/><br/>But this is a minor quibble in an otherwise immaculately cast and scripted fairytale with a good mixture of action and romance. Charlie Cox, as the protagonist Tristan, captures the correct mixture of naivety, subtle comedy and self-realisation required for a story like this where a ""humble young boy embarks on life-changing quest""; Claire Danes as Yvaine is beautiful, feisty and just ever so slightly alien or ethereal, a perfect interpretation of her stellar role; Robert De Niro, in the cameo every reviewer is talking about, is indeed deserving of praise, rollicking good fun (looks like he's having a ball, too)... and Michelle Pfeiffer is triumphantly cool and nasty as wicked witch Lamia, my favourite performance of the film overall. If you enjoyed her deliciously b!tchy performance in the recent ""Hairspray"" then you will thoroughly enjoy her in this, too.<br/><br/>So to round off this review: you will laugh, for sure, you will smile, and you may even cry - Stardust is a beautiful, heart-warming fairytale for all the family, with a heart of gold and more sass 'n smarts than is immediately apparent. One of my all-time favourite films is the absolutely fantastic Princess Bride, and Stardust is being readily likened to this with good reason as it is a very similar type of film exploring similar themes and territory.... and just as The Princess Bride remains fresh, smart and funny twenty years after its initial release, I believe that the delicious tongue-in-cheek sweetness of Stardust will be showing up as a family favourite on our televisions (or equivalent future device!) for many years to come."
"Egamstk","9","19","24","10 August 2007"," Don't judge a book by its cover here.
","The summer has been so full of Blockbusters and comebacks of films, and not to mention some of the disappointments of those comebacks, that I was woe to find a film I could just sit down and enjoy. <br/><br/>In case you don't want to read further down the page (there aren't any spoilers), I'll sum it up here: It's more mature than Ella Enchanted (there are some questionably violent parts, plenty of death, and a handful of scenes with a little blood, not for small children), but doesn't try to be overly corny or overstep its bounds. Think of it as a bit more serious, bit more magical Princess Bride, and you'll be close. <br/><br/>-------------------------------------------------------------<br/><br/>I am, perhaps, not as prodigious a movie goer as others... Maybe once or twice a month, if I feel active. I'm also a huge Sci-Fi/Fantasy fan. I get bored of remade repetitive story lines and films with more flash than filling faster than you can count to 10, and this film is the diamond in the rough.<br/><br/>By the end here (August), I was tired enough of fractured expectations from the big hits that I averted seeing Bourne Ultimatum in favor of Stardust. Having had my hopes thoroughly muddied by Transformers for my Fiction addiction, the previews of Stardust seemed appealing, but I was certainly wary.<br/><br/>As many others here, I was utterly surprised. I had gone in thinking to see another generic fantasy movie clichéd from here to breakfast. Don't be fooled, it is most definitely a fairy-tale, and it does indeed have witches, magic, and utterly requires suspension of disbelief... But the most refreshing thing I found, is that it's NOT based on anything I've seen or read in the past 15 years, and it's actually a really good movie.<br/><br/>((Unlike 90% of the other movies which seem to persistently re-appear like thorns in a side, perhaps a sign that Hollywood is running out of ideas? I could read a book this year, and in two years the movie would be out as another ""Epic fantasy tale, the likes of LotR and the rest"" so says the NYT and such and such no doubt.))<br/><br/>Stardust didn't have me bolted to my seat because of jam-packed action at every turn, nor was I sweating bullets because of plot-hook after plot-hook threatening to tear the dramatic tension apart and echo throughout the theater in a loud boom. It didn't even use enormous blasts of sound to grab my attention to what's happening on screen (Transformers, I'm looking at you). It's not trying to show off the latest CGI techniques, nor did it offend my intelligence with dimwitted dialogs and story lines that are simple enough I could've figured them out in 3rd grade (boy I hate those). <br/><br/>I just... watched. Watched, and enjoyed a refreshingly CREATIVE storyline unfold before my eyes. Sure, I may have known what was going to happen throughout most of the film, but it makes you forget that. It even made my heart twinge at some parts, but the most important aspect I noticed is that I left the theater feeling better than when I'd gone in.<br/><br/>It truly is a gem. After so much slush this summer with so many remakes and films that fell short of my expectations, this was like a cold sweet cup of tea to cap off all the hard work I'd done sitting through the others trying to come out of them with my money's worth.<br/><br/>It's probably not for everyone, but do yourself a favor; If you enjoy fantasy films that stand the test of time alone (Princess Bride, Black Cauldron, The Dark Crystal, etc.) then you should really see this movie. This little diamond is finding its way into my DVD collection the moment it hits stores, you can trust me on this.<br/><br/>Simply wonderful."
"tavm","10","25","33","7 September 2007"," Stardust is an underrated humorous fairy tale of the summer movie season
","While I don't consider myself a big fan of fairy tale movies, Stardust intrigued me based on seeing Michelle Pfeiffer in the trailers as a villain (especially since I was about to see her as the bossy Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray). Boy, is she so convincingly evil here as a witch, especially with her age-ugly makeup in the beginning and end! Robert De Niro is also great as the pirate captain who's forced to hide ""in the closet"" to protect his ""reputation""! Just about all the actors like Claire Danes, Rupert Everett, Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole and many others do fine work here. While Danes and Pfeiffer are classic beauties, there's also stunning faces of Sienna Miller, Olivia Grant (as Girl Bernard), and Kate Magowan especially when we first meet her. Newcomer Charlie Cox is fine as the lead Tristan and he looked so much like his father Dunstan as a young man that I thought that was him in early scenes with Magowan (actually Ben Barnes). Many comments have compared this to The Princess Bride and while I can see some resemblances, the main difference was that with PB, you always knew it was just an imaginary tale as told by an old man to his grandson. Stardust makes you believe, for the most part, that what you're seeing and hearing could have actually happened even with all the hilarity that happens throughout. So on that note, I highly recommended Stardust."

","The beautiful story of Stardust is written by by Neil Gaiman (writer of MirrorMask) and it's really a good story. I think it would appeal to any Labyrinth, Princess Bride or 10th Kingdom fan and yet it's totally unique and stands up on it's own. And I feel the film adaptation of this story has a far better ending than what was presented in the original novel by Neil Gaiman. I won't spoil it for you.<br/><br/>The main character, Tristan (Tristran in the novel), is the son of a mortal and a faerie slave kept by a witch in the realm of faerie. The story begins in a town near a wall that separates the magical world from the human world. When there is a falling star Tristan promises to retrieve it for a girl he is infatuated with. He is unaware that the star has taken the form of a girl in the fairy world and that there are others after her too. Three elderly witches who want to use her heart to become young again, and some bickering princes.<br/><br/>It's a really good story. It has humor and magic and beautiful, surreal scenes and visuals. It's charming and I feel it can be watched by children and adults of all ages. It's simply magical. It's a true classic fairy tale, the likes of which I haven't seen in cinema since the 1980s."

","Greetings again from the darkness. This one will be compared to ""The Princess Bride"" and although it doesn't measure up to that classic, it is extremely entertaining and well made in its own right. The story line is a bit odd and the whole wall thing is never really explained, but the execution is fine, even building up strong suspense.<br/><br/>Charlie Cox plays Tristan, who falls for the wrong girl (Sienna Miller), and agrees to fetch her a fallen star ... who happens to be played by the stunning Claire Danes. Not much suspense on what happens with these two, but the suspenseful part comes in with the wicked witch played by Michelle Pfeiffer and the prince son of King Peter O'Toole looking to reclaim the ruby necklace our ""star"" is wearing. Lots of bad chasing the good.<br/><br/>Along the way, an encounter with the strangest pirate you will see (including any from the Carribbean). Robert Deniro plays Captain Shakespeare - tough on the inside, and shall we say in touch with his feminine side. Another encounter involves the brilliant Ricky Gervais as a fast talking trader and that is good for a couple of laughs.<br/><br/>Not your typical chase, coming of age, or fantasy film, but director Matthew Vaughn's (""Layer Cake"") effort deserves an audience. Sadly the poor marketing campaign will probably prevent it from making any money. My guess it will find big success on video."

"krice23","9","4","4","2 April 2019"," Remarkable, inventive, and Engaging
","This fil is a delight to watch. Thoroughly enjoyable and engaging! Original storyline and a truly fine ensemble cast.
Robert De Niro as you've never seen him, a surprising role in full perfect comedic glory! You are guaranteed to laugh your ass off! Let's face it, words just fail when it comes to his talent and this is a role you will love to see him play. I am confident he must have thoroughly enjoyed playing it. No one else could have done it justice the way he does, no one!
Ricky Gervais puts in a cameo and never fails to disappoint! We always see a little bit of him in every role he portrays and are the better for it.
Claire Danes, the co-star, well what can be said that hasn't already been said? She Is the character she portrays, no matter the material, but here she truly shines (if you've already seen it, you'll forgive me the pun).
Michelle Pheifer as the cruel and relentless Queen witch, truly one of the world's great beauties, and as ever, unafraid to play the aging, deteriorating, hairless hag is the master of her craft, scene after scene.
Oh, and lest I forget, the one and only Sir Peter O'Toole has an early cameo playing a deliciously twisted dying king pitting his sons against each other for the right to be heir to his throne.
One can always argue against stars playing cameos in favor of unknown actors, but then we'd miss these brilliant snippets from our finest thespians, wouldn't we?
There are other names, which I do not know or recall, or at least faces you will recognize. One of which is Claire's co-star, and the male lead, whose name entirely escapes me now, who puts in a perfect performance and it's a pleasure (SPOILERS!) to watch the very realistic chemistry between these two co-stars transform into true love.
As for the plot, I shall leave it to the IMDb synopsis. No point in my rehashing it. My intent here is to share the wonderful and convincing performances by so many which make this film a true joy to watch and does not fail in warming your heart. It is truly a happily ever after film and I'm happy to convince anyone to watch it!!
Won't you give it a try? Only a true curmudgeon would fail to be moved by this enjoyable and heartwarming film."

"rachelgallit","10","4","4","6 September 2018"," Perennial Favorite
","This movie is a lovely cross-section of whimsical and heartfelt. Keeping to the classic hero's journey to discover himself, complete an external quest, and win the girl, this movie is a clear-cut example of a tried and true romantic adventure. Young Tristan sets out to retrieve a fallen star for his unrequited love, only to find that the star is a no-nonsense spitfire of a girl, whom he must team up with to save the kingdom from the clutches of Prince Septimus and the evil witches who seek to kill and consume the star, Yvaine, in an effort to regain their youth. The friendship of the protagonists evolves in an engaging and playful manner, and while contains no revolutionary or surprising twists or turns, hits the classic marks with ease and style. Upon basic inspection, the plot plays out exactly as one would expect given a basic knowledge of narrative structure, but the actors and dialogue carry the viewer through the plot points in an enjoyably predictable pattern: comfortable and familiar as opposed to boring and worn out. Charlie Cox (Tristan) and Robert De Niro (Captain Shakespeare) provide comic relief studded throughout the drama and romance, and Matthew Vaughn (director) delivered his usual brand of entertaining, if not intellectually stimulating, mid-grade blockbusters."
"stephen-speakman","10","4","4","28 April 2018"," Laughs and a crazy adventure story
","I must admit to coming across this on an evening with my wife out with her friends. I'd heard of it when it was on at the cinema and thought ""Nah, I'll give a miss. Besides, it's bound to be crap"", forgetting I've enjoyed watching the likes of The Princess Bride, Labaryth in my time. I sat down and boy, what a mistake I made! The script moves at a good speed (not too slow to make it boring, not to fast to make you make it confusing to question what you had just watched. It was funny/m or romantic where it needed to be. The eclectic gathering of actors from both sides of the pond make you surprised to see Dexter Blackstock playing second in command to a cross dressing Captain Shakespeare, Robert De Niro. Whoever decided cast him in that role must have that he'd had a meltdown doing it, but it couldn't have been more right. In 2017 everyone was raving how during Baby Driver's action scenes when with the music. Well, this film did it 10 years earlier, as the sword fighting on the deck of The Caspertine will show that. All in all, I found it a film to watch on a wet, miserable day which should make you (like Claire Danes' character Yvaine) shine"

"wendylike","10","4","4","22 March 2008"," Surprisingly GREAT!
","I chose the title off the shelf of my video club just because--and I honestly confess--I saw the names of Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Clare Danes. Not with much confidence (and expecting a total disappointment like the latest Disney's ""Enchanted"", which I thought was AWFUL), I started watching it and I was almost instantly THRILLED, EXCITED, totally and completely SURPRISED and AMAZED. Glued to the screen. I devoured the story and I delayed returning the video just to show it to my family and to myself have the opportunity to watch it again. We all thought it was the best film we'd seen in a very, very loooooooong time!!! The acting is just perfect: all the irony, puns and attitudes are what they are supposed to be. I liked the portrayal of all the different characters: sincere, believable and funny. And, above all, I'm absolutely amazed at the solid storyline: the plot does not have a single flaw, and it is refreshing to watch such a film, logical in its own laws, well developed, well portrayed, excelling in visual development (not only the CGI, but all the landscapes.... all the scenes, actually, are worthy of belonging to a painting in a museum). The romance has the perfect ingredients to make anyone -and I really mean anyone of any age!!!-- fall in love with the film. I loved it from beginning to end, and I'm certainly buying the DVD."

","I anticipated this movie to be decent and possibly cliché, but I was completely wrong! Charlie Cox (I had never heard of him until now) played an incredibly good leading man; he was so earnest and romantic, me and my friend that saw the movie with me totally fell in love with him.<br/><br/>Claire Danes, who I did like before (LOVED her in Romeo and Juliet), made me enjoy her even more. Her acting was fantastic, I couldn't even tell that she was American. The chemistry between her and Charlie Cox was extremely good, the casting was quite perfect.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer were equally well-casted; DeNiro as that gay pirate...priceless, priceless. I laughed so hard at that one scene where Septimus comes on the ship...oh my god, wow. Pfeiffer played a decent villain, I liked her as the snippy mother in Hairspray. But she had the right amount of melodrama and snide comments throughout the movie. <br/><br/>Overall, it was funny (but not slap-stick at all!), romantic, the special effects weren't totally frequent but when they were, they were great; the cameos from Ricky Gervais and Peter O'Toole were also well-placed. <br/><br/>I totally recommend this movie to anyone who likes fantasy movies like the Princess Bride or even Lord of the Rings. It kept my interest the entire time and I will be buying the DVD when it comes out!"
"Chrysanthepop","Null","8","10","11 April 2008"," A Spectacularly Entertaining Piece of Fairy Tale Fantasy
","'Stardust' was a splendid watch. I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it turned out to be. To me, it seemed like just another passable fantasy flick but 'Stardust' is a lot more than one might expect. It is a fairy tale about a fallen star and a young boy. Vaughn's direction is solid. The visuals are fascinating, even though sometimes the CGI is obvious. The cinematography is stunning and the soundtrack is beautiful. The writing is commendable and the dialogues are fine.<br/><br/>Comparisions might be made with 'Lord of The Rings'. While I did not like Peter Jackson's movie as much as others did, I throughly enjoyed 'Stardust'. However, 'Stardust' too has its share of flaws. I thought the ending (in spite of some humorous moments) was a little dragged on and gave the film a fluffy touch. The American actors act very well but some of them lose the British accent at times (at one point Michelle Pfeiffer pronounces the 'r') but this is a very very minor case and the reason why I mention it is because it was something I noticed. This minor point does not make me like the film any less but the unnecessarily stretched ending somewhat does.<br/><br/>'Stardust' boasts of a stellar cast that comprises of both British and American talents. The luminous Claire Danes and the naive Charlie Cox have the right chemistry and look convincing on screen. Danes is literally and metaphorically the star of the film. Michelle Pfeiffer springs a surprise performance as the evil villainess. It's great to see her after a long time, that too in a completely different role which she effortlessly pulls off. Robert De Niro too springs a surprise. I won't say much about him because that would be ruining the fun. Let me just say this much that perhaps one will never look at Mr. De Niro the same way. Notice the welcoming cameos that include a magnificent Peter O'Toole, a funnily odd Dexter Fletcher, a hilarious Ricky Gervais and a pitiful Rupert Everett.<br/><br/>There are so many wonderfully shot scenes. I particularly liked the pre-climax scene where Yvaine is approaching towards the wall and the camera switches back and forth to the different characters. The cinematography and music add power to that key scene. Of course there are many other such great scenes but this was one I freshly remembered. The scenes between Tristan and Yvaine are quite nice and fun and thankfully they are not overly sugarcoated (except in the end). The light comedy is quite cleverly put and special thanks to De Niro and his pirates, the 6 (?) ghosts and Gervais for pulling them off.<br/><br/>On the whole, 'Stardust' is a wonderful film. As stated earlier, i would have liked it more had the ending been a little crisp. Nonetheless, it felt like two hours well spent and I recommend it to those who enjoy original fantasies."

This is an amazing film, Neil Gaiman is an amazing author and I would definitely recommend reading the book. I feel embarrassed having to say that the actors are all amazing (just look at who are in this!!!) . It's really impressive that they are all in this film pick one of the known actors and they are iconic. Shooting locations are great as well if you're in the UK have a look where they are and visit them if they are near they really are as pretty as in the film.

Except for one of the Robert DeNiro scenes that doesn't come across smooth and appears out of sync with the tone of the rest of the movie, this luscious romantic fairy tail has a great storytelling feel and the strong magic and the fine balance between serious adventure scenes and the lighter spiritual humor is well done.

"bowmanblue","10","3","3","25 April 2018"," A classic modern fairytale
","There's really little I can find that is negative about 'Stardust.' For what it is, it's possibly as perfect as a film could be. It's a fairytale - pure and simple. It has everything you'd probably expect to see in a 'classic Disney' cartoon - dashing princes, beautiful princesses, evil witches and more magic than you could shake a wand at. There really is nothing new regarding the plot. If you've seen one fairytale then, technically, you've seen this story and nothing will come as much of a surprise when it comes to the plot. However, 'Stardust' isn't your average fairytale.<br/><br/>If you check out the tagline on the marketing, you'll see it says something like, 'The fairytale that won't behave.' I can see where they're coming from. It's a cheeky little number that accomplishes what few films can - it's very watchable for both adults and children. Kids will love the simple 'boy meets girl' story. Characters are very easily identifiable as either 'good' or 'evil.' But the film's really bonus is its much darker undertones. There are simply dozens of visual and scripted gags which will probably go way over children's head and be picked up by adults.<br/><br/> But, it's not just the script that's fun - every cast member is a recognisable face in their own right. Whether it's the narrator - Sir Ian McKellen, or the dodgy seller of lightning in a bottle (and other magical goods), Ricky Gervais. Naturally, the film likes to highlight its two 'trump cards' - none other than Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro. Of course they turn in as excellent performances as you'd expect (I won't go into DeNiro's performance for fear of spoiling it for people who don't know what he gets up to on board his flying lightning-harvesting ship when his crew aren't watching and Pfeiffer smoulders as the evil witch, ruthlessly hunting our young couple). But it's the film's two leads that really have to carry the film. Clare Danes is more recognisable than her heroic counterpart, Charlie Cox, but their chemistry is just perfect.<br/><br/> All in all, you'll be guaranteed a good time with this film whether you're young or old. You'll have to have a heart of stone not to be enchanted by its simple tale of princes and princesses, told to perfection for a modern audience.<br/><br/> And, is it just me, or is the soundtrack one of the most uplifting ever in recent times?"

Of course, it is love at first sight. The peasant must cross the barrier-fence and enter the enchanted land, where things are turned around. It's ruled by anarchy. It's like an Alternative Universe. Witches and magic are quite real. Everything ""works"" differently. He must find a way to bring her into his Universe. If he does it wrong, she will turn back into a star! Fascinating and beautifully done. Some concepts, such as witches sucking up ""lifeforce"" are quite familiar to fantasy fans, so it's not entirely original.

"KineticSeoul","8","3","3","16 February 2016"," This doesn't get the recognition it deserves but Twilight does?
","I saw this movie when it first came out mainly because it was directed by Matthew Vaughn who previously directed ""Layer Cake"" at that time which is another movie I thoroughly enjoyed. And because it was written by Neil Gaiman who did some really good graphic novels. This is a imaginative fantasy movie that combines depths and empathy to it. It has some modern touches to it when it comes to how some people deal with certain situations although it takes place in a fantasy setting. So in another words this is a fantasy movie that people can resonate with, well at least some of it. It fuses symbols and metaphors into the story effectively. While also delving into the genuine heart and the distance people will go to for love. Messages such as in this movie about accepting who you are and doing what you enjoy instead of becoming something your not to please others. It's quite a unique movie that has different varieties of characters. My favorite character being Captain Shakespeare played by Robert De Niro. Robert De Niro really did a great job making this character come to life. I don't know, it's always nice to see cool old guys in fantasy flicks. It's a shame this film didn't do so well when it came to the box office ticket sales. I think it's because it was suppose to be a family movie that tried very hard to cater to the young adults as well. Which might have come off as a bit unbalanced for some viewers. Which is a shame really, because this is actually a really good fantasy romance adventure story.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Stardust (2007): Dir: Matthew Vaughn / Cast: Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro, Mark Strong: Exciting adventure about imagination and magic that seems to explode within every frame of this film. Charlie Cox ventures through a wall into a magical world where the star that fell turns out to be a female played by Claire Danes. A witch seeks the star's heart to retrieve her youth. Matthew Vaughn directs this special effects extravaganza that seems fueled on various ideas and images. Cox does fine as a hero who ventures for one love only to discover his true love throughout many daring encounters. Danes is radiant as the star whose power the witch seeks yet she finds refuge through Cox. Michelle Pfeiffer steals scenes as the witch whose every magic spell increases the age process until a blazing finale where she cuts loose venting on destruction. Robert De Niro is hilarious as Captain Shakespeare whose reputation as a brutal pirate conceals a wild side that opens the door to the film's most humorous scenes. Mark Strong is also superb as Prince Septimus who will become a victim of Voodoo where his body will not be in his control. The film exists purely as entertainment and on that level it works. It may even remind certain viewers of adventures of their youth. Special effects are spectacular with images ranging from unicorns to enchanted flowers. Score: 8 / 10"
"gheremond","9","3","3","19 August 2015"," Magical and hilarious
","This one was quite a pleasant surprise indeed! Having seen the trailer long ago, I went to see this movie with the lowest of expectations. I think that trailer was the one to blame... The flick had nothing to do with it whatsoever. This one has ""cult"" written all over it, it is destined to become a classic! Judging from its mediocre performance at the box office so far - entirely due to bad marketing - I am afraid it is going to take a while for Stardust to gain the appreciation it deserves, but it will surely be remembered ten years from now.<br/><br/>The movie itself is a rare mixture of fantasy, adventure, romance and comedy. And by rare I mean that the combination actually works and in a very major way! It is hilarious without ending up being childish or silly, majestic without being ridiculous and romantic without being sappy. The way it balances all these elements is an amazing accomplishment by itself. This is probably in large due to the origin of the story itself - Stardust is a novel by Neil Gaiman, renowned for the SandMan graphic novels - which proves that a great story is essential to make a great movie. But the material is also exploited in a very competent way by director Matthew Vaughn (of Layer Cake), with style, a fresh view and without resorting to cliché solutions. This isn't the norm when fantasy novels are turned into feature films, where we have a ton of examples with great stories backfiring due to bad directing. There where shots in the film that literally amazed me with their originality, power and immaculate execution. The whole shooting star sequence made my jaw hit the ground! It has been a long time since I 've seen such a beautifully directed sequence - regardless of genre. The combination of visuals and musical score in this one is just magnificent, perhaps one of the best I can think of. And to think that just moments before I was laughing... This is an example of the elegant way in which comedy is interwoven with awe and magic and despair and emotion in this film. I guess it takes a newcomer's fresh perspective on the subject to infuse a project with some vision and originality - this is Vaughn's second feature film."
"alexhenninger2","10","3","3","19 March 2015"," A boy discovers manhood as he embarks on adventure for the love of his life.
","Stardust follows the adventures, and there are many, of Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox) as he sets off to find a fallen star to prove his devotion to the love of his life. He must cross a wall (known as the wall) in his village, which is a border to a magical land called Stormhold, and bring back the fallen star he and his love interest, Victoria (Sienna Miller), witness falling. Much to Tristan's surprise, he discovers the star is a beautiful young womanone who is not as eager to complete the adventure as he is. To gain her compliance, Tristan promises to help put her back in the sky after he presents her to Victoria. I'm sure this will go perfectly as planned, with no complications what so ever. It's not like he and Victoria were the only two to witness the failing star, right? It's not like Tristan is the only one seeking it, right? Wrong. Beware; there are witches to outsmart, flying pirates to fight, zombie swordsmen to defeat and life lessons to be learned. In the end Tristan learns first hand what manhood is all about and what true love iswhat it really is. <br/><br/>The theme is both plot based and character driven. It is clear from the beginning, thanks to the narration, what the heart and soul of this film are about. The narrator states: ""This is the story of how a boy becomes a man"". That statement alone sums up the character development you can expect to witness. The adventure that takes place, forming Tristan's manhood transition, is the plot-based theme that keeps this adventure story moving forward, hitting all the essential stops along the way. <br/><br/>Tristan's story shares the film's runtime with three other interrelated events. The first is the brewing love between Tristan and the fallen star, Yvaine (Claire Danes). Though their relationship faces less then humble beginnings, they grow closer as they share the trials and tribulations of the journey back to the wall. <br/><br/>Tristan and Victoria were not the only two who witnessed the star fall from the sky. A trio of witches and a group of princes also observed the event. The witches need the star for a youth potion (essentially eternal life). The princes need to bring back a magical necklace sent out by their father, the King of Stormhold, which is what originally knocked the star out of the sky in the first place. The King states that the son to return the necklace shall be the next King of Stormhold. How does this tie in? The fallen star, Yvaine, is wearing the necklace. Now that we've tied up that loose end we can continue. <br/><br/>Stardust keeps audiences on edge through the interwoven story telling of these several events as they unfold. As one can imagine, as the climax draws nearer so do these interwoven events, until the final show down and one party is left victorious. Does Tristan make it back to the wall with Yvaine? Do the witches cut out her heart and make their potion? Or do the princes competition steal Yvaine away altogether? What becomes of Victoria? These questions and more await answers, all you need to do is click play."

","This movie made me feel like I could believe in magic again. It was like my mother was reading me a fairytale and it was coming alive before my eyes. It had royalty, witches, pirates and magic. Lots and lots of magic. It was done so beautifully, so perfectly. And no matter how much screen time each actor had, their input was essential to move the story along.Peter O'Toole, Henry Cavill, David Kelly, and Ricky Gervais are very good examples of this. The movie was very well paced, the story was fantastically told. And you had sword fights, pirates coming to the rescue, and a witch that you could not help but giggle along with every time she did something wicked."

"matt19007","10","3","3","5 May 2008"," The best film of 2007 by a mile!
","Having looked forward to this film for months, when it was eventually released in the UK I was disappointed to read a review labelling it as mediocre, boring, poorly scripted and a big let down. Having been so excited about the film, I went to see it against the reviewers advice. I remember thinking as I walked out at the end that this was quite possibly the most enjoyable film I had seen in a theatre since Casino Royale in 2006. The story, a fairytale at the core was incredibly uplifting and in comparison to my usual taste in movies, this was a major high point. Normally I go for action films or thrillers, although I'll give anything a go once and this is the first family oriented movie that I have seen in the cinema for a long time. I liked how Tristan was played by Charlie Cox, an actor who is relatively unknown and he did an outstanding job. Claire Danes was on top form as Yvaine and Michelle Pfeiffer proves that she still has it too, whilst De Niro destroys his tough man reputation in a hilarious role that he plays to perfection. If you don't enjoy Stardust, you cannot possibly have a heart, Schwarzenegger and Stallone are amongst my movie heroes and in a year filled with disappointing sequels and over hyped blockbusters, I found Stardust shone like a beacon. Exceptional. *****"
"alindsay-al","9","5","6","12 August 2014"," A fantastic fantasy film that is a real surprise
","This film is definitely one of the most underrated films of all time as this is a fantastic film and this is truly one of the greatest fantasy films I can think of. With the big name actors and actresses in this film it is a surprise to see Charlie Cox in the lead as Tristan and I must say he does a great job. He starts as an annoying brat but as you would expect he grows and his character becomes a heroic one who even becomes likable towards the end of the film as he makes the correct decision. The supporting characters are also fantastic throughout. Claire Danes as the star was a great choice and she is similar to Tristan as she starts off annoying but grows on you as the film progresses. The chemistry is good between the two and the relationship is good and believable. Mark Strong in Hollywood could be seen as one of the best bad guys around and he lives up to this as Prince Septimus. He is so evil and truly great in this villainous role, just like Michelle Pfeifer who thrives as the witch villain and she also thrives in this role and looks like she enjoys it. The biggest surprise was Robert De Niro's character as he really is different to what I expected but he is great and he is truly a class actor. The story from the outside could have been seen as over the top and cookie cutter but it does its job really well with the number of people on the chase for the star being right and the relationship/hero story is done very well. The script is decent with a good blend between drama and humour but sometimes some of the dialogue feels a little off on occasion. The style is so cool though with the mix of fantasy such as witches and pirates really creates a great blend and a new backdrop for a superb film."
"readstorm30","9","5","6","11 April 2014"," Book vs. Movie
","I waited until I had read the book to see the movie because (in my experience) the books are always better. While the book was good (no spoilers, promise) it put a practical love in a supernatural world. The movie....ooohhh the movie (just finished watching it) it matched the love to the world. The movie took every aspect of the book (and a few new ones) and made them truly SHINE!<br/><br/>The plot had a complete make over, a very good one. There are some new points added that may be questionable to some but I loved them. The main character...lets just say he got a whole lot hotter as the movie goes on. The special effects though, not fully done to the extent described in the book, are beautiful."

But since it was summer and I had nothing to do I sat down and watched it with her. And I have to say I was so happy I did, it is truly one of the best movies I've ever seen. It had everything from romance to adventures to comedy. The actors and actresses were phenomenal, I have to say that Claire Danes did a great job and was the star of the movie.

"fantasyescapist","Null","8","11","13 March 2010"," Charming fantasy chase film but has an in-joke feel that feels incongruous therefore taints the appeal of the overall film
","I was lucky to see this at the cinema and I watched it again on telly as it was shown on Channel 4 this evening.<br/><br/>Acting: Cox is likeably endearing as the naive protagonist Tristan, who goes through a transformation from boy to man. Danes is a good match as the understandably annoyed fallen star Yvaine as she has genuine chemistry with Tristan.<br/><br/>Kelly is amusing as the guard of the wall to Stormhold. Magowan is alluring as Una. Pfeiffer is obviously relishing her theatrical type role as the witch Lamia, De Niro is OTT camp and unconvincing and and Miller's alright as Tristan's crush Victoria, if the role is underwritten. Gervais' annoying and unfunny shtick is anachronistic in a late eighteenth century world. Thankfully it's brief.<br/><br/>Plot and Pacing: They've clearly gone for the in-joke feel of The Princess Bride here, which is a bizarre decision, seeing as this is a straightforward fairy tale whereas The Princess Bride is clearly a spoof.<br/><br/>Not only is the tongue-in-cheek tone incongruous but it never truly feels like a true fantasy world for what I think is due to numerous references and locations.<br/><br/>The plot is the standard chase film. The pacing is slightly off in the sense that we don't get a real sense of the passing of time, as Tristan has a limited period to bring the fallen star to his beloved Victoria.<br/><br/>However, the film doesn't feel overlong as a whole. There are also a handful of laughs here and there.<br/><br/>Cinematography and SFX: There's a lot of camera whooshing used to show different places in Wall and Stormhold and the CGI (mainly green screen) can look very obvious here. But, for the most part the SFX are fine, if nothing special. The general palette of the film is colourful and fitting.<br/><br/>There's a lack of iconic location shots, though and some very LoTR looking scenes too.<br/><br/>Score: The generic heroic soundtrack is used and it's sounds vaguely familiar(if you've seen fantasy films of the last decade, you know what cues and leitmotifs I mean). It's nothing new for this genre from composer Ilan Eshkeri.<br/><br/>The standout easily is Take That's song Rule The World that plays in the end credits, capturing the warm romantic theme with aplomb.<br/><br/>Overall: An entertaining romantic fantasy adventure that has charm and some good performances to help overlook it's lack of identity and inherent flaws. A good, if not great effort, mainly down to aforementioned unnecessary in-joke tone."
"dark_stalions","9","8","11","27 October 2007"," A simple fairytale-style fantasy film done exceptionally well.
","Somehow a fair few of films that I really enjoy have had some part of their advertising which made me expect the worst of them. The original Shrek was one of these, with the images of goofy characters grinning stupidly at me from each and every poster there was no way on earth that I was going to see such a film. However when my sister brought it home on video and played it over and over again I was gradually sucked into it, drawn by it's satirical humour and great characters.<br/><br/>This is another film that I did not find particularly appealing from the advertising. The pictures I had seen made it look similar to the poorly done ""Eragon"" and the trailers hinted at a dull, hackneyed story-line, so I approached this film with low expectations.<br/><br/>It turns out that the story of the film (which I won't delve into) *is* relatively simple and uses plenty of well established fantasy ideas, but this doesn't detract from it in the least. It feels complete with no irritatingly blatant attempts to leave room for a sequel. I know that this is adapted from a book, but have not read it, so can not comment on how closely it sticks to the original. However it comes across as a fairy-tale of the type you are read when you are young, done in the epic style (see LotR and what Eragon was trying to be) which is generally associated with the fantasy genre. In no way is this forced, and the clean simplicity and predictability of the storyline mean that the wit of the production is lost on few without seeming pointlessly trivial. The setting is beautifully rendered with interesting characters who develop nicely (if predictably) and works well as a continuation of the genre which LotR proved to be financially feasible.<br/><br/>The music is a mixture of LotR and PotC 3 in style, with hints of Harry Potter. Occasionally it is over the top, though, when the dramatic context did not require it to such an extent. That is one of my few problems with this film. Despite this the majority of the music is compelling, engaging and fitting to the style of the rest of the production. It also utilises some well-known classical music, applied to humerus effect. (I bought the sound track, it's that good.) <br/><br/>One other problem I had was with the casting of Ricky Gervais. This is purely a personal problem which not everyone will agree with as I do not find his style of comedy particularly amusing, rather the opposite in fact. However this was mitigated by the small amount of screen time and what happens to the character. Otherwise the casting was sound, each played their part to near perfection. I absolutely loved the witches, often finding myself cackling along with them. Michelle Pfeiffer was perfect as the leading witch (she had a title, but I forget it).<br/><br/>Overall a wonderfully rendered fairy-tale style film with few flaws with an epic score that will draw you into it's world and leave you with a sense of deep satisfaction and warmth.<br/><br/>Hooray for decently made fantasy films!"
"Quebec_Dragon","7","9","13","24 May 2009"," Worthy unconventional fairy tale that should have been closer to the book
","Let's start by saying I loved the book by Neil Gaiman and recommended it often. Stardust was a very good fantasy movie in the vein of the Princess Bride with its whimsical tone and romantic aspects. Deniro was great fun in his pirate role that wasn't even in the book! As a matter of fact, all the actors were excellent. I wish that they had more fantastical creatures (like the book) and especially that they had not changed the ending of the book, it would have made it much more memorable. A few tweaks here and there, closer adherence to the original source material and it would have been a great classic for the ages. Tim Burton would have been perfect to direct this as I'm sure the original book would have appealed very much to his sensibilities. However, it was a worthy effort nevertheless. It's definitely worth a rental and a purchase if you like fantasy movies with romantic overtones.<br/><br/>Rating: 7 out of 10"

In the fantasy kingdom, he meets the star Yvaine (Claire Danes) and imprisons her with a magic rope, promising to release her after meeting Victoria. Yvaine was hit by the magic ruby of the evil King (Peter O'Toole) of Stormhold that has promised his throne to the son that could find the stone.

"rhardter","10","10","15","29 August 2007"," A Stardust Melody
","My stardust melody, The memory of love's refrain.<br/><br/>Stardust, Lyrics by Mitchell Parish, Music by Hoagy Carmichael<br/><br/>No, this is not about Stardust, the song, but Stardust, the movie. I have implicitly criticized movies based on comic strips, then modified that somewhat saying that we would be seeing Stardust after all, when I realized that a ""graphic novel"" could be much more than a simple comic strip. This film is far better than that, and far better than I had imagined.<br/><br/>Imagination is the key word. The film is the best new one I've seen in a theater in months, and definitely the most imaginative one I've seen in years. Yes, large parts of it are derivative, but being derived from something else is not important. It is what the film maker does with those that determines the worth of the film. That the director/writer Matthew Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman have accomplished gloriously.<br/><br/>What is the film? It is funny, romantic and adventurous. It has a classic quest plot line, with as unlikely a collection of characters not merely than one could imagine (that word again), but would scarcely ever dream of imagining. The hero (Charlie Cox  totally unknown to me) morphs from a teen-age jerk into a romance novel hero (your typical handsome prince, in my wife's phrase). Most attention has been given to Robert De Niro's way-over-the-top performance, and well it should be. It was the only aspect of the film about which I harbored a reservation prior to seeing it, a reservation which turned out to be totally unjustified. De Niro, in a relatively brief appearance, is incredible! And his famous scene (think of John Hurt as Caligula in I Claudius) is absolutely integral to the plot (which I am not about to give away).<br/><br/>But it is Michelle Pfeiffer as an ugly old witch (now there's casting against type for you!) who really chews up the scenery, especially at the end. The movie has villains galore, and did I mention humor? It has plenty of one-liners for the adults. My own favorite was the punch line that followed ""A two-headed dog? I could get that for you."" I'm not giving that one away either.<br/><br/>Beyond any possible argument, the star of the film is the relatively little known Claire Danes. She plays a strong woman who is also vulnerable, totally human while simultaneously being much more than human. As made up for the movie, she is not conventionally pretty, but she has a magnetic inner beauty and gives a luminescent, shining performance that makes her the most unforgettable person in the film.<br/><br/>Who is the film aimed at? Well, not young children  too much violence (even if cartoonish) and probably a bit too much very-off-screen implied sex. And it is not aimed at anyone for whom the magic of movies no longer holds any attraction, or sadly never did.<br/><br/>Stardust has not yet received either the acclaim or the audience it so richly merits. But it is, both figuratively and literally a gem. As I was watching it, I was mentally rating it at a very strong 9. But by the end, it was a clear 10. I recommend it most highly."

This movie didn't have much of a marketing and because of that I didn't expect anything from it. But, after watching it I was filled with joy, laugh and will to experience and live as much as I can!<br/><br/>This movie is suited for everyone from age 7 to 99. In my opinion everyone can find themselves (or at least part of them) in this wonderful movie.<br/><br/>Stardust is a mixture of fantasy, tale of friendship, true and pure love, adventure, relationships, all spiced with a pinch of intelligent humor. There is a message and lesson in this movie, about not being deceived with exterior and appearance, but to follow the heart. About basic human feelings and how to direct them.<br/><br/>Acting performance was also great. Cast is amazing and I have to say that Robert De Niro obviously had bunch of fun filming it, and he had a great role. Claire Danes is stunning and beautiful as Yvaine, she really had a amazing performance! Movie doesn't get boring in any moment, it keeps you nailed to the chair whole the time with it's subtle and wise plot.

","Silly me I never watched Stardust when it came out in 2007. I read some bad reviews and I was fooled. I would have never guessed this movie was so incredible, that it is now in my top 5.<br/><br/>The storyline is fantastic. I used to read stories all of my childhood, but I swear that in quite some parts the storyline of Stardust overlooked my guesses.<br/><br/>The characters are also fantastic: starting with very small parts - like Bernard's, to the main characters - Tristan and Yvaine. Every character has a great deal of importance in the story, and every actor did his or her best job becoming a part of this story.<br/><br/>It is so beautiful that great actors, older or younger, like Peter O'Toole and Rupert Everett, make the best of their small appearances in the movie. I loved all the subplots, especially the one with the ghosts of the king's sons, which were hilarious.<br/><br/>But what I love most about this movie is the way it made my heart beat for two hours. I can still remember how fast my heart went beating when Yvaine confessed her love to Tristan. And then how amused I was when I saw his little mouse eyes. And how melted my heart was when I realized that this story is about an impossible love, made possible by extraordinary characters and extraordinary adventures.<br/><br/>The lovers came not only from different worlds, but from completely antagonic worlds, that could only exist one opposite to the other.<br/><br/>Love, adventure, imagination, fantasy, humor, great image and soundtrack, great story, even great actors - this movie is a must see!"

There were some bits I did not remember, so how accurate this is to the book I can not say.<br/><br/>As a movie is was glorious. The vibrancy of the scenes, the acting by various people. There was nothing to fault. The spry old guy that guards the hole in the wall.<br/><br/>Robert De Nero is going to take a long time to live down the pirate scene, each time I see him now that is how I am going to remember him.<br/><br/>I think this is a real triumph for the fantasy world. With so many books being turned into drivel on the screen it is wonderful to see one that still has its sparkle and allows you to spend 90 odd minutes in a world of imagination.<br/><br/>The dead sons (who could only really get along when dead) I found very amusing. Michele checking out her pert new bottom was a hoot.<br/><br/>The actors were well picked and did a fantastic performance.<br/><br/>But still Robert De Nero in drag is going to take a long time to get over.

The movie plays like a fairy-tale for adults, but at the same time, it subverts the genre, thanks to some brilliant writing, and some fantastic ideas and characters, brought to life by a stunning cast.<br/><br/>Claire Danes as the star in human form is great, Michelle Pfeiffer (who hasn't been in movies recently), has great fun as one of the witches, Charlie Cox makes an appealing hero, Rupert Everett makes a small but memorable appearance as one of the kings sons hoping to be crowned king, but Robert De Niro steals the film with his turn as Captain Shakespeare a sky captain who catches lighting, while hiding a secret from his crew. <br/><br/>The production design is impressive, the effects brilliant, and the humour in the movie is pitched just right. While the actual plot is fairly predictable in places, and you can almost guess the end after the first 10 minutes, I simply didn't care.<br/><br/>As I sat watching it, there was a big smile on my face all the way through.

It has the perfect balance of fantasy adventure, humanist story and (very British) adult comedy.<br/><br/>There are so many outstanding performances here but hats off to Deniro and Danes they are an absolute delight.<br/><br/>Aside from the excellent effects and the stunning sets the real magic is the relationships between the characters - how they are written and played, it really captures your heart and stays in your mind afterwards.<br/><br/>I left the cinema feeling like a five year old wishing I could find the chink in the wall.

","I personally think it was a huge lack of advertisement. I never heard of this movie until just a few weeks ago at the latest Harry Potter show. I personally think that this movie will do a lot better by word of mouth and additional advertising. I thought the movie was great as did all my daughters and their friends. So what is your opinion on the poor turn out? Another thing I noticed was that it was only shown on one screen in an 18 screen theater. The second day it was out it only had like 5 showings. Also it had to compete with Rush Hour 3. That could have been a big factor. Anyways, despite it's poor first week, I personally think it is worth going to watch on the Big Screen. It has everything. It is a love story, combined with some pretty darned good special effects, mixed with Fantasy and humor. Not to mention it has a very different and entertaining story line."
"runner-15","10","6","8","11 August 2007"," A perfect movie
","I was absolutely blown away by this movie. Usually with any movie no matter how much I like it I can find some sort of fault. Sometimes it is minor sometimes major, usually it involves one of the lead characters doing something totally against logic sometimes it involves a unclosed subplot at the end. But this movie is perfect I can find nothing wrong with this movie. The director created one of the most incredible fantasy worlds ever shown on the big screen. And De Niro What can I say he was so wrong and so right at the same time. I would have never thought it was possible but he was so wrong for his part in this movie that he became the only right choice, absolutely beautiful."

","The best adult fantasy ever(Sorry all of you Lord of the Rings fans). If you have a since of adventure and a since of humor you will love this movie. After a summer of uninspired blockbusters filled with mindless explosions, car chases, people flying above the cities, this movie offers great acting and a great story line. The romance, adventure, humor, and fantasy will keep you entertained through the entire film. This movie delivers it all in perfect proportion. It is not over the top or cheesy. I would also like to commend Matthew Vaughn for directing the best movie of the summer and we will be looking forward to his next project. If you are a collector of movies, this is one for your top shelf."

This movie doesn't ooze charm - it tickles the cockles of your heart with it, though. Claire Danes and Charlie Cox as the protagonists Yvaine and Tristan are entirely appropriately cast, and by the end of the movie you will fall pretty much in love. The rest of the cast perform admirably, with especial kudos to Robert Di Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer.<br/><br/>Just don't expect the book. Vaughn has made some pretty drastic changes stylistically. Just think of it as an adaptation, with its own unique charm, and you'll enjoy it just as much, if not more so, as I did."

","Before watching this movie, I felt that it was not nice, the feeling of it that made me not want to watch. But I am glad that I did watch it and it is pretty cool. I thought it will talk a lot and it did prove me wrong. It cut pretty short on talking compared to other fantasy movies (where they talk a lot in the introduction) and goes straight to the intense action. It is safe to say that this can be one of the best fantasy movies or the best. Compared to The dark is rising, Stardust did a lot time better than it. Finally, a fantasy movie that don't disappoint. The recent fantasy flicks like Eragon and The dark is rising just fall flat to the ground. Surprisingly, Stardust got the right pace and end nicely.<br/><br/>Stardust is good for all age not like Lord of the ring which has some violent scenes. Stardust has the humour to cheer people up but it does have its intense scenes too. It is a good fantasy movie unlike the recent ones. It won't disappoint you in terms of fantasy and plot. It is slightly weird and funny, it does have the intense action mixed with good intense music and has fantasy violence and things like the flying boat. What is more you want from a fantasy movie. The plot is surprisingly interesting too. It can keep you going. The recent fantasy movies do not have all these points. Stardust has a lot of reasons for you to watch.<br/><br/>Overall, it did pretty good in the term of fantasy. It is a great movie to watch in the weekends or anytime. It does have the suspense to keep you watching."

","Matthew Vaughn's film adaptation of the Neil Gaiman's novella ""Stardust"" is a pleasant surprise in that I didn't know what to expect of it beforehand. For one, ""Mirrormask,"" the other Gaiman material adapted to the big screen wasn't much of an experience worthy of its source. Also, the trailer didn't look at all exciting. But somehow, the lowered expectations helped in a genuinely satisfying experience.<br/><br/>""Stardust"" is set more than a century ago and tells the story of Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young man from Wall, England, who sets out to the other side of a wall, to a magical kingdom, in search of the star that fell from the sky so that he can get the hand of Victoria (Sienna Miller) in marriage. It turns out that the star is not in the form of a piece of rock but of a young woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes). And he's not alone as Lamia (michelle Pfeiffer), one of the three witch sisters, is also in pursuit of the star whose heart is said to be the key to immortality. Add in the fact that Yvaine has found a diamond necklace at the site where she fell, which is the object of desire of two king-wannabes, who now has to find Yvaine to retrieve the necklace.<br/><br/>What ensues is an old-fashioned fantasy film that plays more as a fairy tale for grown-ups, which while never reaches the heights of last year's ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" succeeds in presenting a dazzling imagination and wry humor that keep you engaged during its running time. The battalion of intersecting plot lines make for an overall uneven experience but co-writer/director Vaughn and co-writer Jane Goldman keep the proceedings lively with the script's banteringly amusing nature.<br/><br/>Leads Cox and Danes generate genuine chemistry so much so that it's easy to categorize their pairing for a romantic comedy that all the more that calls to mind ""The Princess Bride."" The supporting cast that include Robert De Niro and Pfeiffer easily ham it up without going overboard.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Stardust"" is a magical experience. It may not be a definitive adaptation but it's definitely worth the two hours."

","The reason I say indirect because this movie actually has a purpose besides just being funny. As well the humor is never just over the top but simple and in the correct places.<br/><br/>The combination of the entire story makes this a movie for pretty much anyone not just a certain group of movie goers. With just enough special effects actions while not over doing it, each part of the experience actually compliments itself. From what I could remember there wasn't anything but good acting within the movie. Not that you couldn't expect much less from Robert Deniro or Michelle Phieffer. But the rest of the cast and even the small parts were written and accomplished well.<br/><br/>This could be probably the best attempt I have seen to repeat the greatness of one of the most underrated movies of all time.

"wayne-83","Null","12","20","1 August 2007"," Take That!
","Loved the movie--it was wonderful! Such a joy to go to a sneak preview with no expectations and find such an enjoyable film. I thought Charlie Cox did a great job as Tristran, going from ordinary ""lad"" to King--it was a joy to see. Michelle Pfeiffer gave another great performance as the villain--I've loved her performances for a long time (e.g., Married to the Mob, Jonathan Demme, director). Claire Danes was good as well, though Charlie Cox is the one that has the great story arc, and it was his performance that makes the movie work (I want to go back and Netflix his earlier movies, such as Casanova). As a sidenote, I picked up the book by Neil Gaiman and have now read it--excellent book! The movie follows the book quite closely, cutting some minors characters out--but getting the key incidents of the book just right. The Robert DeNiro role isn't really in the book, but it was a great, fun addition, so can't complain. DeNiro's retrofit of Charlie Cox's wardrobe was great! I hope this movie does really well (dare I say it, if Disney was involved, they could make this movie huge). Its a great story, well told, and it respects the audience: the movie realizes that the audience can put two and two together very quickly. The movie gives some hints of some of the connections between the characters, but not in a heavy-handed way (and, unlike Pirates 3, it does tell a coherent story). Also, the classical music provided excellent support for the story, and the Take That song at the end was pleasant (I can't judge a song by just one listen so I'll leave it at that). Finally, there will always be some carping about movies based on books, but fans of Stardust (the book) should, I think, be thrilled with this movie."
"gonzalezrstudio","10","4","5","8 May 2015"," Pleasantly Surprised
","I honestly decided to watch this movie because 1. It was on Netflix, 2. I love sci/fi fantasy, but more on the forefront of my mind was 3. I just finished watching the entire Daredevil 1st season and wanted to see Charlie Cox in another role. <br/><br/>I admit, the beginning got me irritable because of the way Cox swooned over a spoiled brat, but I loved watching him grow as a person and learn his self worth. Some might say ""where did the witches come from?? Nothing was explained!"" But hey guess what.. it's FANTASY!! It brought me into a new exciting world that I never would have thought about on my own. Others might complain because it wasn't exactly like the book (which i can understand), but films are never going to be exactly what the book is. <br/><br/>Perfect balance of comedy (i found the 7 princes hilarious), romance (i mean Cox just steals my heart), and action. I also didn't expect the mother to be a princess, that was a pleasant twist for me. <br/><br/>If you're expecting a logical film, don't waste your time. This film is for those who want to put logic on pause and get away for a while. For two hours I entered into a magical land with two headed elephants, mystical enchantments... traveling by candle..."

Charlie Cox did a great job as the lead character and I am surprised that I have never seen him in anything else its as if he has disappeared which is odd because he does a great job.<br/><br/>I think I have fallen in love with Claire Danes she looked so beautiful and her acting was perfect especially in the scene with the mouse.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer was a great Villain she really stole the show her performance was flawless.<br/><br/>Mark Strong gave a good performance as Septimus because the film needed another Villain as well as the Witch, his Character was interesting and Mark Strong always does good as a bad guy.<br/><br/>My one small problem with the film was the fact they underused some great Characters Robert De Niro was not in the film enough he didn't appear until nearly one hour in and his characters was only in the film for twenty minutes. He was the funniest characters in the film and should have had more screen time it seemed a waste of De Niro's talents.<br/><br/>Look out for some great cameos by Ricky Gervais who steals every scene he appears in, and Peter O Toole puts in a good performance as the King of Stromhold.<br/><br/>I Loved the film though and was really shocked to find that it did poor at the Box Office. A part of me wants a Sequel because it would be interesting to see the Characters again but I have a feeling that a Sequel could be poor because the Story would have to be Original not like this one which was based off a book.<br/><br/>Overall Stardust is a great film for all the Family which mixes Action Adventure Comedy Drama Fantasy Romance and Horror.<br/><br/>Rating 9/10"
"Cedric_Catsuits","10","4","5","15 July 2011"," Fantastic
","I'm not usually a fan of the fantasy genre but this is one Fairy Tale that pleasantly surprised me and had me hooked from the beginning. A wonderful cast reads like a Who's Who of contemporary British acting talent (with the exception of non-actor Gervais) so it was curious to see Claire Danes in the ""star"" role - she is neither English nor classically beautiful in the Fairy Tale sense.<br/><br/>I must, however, give her 10/10 for her impeccable English accent - few things irritate me more than when American and British actors are cast as the other nationality, and I can think of no other actor from either side of the pond who has mastered the foreign accent better than Danes. Still, neither country is so short of talent that such a reversal is necessary.<br/><br/>It also annoys me when beautiful women are cast as old hags - Sarah Alexander is one of the most beautiful women on the planet! Her performance here still merits a special mention - it may be a small role but she makes the most of it. Indeed, so many of the supporting players give exceptional performances, that alone makes the movie worth watching.<br/><br/>A lovely story, wonderful scenery and the odd if obligatory special effect combine with solid acting and directing to make this a must-see for all the family."
"neil-476","8","4","5","24 October 2007"," Tolerable translation
","Adapting a much-loved book for the screen is always a risky affair. On the rare occasion when it is done with a slavish regard for accuracy (Harry Potter 1, for example) the result can end up a little on the sterile side. On the other hand, a cavalier approach (Starship Troopers, Kubrick's The Shining) leads to part of the audience wondering how the point of the book could be missed. Even when an adaptation is regarded as successful, there can still be valid reservations (Gimli as light relief in Lord of the Rings, for example).<br/><br/>I realise two things - one, it is often the case that changes have to be made because what works on the page doesn't work on screen and, two, the primary motivation of those who put up the not-inconsiderable funding to produce a mainstream feature film is to make profits. That means bums on seats. And that may mean you don't always cater to the sentiments of those who hold the source property particularly dear.<br/><br/>I'm a big Neil Gaiman fan. The Charles Vess-illustrated version of Stardust sits proudly on my shelves and I thoroughly enjoyed reading it. It tells a fairy story in fairly traditional terms, but tells it with adult sensibilities. I'll confess that I haven't read it for a number of years, and I never did memorise it (although I do recollect that it had the single most effective use of profanity on the printed page which I have ever seen), so it follows that much of the detail is vague in my memory. I was therefore able to approach the film without excessive preconceptions.<br/><br/>I saw it in a fairly full cinema with a friend and his young son. I don't recall ever being among an audience which contained so many women in their 30s before, which surprised me.<br/><br/>This film satisfied that audience. It satisfied my friend and his son, and it satisfied me. I was surprised at the amount of humour - Gaiman recounts the story in the book in fairly straight-faced manner - and the humour all worked, and worked well: it didn't prevent the story being taken seriously, but it did lighten the tone. This was necessary, I think, because there is a need to maximise audiences, and this fairy story (the tale, as opposed to the telling) pitches as well towards children as it does towards adults. So why exclude a big chunk of audience from the cinema and DVD sales demographic? No, it's not a faithful adaptation. But, with the exception of the inclusion of humour - not necessarily a bad thing - it captured the flavour of the book, and was entertaining in its own right."

","I had not read the book and had heard mixed reviews of the film. Firstly I have to say that it isn't perfect and the ending was not great but generally the film was a lot of fun and I had a a smile on my face all the way through. The acting was fine with enjoyable performances from the princes and especially Robert De Niro and his men who were the funniest characters in the film (I wish the crew had more air time). Matthew Vaughn directs well but the cinematography is not nearly as interesting as in Layer Cake and occasionally the extreme wide shots overwhelm the film. The soundtrack is enjoyable and suits the tale though is quite forgettable. Overall a fun film though not quite in the league of the The Princess Bride"

I'm a bit hopeless at describing the movie today, but what I'm trying to say is, that this film is worth seeing. And worth seeing more than once.<br/><br/>I saw it the day after it came out here in Denmark, and I think I will go see it again, sometime soon. Tickets to a movie cost a fortune here, but I liked it so much that my pockets have to empty a little, but for a good cause. Well, a good laugh, a good experience. I enjoyed it so very much. Actually, after I came home, I went straight to the library to borrow the book, it is based on. Perhaps I can relive the experience of this great story. I sure hope so.

Of course, it lost the gore of the book but it's still a fantastic tale as well.<br/><br/>It was well-written and well-cast except for Danes, who should've traded places w/ Sienna Miller instead.

"haliverpool","9","4","5","18 September 2007"," Quirky Romantic Fantasy
","""Stardust"" is the most enjoyable movie I've seen in years. I like the fact that it's hard to categorize. I'd call it a romantic-comedy-fantasy-adventure. There is exciting action. There is a fairly standard romance. There aren't any belly laughs, but plenty of good chuckles.<br/><br/>I noticed several years ago while watching ""The World According To Garp"" with my family, that it makes a great difference who you watch a movie with. The first time I saw that movie was with a theater full of possibly inebriated college students. It was great fun. With my family, parents, sister etc., it was almost bad because they weren't into it at all. I saw ""Stardust"" with my wife. I think the hand holding and snuggling during the movie added a lot to the enjoyment. If you can, see it with someone you love. I think you can enjoy it alone or with friends, but it's better with a significant other.<br/><br/>There are a lot a familiar faces on this movie. I found that somewhat distracting. Captain Shakespeare was the only character I found to seem somewhat unreal. I think I detected De Niro ""acting"".<br/><br/>The visual effects seemed natural. Sure it's a fantasy, but the filmmakers didn't make the mistake of overpowering the story with flashy effects. The characters are believable. While most of them live in a fantastical, magical world, they still behave as real people would in those circumstances. Except for De Niro I didn't notice any ""acting"".<br/><br/>Bring a date - Enjoy!"

","I'm particular about movies depending on the very mood that I exhibit at any given time, but this film caught me completely off guard in its capability for both originality and level of surprise.<br/><br/>After The Lord of the Rings, I thought that perhaps all we had to look forward to in the fantasy genre was for the Harry Potter series to finish its run. I'd seen several attempts of new efforts here and there that simply failed to captivate me.<br/><br/>What held me from the very start was the well-spoken narration by Ian McKellen. From there on it just became more and more charming to behold with each set and character introduction. The whimsy was light and delightful.<br/><br/>There were the archetypes of old, but they were merely touched upon, not hammered upon in great detail. The story was very complicated, yet simple in concept. I thought that the beauty of the story telling was that everyone knew what actually should happen to the main character which was a direct contradiction to his main goal.<br/><br/>I thought it was remarkable that the story held no restraint in eliminating characters. It was quite brutal yet understandable.<br/><br/>The film, to me, was all about true beauty of soul. So many characters were absolutely remarkable for their own inner radiance. The quality of them helped to turn the tale in surprising new directions that really kept the pace exciting.<br/><br/>The ending surprised me above all things most. I'm prone to finding tears of sorrow in movies, but rarely to tears of happiness burst free. In the last moment of the movie, I wept. I praise Stardust for keeping fantasy alive and wonderful. This film is a blissful escape, and a very charming one."
"divadrummer-1","8","4","5","7 September 2007"," Whimsical as intended. Read the book after!
","I adore the book, I love Neil Gaiman, and I like fantasy movies. This should be an obvious win, but it's a mixed review. Stardust is sweet, but deviates from the book in important and annoying ways.<br/><br/>Stardust is a classic fairy tale. Tristan Thorne ventures off into the fairy kingdom of Stormhold to retrieve a fallen star for a young lady he wishes to marry. But of course, the world of fairies differs greatly from our own. The star is not a lump of rock, but a surly girl, and her entrance into Stormhold has not gone unnoticed. Powerful princes and witches race to seek the Star's power, and Tristan is thrown unknowingly into the pitch for power.<br/><br/>If you have not read the book, I highly recommend it, particularly if you can get your hands on a copy with the original illustrations of Charles Vess.<br/><br/>The movie stands on its own without comparisons to other current popular fantasy movies. Beyond the eye candy, the story is solid and the characters are quirky and interesting. The three competitors for The Star cross paths in entertaining and coincidental ways, and the movie - like the book - is wrought with comedy.<br/><br/>While the movie is mostly faithful to the book, the biggest downfall is in the minor characters. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro both had their parts artificially inflated for the movie. Robert DeNiro's pirate captain Shakespeare, in particular, was a role that took place in about 3 pages of the book. It's true that a long passage of time occurred in those few pages, and it was nice to see them fleshed out in the movie. But the character of Shakespeare was reduced to Jar-Jar Binks status - mostly unnecessary and over-ridiculously funny. Pfeiffer as the Witch Queen Lamia had a role much more in keeping with the book, and stole the show with her deliciously evil performance. But the added combat scenes at the end were over the top, and eventually made no sense at all. A huge ""huhwhut?"" washed over everyone in the theatre - book fans and newcomers alike - when Lamia's part ended. Even Septimus had his character altered from unyielding villain to sympathetic opportunist.<br/><br/>The best part of this movie is the romance. While foppish Tristan could have been a slightly more remarkable man, Claire Daines was perfect as the surly Star, and paired together, they were too cute to deny. The image of Yvaine shining every time she's happy is practically meant for movies, and will strike a heartstring-chord for anyone who's ever been in love. There are even a few places where the story is altered to add some subtle lines that build the romance, and they're very effective.<br/><br/>Because the story is so packed with adventure, and a few things were inflated to fit the big acting names, the movie is a little long. But I do recommend it for any lovers of romance, fantasy, or the original book."
"L. Lion","9","4","5","6 September 2007"," A Magical Film, A Mystical Box Office Disappointment
","I went to see Stardust about a month after it opened and failed, rather spectacularly, at the box office. I support fantasy films and thought I would go even though my ability to help the film's box office fate had evaporated after the disastrous first weekend.<br/><br/>My first reaction to watching this film is what a joyous experience it was. This was truly imaginative, vibrant fantasy full of wonderful, whimsical performances and smart details. It has some of the best production design I have seen in some time - the settings are sumptuous and beautiful, every set has its own special character and helps establish Stronghold is a fairy land that I would love to visit.<br/><br/>If there was any place where I felt the film dragged it would had to have been the appearance of pirate captain Shakespeare and his lightning-fishing crew. Although there was nothing wrong with these scenes, they detracted from the work of some wonderful villains (Michelle Pfeiffer as Lamia the witch, and Mark Strong as Septimus, the last surviving prince of a fratricidal family). Any good quest movie needs smart, tough, evil villains, and this film has more than one. Even better, they are at the same time despicable and fun to watch. Captain Shakespeare's appearance put off their particular quests at a time when the movie needed more speed, not less.<br/><br/>I was also a bit mystified by the casting of Claire Danes as Yvaine, the fallen star who is sought by all of the leads. Ms. Danes is a fine actress, but she is plain looking. If you are going to be playing the embodiment of a pure fallen star, you had better be luminously beautiful. Does it help that the male lead, Charlie Cox, is prettier than she is? Would getting Rose Byrne have been such a problem? The final battle scene, at the house of the witches, also drags a bit. The film does not have a rousing finale.<br/><br/>However, in spite of these imperfections, and if anything I am a person who counts imperfections, Stardust was one of the best films I have seen this year, a glorious fantasy adventure. The greatest mystery behind this film is why audiences chose to ignore it, yet flocked to genuine turkeys like Wild Hogs. I expect this film to be discovered on cable in a year or two, and be in heavy rotation on basic cable channels for a decade to come."

Vindictive witches, a magical star that moonlights as a beautiful woman, seven brothers--all possible heirs to a vacated throne--picking each other off, a Medieval Las Vegas, a gate guardian who does kung-fu, flying pirate ships, wild swashbuckling sword play; this movie has it all.<br/><br/>A great fairytale style adventure for adults, although a little too violent in places for kids. Fantasy stories are often difficult to write, as the author has to create an entire world, but the land this story takes you to is given more than adequate foundation, and the back stories of the numerous characters are developed quickly and clearly. Basically, there are ""two worlds,"" one of scientific law, and the other where magic governs. They are separated by a stone wall, with one single gate of passage. Entry from the ""real"" one into the ""fantasy"" land is restricted by an old guy who beats the snot out of interlopers.<br/><br/>There are several subplots, but the one prize everybody wants: the witches, the princes, a gypsy, a star crossed lover, and a few others is a woman who is sometimes human, sometimes a stellar object (don't ask, just believe!), and she has a power they're all after. Extremely well written, all these interlocking subplots converge for some good old style fairy tale good vs. evil fireworks. Acting is superior throughout; the witches are scary, the backstabbing princes are nasty, the star/woman is indeed ""heavenly,"" the spectator ghosts are amusing, the pirates are both greasy and funny, the hero easy to root for. Special effects are devised and utilized very well.<br/><br/>It's obvious from the start how everything will work out, but it's a fairy tale, so that's to be expected, and it certainly doesn't take anything from the entertainment value of the movie.

","I was really looking forward to the film, and I was certainly NOT disappointed. I thought it was enchanting, and clever, not to mention the comic relief was wonderful. In a lot of films people wonder ""where is this heading?"", or they simply fall asleep. This kept my father awake and intrigued.. which is a miracle for HIM! Going to my favorites' list. Loved it. If you're down, and you want to dream again or be inspired, this is your kind of fairytale.<br/><br/>I thought the acting was also done extremely well, and although many fairy tales are alike, this story is original and fresh. I give it nine out of ten stars."

","I expected a fantasy movie with great visuals from the previews. What I didn't expect was to laugh so much. This was a delightful fantasy with excellent writing. <br/><br/>For starts, De Nero's performance as a tough pirate captain whose ""deep dark secret"" is that he's a cross dressing, stereotypical closet queen of was excellent. Seeing him dance around with boa and fan was hilarious. <br/><br/>Some of the scenes with the wicked witch were enough to set us laughing on the way home. In particular her attempts to minimize the ravages of excessive magic use. <br/><br/>The cgi was very well integrated with live action, for the most part almost seamlessly.<br/><br/>All in all, this is a movie worth watching more than once!"

","Liked the movie very much; has a bit of a slow start but once the action starts it's very enjoyable. Lots of action, great special effects and it's got some humor as well. If you like fantasy movies you'll enjoy this one. My hubby wasn't a big fan but our 11 year old daughter loved it as did her 16 year old cousin. Great for kids although some scenes might be a little scary for younger children. Robert DeNiro is great although the role is not quite what I'm use to seeing him in and Michelle Pffeifer is great as well. I think this might be one to add to your DVD collection once it's available; especially if you are a fan of fantasy movies."
"The_Defiant1","7","4","5","19 August 2007"," Good Film, Despite the Fact I'm Not a Fan of Fantasy
","This movie is very well made. Great cast with both the celebrities you know and those you don't. It has an exceptional score to go with it. Unfortunately I'm just not a fan of pure fantasy and that's most of what story has to offer. Expect a cross between Star War optimism and Lord of the Rings fantasy. It's a fairly bright and positive movie despite the antagonists in the plot. This movie delivered everything right whereas a movie like Eragon failed miserably. If you prefer movies grounded in reality and science, this isn't a movie for you. If you like a fantasy getaway where anything is possible, you can't find much better. Overall it's worth the money, but I wouldn't want to see it again. It has a few too many silly moments and almost qualifies as a comedy. I see no need to rush to a theater. Best suited for a DVD rental."
"celestine333","10","4","5","18 August 2007"," Great story not overshadowed by its special effects
","This movie was an unexpected delight for me. We bought tickets, not knowing much about the movie. It was the only show that was playing at the time we wanted to go to the theater for a last-minute decision to see a movie. Don't read those dry synopses...they don't adequately portray this well-done film. This is quite a magical movie that blows away any other titles that I've seen. The story and special effects far surpass titles like Peter Pan. ""Stardust"" captivates and excites, and it holds the undivided attention of both children and adults. There is adult (not dirty) humor, examples being the blue-colored blood (hence ""blueblood"")of a killed prince, the 97 year old wall-bouncer and the goat turned into an innkeeper named Billy by a witch. Lots of laughter! Lots of beauty! Keep your ears open for the hidden humor, as well as the poignant. The plot is that of a fallen star who is sought by evil and good characters and their inner-weaving scenarios. There is excitement, non-stop movement with superb scene-pacing and great characters acted well. Recommend! It's a keeper! My sons, age 14 and 9, loved it, as did our 19 year old neighbor. Boys and girls, men and women! Yes, the row of guys in the rear enjoyed it immensely. More than a family film--it's a royal treat!"

","Amazing film... if you haven't seen this then I would really recommend. This is a real gem and lost one to me... for some reason I missed this film when it was released .. maybe because there were other good films out in 2007, or maybe because my children were young? Anyway we had a dreary Saturday afternoon with my son not feeling so well. I heard about this film after watching Music channel and Take That song came on. I saw background scenes and realized 'Rule the World' was from the film Stardust. I checked out on IMDb and saw the great ratings and feedback so I got the film. My son not feeling too good didn't want to watch it as he had not heard of it. So I said OK lets put it on for 10 minutes, if you don't like we switch off and put something else on... 5 minutes into it we were all engrossed ... We didn't even think about the 10 minute rule. The film is very funny. Some real great moments that you won't see coming! Panto v Discworld with some ""adult"" very suttle innuendo's but nothing tacky or offensive ... just like watching panto ;o) We would watch the film again and would recommend to all our friends.

"kekca","10","5","7","6 December 2013"," My rating: 10
","Rarely, very rarely, I give such high rating of a film. Maybe it can not reflect it fully but still it shows my willingness to represent it to you.<br/><br/>It starts a little bit and untypical but this is what the fairy world of the fantasy, without which we can not, is. Because fantasy make us to dream what we want to see, to go beyond our limits - to emerge from the aquarium rather than sink into it and drown.<br/><br/>Crucial moment: the heart of the damsel, crossing point for all human worlds. And man's, and woman's; of children, and of elder people; of the young and of the adult. Crossing point where only harmonizing balanced worlds can become one and create new world.<br/><br/>Balance is also one of the movie's elements. Measured doze of humor, action, adventure, fairy tale and tension. In order of appearance it presented us a story of ghosts, witches, flying ship who's captain (one of the biggest) is a lightening strikes hunter.<br/><br/>The audience also becomes a ghost because this movie comes to life in front of them without an interest of their existence.

"ExpendableMan","8","5","7","18 November 2007"," Brilliant! A perfect 'relax and forget the world' movie
","Stardust is the kind of film that reminds you why you keep going down the DVD rental shop, buying Empire magazine and visiting this site: it's a gem that the majority of people will overlook, but everyone who takes the time to check it out will have an absolute blast. It might not have set the box office on fire, but cult devotion beckons, partly because of the Neil Gaiman connection, but also because it's one of those rare examples of script writing where everything fits into a cohesive whole. All the multiple plot strands are wrapped up neatly, the story takes it's time and is in no rush and despite the fantasy setting, Stardust is just as keen to laugh at itself as it is to enchant the audience.<br/><br/>Set in ye olde England where the concept of stumbling into a fantastical world of Unicorns, witches, magic and flying boats is the start of a terrific adventure rather than a reality-blurring head trip, Stardust tells the story of Tristran Thorn (Charlie Cox), a likable but aimless country youth. Desperate to cop off with Sienna Miller's village bike, he crosses the wall that surrounds the town in order to find a piece of a star that's fallen to earth and return it to her as a demonstration of love. His efforts are waylaid however when the star doesn't turn out to be a lump of space rock, but a feisty Clare Danes who isn't exactly pleased to be a wedding present. Throw in an evil trio of witches (led by Michelle Pfeiffer) looking for the secret of youth and the dastardly Prince Septimus and Tristran's simple act of crossing a wall, picking up a rock and walking back turns into an epic adventure of romance, swashbuckling and fun.<br/><br/>By now, with all this talk of Unicorns and such like, there's bound to be a few people out there whose eyes are rolling at the thought of yet another fantasy adventure clogging up the screens, but Stardust has an edge on the competition. Where the likes of Eragon relied on special effects and wide shots of the New Zealand countryside to enchant people and usually fell flat, Stardust concentrates on the story. The special effects are kept to a minimum and you're encouraged to pay attention to the one-liners and sparkling dialogue, rather than ogle hordes of sword wielding clichés. In this respect, Stardust's closest relative is The Princess Bride, a story that was shot through with a similar degree of knowing humour without jeopardising the central premise.<br/><br/>Stardust in short, is a film tailor made for the Christmas television schedules. It transports you to another world and for over two hours, you can sit back, get swept up in it and forget about the mortgage, car insurance and the miserable next door neighbours that keep throwing mashed up watermelon slices onto your patio floor. With a cast that consists largely of British TV comedy regulars, it's no surprise that the sense of freewheeling fun never diminishes. It might be stereotypical, but this is no two dimensional children's movie, it's one the entire family can enjoy: toddlers, sulky teenagers, direction-less twenty somethings, parents and grandparents all."

","Brilliant cinematography, great dialogue and excellent acting make this movie the best of 2007 hands down! This is really a movie with something for everyone and must not be missed. I'm not a regular viewer of romance driven movies but this one was like nothing you've seen before because it really had so many elements to it and was directed so well with the perfect cast of actors. It has genuine comedy, action, drama and fantasy that will not disappoint and a superb musical score that completes it. Even if you absolutely hate romantic movies, you will love this because it is much much more than just a romance movie.<br/><br/>From the opening scene, with an accomplished narrator introducing us to the spectacle about to unfold, you know you're in for a treat but I remained a little skeptical for the first 10 minutes thinking that there was no way the movie could carry on in such a brilliant and entertaining way.. I assumed it would get a little boring after a while, after all it is over 2 hours long. How wrong I was! There was not one moment in the movie that lost my attention and to me that means it was close to perfect! I rated this movie 10/10 because it did everything it was supposed to do, and did it very very well. I think its so good that at the time of writing this, on IMDb.com the rating is 8.1 and that is a slightly unfair rating! Exceptional and rare, cinematic genius, must not be missed."

","Just saw the movie and boy was I astonished. I can't remember the last a fantasy flick has touched my heart (Bridge to Terabithia?). It wasn't a total masterpiece of some sort. But it was, in all respects.... lovely. Sure, it was a combination of clichés (a king in his deathbed, a witch searching for eternal youth and all others) yet somehow it still manages to entertain you all throughout.<br/><br/>Was it predictable? Not really. With so many characters involved, you'll really have no idea what's going to happen next. Were the characters lovable? Definitely. The movie makes you adore the characters so much that you'd actually care over what will happen to them. The idea of using ""fresh"" actors/actresses is technically a good thing for this movie. You see, the best thing about using fresh ones is that you'll see them as characters and NOT as stars. (Look at Charlie Cox and you'll see him as Tristan. Look at Captain Shakespeare and you'll see Robert De Niro.) Can your children watch it? Of course. Trust me when I say that if your child watches this movie, he or she will remember this throughout his/her childhood. (Of course, that is assuming that your child isn't a video-game freak).<br/><br/>All in all, a really adorable movie. A nice break from writing my dissertation. I'll be sure to buy the DVD when it comes out. And probably the novel itself."
"poojucu","9","5","7","30 September 2007"," Escapism as it's very best.
","Stardust is too say the least one of the best fantasy/fairytale/adventures of the year. It's combined elements of humor, action, fantasy, and surprise will surely make it a success with the whole family.<br/><br/>Stardust's main basis is a love story. A young man (Tristan) sets out into a mystical land too retrieve a fallen star, which he intends too return to his love Victoria (Sienna Miller) in order too win her affection. Upon getting the star which is actually a woman (Claire Danes), Tristan embarks on the perilous journey home. As he goes however a connection develops between Tristan and the star, and he begins to question who he actually loves. This is a very convincing relationship and I tip my hat too Charlie Cox and Claire Dannes for making it all the more real. <br/><br/>Other people are seeking the fallen star for their own reasons including three witches and a set of brothers who all wish to become king of the land. This makes for an action packed journey as all three different story lines inter wine and connect throughout the film.<br/><br/>As a character Tristan grows and matures over the story, actor Charlie Cox I thought brought a marvelous almost charming naivety too the role. Rickey Gervais plays Ricky Gervais again, and Robert Di Niro supports as the flamboyant Captain, which worked surprisingly well for this film.<br/><br/>Stardust has it all from humor to romance, too drama and then to action. It is a solid achievement that really does merit a trip to the cinemas and a DVD purchase. Maybe even a second trip to the cinemas, it really is that good."
"Muromets","Null","5","7","10 September 2007"," A tale to remember
","What it takes to make a and to tell tale? To tell it with all passion you possess? What it takes, to create a story for children and their parents, without pompous moralistic lectures and banal cliché-like preachments? I guess, it requires sincerity, straight from you heart and soul. Sincerity, that can not be faked. And Stardust  is a perfect example of Tale from big ""T""-letter. It reminds literally brilliance of Astrid Lindgren, Tuwe Jansson or Alexander Milne. It has actor's sparkling performance (Peter O'Tool, Rober DeNiro Do I need to continue? ), astonishing special effects (a good tale requires magic, isn't it?) and kindness  kindness that nowadays lacks so bad. There were Never-ending Story. Now it's a Stardust. A good tale never dies, because hope is indeed immortal."

","This was the first movie I saw this summer that I really enjoyed and would recommend to others. It has a great cast with Clare Danes giving an excellent performance. Sheis truly one of the best actresses on the screen at the moment. The movie has a plot and the special effects serve the story, whereas in many movies these days the special effects substitute for the plot. Robert De Niro shows his comic side again as he did in the ""Fokkers"" movies but it is a little overdone. Michelle Pfeiffer is excellent as the witch. The plot moves to a thrilling climax before good wins over evil with the rightful heir to the throne of the mythical country marrying Clare Danes and living a long and happy life. The soundtrack is perfectly co-ordinated to the action on the screen, which adds to the mood. Outside filming used locations in England, Scotland and Iceland to great effect. This movie is suitable for both children and adults. I wish more quality movies like this were available to see."

I will now read the book since I enjoyed this film so much. I have now went and saw it twice. First, I think the story is very adorable. Second, the acting I thought was great. This movie didn't come across cheesy or corny for being a love story with fantasy. I thought Claire Danes was amazing. I think the way she acted and gave her character such life and humor was great. I think Ms. Danes needs more work in Hollywood. Such a talent ever since her My So Called Life days. I am a huge fan of the Princess Bride, so I'm a sucker for the sword and love story movie. I thought this movie was very funny, and I just loved the Robert Deniro part. I think I could laugh at that over and over again. I think Charlie Cox was good. It was a sweet movie. I thought Michelle Phifer was great. She was perfectly wicked and a great witch. It was great the stuff with the brothers. This film had action and comedy all in one. A great date movie. The time just flew by in which I was sad to see the movie end. I thought the sets and locations were beautiful. I loved the ending and it really made me want to read the book now that I know there is one. Everything worked out for everyone which is great. Please go see this movie you won't regret it!"

Michelle Pfeiffer also is very good as Lamia, and Claire Danes is perfectly tolerable as the ""star"". I will say though that Charlie Cox was not entirely convincing at times as the hero, and the film is overlong. However, there are plenty of things to recommend it, particularly a chance to see Robert DeNiro in drag doing the can can. The direction, while not the best direction in existence, is competent, and does give some thrills here and there, like the princes who decide to kill each other. The script is quite witty, a little underdeveloped at times, but not that bad at all. In conclusion, an enjoyable film, not the best I've ever seen, but well worth watching. 8/10 Bethany Cox."
"Redcitykev","8","6","9","22 November 2007"," Excellent piece of entertainment
","I doubt that there are many people who would place Stardust at the top of their lists of the best films of 2007, but there is little doubting that this film is, if you are in the right mood, an excellent piece of entertainment.<br/><br/>The concept of a magical land sited right next to a little area of jolly old England is a nice one, especially as the portal is a simple dry built stone wall, the type that you see throughout the English countryside! The time setting is very interesting, I first thought that the story would have worked better if the English setting was modern era, but on reflection a modern day youth of 16 would be too 'streetwise' to be drawn into the world beyond the wall. Withing this setting the narrative holds no real surprises, and without giving anything away the moral line of Good vs Evil and True Love triumphing - or not as the case may be - is all to familiar to anyone who has any grounding in basic faery tales and fantasy fiction.<br/><br/>Allowing for the constraints that the basic storyline gives the film, the film does allow its own elements to breath, and there are no strings left untied that I could see.<br/><br/>The performances are all great fun, and all cast members seem to be really enjoying themselves, although there is one 'turn' that steels the show. Mr DeNero is truly a joy to behold! At first he appears to be playing, well DeNero, but then...No, I'm not going to say any more, you will just have to see the film to judge for yourselves! The effects are what you expect from such a film, all very well done, and some are really spectacular. There is nothing here to really disappoint all but the most critical fantasy film fans, and for the causal viewer there is a lot of fun to be had here.<br/><br/>Check your brain in at the box office, get yourself a large popcorn and sit back and let this film entertain you for a couple of hours. You may have forgotten most of it by the time you reach the pub - apart for the aforementioned Mr DeNero! - but you would not have wasted your money!"
"Craig_McPherson","8","6","9","1 September 2007"," Once upon a time..... Hollywood made movies like this
","Once upon a time, tales of princes, pirates, witches and unicorns used to captivate us. Sadly, those days departed with our childhood, however thanks to Stardust, you too can recapture the essence of those innocent bygone days of wonderment.<br/><br/>Directed by Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) and based on a graphic novel by Neil Gaiman, who also had a hand in penning the screenplay, Stardust is billed as a fairy tale for adults. The movie draws heavily on a multitude of fantasy influences, not the least of which are those spun by the Brothers Grimm. Complete with the aforementioned menagerie of fantastical players, perhaps the greatest spell this movie casts is the one it weaves over the audience.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) who lives in the English town of Wall, so named because of the stone structure that lies on its border, separating the land's inhabitants from a mysterious realm where mortals are forbidden to enter  a land known as Stormhold. Of course, this didn't stop Tristan's dad from weaseling his way across years earlier; an event which led to Tristan's advent on the scene.<br/><br/>Fixated upon winning the hand of the comely Victoria (Sienna Miller), Tristan pledges to cross the wall and bring back the remnants of a falling star seen shooting from the heavens into the land beyond, and from there Tristan's adventure begins.<br/><br/>Upon arrival on Earth, the star takes the human form of Yvaine (Claire Danes) and her capture, by either the surviving sons of Stormhold's dying king (Peter O'Toole), or the evil witch Lamia (played with screen-eating aplomb by Michelle Pfeiffer) will yield the throne for the successful prince, or youth and immortality for the witch and her sisters.<br/><br/>As Tristan's quest unfolds, he and Yvaine encounter a hoard of lightening-harvesting sky pirates captained by Robert De Niro, who practically steals the show with his comedic portrayal of a swash buckling swordsman with a secret passion for chiffon and the can-can - a performance that had me giggling like a schoolgirl throughout.<br/><br/>Vaughn keeps the story moving forward at a brisk pace, never allowing things to get bogged down in sentimentality or overly drawn out scenes. In many respects Stardust hearkens back to Rob Reiner's 1987 movie The Princess Bride which also managed to find the perfect blend of comedy, fantasy and romance and wrap it all up in an enchanting fairy tale that could be enjoyed equally by young and old alike.<br/><br/>With cameos by Ricky Gervais (The Office), David Kelly (Waking Ned Devine) and Rupert Everett, Stardust will envelope you in its charms and leave you feeling like a child all over again and reassure you that the sense of wonderment and enchantment still glows, even within the hearts of jaded adults."
"Credo_Quia_Absurdum","7","6","9","31 August 2007"," A future cult movie?
","Sometimes there is a movie that goes unheard of, ignored by most, sometimes pounded by negative critics and suddenly, some years later, it turns into a classic for some reason. Fantasy movies are usually on top of that list. Think of Labyrinth or The Dark Crystal. Stardust will probably find itself along with those titles in the upcoming years for many reasons.<br/><br/>First of, the movie, overall, is not taken seriously in many different ways. The actors all seem to be having fun and an aura of global simplicity surrounds the movie from beginning to end. There's a lot of cheezy stuff in Stardust, but just enough so it can't be considered as a boring parody. It involves old fairy tales with contemporary humor, pretty much like Shrek did with brilliance. Although it is not funny as in laughable, the movie makes us smile not because of some joke or the facial expressions of some actor, but because we find each and every character charmingly naive and totally focused on one single idea. The fact that their personality is so simple makes them likable very soon after we encounter them for the first time.<br/><br/>The most intriguing part is, without a doubt, Robert De Niro's role as cross dressing pirate. His part is played with great acting and he is seen just enough so his character doesn't turn into a cliché. He is an enlightenment to the movie and almost makes us forget about some boring scenes. The brothers killing each other for the throne also fill up some good moments. The main actor ( Charlie Cox ) playing the hero is doing his best but the whole scenario was too much of a "" loser turning into a winner "", he is still not experienced enough to play a leading role. He was mostly overshadowed by the other characters ( especially Lamia ( Pfeiffer ), Septimus ( Mark Strong ) and Captain Shakespeare ( De Niro )). Claire Danes was okay. I wished Jason Flemyng would've played a bigger part as Primus. I liked his over-the-top prince charming looks and personality compared to the Severus Snape/Aragorn look-a-like in Septimus who was not enough of a villain. Wearing black does not really make you evil. Michelle Pfeiffer was all right but I think her character also was built on ""evil looks"" and she is not that terrifying although the ""inn scene"" was great.<br/><br/>These kind of movies must not be expected to be as gigantic and dramatic as The Lord of The Rings which is the prime example. It is not a work of art, just an enjoyable family friendly film. It has to be taken lightly. There is nothing out of the ordinary in Stardust but, sometimes, if we focus on the ordinary things we usually ignore, we find beauty in them and that is what can be found in this very movie."
"Robert_duder","7","6","9","25 August 2007"," A well meant fairy tale with really good romance and adventure but has some moments of frustration
","Stardust is not alone in the absolute slew of magical fairy tale adventures to hit the screen in 2007 although it stands alone this summer with the exception of Harry Potter. Still I have to wonder if audiences really want all this fantasy and magic? Stardust to date hasn't fared well in the theater but I went to see it with reasonably decent expectations and the first hour I was a little disappointed. The film is much longer than it needs to be, in fact, it almost feels like it forces itself to be 2 1/2 hours just to fit the fantasy epic genre. The problem with Stardust is very simple. It has far too much misguided and misplaced humor. It makes itself into a fantasy/comedy and it doesn't need to be like that. The humor and self mocking ruins the film rather than assists it in any manner. Fortunately by the time the first hour is past the rest of the film redeems itself in a huge way with an amazing adventure, beautiful romance, a touching story, and a feel good Fairy Tale with the happy ending in tact. Director and co-writer Matthew Vaughn has never done anything like this only previously directing Layer Cake and involving himself in British cult classics like Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels, and Snatch. So his attempt and experience at a subtle dry humor just doesn't transition over the Stardust very well but fortunately Fairy Tale wins out.<br/><br/>Certainly an all star cast brings this film into high regard with Sir Ian McKellen narrating the story. Charlie Cox plays our young hero/Prince Tristan. He goes through a very big metamorphosis throughout the film and I couldn't see him as the hero in the beginning (which I think was the point) but by the end he is the handsome and swashbuckling Prince you'd expect. He does a terrific job and delivers a strong performance while being very easy to relate to. Lovely Claire Danes returns to the big screen for the first time in two years as the fallen star Yvaine. I had figure Yvaine would be portrayed as a quiet, lovely, naive girl but much to my surprise she is a firecracker. Sarcastic, and strong and a fighter and a much more interesting character than I thought she'd be. It makes the romance between Cox and Danes much more interesting and it is really a beautiful romance with some truly inspiring moments of heartfelt honesty. Michelle Pfeiffer is the evil witch (one of three) who sets out to capture Danes in order to capture eternal beauty by eating her heart. Pfeiffer is appropriately 'witch-like' but unfortunately her character gets saddled with a lot of the misplaced humor I mentioned. She's almost campy at times but the final battle does make her as wicked as witches come and she looks incredible (out of make up that is.) And finally I must mention one of my favorite actors Mr. Robert De Niro who I admit I respect in almost anything he does but this performance makes Stardust worth while. De Niro plays...ahem...flamboyant but closeted Captain Shakespeare. Supposedly the meanest pirate of the air ship in the sky but as it turns out he simply wants to keep his reputation while living his secret life behind closed doors. Watching De Niro prance around in a dress is priceless and it's not that it's mocking homosexuality, in fact, his character has an important moral about being yourself and he is a hit of the film. He's a great character!! Add in supporting performances by Peter O'Toole, Sienna Miller, Nathaniel Parker, and Mark Strong as a deliciously evil Prince bent on capturing a stone around Yvaine's neck that will make him King. Everyone has a great role and does a great job despite the sometimes campy humor and dialog.<br/><br/>Stardust manages to hold a little bit of adult aura to it while still being reasonably acceptable for children and comparisons to The Princess Bride are not unfounded at all. In fact Stardust may actually stand the test of time and become a bigger hit down the road on DVD or as a cult classic because it does have moments of true heart and I wasn't disappointed in any way. I just wish there had been less of that humor because it wasn't entirely necessary although the plot point of the 'dead Prince brothers' watching over the remaining brother(s) was very funny and did add smiles to the already cute story. Most of all Stardust has a terrific romance and adventure spanning a magical world and it's worth checking out. 7.5/10"

","""Stardust"" is simply, timeless. There really aren't many current fantasy type movies that can hold a star to it... er, candle. Everything about it is sheer genius. There wasn't really much character development, but the acting made up for it. From the very beginning, it grabbed my attention and just kept going for the whole two hours. It's a movie you can watch over and over again and see something new every time. It made me laugh at, fear for and fall in love with the movie! I went in expecting nothing and came out shining. I can't wait for Stardust to come out on DVD, but till then, another $8.00 will be worth it to see in the theater a 2nd and maybe 3rd time. Watching the characters evolve was my favorite thing about the movie. And the ending couldn't have been better. Stardust is my now my second favorite movie, ""Amelie'"" being my first."
"ArielSol","10","7","11","6 September 2007"," The most original fantasy I've seen in years...
","I wasn't expecting to like this movie as much as I did, but from the start, it enchanted me. It followed no 'formula' but made it's own way through the classic quest, with stops along the way in the realms of historical romance, fairy tale, fantasy, comedy, action adventure and the always popular coming of age. Neil Gaiman is a favorite of mine anyway and his touch; lyrical, with a hint of darkness, but a core of good, is somewhat reminiscent of 'The Princess Bride'. But unlike that film's simplistic story, 'Stardust' is much richer and more detailed, conveying its tale with wit, charm and the perfect measure of comedic quips from its surprisingly star-filled cast.<br/><br/>I won't give anything away, but to say I was delighted is an understatement. Do see this one."
"Deathbypenguins","5","25","53","10 August 2007"," Generic, lacking the subtlety and humanity of Gaiman's original tale
","I came in to this movie not expecting a faithful translation of the book, but a solid movie that kept the spirit and basic plot outline of Neil Gaiman's fantastic fairy tale, Stardust.<br/><br/>I was disappointed on both counts.<br/><br/>What I loved most about the book (and what made it stand out from other fantasy adventure novels) was the subtlety of the majority of the plot and the human nature of the characters.<br/><br/>In the book, the ""good"" guys were not pure; they made mistakes that were more malicious than clumsy, yet were still likable. Tristran's mother was not pure and good; she wanted an heir, and she got one out of Dunstan. After that, her son was on his own. Yet, even when it does show these moral failures, it doesn't quite show the characters making up for it. Tristran is impossibly blinded by his ""love"" for Victoria Forester (who wants nothing more than the hand of Tristran's forty-something employer) and captures an innocent and very human star for his own ends. He is redeemed because he trusts her and lets go of the chain himself. This short and simple fact is left out.<br/><br/>Subtlety and irony run throughout the story, yet the movie plot is blunt and again, lacks the grace that made the book so wonderful and satisfying. The queen cannot get Yvaine's heart because she has already given it to Tristran, and the elderly witch stops. Tristran's mother's chain is broken when the moon loses her daughter in a week when two Mondays come together, not when Ditchwater Sal is killed.<br/><br/>As a movie, it was passable and generally likable. But even so, it was disjointed; the modern-ish concepts such as a cross-dressing captain and various comments throughout the movie seem out of place in a period fantasy piece such as this."

","Stardust is a 2007 Fantasy Adventure movie starring Claire Danes,Charlie Cox,Sienna Miller, Robert De Niro and Michelle Pieffer and tells the story of a young man named Tristan(Charlie Cox) who's in love with a woman called Victoria(Sienna Miller) who already has another suitor called Humprey(played by an unreconisable Henry Cavil). In order to win Victoria's heart,Tristian goes on a quest to retrieve the fallen star as Victoria spotted it while Tristian and her were on a date.<br/><br/>But when Tristian does go and find the star,it takes on a human form into a beautiful woman called Yvainne(Claire Danes) and at first the two don't get along but romance blossoms between them. When an evil witch(Michelle Pieffer)is looking for Yvainne,it's up to Tristian to protect her from the witch who wants her for eternal youth?<br/><br/>Overall I really enjoyed this film as I used to have it on DVD and I bought it again as I hadn't seen it in over 10 years and had it forgotten.
The movie is very dark and the story is dark too yet I thought the acting was good and the chemistry between Charlie Cox and Claire Danes was believable.<br/><br/>Also stars Shazam star Mark Strong as one of the heirs of Stormhold and narration from X-Men star Ian McKellan.<br/><br/>

For the down part there's isn't anything much to say. There's aventure, sweet moments, violence, humour.. Everything to make it likeable for anyone. Although I did find that they sorta added some "" fakeness"" if you can say it that way in the characters like they were drawn or something even though those are clearly actors. Which bothered me in some way. Also Tristan and the star aren't attractive enough to make a relationship. Bothered me as well. I'm also going to add that the actrice who plays Yvenne/ the star is not very good.

","An ordinary boy promises a girl from his village that he will retrieve a fallen star as a sign of his true love.

A couple of other people wanted it for its heart (which granted eternal youth to the one who ate it) or for its diamond (which granted a true male heir to the magical world's throne his crown).<br/><br/>It's a movie which I was tempted to take seriously but I was very surprised when I found out that it was actually presented in a funny and entertaining way. It's unique way of telling a fantastic story made me laugh quite a lot but also kept me eager to discover its ending. As you might expect, the plot is OK, but nothing more, just enough to makes the funny events possible. It is a great movie in my opinion, a must see, but if you're after a movie which doesn't put such an accent on its comical side, this might not be for you."
"javi-y-se-acabo","8","2","2","2 May 2017"," One of the Best Epic Tales of the Last Decades
","This movie is perfect. And with that would be enough for you to watch it, but I'll explain a bit more. Everything is so great that I wonder why this movie is not so much known by many people. From the story to the visuals to the acting to the score it is such a wonderful movie that I ask myself why I hadn't discovered it sooner.<br/><br/>It tells the story of Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young men who wants to cross The Wall to get a shooting star he sees to give it to his love interest, Victoria (Sienna Miller), to show his love for her. Later he discovers his father had crossed The Wall a long time ago and that his mother was from the other side of The Wall. He then travels to the place where the star has fallen and discovers that the star is a young and pretty girl called Yvaine (Claire Danes). Together they start a journey through Stormhold, the kingdom on the other side of The Wall, to return to The Wall so Tristan can show Victoria his love for her, but this young star is also being chased by Lamia(Michelle Pfeiffer), a horrible and old witch who wants to recover her youth and beauty, and Septimus (Mark Strong), an evil prince who wants to get the throne of his father before his brothers.<br/><br/>All the actors from the bigger roles to the smaller roles are great. First we have the main characters, Tristan (Charlie Cox) & Yvaine (Claire Danes) they both have chemistry and you can connect with them very well. On the other side you have the witch, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who is as evil as ever and gives a performance full of charisma, the same as Mark Strong in the role of Septimus, one of the many sons of the king who wants to take the throne of his father for himself. Also there are minor characters like the Captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro) who gives an hilarious and great performance as the captain of the flying vessel. Even characters like Victoria (Sienna Miller) or Una, the mother of Tristan(Kate Magowan) are great in their small roles.<br/><br/>Other great thing I have to add is the awesome visuals this movie has. Many scenes felt like a Lord of the Rings movie, with many epic moments but also many emotional moments. All the visual effects and the cinematography only add to this movie one more reasons to love it. This and also the amazing score created by Ilan Eskheri, an awesome, magical and epic masterpiece that carries much of the epic and emotion of the movie (just watch the scene of Septimus riding in slow-motion in the black horse, or the whole opening scene when the star falls to the Earth), and along with the scenes of the movie, it creates such a wonderful fairy tale full of epic, comedy & romance.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone who wants a movie full of epic and romance but also wants to laugh. This is a movie to enjoy and to travel through Stormhold without worrying about anything more than the old witch and the evil prince. Watch it and you won't regret it!"

","The outcome of the movie is rather predictable; the characters act more like teenagers rather than adults; It's a feel good fantasy movie targeted towards teenagers and it is mostly liked by teenagers; the movie might even be a bit too light-hearted for my liking, every death that has happened wasn't really that tragic and they even managed to make me laugh about one death scene, not because it was horrible, therefore funny, but because they made the scene funny. I literally felt two emotions there, sad because a person died, but laughed because how it happened.<br/><br/>Though, despite its shortcomings that mostly adults will notice, the movie is a joy to watch. It will make you laugh, smile and leave you a bit touched. Even though it is predictable, the story is actually unique and memorable. I do not think I've ever seen a movie where a star happens to be a young beautiful woman that can give you ""Everlasting youth"" if you take her heart out.<br/><br/>There is one scene in predictable that made the movie for me. While they were in a carriage, the young man was turned into a mouse, and the star was taking caring of him. Thinking that him being a mouse means he won't understand her, she professed her love for him. The words were touching, the explanation of love was really good, it was good writing overall. <br/><br/>So in short, you will have fun watching this movie and you will definitely remember it because of how unique it is, even though the outcome is predictable."

","Michelle Pfeiffer as a sexy lethal witch with an aging problem is in better form than in ""Witches of Eastwick."" Robert DE Niro comes to the rescue out of the sky like the plumber in ""Brazil,"" in a sky ship just like the one from Disney's ""Treasure Planet."" Ian McKellen narrates, and come to think of it, the hero's (Charlie Cox') theme bears some resemblance to the Fellowship Theme in ""LOTR."" At least there are no R.O.U.S. in it!<br/><br/>Despite uncountable derivative elements, and a high degree of predictability (c'mon, who did not think it will be Pfeiffer vs. Cox at the end with starlight saving the day, 15 minutes into the show?), this film manages to remain charming, well-directed, crammed with great actors doing their work exquisitely, and a deft script.<br/><br/>The story is great fantasy. Tristan, a grocery boy whose father once stumbled over ""The Wall"" into a magical world right ""next to"" England, saves a fallen star incarnated as a beautiful girl. The star is pursued by witches who want her heart for everlasting life, and princes Secundus through Septimus who need her jewel to become king, but die like flies instead. The star gives her heart willingly to Tristan, aptly named after a German legendary prince: His mother is Una, the dying King's firstborn, whom his father had wooed during that one night over ""The Wall"" many years earlier.<br/><br/>It is no ""Princess Bride"" however, a film that was starry-eyed where this one is just a little too glib and derivative. De Niro is great, but the drag show is a somewhat desperate attempt to be different. Having the evil witch give up, only to rise suddenly once more, is just like those all-too-expected endings of horror flicks where the dead monster pops up one last time for a gratuitous scare. Having the star profess her love to Tristan while he's hexed into a mouse, but then he confesses he understood everything is an old ""overheard monologue"" trick. At least he was a Rodent Of Usual Size. And yes, those notes from the LOTR ""Fellowship"" theme got a bit annoying after a while.<br/><br/>Still, while the film is not great, it is very, very good: well-paced, with plenty of action, romance, comedy, scare, visuals, and fairy-tale. Matthew Vaughn is a versatile craftsman, having directed everything from crime thrillers to superhero flicks ... to this great little fantasy tale, worth seeing more than once."
"chris-jones1991","7","2","2","20 November 2012"," Stardust (2007): Narratological Principals
","Director Matthew Vaughn follows up his directorial debut gangster flick Layer Cake with a film that is the complete opposite. Based on the novel of the same name by author Neil Gaiman Stardust could be best described as a modern day fairy-tale or to quote its tag-line: 'the fairy-tale that won't behave'. Although this is true in that the film aims to appeal to children and adults alike such as containing violence with blue blood rather than red, this film still shares key narrative plot points and character functions of traditional fairy tales.<br/><br/>The film begins with the obligatory opening narration that can be found in any of Disney's adaption of traditional fairy tales. This accompanies a short backstory serving to build up the introduction to primary protagonist Tristan (Charlie Cox); the action begins when he is dispatched by the girl he loves, to retrieve a fallen star. A journey which takes him to the mysterious world on the other side of a stone wall running alongside the Victorian village he lives in. This gives a sense of reality to the magical world buy juxtaposing it with the 'real' world opposing traditional fairy tales where the worlds are often fictional and self-contained. A child is likely to believe that a fantasy world can exist parallel to their own, based upon this plot point.<br/><br/>The action really starts to take place with Tristan discovering the star he has been sent to retrieve is anthropomorphic. The film then focuses on Tristan's journey to take the star back home with the traditional binary opposition of good versus evil coming into play when he must protect her from others who want her heart such as a trio of evil witches. This is when the film really starts to play upon the narrative conventions of traditional fairy tales.<br/><br/>All of Propp's character functions are presented to the audience with a good twist being the sub plot involving feuding princes trying to wipe each other out introducing us to false hero Prince Septimus (Mark Strong). A clever device toying with fairytale conventions and how the audience often associates Princes with being the standard fairytale hero out to save the princess-not try to kill them as is the case here. The film also contains some brilliant support from Robert De Niro playing completely against type as a camp pirate captain who helps the protagonists. The film starts out as a Tristan's quest to retrieve a fallen star, 'the princess' but actually charts his journey into manhood.<br/><br/>Although Cox gives a good performance he is somewhat over shadowed by the immense status of stars such as Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer, whilst numerous cameos feel at times to be shoehorned in. despite this some brilliant cinematography and set pieces keeps the audience engaged. Stardust has its faults but that does not stop it being a great reinvention of the traditional fairytale narrative that is destined to be loved by audiences both young and old for decades to come."

","This is a good movie...on the first run. We watched it a friend's house in High Definition. The picture quality is superb, spectacular at best. To put it in terms of a high school perspective, this movie takes the clichÃ© fantasy love-goochy goochy theme and puts it into an epic, ""Lords of the Rings"" type of setting, where there are 2 worlds (don't recall the names of the 2 realms). One world is the magical world. The other is the human, non-magical realm. The movie takes place in the magical world. There are some bitter, (inane) witches. They duke it out with the 7 sons of a king who is about to die. These 7 sons must kill each other to take the realm of the king, but first they must capture this ""special"" pendant. The pendant is actually a special gem that takes the form of a beautiful, shining, ""star"" woman, who runs into the main character. No, I can't remember any names, but that's the basic lowdown. <br/><br/>BUT WAIT! There's more! The good part of this movie is, it's exciting! I was on the edge of my seat for a good 20 minutes (not continually). And as a friend puts it, there is an ""anticlimax"" at the end- something you didn't expect to happen. At least to us.

","Stardust is a wonderful, wonderful movie that I was privileged to see when it came out in theaters. I was a little skeptical at first because of the title, but my mind changed about 2 minutes into the film. The story is great, the acting is great, and the movie is put together very well.<br/><br/>The main story revolves around Tristan, a young man who lives in a village that borders a magical kingdom called Stormhold. When he sees a falling star, he tells the woman of his dreams that he will travel and retrieve the star if she will marry him. When he travels out for the star, he isn't fully aware of what kind of realm Stormhold is. When he reaches the fallen star, it turns out to be a woman by the name of Yvaine. Throughout the movie, many dangers beset them, including a group of witches who also seek to capture fallen stars.<br/><br/>Amazingly the plot is not really predictable, which is rare with this year's movies. There are many elements that twist the story up a little bit throughout the movie, and for the most part they all fit very well into the setting and genre. There's a nice blend of drama, comedy, and action throughout the whole film. The acting is pretty good as well. Charlie Cox does well as Tristan, and you can see his character slowly mature and evolve as the story moves along. Claire Danes acts well and looks absolutely gorgeous as Yvaine, the fallen star. Michelle Phieffer also gives an amazing performance as the head witch after Yvaine.<br/><br/>One thing to beware of and consider before letting your kids see this movie, though, is the tendency of violence as well as references to violence. There are several stabbings and murders in the movie, and there is constant reference to cutting out and eating the heart of a star(Yvaine). there are some sword fights as well. The overall tone of violence is not really strong, but something to think about.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 9/10. This is a great fantasy movie that is not very predictable and has many interesting elements to it."
"Boba_Fett1138","8","2","2","6 April 2008"," Quality fun.
","To be honest, I didn't expect this movie to be as good as it turned out to be. No way this movie seemed like one deserving its current 8 out of 10 rating on here. This seemed to me like just another fluffy 'light'-Lord of the Rings children movie. But even though this movie borrows heavily from other movies, it remains a good and certainly fun quality production.<br/><br/>Best choice the movie made, was that it was one that didn't took itself as seriously. You obviously have to take this movie with a grain of salt. It knows it is ridicules in parts and it doesn't try to hide this but rather even exploit it further. This is mostly what makes the movie so fun to watch. Because of this you also tend to forgive this movie from 'borrowing' elements or entire sequences from other movies. Fact that his movie doesn't take itself as serious can also be seen in the delicious over-the-top roles from Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer roles.<br/><br/>Because the movie needs to be taken with a grain of salt, also the humor works out the best. The humor within this movie feels non-forced, even though it got put in- and planned out all deliberately into the movie. It knows to remain fresh and it doesn't overly try to make you laugh. It's often more subtle and not something you would expect from a genre movie such as this.<br/><br/>It's mostly the fun level and atmosphere of this movie that makes it such a good one to watch. Because lets be fair, if this movie purely had to rely on its story, this would had been a rather weak and simple movie to watch. It's quite formulaic stuff all and of course the way the story progresses is rather predictable. I also don't know if this is really a kids movie. Even though the movie got obviously targeted towards this audience, I strongly feel that it are the adults who will mostly enjoy watching this. The humor and overall story is too mature for that.<br/><br/>Also the diverse wide range of characters makes this movie a real fun one to watch. Most characters are really over-the-top and are often being played by some fine big name actors. Besides the earlier mentioned Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro, the movie also features Sienna Miller, Ian McKellen, Peter O'Toole, Mark Strong, Rupert Everett, Claire Danes, Nathaniel Parker, Dexter Fletcher and Ricky Gervais among others. Most of them are well known respected British actors, which also already gives the movie a certain atmosphere. But it needs to be said, with all the many different characters in the movie it at times feels that most actors looked as if they were making a movie on their own. The movie doesn't always feel like a coherent one.<br/><br/>Also the pacing isn't always right and the movie gave the feeling that it also could had been easily 15 minutes shorter. It on the other hand is a fine looking and constructed movie, even though it doesn't feature the best special effects around but this sort of feels suiting for the movie and its entire atmosphere.<br/><br/>Highly recommendable and in this case believe the hype!<br/><br/>8/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"Benjamin_Cox","7","2","2","17 March 2008"," A modern pantomime but without the wooden scenery or acting - 75%
","Having tried (and failed) to get my Better Half interested in the brilliant ""Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy, I was somewhat surprised that she wanted to see this so badly. A number of our work colleagues had recommended it which is normally enough for us to catch a bus into town and head for the cinema but having missed it, she wasn't about to let the DVD go the same way. Feeling very much like an English version of ""The Princess Bride"", it is a fantasy adventure with its tongue firmly in cheek but for those of us who prefer serious fantasy films, ""Stardust"" might not satisfy those die-hard fans missing Peter Jackson's genius.<br/><br/>The film introduces us to Tristan (Charlie Cox), a young man living in the English village of Wall which, unknown to most, borders a magical world called Stormhold. Watching a falling star with the object of his affection Victoria (Sienna Miller), Tristan promises to bring the star back to her to prove his love for her and sets off into Stormhold to bring it back. But unknowingly for him, the star is actually a beautiful woman called Yvaine (Claire Danes) whose life is in mortal danger. Pursued by an evil witch (Michelle Pfeffier) and a villainous prince (Mark Strong), Tristan finds that achieving the impossible is really quite difficult.<br/><br/>Essentially, that's the plot in a nutshell but what I neglected to mention is that the story allows for a seemingly endless list of cameos that nearly puts ""Ocean's 13"" to shame. Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, Rupert Everett, Dexter Fletcher, Mark Williams, Adam Buxton, David Walliams - admittedly, not all of them are household names but this is one of those films where you'll recognise (or think you recognise) almost every character in the film. Sadly, the biggest cameo is also the most unusual and the biggest let-down - Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare didn't really feel part of the story at all and, personally, was a bit of a disappointment. But what makes ""Stardust"" work is that it covers all the bases for a decent family movie. It lacks the visceral brutality of ""Lord Of The Rings"" but makes up for it with plenty of comic touches such as the collection of ghosts commentating on proceedings. There are one or two moments to scare them as well but that's why we hide behind the sofa, isn't it? <br/><br/>""Stardust"" isn't perfect - the whole thing feels disjointed like it's merely a collection of scenes with different characters. In essence, this is a million-dollar pantomime complete with stereotypical villains and plenty of broo-ha-ha and if that's what you're looking then you probably couldn't do better. However, I will hold my hands up and confess that I am a serious fan of fantasy. I don't go to conventions and I don't believe that early Eighties nonsense like ""Red Sonja"" are genre highlights. I just want a film that feels authentic and believable and in all honesty, the only films to do that are... you've guessed it, ""Lord Of The Rings"". A tad unfair, perhaps because ""Stardust"" plays the same game with different rules. This is a fantasy film for those who don't like fantasy, for those who haven't the time or patience to cope with more weightier material. This is a film, then, for my Better Half."
"toyman1967","9","2","2","14 March 2008"," An unexpectedly wonderful movie!!!!!!!
","I LOVED THIS MOVIE!!!! Right away, I was thinking of comparing this great movie with The Princess Bride and lo and behold, I am not the only one. I do have to say, The Princess Bride will always be my favorite but this one comes in a very close second. Both have their romantic charm and their very funny comedic parts. I think that Stardust will go down as a classic in the future. I will not give it away but if you haven't seen it yet, Robert DeNiro gives his best surprise performance of his career. Forget his classics, this role will forever go down in history, or at least my history, as his best role ever!!! This is a great movie for the entire family to see and one worthy to sit next to the Princess Bride in anyone's sappy, romantic, fairy tale type movie collection"
"SorcererLink22","9","2","2","9 March 2008"," Ground breaking Fairy Tale for both children and adults
","Wow! I went to see this movie with my boyfriend and we were both expecting a so so fairy tale, and what we got was an full fledged entertainment experience. WARNING THIS CONTAINS SPOILERS. You have Clair Danes as a beautiful fallen star who was summoned by a dying king in a fantasy realm that shares the world with England. When she falls to earth she is found by a boy who is searching for the fallen star to give to an undeserving woman. Also on the stars trail is Michelle Pfieffer's character who is an evil witch dead set on cutting out the star's heart to restore her youth. This movie had daring fantasy action, very risqué humor, and charming characters that are believable considering the story. Very daring performances from a star studded cast including Robert De Nero, Michelle Pfieffer, Clare Danes and a number of others. Brilliant. Stardust will touch hearts and funny bones as it dazzles you with a breath taking story and beautiful special effect. By far, one of the fantasy genre films in a long time. Two thumbs way up"

Also, being a bit of a poof myself, I almost shed a tear when the crew stands behind it's captain ;) Special mentions are due to Billy-goat - he is always fantastic, but in this he stole the show! 8/10 - not a ten, because it is painfully obvious budget had something to say.

"dfranzen70","8","2","2","24 February 2008"," Delicious, striking sets and rich, beautiful acting
","Stardust is a lush fantasy story about love, dark magic, evil witches, entitlements of inheritance, and the twinkling stars in the sky. It is gorgeously filmed and well paced, and its denouement will make your heart soar.<br/><br/>For the unrequited love of a girl, young Tristan (Charlie Cox) vows to bring back a fallen star. But once he makes it to the crater where the star hit, he realizes the star isn't a rock at all - it's a beautiful young lady named Yvaine (Claire Danes), who's none to pleased to have fallen from her high-and-mighty perch in the firmament. But promises being promises, Tristan ensnares Yvaine using an enchanted chain and begins their journey back to his village, so that he may present the star to his love, Victoria (Sienna Miller).<br/><br/>But Tristan and Yvaine are unwittingly part of a larger story; the king of the enchanted realm (Peter O'Toole) has just died, and the new ruler will be he among the sons who possesses the kingdom's sacred ruby, which the dying king had tossed up into the heavens, where it smacked into Yvaine, thus bringing her crashing to Earth. Now all the king's remaining sons are on the hunt for the ruby, not knowing Yvaine wears it around her neck.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, three witch sisters have noticed the falling star, which is a major omen in the kingdom of Stormhold; whoever can possess the fallen star will be immortal. You don't have to be pure evil to think immortality might be kind of fun, so the oldest of the sisters, Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) sets off to find it as well.<br/><br/>During the long journey back home, Tristan learns about love and his own parentage. Oh, does he learn about love! With a griping, angry denizen of the sky as his prisoner, Tristan thinks he has everything worked out; he'll present Yvaine to Victoria, who will marry him instead of the cad Humphery (and really, could he be anything but a cad, with that name?).<br/><br/>This is more than a simple fantasy story of good versus evil. It's about telling the difference between being infatuated and being in love; it's about trust and righteousness; it's about doing the right thing, even when it seems impossible to do so.<br/><br/>Based on a Neil Gaiman story, Stardust is impeccably written (it was adapted for the screen by director Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman), with rich characterizations, top-notch acting, and wondrous visual effects. Robert DeNiro gets a showy role as the captain of a flying ship (sort of a cross between a dirigible and a pirate ship), and although it IS a showy role, DeNiro is far from hammy in it - he is, in fact, outstanding. Pfeiffer is remarkably despicable as the ugly-then-beautiful-then-ugly rotten witch Lamia. She doesn't dress down for the role, she dresses down and dirty and Lamia is not a shallow, one-dimensional character in the least. A lesser actress would have played the part a little over the top, portraying Lamia as a power-mad demagogue obsessed with looking pretty, but Pfeiffer delivered a multilayered performance, fulsome in its depth.<br/><br/>Danes is also a huge asset here. Her dancing eyes and rubied lips (matching the stone, of course), coupled with the CGI-added glow about her (since she is, after all, a fallen star) lend a real ethereal feel to her character, but it's her acting that lends the appropriate gravitas; otherwise, Yvaine would be a simple, irritated version of Victoria.<br/><br/>And although the role of Tristan might have been given to an actor offering only a callow performance, Charlie Cox is fantastic as the protagonist. He doesn't just let things happen to him, he makes things happen through decisive actions, good or bad. He's forthright and honest; he's just blinded by the prospect of love from Victoria.<br/><br/>Exquistely photographed and with quick, efficient pacing that doesn't let itself get bogged down in the special effects of the moment, Stardust is a real treat for fans of fantasy novels and movies."

","Maybe it's because it wasn't written by Hollywood, but by a real author. Maybe it's the tongue-in-cheek fun, from a camp Robert de Niro to the dead princes. Maybe it's just the refreshing originality of having a star (the kind in the sky, not celebrities) being a girl. In any case, Stardust is actually the first modern fantasy film which is very good. It really is not cheesy or wooden or predictable. Actually it is somewhat predictable as all fantasy films have to be - the boy and girl get together, and good wins against evil, etc. The best aspect was the ghosts of the dead princes - I loved their comic role here. The worst aspect... probably the Take That song at the end. But you don't have to stay for the credits so go and immerse yourself in it."
"Mightyzebra","8","2","2","6 February 2008"," Only just 8/10 from mightyzebra
","In just about no doubts, this is an entertaining, exciting adventure and fantasy film. But just how many good points are there to it?<br/><br/>1. Even without animation this is good for children (except for a few pieces of CGI to help with the special effects). 2. Some parts are ""Tongue in cheek"" to entertain adults. 3. There is good acting in this film. 4. The storyline is very well-thought up and convincing. 5. There are many charming and a few heart-wrenching parts of this film.<br/><br/>In what seems to be the Victorian era, a young man walks over a long wall beside his home town and enters an amazing, remarkable whole new world. He meets a slave girl, who calls herself a princess. Nine months later, back in his home town, he receives a baby in a basket and he realises it is from the slave girl over the wall...<br/><br/>Years later, the baby Tristain is nearly a grown man and he is in love with a woman whom he lives near to. They see a shooting star fall from the sky and it lands over the wall and Tristain tells her he will go over the wall to give her the star...<br/><br/>Recommended for children aged 10 and above (because of a few rather tense fighting scenes), this is an entertaining film good for the whole family. It may not be to everyone's standard, although there is likely to be at least one quality which you will admire when you watch it.<br/><br/>Enjoy ""Stardust""! :-)"
"eastbergholt2002","8","2","2","27 January 2008"," Excellent Fantasy Adventure
","Stardust is a fairy story, where good triumphs over evil and the hero eventually wins the girl. The film's most appreciative audience is likely to be children between the ages of 8 and 12 however it was officially rated a PG-13 partly for its ""risqué humor"" and Yahoo suggested the film was suitable for an audience of 14 and up. This probably explains why the film only took $39 million at the U.S. box office. It deserved to do better.<br/><br/>Stardust takes places in a magical world called Stormhold. Charlie Cox is very good as the hero and Claire Danes is execellent as the love interest. De Niro plays a cross-dressing pirate called Captain Shakespeare. Michele Pfeiffer plays an evil witch and gives an over the top performances worthy of British pantomime. The supporting cast includes a long list of British acting notables including Sienna Miller, Ricky Gervais, Rupert Everett and Peter O'Toole. Everybody hams it up outrageously. The direction is slick, the script witty and the film looks expensive. It's very enjoyable."
"siderite","8","2","2","2 January 2008"," Beautiful fairy tale with a tang of cinema humour
","No, the film is not a comedy, more of a darker fairy tale, but there are certain scenes that clearly point to other movies. For example Claire Danes and Charlie Cox standing on the prow of the air ship as it hits the water. It must have been hard for the actors not to raise their arms. Also when Michelle Pfeiffer used a voodoo doll; very Eastwick of her.<br/><br/>The story is almost standard: you get the prince(s), the princess, the witches, the hero, the evil king, the pirate... all the tarot cards are there. The effects are good without being terribly flashy, the actors seem to have been chosen for their match to the role rather than using Hollywood stars (pun intended) to bring people in the cinemas.<br/><br/>However, what makes this film good is that it puts the story in the foreground and the actors, soundtrack, special effects and whatnot remain where they are supposed to: as props for telling it.<br/><br/>Bottom line: good fairy tale, both for children and adults, and a very well done film."
"vovazhd","8","2","2","1 January 2008"," Fantastic proverbial fantasy
","Stardust is a fantasy about a young man named Tristan, who journeys to collect a fallen star that he and a girlfriend notice in the sky one night. In doing so, he journeys from his ""real world"" town of Wall into a magical land that is hidden behind a wall nearby. But he is not the only one after the star; a band of witches and the son of a King also pursue the fallen star. The star turns out to be a woman that carries an attitude of her own, further complicating the quest. The film has several subplots that are important but too complicated to describe here. When everything comes together, you get a fascinating and elegant structure that forms a perfect fantasy tale.<br/><br/>The movie is, above all else, creative. The fallen star visibly glows as she becomes happy and strong, the witches grow old and ugly as they cast magic (which is why they are after the star; the star's heart regenerates their youth), the King has a unique method of choosing his heir, and there are countless magical spells or objects that are remarkable to imagine (Babylon candles, witch hexes, trapped lightning). One of my favorite ideas is that of Captain Shakespeare (perfectly played by Robert DeNiro), a pirate that believes reputation is everything. The imaginative use of the fantasy world and bright characters is the factor that puts it above most movies.<br/><br/>Stardust does suffer from occasional acting or dialog problems, although none are too distracting. The music is fantastic; its not too intense or overused, but perfectly suits the style. Depending on your personal tastes, it could be a little slow, but for most people the pacing should feel perfect. The finale was especially put together well, with a few exciting surprises to wrap up all the subplots.<br/><br/>I recommend the movie for people of all ages. It has a magical atmosphere that you can't go wrong with. People who love fantasies, dreams, or adventures will like it the most."

","This was an unexpected pleasure. My lady is a big Gaiman fan and a big films-like-this fan, so the fact that we'd be going to see it was a no-brainer. The fact that it might just turn out to be thoroughly enjoyable did not occur to me. So, let's look at the bits: the direction was spot-on, dealing with the soppy and romantic bits with enough comedic or dramatic flair that, though never cynical, they were carried off with the right amount of tongue-in-cheek. The action delivered and the comedy was funny in the right bits. The weakest point of the cast was probably Claire Danes, and even she was engaging, believable and amusing. Pfeiffer's panto dame witch was a hoot, and De Nirowell, watch and learn. And laugh. Genius.<br/><br/>Overall, the film had, for me, no weak bits. Well written, cast, acted and shot. Well edited. Wellwell, well everything. Never a work of art, and never a ""film of the year"" contender, but the sort of enjoyable, entertaining and classy film that you wish happened more often than it actually does.

"jhkenn97","10","8","14","20 August 2007"," A witty, wonderfully imaginative, and timeless tale, destined to become a classic
","This remarkable film can be summed up very easily. First of all, while the comparisons to ""Princess Bride"" are inevitable, it's almost futile to do so. While both films combine adult wit and humor with a fairy tale backdrop, ""Stardust"" is so much different than any other fantasy/sci-fi film I've ever seen. It's such a hybrid of those genres, but its plot and script are so unique that--along with the performances, special effects, cinematography, and score--the finished product is simply not all that comparable to anything that has ever appeared on the silver screen. Secondly, the score is very effective at simultaneously pulling us into the story and the fantasy world in which it takes place and pushing the story along, while creating just the right amount of awe and excitement necessary to make the magic believable within the realm where the characters exist. Thirdly, I did not find the film to be even remotely difficult to follow or confusing in any way. In fact, the interesting interplay between the three main subplots actually made it even that much more compelling to watch. Wonderfully casted, and superbly acted across the board. This fantasy adventure (with sci-fi elements) was the best one I've seen since ""Return of the King"" (not that I am comparing the two at all). OK, so its not that easy to sum up, but don't let any crude and/or heartless and cynical review nor the film's pathetic PR prevent you from partaking in the best time you could have at the movies this summer (or even possibly in a long time)!"
"parachute_over_me","1","38","91","15 August 2007"," The Magic of the Book is Now Dead
","Surprise, America! It was a book first! And while it goes without saying that most movies made from books are inferior to their paper predecessors, sometimes said movies capture the essence of the author's work, while only leaving out and changing minor things.<br/><br/>In Stardust's case, not only was the movie inaccurate, but what it left out and changed ruined everything that the book was good for.<br/><br/>For instance, in the book, there's this Market that occurs in the field on the other side of the Wall, where the people of Wall and the people of FAERIE (not Stormhold) trade. The little love circles that go on with Dunstan and his future wife are so endearing that the fact they left her out was very disappointing. Yes, in the book, Dunstan courts a girl named Daisy and is whisked away by Una for one night, afterward going back to Daisy for a happy marriage, raising the baby Tristran together in harmony.<br/><br/>Another point, Victoria didn't even give Tristran the decency of being awful to him, let alone being friendly.<br/><br/>UBERSPOILER!!!!! The slaying of the witches was a terrible inaccuracy. Gaiman wrote in the book this awesome little passage where the main evil witch (Pfeiffer's character) threatens Ditchwater Sal (a completely robbed character) by saying something along the lines of ""the acorn that will grow into the tree that will be cut for the crib of the prince who will slay me has not yet fallen."" Shortly after that passage, it narrates a squirrel picking up an acorn and then forgetting it in the ground. Instead, Tristran and Septimus (an unlikely alliance) have to kill ALL THREE of the witches.<br/><br/>And talk about a deus ex machina...with the whole Yvaine-shining-the-life-out-of-the-witch thing. Absolutely terrible.<br/><br/>The end was most disappointing. The point of their marriage was that Yvaine COULDN'T HAVE CHILDREN, and that once Tristran died, Yvaine became the immortal queen of Stormhold by herself, never returning to the sky.<br/><br/>Gaiman's writing of these things were magical, and now the movie has ruined all of it. So please, I implore you, if you want the real magic of this story, pick up the book. Even if you're not huge on reading, it's a quick read. Took me two days, and I'm not so speedy a reader myself."

I think children will like all the fireworks and good special effects, but people that have seen lots of better films will just find this film to be blah. There is absolutely nothing standout about this film. I've missed Michelle Pfieffer and it was good to see her back in films, but I think she was wasted trying to do the best she could with what the script gave her.

"MissTrixieDelight","5","13","26","11 August 2007"," 'Stardust' is no 'Princess Bride'
","Forget the Hollywood hype. Stardust is no Princess Bride. Having read and immensely enjoyed the novel, Stardust, by Neil Gaiman, I can sum up the film in just two simple words; magic lost.<br/><br/>It's hard for me to imagine that Neil Gaiman had anything to do with this filmlet alone the fact that he was a producer. I must admit that I was angry during the beginning of the film and found myself slowly accepting the reality that the film's narrative was failing to stay true to its literary counterpart.<br/><br/>Whatever happened to Tristran's one ear that was pointy and elfish as well as the reasons behind it? Why didn't we get to see how he was treated differently by his peers in Wall? Why didn't we learn the reason why Tristran's father, Dunstan, purchased the snowdrop (glass flower) from the gypsy girl who was the witch's slave? Why weren't we treated to the delicate love scene (as far as PG-13 will allow), between Dunstan and the gypsy girl, which resulted in the birth of Tristran? Why weren't we treated to the wonderful and mysterious goings on at the Faerie Market by all of the vendors and spectators who traveled so far to be there? In the book, vendors shouted, ""Eyes, eyes! New eyes for old!"", ""Instruments of music from a hundred lands!"", ""Try your luck! Step right up!"", ""Everlasting lavender!"", ""Bottled dreams, a shilling a bottle!"", ""Swords of fortune!"" and ""Wands of power!"" Inarguably, this would have lent such a magical feel and sense of wonder to the Faerie Market. Why weren't we told that this very special Faerie Market only took place every nine years? Most importantly, why didn't we get to see the reason why Tristran was granted entrance into the land of Faerie? Finally, why did the filmmakers leave out the hairy little elfin man who helped Tristran get around in the land of Faerie as well as the little faerie folk? Instead of the beautifully crafted narrative in the novel (which so eloquently and effectively establishes a fantastical yet very romantic time and place during the Victorian era), the film speeds past important story elementsthus, leaving us with contrivance and an empty feeling which makes us not care so deeply for the main characters.<br/><br/>Let's face it, Stardust will never reach a very high ""rewatchability factor"" that The Princess Bride has earned. There were no magic moments in Stardust to remember endearingly and no witty lines of dialogue to repeat over and over with friends like, ""As you wish."", ""Inconceivable!"" and ""My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die."" The Stardust script was a mess and simply could not hold a candle to that of The Princess Bride. Undoubtedly, William Goldman is a true genius and an extremely gifted writer. Both his novel, The Princess Bride, and his screenplay adaptation, are far beyond compare. In the novel, and the film, The Princess Bride, one is captivated by the rich characters and their motivations. In addition, the comedic elements in The Princess Bride are priceless with several laugh out loud moments. None of this can be said of Stardust. In fact, Stardust fails miserably in the comedic department. (Honestly, a cross-dressing gay sky pirate?) The comedic elements seemed to have been thrown in haphazardly and were ill-timed at that. Perhaps more comedy would have been inspired if Rupert Everett's character wasn't killed off so suddenly.<br/><br/>Even the characters of time and place were not fully developed as in The Princess Bride. One never feels a connection to Wall or to Stormhold like we are of Florin and Guilder in The Princess Bride. In addition, other wonderful characters of Stardust were either small caricatures or just plain eliminated from the film! The mother who raised Tristran as her own was non-existent in the film. Even Tristran's father's character, Dunstan, was pretty much left in the dust. Even the way Tristran first encounters Yvaine, the fallen star, is ridiculous to say the least! Tristran's entire journey to reach the fallen star was skipped over completely. Instead of a rough, perilous journey, Tristran is suddenly 'beamed' to the star's landing spot viaCGI! What a rip. At least in The Princess Bride, we were treated to the journey as well as the narrow escapes of the Eels, Cliffs of Insanity, the Fire Swamp, Quick Sand and the triumph over the R.O.U.S.'s (Rodents of Unusual Size).<br/><br/>Is there anything redeeming about the film? Michele Pfeiffer makes a darn good wicked witch. That's it, really. Robert De Niro was OK in his role. He was the only real comedic relief in the film and, even here, his lines of dialogue were mediocre at best. Charlie Cox was no Westley and Claire Danes was no Princess Buttercup.<br/><br/>The film was choppy and, for the most part, the characters were like 'walking stick figures'. The make-up and costume departments did a fine job. However, the special effects were not that spectacular and did not compensate for the lack of development for either the characters or storyline. At many points, the film's score was so over the top and dramatic that it didn't fit the scene.<br/><br/>In the end, the mistake was putting two novices on this projectthe director, Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake), and first-time screenwriter, Jane Goldman. And, it showed. (Let's face it, they hired the wrong Goldman!) I blame Paramount and Neil Gaiman, equally, for not choosing a better team. Rob Reiner (The Princess Bride), Peter Jackson (The Lord of the Rings) or Tim Burton (Edward Scissorhands) would have been infinitely superior choices for director. (Neil, you should have adapted your own screenplay like William Goldman did!) Even Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer could not save this film. I truly believe that the studio knew Stardust was in trouble to some degree. The August release date of the film is rather telling. Paramount only wishes Stardust were the next Princess Bride."

"amy-wow","5","9","17","27 October 2007"," Major Disappointment
","Stardust really failed to impress me. The premise is good, and thus the movie should have been miles better than it actually was. I can't think of what I disliked most about this movie. The throwaway characters, the seven ghosts lurking in the background who served no purpose, other than to provide an unfunny lame running commentary throughout or the supposedly 'funny' scenes. I think that it is probably the terribly predictable ending which annoyed me the most. The only redeeming features of this movie are the beautiful scenery, and as usual, the great performances by Michelle Pfeiffer & Robert DeNiro. The film dragged on for an unnecessary 128 minutes, and failed to hold my interest. It really is a painfully average film, that by no stretch of the imagination, deserves to be hailed a 'classic'. It is certainly not a film, that in 20 years, people will still be talking about, which in my book, is what I consider a classic to be.<br/><br/>Stardust : 5/10"

I will buy the movie when it comes out on DVD and let her watch it when she is older.<br/><br/>My husband and I enjoyed it very much and would have been satisfied even if we would have paid (although they did get $10 out of us for a popcorn and soda.) I thought the movie was well paced, it kept our interest throughout the entire 2 hours. De Niro fans are going to love him as Captain Shakespeare and he provides the comic relief. Seeing him in this role will be worth shelling out $10 for! Who would have thought he could be so funny!<br/><br/>I gave it a 9 out of 10 for it's genre.

"Polaris_DiB","7","5","8","23 August 2007"," Good stock fantasy
","If any style of film could be called my ""guilty pleasure"", it'd be this generic fantasy type. Guilty is the wrong word for it, though, as I'm pretty pleased to be an escapist from time to time. ""Stardust"" is good stock fantasy, the likes of which one should expect from Neil Gaiman (or Gaiman adaptation, as it were). It isn't the visual dream-scape of Mirrormask, it isn't the adult pretension of Pan's Labyrinth, and it isn't the fun-loving classic The Princess Bride, but it contains just what the fantasy-lover is familiarized enough with to be completely comfortable during the entire viewing. Fantasy lovers should rejoice--special effects work has finally become good enough and cheap enough that this stuff is in regular production now.<br/><br/>The story of Stardust involves a young man named Tristan who, in order to gain the love and approval of the most beautiful girl in their small town of Wall, goes on an adventure to retrieve a fallen star. To make things difficult, however, Tristan's fallen star is actually a woman named Yvaine, and he's not the only one looking for her... some witches have their greedy eyes on the immortality the star's heart can give, and a brother's feud over the magic kingdom leads murderous princes in her direction.<br/><br/>From there it's all pretty predictable, but it involves some attractive fantasy elements, some warm-hearted commentary on the nature of love, and the best part, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate. On that note, DeNiro's performance is spot-on... it's not the excessive lisp that most actors use to portray gay people, but a surprisingly effective one from someone used to being seen as a rough-and-gruff typecast character (thus the ongoing joke surrounding his character matching DeNiro's own opening up into alternate forms of acting). DeNiro hasn't been so unique to his own image since Brazil, and that's saying something.<br/><br/>Stardust is the type of movie, perhaps, that will subsist on children's and fantasy-lover's shelves for a long time. I can't say it offers anything new, but it's not really there to. It's actually those most familiar with it's tropes that will enjoy it the most.<br/><br/>--PolarisDiB"
"star_heart","9","3","4","21 April 2015"," Fun and delightful journey
","A funny thing happened on my second viewing of this movie. I saw it when it was first released back in 2007 but apart from finding the special effects a little overblown, I was nowhere near as touched as I was watching the second time. Not sure if the difference is 8 years of additional maturity and life experience on my part, or that during the second viewing I saw the movie on its own merits rather than alongside a rerun of The Princess Bride in my head, and away from the rather pushy marketing when it was first released. <br/><br/>I suspect that anyone who has a strong reaction to watching the characters is reacting to its portrayal of innocence. Through young Tristan we inhabit a character who is the embodiment of innocence and all it represents to us, such as trust, hope and youth/purity. At the start of the movie he is young and inexperienced, and he keenly feels it, confiding in his unrequited sweetheart Victoria about how he yearns to travel to exotic places just to fetch her a boon, not just Ipswich to buy her a ring. Despite his brave face, the humiliation of being beaten down by Victoria's preferred suitor Humphrey, and being identified as 'just a shop boy' lowers his spirits, but does not harden him. Despite his innocence Tristan is not naive; the power of his innocence comes from staying true to himself and having hope and faith despite of the setbacks and dangers he faces. It is trusting that your path is the right one for you, and keeping steadfast to it. In a less fantastical movie, innocence would have to be tempered with more cynicism, caution and an underlying belief that the only way to achieve his goals would be to go it alone. For this reason, all movies about the journey of an innocent are ensemble movies by necessity. Tristan cannot achieve his goals by virtue of innocence alone, but it his purity of heart which allows him to trust any mentors who happen on his path, and in doing so, they both learn from each other. Tristan's refreshing authenticity brings out the best part of Captain Shakespeare, and in return our hero gains confidence in himself and his abilities to achieve his ends. <br/><br/>Young Tristan sets out to find a shooting star to prove his love to a village girl, but unknown to him, the star has powers that restore lost youth. The witches and princes also pursuing the shooting star for her gift of everlasting life and youth are wonderfully realized. Watching it the second time it occurred to me that their pursuit of prolonged youth is actually an attempt to reclaim lost innocence just for themselves. Stripped down to just its superficial traits, innocence embodies the younger self, unmarred, unaffected by the cruel life they have lived. The villains want to undo the effects of their harsh their lives and return to a state closer to purity – even if it is only skin deep. The biggest revelation to me on this second viewing was that despite the star Yvaine being the object of pursuit, the powers possessed by her character are the reflection of the qualities personified in Tristan, making the greatest treasure in this movie his strength, genuineness and his innocence."
"Laurynas_Radzevicius","Null","3","4","23 February 2014"," Strangely entertaining, funny and enchanting, but quite predictable
","This movie is strangely entertaining compared to other fairy-tale like adventure films. Starting from the drawbacks, the end was predictable from the start of the movie (seriously, was there any doubt that Tristan will become a king and marry Yvaine??). And of course, some logical gaps (for example, why would the witch pretend to let both of the protagonists go and try to kill them literally 30 seconds later, instead of killing them at once...). And of course, the whole romance thing a a bit too sappy. So, these are the drawbacks, but since I gave it 9 stars, it should be quite good, right? On the positive side, unbelievably entertaining performance by De Niro and the group of ghosts - I caught myself smiling every time they appeared on the scene. Also, some irony towards other similar type movie was very subtle and made the movie even better. The main characters also very well picked. Overall, a perfect movie for the evening."

","""What do stars do? They shine.""<br/><br/>Sky pirates. Blood-thirsty (actually, heart-hungry) witches. Fallen stars. Murderous princes. Action, humor, and all the romance that anyone should require. Stardust is an entertaining fantasy adventure film that has it all, and should appease any fan of the genre.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn's second directorial effort is quite different from the work he did before and after it (the excellent Layer Cake and Kick-Ass, respectively), and it proves that he can make a good movie in nearly any genre. This adaptation of the Neil Gaiman novel of the same name follows our young hero Tristan (Charlie Cox) as he follows a falling star to another world, in order to bring it back as a gift for the woman he wants to marry.<br/><br/>It's not that simple of course, as Tristan finds the star to be not a mere celestial rock, but a young woman (Claire Danes). A very uncooperative young woman, and one who is also being sought by three witch sisters and a prince, who all wish to kill her for her immortal heart. As you can probably guess, that scenario has adventure written all over it.<br/><br/>Stardust has a very definite Princess Bride vibe. If that movie's mix of action, humor, romance, and colorful characters (Robert De Niro has a ball as a rather unique pirate, and Michelle Pfeiffer and Ricky Gervais also steal every scene they're in) appealed to you, then you're in luck. I honestly can't come up with many reasons why someone wouldn't like this, unless you're just not a fan of Gaiman's book or the genre as a whole. I found it to be charming and fun."

For me what appears to be relatively unknowns as the young romantic leads and established ""Hollywood Royalty"" in the roles of Mentor and Villainess! I read the FAQ and I am glad I saw the movie first, I doubt the book would have caught my spirit as easily as the film - despite the fact I think Neil Gaiman is a talented author.<br/><br/>I love the plot twists along the way, but my favourite was Captain Shakespeare, who - although not in the book, nevertheless seemed a member of the Neil Gaiman universe. The ship catching lightning was splendid! Victoria got justice in the end when the rival revealed his true colours!

","This charming little story completely missed the marketing wagon and I feel drawn to point it out to people so it gets the attention it should. I found it in the cheap pile at a DVD store on the weekend and decided to watch it late on a Sunday night. I'm really glad I did. It's been a long time since a fantasy movie has told a fairytale so completely and so well. Most of the cast were brilliant; it seemed everyone was having fun but taking it seriously, producing a happy, dreamy quality with dark undertones that all good fairy tales should have. Ricky Gervais was the exception (although it may have been because I don't like his humour); he seemed to not fit into the world they were trying to portray. Michelle Pfieffer was a perfect wicked witch, Charlie Cox was a great lead role for a virtually unknown actor, and even Claire Danes had her moments. The whole film was fun, feel-good entertainment without being either Disney or Epic Fantasy, with good use of limited but perfect special effects. There's an absolutely fascinating fight scene that you have to see to believe. The film reminded me of the good old days of Labyrinth, Princess Bride and Never Ending Story and was a only a little disappointing by being very same-ish throughout, no huge highs or lows, with very little in the way of memorable quotes (except for a rousing pirate ""Argh!""). That's the only thing I can be critical about however and I will be recommending it to everybody I see in the next few weeks."

Stardust is in league with the likes of Labyrinth and even Lord of The Rings, you must also take into account it was written by Neil Gaiman who also wrote the story for the film Mirrormask. <br/><br/>If anyone has seen either of these films and enjoyed them, then Stardust is a perfect film to add to the fantasy genre. Great acting from Michelle Pheifer and Robert De Niro, and an even better performance from Claire Danes part which surprised me.

We thought it was one of the best films we have seen in the past several years. The cinematography is beautiful, and the special effects are really great. It is a very good fantasy story, but is also very funny in places. (My son said it wasn't just a comedy with some fantasy elements, which he thought would have been a bad thing, for some reason). I thought both Robert DeNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer turned in terrific performances. Also, it is fun to see the transformation in attitudes of both of the main characters, Tristan and Yvaine over the course of the movie.

","Finally a Neil Gaiman story has been successfully brought to the screen. Mirror Mask was a fascinating movie artistically, but not nearly so engaging as Stardust. With an easy story telling approach, reminiscent of Princess Bride, Stardust captures Gaiman's sense of magic coexisting alongside our mundane existence. Unlike the Rowland's Harry Potter, Gaiman's magic has a decidedly sharper, nastier edge, but at the same time there is a marvelous sense of humor and the story really never takes itself too seriously. As for the cast, Peter O'Toole and Robert De Niro were hilarious, and Michelle Pfeiffer really held the story together with her witchiness. The leading protagonists were fun. Clare Danes as the star had simple grace and good humor which well balanced Charlie Cox's faltering steps toward manhood. All in all, it was a great family movie."

Stardust was blessed with great acting, from top-notch Claire Danes in the leading role down to the great acting from the First Officer of the ship. It really has an original plot line compared to a lot of fantasy movies that have been made recently which was accompanied by a great sound track.<br/><br/>The first minute or so of a movie is crucial. This was very well done by the view, great soundtrack and Ian McKellen for narrator, which I have to say that gives any movie he is a part of, even if it is a very minor role, a positive boost.<br/><br/>I loved how this movie was just plain funny but managed to make a serious mood for the important parts. There was also a added bonus that at times it made you reflect on yourself, especially when Yvaine was explaining what she saw as she looked down to earth. Her words were so full of truth. Even though humanity has done a lot of evil in the world there is always the possibility of good and love in us.<br/><br/>All in all, this movie has really exceeded my expectations. I thought it would be just another bad movie based on a good book; Eragon anyone? Though it managed to provide much more then that. I highly recommend it to anyone. This is a summer blockbuster even if it doesn't show it at first glance."

"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","4","16 August 2007"," Wit and humour above all else
","Recognizing that different elements in a movie will appeal to different people, I consider wit and humour the prime attraction for me in Stardust.<br/><br/>While the trailer of Stardust will no doubt bring to mind movies like Princess Bride, it is not quite a pure romance. Right from the beginning, it does not present the heroine with an elegant, romantic aura as you see in Robin Wright. Claire Danes at the start of the movie is loud, rude, impatient and limping! The charm comes later but towards the end, she is just as captivating as Robin Wright, if not more. But let me back up a little bit first.<br/><br/>The star in Stardust is Danes, in the form of a young woman so long as she reminds in a magical realm outside our normal world, the trespassing into which will turn her into stone (albeit a piece of gem). She (as a piece of gem) is thrown by a devious old king played by Peter O'Toole as the final test as to who among his seven sons will succeed him. Talking about wit and humour, these seven sons provide a rich source. Some are already dead and appear as black-and-white ghosts at the beginning while others join their rank as the story unfolds. The most prominent two are played by Mark Strong and Rupert Everett.<br/><br/>Another plot line centers around love-sick Tristran (Charlie Cox) who promises to venture out of the normal world to bring his love Victoria (Sienna Miller) the falling star they see, within seven days, to win her hand in marriage. It doesn't take a veteran moviegoer to see that Trintran is another delightful source of humour for the movie makers.<br/><br/>Completing the interwoven (but not complicated) plot is several-hundred-year-old witch Lamia and her two sisters' quest to attain perpetual youth from the heart of the fallen star. By drawing lots, which are in fact internal organs of an animal just cut open, Lamia wins with the heart (over the sisters' kidney and liver) and gets the chance to swallow the last magical portion they had, which restores her youth temporarily. This quest generates a lot of laughs, some quite as crude as the above-mentioned lot-drawing but mostly not. Michelle Pfeiffer must be complimented for allowing herself the look of a grotesque old hag, although she does get to look beautiful during the middle portion of the movie.<br/><br/>From those three interwoven plots, you get a ride of merriment throughout the entire movie. Granted that these are not Woody Allen type sophisticated humour, they are usually quite decent and funny. Must be mentioned is a little side-plot with Robert De Niro playing the captain of an airship. This is the funny De Niro, something like what you see in ""Analyze this"".<br/><br/>There are of course all these other things that complete a fantasy adventure movie  special effects, combats, vehicle chase scenes and all the rest of them. But what about romance? Be rest assured that you'll have that too. This comes in the unlikely-odd-couple variety, which often gives more satisfaction, when it blossoms, than the standard boy-meets-girl routine. As to Claire Danes, one critic holds that she is miscast, citing Gwyneth Paltrow as a better choice. I found myself agreeing with him in the first half of the movie, until it comes to Danes' soliloquies to a mouse that is Tristran. That scene changes my mind, unequivocally. Claire Danes for Stardust, nobody else."
"jmbartle","8","3","4","14 August 2007"," A Fairy Tale for Adults
","Stardust, which is adapted from Neil Gaiman's novel, despite my early skepticism translates very well onto film. After reading the book, I was slightly worried that the essence of the story wouldn't be captured on screen, but I couldn't have been more wrong. Matthew Vaughn's movie, like Gaiman's novel, does an excellent job of tackling serious themes like love and loss without ever taking itself too seriously. These comedic tones, which can be seen as subtle jabs to some fantasy epics, are what really led to my enjoyment of the book and the movie.<br/><br/>Matthew Vaughn's talents in the directors chair have given the movie viewing public another excellent film. He does a great job of keeping the viewer completely emerged in what is happening to the characters throughout the film. While slightly over two hours long the film never once drags or feels bloated with needless characters or subplots (aka Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest). Working with a $70 million budget, which is a somewhat small budget for a fantasy film, Vaughn brings to life the Village of Wall and the kingdom Stormhold in such great detail. He takes Gaiman's descriptions of places, characters, and events and displays them magnificently on screen. He also manages to get some great performances from his entire cast.<br/><br/>Newcomer Charlie Cox plays the main character of Tristran Thorn with great presence and charisma. He does a great job with the transformation from the lovable loser to the brave hero. Mark Strong also stole the show as the power hungry prince Septimus. Even though he was the ""villian"" of the film I hated to see anything happen to him because he brought so much to every scene that he was in. Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert De Niro, Claire Danes, and Sienna Miller also gave admirable performances in their supporting roles.<br/><br/>The marketing campaign is the only thing that I have to complain about for this film. They did a terrible job of showing the public what this movie was going to be about. In any of the adds that I saw do you ever really get a glimpse of what the plot is going to entail. There was just random clips of Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro. While they were both good in the film, they were not in any way the main characters of the movie. I just hope good word of mouth will help this movie get the recognition it deserves to have!"
"jaredmobarak","9","3","4","11 August 2007"," Mind you don't wear out the wenchStardust
","A magical adventure is just what the summer needed to usher the season into its closing months, leading up to the award contenders' fall/winter releases. With all the sequels and over-the-top action and special effects heavy drivel, an intelligent story steeped in originality couldn't come at a better time. Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess's fantasy story Stardust is a tale ripe for cinematic translation. With the adventure, the surreal, the action, the romance, and the comedy, this film is a direct descendant of classics in the genre like The Princess Bride. After walking out of the theatre, I only had one regretthat I hadn't the opportunity to open up my newly purchased 2007 hardcover edition of the novel yet. If the film was this enjoyable throughout its entirety, I can't wait to check out the source material.<br/><br/>I don't want to ruin any story/plot lines in this review. There is a lot going on and many characters to contend with. Rest assured, everyone's motives are clearly laid out and no one seems two-dimensional or a waste of space. Even the small parts, which crop up at many instances throughout, have fleshed out roles, integral to the story thread that they are a part of. Nothing happens without a reason or regard for some future event. Between the journey of a boy for a fallen star to win his love back at home, the quest for the ruby stone that will crown a prince king, the mission for eternal life by a sisterhood of witches, and the story of a boy becoming a man and finding the true meaning of love and sacrifice, Stardust literally has it all. Fate is a big factor with the progression of our characters as an incident that happened eighteen years previous started a chain reaction of events leading to where we begin our tale with young Tristran. All our heroes and villains continue down the same paths, hot on the heels of each other or narrowly missing confrontation at every turn. The magical land of Stormhold is very near our very own England. Only those with the courage to seek out adventure will dare cross over to see what the other side holds.<br/><br/>We are treated to a plethora of quirky folk along the journey of Tristran and Yvaine. They soon find out what trouble lies in store for them and, with the help of others, attempt to stay alive so that they can each get back to their respective homes. Charlie Cox is fantastic as our hero with equal parts shyness and bravery. His transformation along the duration of the movie is realistic and he handles the romantic moments with the same poise as the action sequences. Always with a smile, his awkwardness to the world outside his reality leads to some very humorous moments with great comedic timing on his part. As for our falling star, Claire Danes continues to impress me this year. The girl I couldn't stand has been slowly finding a soft spot with me. She is radiant here, and her smile glows enough so that the filmmakers didn't even need to use the halo effect when she is happy.<br/><br/>Fans of British film and television will enjoy seeing the numerous cameos included. No matter the name or the top billing, some of the big stars don't last very long. Either way, though, each does his job fully to create the world we are in. We are given nice turns from Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, and Jason Flemyng along with wonderful brief moments from the likes of Rupert Everett and Mark Heap. Michelle Pfeiffer is fantastic as our main villain, yes, but it is Robert De Niro who truly steals the show. You have no idea what to expect from him in the trailers, and you still don't upon his introduction. However, when his true self comes out, it is absolutely priceless.<br/><br/>I never would have thought Matthew Vaughn could create such a lush world of comedy and swashbuckling amongst so many fantastical elements, complete with some very nice computer generated work. This is the guy who produced Guy Ritchie's high violence capers and directed his own harsh crime story in the film Layer Cake. To go from almost directing X-Men 3 to than begin work on a Gaiman fantasy story is quite the leap, but he handles it beautifully. I read that Gaiman actually approached Vaughn because he knew him as an entertainment industry guy that he could trust. Not wanting his words to be altered and disrespected, he met with Vaughn and the two came up with a way to make the film true to the novel while also being palatable for Hollywood to embrace. This is truly a story with a lot of heart and I can't wait to watch it again."

"tburke85","8","4","6","9 May 2009"," Stardust A Pleasant Surprise
","Let me first start off by saying I'm not a big fan of these movies but this one surpassed my expectations and as a man I'm not embarrassed to say that. Without giving too much of the plot away for those of you who haven't seen it or read the book. Stardust is an action adventure fantasy fairy tale with a coming of age story, romance, and plenty of humor. The talented cast do a magnificent job including Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Michelle Pfieffer, and Robert De Niro. Claire Danes was the perfect choice as Yvaine. Claire's strikingly beautiful, smart, and feisty completely believable as the fallen star who crashes to Earth. She's a remarkable actress one of the very best in Hollywood today. She's been excellent in all her films and continues to prove it in Stardust. Well done. Newcomer Charlie Cox also does a good job as Tristan the poor boy who becomes a man and later the hero. Claire Danes and Charlie Cox had great chemistry together that really showed on the screen. Michelle Pfieffer is a solid villain deliciously evil as the sexy witch Lamia and Robert De Niro is terrific as Captain Shakespare the fearsome pirate with a hilarious secret. In fact everything about this film was great. Stardust is fast paced even with a running time of over two hours and it leaves you entertained by the end. Not too many movies come along where you care for the characters and you feel part of the adventure. The director Matthew Vaughn did an admirable job doing that adapting the movie from a book by best selling author Neil Gaiman. He brought this fantastic imaginary world to life giving time for the characters and romance to develop with decent action sequences plus lots of hilarious moments that will make you crack up laughing at least I did. Stardust was a pleasant surprise from all the threequels that came out in 2007 some good - The Bourne Ultimatum and Shrek The Third - some okay but over-hyped and somewhat disappointing - Spider-Man 3 and Pirates 3 - and others that were just horrible - Rush Hour 3 to name one. Hollywood should really start making more films like Stardust with a compelling story, memorable characters who are well developed, action, adventure, romance, and humor instead of just trying to cash in on a quick buck. Overall Stardust was the perfect example of a great fairy tale done right. It's got something in it for just about everyone. Definitely one of the best movies that came out during the summer of 2007. As long as you enjoy watching movies and like to escape into a fantastic imaginary world for two hours then go see it. You won't be disappointed."
"DavidSim240183","9","4","6","14 December 2008"," To catch a falling star
","Fantasy film-making is all the rage nowadays. Harry Potter and The Lord of the Rings rekindled the public interest in magic, sword & sorcery, and now not a year goes by when we don't get a new fantasy epic wanting a piece of the action. Most have been bland disappointments, lacking in any magic, so its a rare treat to come across Stardust. One that stands head and shoulders above the rest.<br/><br/>Stardust is based on the novel by Neil Gaiman, a man with a fine grasp of fantastical storytelling. After all, he did write the script for MirrorMask, a greatly underrated fantasy epic that should have found a far richer audience than it did. Directing the film is Matthew Vaughn, which is certainly a change of pace. His background has all been in Guy Ritchie's crime thrillers up until now. And co-writing the screenplay is Jane Goldman, making her debut as a screenwriter.<br/><br/>Stardust was sadly not a success. People may have thought it no different from the other fantasy films Hollywood churn out on a yearly basis. Which is a shame. Because it's a great entertainment. It has a fine cast. A wonderful script. And great music too. What more could anyone ask?<br/><br/>I will admit it is a bit slow to start. I always get restless through the first 15 minutes. Because it has to set up the different plot strands in the film. But once that's out of the way, Stardust really flies high. Local shop-boy Tristan (Charlie Cox) is in love with Victoria (Sienna Miller), the prettiest girl in the village. But she won't give him the time of day. So to get him out of her hair, she sets him an impossible task. She will agree to marry him, if he brings back a shooting star they see in the sky one night. And Tristan being the lovesick fool that he is, eagerly agrees.<br/><br/>But this star is more than a star. She's a girl called Yvaine (Claire Danes), knocked out of the sky by a necklace from the King of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole). On his deathbed, the King sets his sons an equally arduous task. The first son to bring back the necklace will inherit the throne. And the witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants the star as well. To regain her youth and beauty. But which one of them will reach Yvaine first?<br/><br/>Compared to the dreary likes of Eragon and The Golden Compass, Stardust is a real magic delight. The film is perhaps overplotted, but Matthew Vaughn and Jane Goldman do an excellent job of keeping each story in flight. In fact that was what I enjoyed most about the film. Watching the different characters and their different agendas all interweaving with one another. It may take a few viewings for you to get a proper grasp of the narrative, which may explain its low box-office reception, but once its worked its magic over you, Stardust will always have a place in your heart.<br/><br/>The book was a very enjoyable read, and quite a few of Neil Gaiman's touches have made it into the film. The Babylon Candles that can take you anywhere you want just by thinking it. A flying pirate ship with sails that collects lightning from the storm clouds it encounters. Gaiman's imagination has a rich and frivolous spirit. All things that make Stardust heady entertainment.<br/><br/>There's some great casting too. Newcomer Charlie Cox does well as Tristan (it was Tristran in the book). Watching him go from a hapless shop-boy to a hardened fighter is fun. I predict he has a big future ahead of him. In a blonde wig and a flawless British accent, Claire Danes is a dead ringer for Gwyneth Paltrow. Danes is a little annoying to begin with. She makes Yvaine too whiny and shrill to ever be sympathetic. But eventually she tones it down and makes the part her own. Her slow discovery of what it means to be human. Simple pleasures like enjoying a bath and knowing love.<br/><br/>Even though this is Matthew Vaughn's second film, he's managed to bring together an eclectic cast. Michelle Pfeiffer impresses as Lamia. She always does well in more offbeat roles. And gives a great performance of calculated evil. Her British accent is good too, if a little affected. Its not quite as natural as Danes', but she's a worthy villainess. There's a surprise cameo from Ricky Gervais as a wheeler-dealer. Its not much more than an excuse to do his usual stand-up schtick on camera, but his ad-libs are so funny it seems churlish to complain.<br/><br/>I've never really liked Sienna Miller that much. She seems a bit full of herself. But since Victoria is supposed to be, it makes Miller right for the part. Mark Strong impressed me as Septimus, the youngest son of the King of Stormhold. Not just intimidating, he's funny at times too. The look on his face when he sees Robert De Niro in a petticoat is priceless. And its De Niro who steals the show as the swashbuckling, cross-dressing sky pirate Captain Shakespeare. Gleefully trashing his tough guy image, he hasn't had this much fun in a film since Meet the Parents. There was a Captain Shakespeare in the book, but having him as a closet cross-dresser. I don't know where that came from!<br/><br/>The ending is rather different from the book. Lamia just gave up originally, which was a bit implausible. So the film has to invent some things for a better ending. Some work, like Lamia's deception. Others feel a bit false. Like Tristan being the sole living heir to the throne of Stormhold. But I still enjoyed Stardust immensely. There's a wonderful, infectious joy to it all. Watching the various plots all converge on one another. Stardust shines as brightly as Yvaine's smile."

","I am not a fan of fantasy movies in general, which is why I was initially unsure about watching this movie, but I was encouraged to see it because of the amazing cast, and I do not regret seeing it for a single second. I feel that this movie has elements that everyone, no matter what age they are, can enjoy. It has all the connotations of a regular fairytale, but with twists that keep older viewers entertained.<br/><br/>The acting displayed by Claire Danes was beautiful, and her scenes opposite Charlie Cox showed amazing on-screen chemistry, and kept you drawn in. Michelle Pfeiffer was also amazing to watch, and played the role excellently.<br/><br/>Whether you enjoy fantasy movies, liked the book, or are just looking for a good movie to watch, I would strongly recommend this. If not for all the reasons I've listed above, but because of the amazing special effects, and rich storyline."
"tomimt","9","4","6","16 September 2008"," What are we willing to do for love?
","When a movie delivers you an emotional impact, other than pure loathing towards it, you know you're dealing with a well made story, that manages to play the right strings somewhere inside you. This was something that happened to me during ""Stardust"" when I noted tears bursting from my eyes while watching the love to be woven between a star and a man in midst of a fairytale written for adults.<br/><br/>It all begins, when a young boy crosses a barrier between fantasy and reality and arrives to a fair held in a field near the city he lives in. There he meets a girl, whom he fells instantly. 9 months from that, Dunstan (Ben Barnes, later on Nathaniel Parker as he gets older) gets a basket delivered to him. Inside this basket is a baby boy, Tristan (Charlie Cox), who's a result from his affair with the girl.<br/><br/>Later in life Tristan fells in love with a bit arrogant and selfish girl Victoria (Sienna Miller), to whom he promises to bring a falling star from behind the barrier wall. From this begins Tristans adventure for true love, as he's about to find out that the star is not what he thought.<br/><br/>""Stardust"" is filled with wonderful characters and actors. Michelle Pfeiffer does a wonderful role as a wicked witch who's after Yvaine's (Claire Danes) heart and Robert De Niro does humorous and quirky part as captain Shakespeare, a rowdy captain of lighting catchers.<br/><br/>Laced with beautiful soundtrack and rather stunning visuals ""Stardust"" is very well rounded up tale. The story written as a novel by Neil Gaiman works almost as well on a screen than it does on its original form. Definitely recommendable viewing."

","First things first to all you haters out there DO NOT COMPARE THE BOOK TO THE MOVIE OR VICE VERSA! They are two different entities people...movie makers cannot possibly put the details of a book in a movie. If you think you can, then you can start a revolution. So don't get so boo hooey when the movie is not like the book. Ahhh since i have that off my plate I can start by saying that this movie rocks. It is fairy tale/ fantasy extravaganza brought to life. Great acting, casting and effects all together. It is the story of a boy who becomes a man and is in essence a love story. And whether you like to admit or not there's is school girl in all of a us thats a sucker for a good love story =)). This story takes place in a town that holds a secret..a great wall separates them from an enchanted kingdom, where no one has ever dared to tread the kingdom of Stormhold. The story revolves around Tristan, a young man in love with a girl called Victoria who couldn't care less (we all heard that one before). A star falls from the sky when he tries to woo her and he promises to bring it back to her for her hand in marriage. The quest becomes and adventure full of magic, murder, corruption and looooove.The magical Kingdom of Stormhold has just lost their king the star that has fallen from the sky is of great importance. 3 powerful Witches (Pfifer who plays and excellent villain!) that crave youth and beauty are also after the star. So basically everyones after the star. I can go on and on but Ill stop here! Whats good about this movie is its not predictable, which is rare in this day an age. It is a rich tapestry which slowly unravels. Never a dull moment!"

","I was obviously quite keen to see this at the cinema, I missed it, but when I saw it on DVD I was pretty satisfied, a good film from writer/producer/director Matthew Vaughn (Layer Cake) and co-writer Jane Goldman, wife of Jonathan Ross. Basically in a countryside town there is a mysterious wall to apparently another world, and the Guard (Charlie and the Chocolate Factory's David Kelly) is not letting anyone pass, but Dunstan Thorn (Nathaniel Parker) tricked his way past him, into the magical world of Stormhold. Years later, his son Tristan (Charlie Cox) is doing the same to get a falling star for his love Victoria (Sienna Miller). When he gets there by black candle light, he lands in the star crater, and he meets the star, Yvaine (Claire Danes). The don't realise it, but others are after Yvaine also, because with her heart they obtain eternal youth and life. Evil witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) is one of these people, and her youth obtained from another star is wearing away as she uses more of her powers in her search for Tristan and Yvaine. The film is basically a long journey across this magical land, with Tristan and Yvaine bumping into witches, pirates, including Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Niro), and much more. Narrated by Sir Ian McKellen, and also starring Ricky Gervais as Ferdy the Fence, Peter O'Toole as King, Mark Strong as Septimus, Green Wing's Mark Heap as Tertius, Rupert Everett as Secundus, David Walliams as Sextus, Green Wing's Julian Rhind-Tutt as Quartus, Smack the Pony's Sarah Alexander as Empusa, Mark Williams as Billy and Dexter Fletcher as Skinny Pirate. A very good cast, some good special effects, and the Take That single ""Rule The World"" is fantastic, it was tipped for an Oscar nomination for Best Song, but it never received one (instead three for The Golden Compass, and the winner was for that Irish film Once). Very good!"

Michele Pfeiffer - oh what a makeup job they did on her! For one who is so pretty she interpreted ""ugly"", old, mean and decrepit really well. If it wasn't for Peter O'Toole's voice, I wouldn't have recognized him. The special effects were good and believable.

The star is eventually saved by Tristan, the riddle of his parentage solved and all is happy ever after. The journey is magical, the lead man is fluff but the rest of the cast, sp.

"deppj","8","4","6","25 October 2007"," Excellent fantasy film, a must see.
","I loved this film. Firstly, with the main set of actors being British, it brings a sense of realism into this fantasy story. With most films, American actors often come across badly, see through, and fake.But with Brits, they're more believable. That's why I think this film works. Danes does well in the part, her accent is very good, and she comes across well, Cox in his first major roll is excellent, and that goes for the rest of the Brit cast. Pheiffer is terrible I thought, her accent jumps a lot, and she's as wooden as ever, she has zero charisma and zero charm. The only reason I think they cast her is to make more American audiences see the film, as if DeNiro wasn't enough. A British actress would have been much better. As for DeNiro, I thought he was excellent, very funny in his roll. And as for the film as a whole, excellent, great soundtrack, storyline was good, and a lovely ending."

I've never been a one for witches and wizards, never been a Potter fan (probably something to do with making my name rather common), but this film was a perfect blend of humour, romance and magic. It is one of the few stories where I was not bored with the love connection, partly due to Claire Danes' ability to 'brighten' up all the romantic scenes. This movie was laugh out loud at times, which is very difficult thing to achieve with me. It looked like all the actors were having great fun making this film, and though not a Di Nero fan, in his role he was fantastic and showed versatility.

On the one hand Michelle Pfeiffer, one of Hollywoods best known actresses, gave a tremendous performance as the evil queen. Don't get me wrong this was a very good movie. The special effects were excellent, the costumes were good. One thing that I was not expecting was seeing Robert DeNiro cross dressing. That did not paint a very good mental picture for me. I like Bobby DeNiro, but could have casted someone else for that role. We are introduced to the man who will be playing young Prince Caspian in the upcoming Disney/Walden Media film The Chronicles of Narnia:Prince Caspain. Overall, Stardust did not bite the dust."

I haven't read the books these are based on but there are enough fresh ideas in this magical universe to keep the storytelling engrossing.<br/><br/>Kudos all round, this film manages to get it just right on almost every area that counts.

"fwomp","7","4","6","17 September 2007"," It Ain't The Princess Bride
","Having met and spoken to Mr. Gaiman about his writings and, specifically, about this film, I had extremely high hopes for it. For those not ""in-the-know,"" Neil Gaiman is the author of the novel STARDUST, as well as many other award-winning stories.<br/><br/>There's been a bit of buzz about comparisons between Stardust and THE PRINCESS BRIDE. And although I can see a few points, Stardust is really its own animal. This is both good and bad. The good comes from the fact that it's original and almost epic in scale. The bad is that it strikes a few funny chords only to reign itself back into serious territory where much of its umpf! is lost. The Princess Bride played off its ridiculous nature so well that you knew nothing was to be taken too seriously. It never went for the serious angle (much to watchers' delight). But Stardust loses quite a bit of its power by jumping back and forth, as well as having a beginning that lagged.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an honest retelling of Gaiman's Stardust novel, please don't go and see this. Just as if you enjoyed Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep by Philip K. Dick, I wouldn't expect that you'd go see BLADE RUNNER and applaud its accuracy to the novel. That is to say that both mediums have their good points, just try not to compare them too closely.<br/><br/>What we have here is a smidgin of Neil Gaiman's story taken out and revamped for movie audiences. And this is a good thing. Trying to be too strict to a novel's plot can stymie creativity when it comes to film time. Thankfully writer/director Matthew Vaughn realized this.<br/><br/>Although there are peeks into Gaiman's story, most of it is Hollywoodized to appeal to a larger audience. The mysterious town of Wall, the beauty of Star/Yvaine, the evilness that appears when sudden beauty arrives, etc. These are nice incorporations. Where it fell down a bit is the overly long opening which was used to describe the goings-on around Wall, the addition of certain characters/parts in order to add the ""blockbuster"" talent (which wasn't all bad), and the on-again off-again seriousness that went a bit too far.<br/><br/>The biggest letdown for me was the main protagonist Tristan (Charlie Cox, CASANOVA). His role wasn't the most inspiring. Unfortunately neither was the beautiful Star/Yvaine (Claire Danes, THE FAMILY STONE). She played just well enough to keep me watching her, but that was about it. The supporting cast held my attention MUCH better. The wily old man who guards the entrance/exit to Wall (David Kelly, CHARLIE AND THE CHOCOLATE FACTORY), the wickedly wicked witches  especially Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who plays the part so over-the-top as to be delicious  and how could we forget Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro, THE GOOD SHEPHERD), the flamboyant captain of a sky-ship who captures lightning like fish and keeps his cross-dressing secrets securely hidden in his closet. These supporting characters are what kept me engaged and they weren't what the story was about.<br/><br/>Comparisons aside, this is an okay film to check out, but don't let anyone fool you. This isn't The Princess Bride II.<br/><br/>For a better Gaiman adaption, try checking out MIRRORMASK."
"wondernat","9","4","6","30 August 2007"," The kind of romance you wished Hollywood would make more often
","I went into this movie with nothing but the lowest of expectations. I thought this was the worst marketing job ever for a major motion picture, but suffice to say that if you were likewise beguiled by the shoddy trailers and horrific title (""Stardust,"" for cryin' out loud!), you will not be disappointed by this movie! First of all, you have to know this is an adaptation of a pseudo-comic book. It's a book written for adults, albeit its illustrations. (You get to see exactly where and how Tristan was conceived in the book!) I haven't finished reading the book yet, but knowing it's an adaptation, I say the movie is wonderful in its own right. The first 30 minutes had me grunting and snorting (cheesy lines to the max!), but as it progressed, the story was truly engaging. The graphics were nothing short of marvelous, helping create the illusion of fantasy without sacrificing its inherent sense of danger and adventure.<br/><br/>As for the acting, I have to say that it's obvious that it took Claire Danes a while to get comfortable in her role. There were many scenes in the beginning that I KNEW were supposed to be for comic-relief but weren't because she missed her mark quite a bit. However, this falls into the first 30 minutes I commented on earlier and easily overlooked. Charlie Cox too was a bit annoying, but you get used to the guy -- he comes off as believable as a naive, adventure-seeking romantic.<br/><br/>And the romance... it was such a cute story! This is where using the fantastic helps bring out the HUMAN not the metaphysical (ironically). The chemistry between Danes and Cox was absolutely charming, and I have to say it's largely due to them that this movie works as a romance.<br/><br/>A note on the POSITIVE queer portrayals (for once in a huge blockbuster like this!). Robert De Niro in drag? WOW!! I guess a lifetime of playing the tough guy really began to bore him! I wasn't too convinced by his stereotypical portrayal of a gay man (dood, Rupert Everett was on the set!), but seeing him in drag and struttin' his thang -- bonus points!! For the parents: there is a lot of blatant deaths and pointless violence, but thank goodness it's all kept off-camera. <br/><br/>This is definitely a movie for the progressive family and the love birds."

","So it's lurking way down the chart at the box office... So it's not flying at you from every angle in the form of trailers, TV spots, pop-up ads or street posters... So it's not one of the worlds most famous fantasy novels... But blimey it's a good film! Fast paced, snappy dialogue, exquisite setting, tongue in cheek humour, solid acting and, of course, the ever radiant Claire Danes. Layer all of that icing on top of the cake that is an uncommonly original story and it truly is amazing that more people aren't turning up in droves.<br/><br/>I'm assuming that everybody has seen Superbad and the Bourne Ultimatum by now. Assuming that, I strongly suggest skipping spots 3-7 on the top ten list and heading straight for this ""diamond in the rough"" at number 8.

","Neil Gaiman is at his best in Sandman and with Pratchett in Good Omens. He's a wonderful writer, but I didn't like Stardust nearly as much as some of his other work. So this film was a pleasant surprise -- one of the very few screenplays that actually surpass the original material. It's fair to say that the typical movie based on a book tends to fall far below the bar set by the book, but this is clearly the opposite.<br/><br/>I hope Neil is happy with this adaption, because it brings out the best of the book. The casting is a pure joy, the directing has a light but steady hand, the pacing was perfect, and the special effects were not overwhelming. The film somehow managed to balance several genres at once without becoming smug about it.<br/><br/>An unexpected and lovely pleasure.<br/><br/>It's a pity the marketing for this film has been so poor, because by all rights this film should be doing much better at the box office than it has so far."

","Very pleasantly surprised by the movie -- it has steady pacing that neither drags nor speeds, and I found the story engrossing even if it is a fairy tale of sorts. Set design and art direction are perfect, as are the key characters... and how great is it to finally have a movie worth seeing that isn't a sequel to something else?! I do fear they've mis-pitched this movie in recent weeks, as it's as much a movie for the pre-teen crowd as anything else pushed directly at them, but like all really good family movies (Princess Bride comes to mind), adults will find plenty to like in Stardust as well -- which probably explains the recent ads and their 'more-grown-up' feel about the film.

When Robert Di Nero is not convincing one points at the writer, director or both. The hero is weak and does not inspire an empathy from the viewer...also he is pretty stupid not to be amazed that an actual star is a beautiful girl.

This will make sense to people familiar with Neil Gaiman's work, because he seems to take a lot of joy in odd little things. After seeing the movie, you just know the humour played out ten times better in the book, but at least they were *trying* to entertain us.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A story with a beginning, a middle, and an end, even if it's all seemingly recycled.

It's so great to see her in movies again that one is led to believe that she is the actual ""star"" in this cast. I also happen to love Claire Danes, but I think the chemistry was off here. She could glow *without* any special effects, but I think she was just misdirected in this movie.</li></ul><br/><br/>What didn't work in Stardust:<br/><br/><ul><li>That same sense of humour that makes the story memorable is often just plain sad and unfunny.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Stardust avoids ever having a point or hitting home on any of the moments that must have been good in the book. It makes you want to go read the book just to see how badly they messed it up. You can tell this was a sarcastic story in print, with a subtle mix of humour and romance. The movie never finds a balance; it just flops back and forth like a broken tennis ball... not very satisfying to watch.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The special effects shots are pointless and uninspired. We've seen it all before, too many times. I find it hard to imagine that any of the kids in the audience were looking on in awe. I think most of them were just thinking ""get on with it"", like I was. If the filmmakers can't summon a sense of wonder, they shouldn't be making these types of movies.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A weak plot. The main character is just getting pitched around from place to place. There are the elements of a story here, but without any flow. Most of the characters' growth is *implied*. This would be okay if the whole movie functioned as ""a story about a story"" like Princess Bride, but it doesn't. They actually try to be serious with this most of the time, and that makes it come off as very unsubstantial. I was moved once, and only once, by Michelle Pfeiffer's character near the end, and she was the *villain*.</li></ul><br/><br/>Stardust is a rental for a very boring night.

"lymond01","6","7","13","17 August 2007"," Original story, lame presentation
","Movies must be difficult to make. I think this is true because, given an original story, a decent cast of likable characters, and a book to work from, this movie still fails in most regards. While the dialogue, even the humor and ""wit"", was fairly weak and seemed like the writer was trying too hard, it was the actual shooting that hurt the film.<br/><br/>Camera angles, lighting, timing of cuts, length of a scene, music, continuity...the film seemed like it was directed by an amateur film maker. The scenes were (mostly) the bare minimum to get the point across - very little dramatic work, and in a fairy tale type romance movie, you want something dramatic, epic.<br/><br/>This film drew early comparisons to the Princess Bride. Stardust is a romantic fantasy with a crazy cast of characters, fencing, fighting, pirates, witches, true love. But the writing and the scene-crafting in the Princess Bride were works of art, and Stardust seems a little too raw -- overblown sarcasm when subtle wit was needed, or the camera focused too briefly on an amusing look by a ghost.<br/><br/>Again, kudos for, finally, an original fantasy story hitting the theatres (instead of sequel upon sequel) and it was a good one. I can imagine the book was much better though."
"Quicksand","7","7","13","12 August 2007"," Earth to Director: Stick with Directing
","I had a longer thing here, but ultimately this movie isn't worth that many words. It can be summed up in just a few, actually: Matthew Vaughn, longtime producer, directed the movie ""Layer Cake."" Nice debut.<br/><br/>For some reason, afterwards, he decided he was a screenwriter too. He isn't.<br/><br/>His screen writing partner is someone with no writing to her credit, and according to the IMDb seems to be little more than a TV personality. Their screenplay is awful, trite, simplistic and condescending, but you can still see the starlight of a brilliant book (which I have not read) shining through.<br/><br/>The actors mostly bring their A-game. Claire Danes is passable, but isn't a star (either within or outside the movie), and has a horrible British accent. Robert Deniro doesn't even attempt an accent, so at least he's playing to his strengths (sort of). Name actors are given very little to do, and no-name actors are given huge parts to play. The results are mixed.<br/><br/>I did enjoy the movie while I was watching it, but afterwards I had time to ask questions. Questions like ""why the heck was there only one guard on the wall 24-hours a day? didn't he have back-up?"" or, ""Why the heck did they cast three younger actresses to play the old witches, and only one (Michelle Pfeiffer) is ever seen as herself? Why not just cast 2 older actresses and save on the wrinkled latex?"" It's incredibly sloppy construction, but Vaughn wanted to add to his audition reel, I guess, and hung his fancy suburban home (er, flat) on the blueprints of a Beverly Hills mansion. This is a C-minus movie that should have been an A+.<br/><br/>Just because you can direct a film does not mean you can write a screenplay. See also ""Spider-Man 3."" In the case of ""Stardust,"" I heard the book was phenomenal, and the Neil Gaiman I've read defies description.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't. It's just pretty okay. See you at the library."
"jdesando","Null","7","13","7 August 2007"," You get it both ways.
","In Stardust, you get it both ways: Michele Pfeiffer as a several hundred years old witch and Michele Pfeiffer as a stunningly-youthful 49 years or so of her real face but still a witch. This fantasy-fiction adaptation has a similar bipolarity: The romance of Tristan (Charlie Cox) and Yvaine (Claire Danes) in a strangely magical kingdom just beyond the town Wall's wall is part naïve Princess Bride, part degenerate Pirates of the Caribbean, and a modicum of Lady in the Water.(Tristan has made a promise to his love that he'll catch a falling star by venturing over the wall into the kingdom.) <br/><br/>Mind you, I enjoyed the childlike part and the raunchy in equal measure with a unicorn and a man turned mouse on one side and a pirate in drag on the other (Robert De Niro as Shakespeare). I'm just not sure who besides me as man/boy will be attracted to this layered fairy tale. The computer graphics are not the most stunning of the year (a positive condition for those of us surfeited with CGI)), the flying ship hardly realistic, but Michele Pfeiffer's aging body does show some sophisticated effects.<br/><br/>Supporting the bipolar air of Stardust is Claire Danes in the titular role (Yvaine is a star landing on earth in the form of an attractive young woman). Danes is an off beauty with a unique smile allowing her to emphasize the ironic with some sardonic turns. Danes just seems too intelligent and is too old (She is the most mature looking and acting 28 year old in Hollywood) to be playing against immature 25 year old Charlie Fox.<br/><br/>Yet all the inconsistencies work because the film is essentially intelligent and relatively unadorned. It is interested in the choices young people make (Tristan's initial pursuit of a selfish girlfriend is not suited to him; Shakespeare is bluff and tortured about his cross dressing).<br/><br/>So let the pixie dust or stardust or whatever shine on you and enjoy a shower of impressions not always logical but usually delightful. Things are not always as they appear."

It was visually beautiful on screen, the actors were all perfectly cast, from big name stars to people I'd never heard of, and the story was compelling and original. It might be a bit much for younger children, as the evil of the villains is very clearly portrayed.<br/><br/>This is hands down the best movie I have seen this year (sorry ""Knocked Up"", you had a good run). See it once, see it twice, tell your friends, pre-order the DVD. You will not be disappointed, unless you happen to hate movies with humor, romance, action, adventure, drama, or fantasy.

","What a wonderful, fanciful movie ""Stardust"" is.<br/><br/>I could easily end it with that one statement and suffice to say, one could take it as a very strong recommendation to go see it.<br/><br/>At a time when Hollywood seems bent on forcing remakes and sequels down our throats, ""Stardust"" makes us remember why we go to the movies in the first place - to escape reality for a couple of hours and explore other lives, other times, or other planets. Ironically, ""Stardust"" takes us to all three places effortlessly and with a childlike glee we all long for.<br/><br/>""Stardust"" is full of all the characters we remember as children: princes, witches, pirates, ghosts and scoundrels. It has the damsel in distress, the hero, the rogues, the obstacles, spells, antidotes, charms, and even a touch of light-speed to make it quasi modern.<br/><br/>""Stardust"" is about a man from the town of Wall, which is conveniently situated next to a wall that separates their town from a magical kingdom. The only way past the wall is through a breech that is diligently guarded by a scruffy old codger (played wonderfully by David Kelly). One day a young man from Wall named Ben Barnes out maneuvers the old guard and escapes through the breech. He happens upon an enchanted kingdom called Stormhold where he meets a chained (and very sexy) young lady named Una. She is held captive by a witch and leashed by an unbreakable chain. While the witch is away, Una seduces Ben and sends him on his way. Ben returns to Wall without incident and continues his life. But nine months later he is summoned to the wall breech where the old guard hands him what you might expect - a baby boy.<br/><br/>The boy, named Tristan grows up to be a rather hapless young man (Charlie Cox) who is smitten with a girl way out of his league and also betrothed to another. Nevertheless, the young lady (named Victoria and played Sienna Miller) goes out once with Tristain and he confesses his love to her. After they espy a falling star, she tells him he can have her if he retrieves the star and brings it back to her. He agrees and sets out on his quest, which will take him to the other side of the wall.<br/><br/>Meanwhile in the kingdom of Stormhold, the old king (perfectly played by Peter O'Toole) is dying. He calls his remaining living sons to tell them who shall succeed him to the throne. His sons' names are Primus, Secondus, Sextmus, and Septimus. The other sons where killed by the other brothers in a humorous competition to see who lives to get the throne.<br/><br/>Anyway, he tosses his ruby charm to the sky and Voila, that what brings the star to earth.<br/><br/>The star crashes in the form of a beautiful woman named Yvaine (Clare Danes) and she, of course, is wearing the charm. But little does she know she is now being persuaded by Tristain, the Princes, and also an aging witch named Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) who wants to cut out the stars heart to regain her own youth.<br/><br/>Complicated? Yes. But it all comes together as the adventure unfolds.<br/><br/>Tristain is the first to find Yvaine but is so blinded by his devotion to Victoria he doesn't recognize the growing bond between he and Yvaine. His initial interest lie only in returning Yvaine to Victoria as proof of his love. But he must get past the princes and Lamia first. The princes aren't that big an issue as they are constantly trying to kill each other - and just as in ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" - never has death been so funny. <br/><br/>But Tristain also encounters the witch who enslaved his mother (though he doesn't know it's his mother) and a band of flying pirates led by Robert DeNiro.<br/><br/>His is the most important character in the movie and DeNiro plays it to a tee. He steals the movie with his toughness and soon we learn an undercover secret that will leave audiences on the floor with laughter. Though his role is small in length, DeNiro is extraordinary!<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer is wonderful as Lamia - a sexy evil witch. Claire Danes is most appropriate as the confused and distressed Yvaine. She makes a perfect damsel. Jason Flemyng, Adam Buston, Rupert Everett, and Mark Strong add the perfect dose of levity as the fighting princes whom, as they die return as ghosts ala ""Blithe Spirit"" and ""High Spirits"".<br/><br/>Moreover director Matthew Vaughn, whose only other directing experience was ""Layer Cake"", weaves an enchanting tale that everyone will enjoy.<br/><br/>""Stardust"" may be too complex for young children, but anyone over the age of 13 will want to see this movie multiple times. It's that good. ""Stardust"" is what movies are supposed to be. Perfectly written, perfectly cast, perfectly directed, and perfectly acted. In other words...perfect."

I mean, seriously- dude goes through hole in wall, bangs hot chick on the other side, has a baby delivery nine months later, and doesn't even freak? Not even just a bit? No crossing back over to the moms like ""WTF is this?"" Then we get this droop Tristan kid, who lets Victoria walk all over him, I mean, dude's a complete doormat. I'm supposed to believe a week on a ship with a cross-dressing, fan-waving Bobby DeNiro turns this guy into a hero? Yes, they have Robert ""Vito Corleone/The Taxi Driver"" DeNiro skipping around in a dress singing showtunes. About the only definable story line and shining role was Michelle Pfieffer's witch. The rest of it was a jumbled mess. Both DeNiro and Pfieffer should be ashamed of this. Academy Awards need to be returned. Claire Danes was hot, as always, but seriously. If she could just ""shine"" and blow up the witches, why not get on that a bit sooner, hmm? Tristan's moms didn't age a bit from getting banged by his pops to him being a grown man. And how come she didn't pack up the old hag she was attached to and haul a$$ like that earlier, since, you know, she could have done that whenever and stepped through the wall where her little chain wouldn't exist. Way to go. Tristan never even had to fight anybody. He let some animals loose, and they just ate a witch, and left. Skinny, hungry animals (i.e. wolves) just left without going for fresh meat right there. The witch produces a voodoo doll from nowhere when Tristan's uncle shows up to fight over the star? And ""drowns"" him without a fight? See, now I'm getting just as random as this crazy film. One has to wonder if, in the editing room, they realized it was crap and started throwing in extra effects to fool decent people into thinking this was more than garbage that should have gone straight to DVD. Not to mention this had to be screened and approved by someone who actually thought it was a good idea (or they were hoping Pfieffer's theatrical return with Bobby DeNiro's name might carry it). And they wonder why ticket sales are down most of the year. I like movies like Princess Bride, the Dark Crystal, Labyrinth, going on to Star Wars, etc. But this film was ridiculous. I had to ask Blockbuster if they refunded time, because this was one of the biggest wastes of it I have ever had the displeasure of having to endure. It quite literally gave me a headache. Skip it if you expect coherent story lines or a classic. Even my Harry Potter loving fiancé was horrified at DeNiro in a dress and how ridiculously convenient everything turned out to be for our hero to ""win"" without ever fighting. And one last thing: how in God's name did Humphrey and Victoria end up in Magicland for the crowning ceremony? I mean, come on. No wonder people in other countries think Americans are dumb. Dreck like this with an 8.1? It belongs down with Cool as Ice and Who's Your Caddy. It's that bad."

The cinematography at times along with the musical score, and special effects have a similar feel to the Lord of the Rings. However, such grandiosity, which one can admire, unfortunately, does not seem to come together with other moments of inadequacy. I felt at times that I was not watching a film made for cinema, at certain moments it felt like a film-for-television, which was a real shame.<br/><br/>The story has potential and indeed some elements were highly watchable and original. Robert De Niro performs well in his role as an air-captain, while Michelle Pfeiffer is pretty scary as a witch in search of eternal youth. But potential is no good if you don't use it well and it tires a long-time before the end.<br/><br/>Stardust isn't bad, but considering the potential strength of the story, some of the very good special effects and cinematography it really feels as though it punches below its heavyweight potential, and for that Stardust disappoints."

","You have to be quite mundane not to love a movie that contains humor, love, lightning-catching pirates, heroes, villains, magic, and fantasy. ""Stardust"" has it all. Based on Neil Gaiman's must-read novel, ""Stardust"" tells the tale of how 18-year-old Tristran Thorn becomes a man after he vows to bring back a fallen star to the woman he's infatuated with as a token of his love for her. The girl agrees that if he retrieves the star from the magical kingdom separated from them by a huge wall within a week's time, she will marry him. With this promise in mind, Tristran sets out on the adventure that will change his life and his mind about what it means to truly love someone. <br/><br/>Finally, a movie that teaches a message along with being truly entertaining. Not only do we get to witness Matthew Vaughn's great cinematography and directing, but the whole concept for this film was delightful. They had the author's okay on any changes they made during the book-to-script transfer, which keeps one feeling that the integrity of the story was kept in place. The script is clever and funny without being dirty or crude. The audience has no confusion over which characters are bad and which are good. The values that are held by the heroic models are wholesome and worthy. Those held by the villains are detestable and inappropriate. <br/><br/>It is impossible to put in a few short paragraphs how excellent this movie was all around. Charlie Cox and Claire Daines were beautiful together; their acting styles and chemistry melded perfectly. Michelle Pfeiffer was convincingly evil and delightfully poisonous; Robert DeNiro was shockingly non-gangster, and the supporting cast didn't miss a beat.

It was also predictable which isn't a problem since I've had enough silly plot twists for a lifetime.<br/><br/>I thought the ghosts were hilarious and there was plenty of humor to go around.<br/><br/>Overall I gave this a 10 for nice special effects, moving story, and for being original. Since watching this movie I want to pick up the book and check it out! I think everyone who is into fantasy movies should at least check it out."
"act7-1","10","4","7","19 August 2007"," when was the last time you wished upon a star?
","I definitely agree that the trailers for this film don't do it much justice. I went in expecting to watch a children's tale similar to Narnia, but I was pleasantly surprised with the humor and poignancy of the story.<br/><br/>How could you go wrong casting Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro in a film, right? But it was Claire Danes that gave a memorable performance as Yvaine. For a moment, she makes us believe that true love does exist. And it is able to put a glow in someone's life.<br/><br/>I haven't read the novel (by Neil Gaiman) that this movie is based on, but I'm sure there are a lot more nuances to the story than the movie is able to show. Topics like pretending to be who you aren't, infatuation, conditional vs. unconditional love, family.<br/><br/>All of these plot undercurrents are cast against the backdrop of a world where magic and fantasy are merely separated by a stone wall. I really admire the author and screenwriter for not taking this story too far. For not introducing dozens of characters that don't get the proper depth in a movie. And mostly for giving us a fun sense of wonderment when we look up into the night sky and see a particularly brilliant star."

"wilywilliam","9","3","5","8 March 2010"," Get carried away
","I caught this film on terrestrial TV in the UK last night. For all you non-UK readers, terrestrial TV in this country leaves a lot to be desired. Sure, there are nuggets of gold, but you can't rely on top quality viewing every night of the week. So when I stumbled upon this movie, I though ""let's give it a go."" I'm very glad I did! I was glued to my seat. And for two and a half hours (including ads), that's a very good sign.<br/><br/>So whenever I see a movie that I either really love or really hate, I come onto IMDb, see what other people thought and sometimes give a review. I just couldn't believe the negative reviews, so felt compelled to review this movie and give my reasons for the positive score.<br/><br/>Fisrtly, I think all those who ""read the book; hated the movie"" should get over themselves. This is a pet peeve of mine. If you ever fall in love with a book, either (a) Don't watch the movie - it WILL be different, or (b) Watch the movie with an open mind, expecting it to be different. For what it's worth, I've never read the book, but now I might (and get this, if it's different from the film, I won't go writing negative reviews on book forums!).<br/><br/>Those who just hated the film. It seems that, from the language used in your reviews, you should, like, totally grow up or something. Okay, maybe I'm getting a bit personal here. Everyone is entitled to their views, so to get back on track, this is why I liked the film.<br/><br/>Story/plot: Far fetched, sure. Borrows from other stories, guilty. A few holes, maybe. But still magical, engaging and heartwarming. If you want a hard-hitting, realistic thriller don't watch this movie. Simple. But if you want to forget about things and just enjoy some lovely silliness, and some good old-fashioned romanticism, then this movie is for you.<br/><br/>Acting: Well, you can put your RADA critiquing hat on and rip everyone to shreds, or else you can just get lost in the movie and allow the more-than-adequate turns to carry you along to the movie's climax. I though the ensemble did a great job.<br/><br/>Score/Cinematography: Almost invisible in the background, but doing enough to bring the magic on the screen to life. Sure, I'm not going to remember either to my dying days, but then sometimes it's nice to allow a score/visual to just carry us along for the ride. Subtlety was king here.<br/><br/>So all in all, in case you haven't guessed, I loved this movie. In it's field (if you'll pardon the pun), I think it stands alone as an outright bobby dazzler. If you're like me and prefer to go into a movie with no preconceptions, then give this one a go. You might not like it, but if you let yourself go, you more than likely will."
"CheyenneWag09","10","3","5","19 February 2009"," Amazing but overlooked
","The weekend this came out was the same as Rush Hour 3 (which I'm a huge fan of the series) so when my buddy suggested we go see it I was skeptical. Yet this was definitely in the top two movies of summer 07 and it goes in my top 25 movies. This movie has everything a good movie should. Action, romance, suspense and best of all, humor. The only thing that disappointed me about this movie was that it was overlooked by the broad spectrum of movie goers. In a summer with such hits as The Bourne Ultimatum, Spider-Man 3 and as i previously stated, Rush Hour 3, it sorta fell to the bottom of peoples to see lists. I believe that people that aren't fans of fantasy movies will greatly enjoy this flick. This is not your typical fantasy movie such as Lord Of The Rings and Harry Potter. Don't be fooled into being convinced it is such. With an amazing cast and a great directorial flow it is a definite must see. I will have to read the book now that have immensely enjoyed the movie."
"ridiculonius","10","3","5","12 September 2008"," You'd Better Believe it's Better than the Book!
","I bought the book Stardust after seeing a trailer for the movie; I had previously glanced over the novel in bookstores but never bought it, however, the trailer was so well-done I thought I'd better read it before the film came out. I was pleased with the plot, but everything else was sadly lacking - it seemed half-finished, almost like an early draft as far as character development goes. And, though it is supposed to be a romantic fairy tale, the primary romance is bordering on non-existent until the last couple of chapters; the climax was HORRIBLY boring and the novel was much too much too short. When I rented the movie I wasn't entirely sure if I'd like it, as films are never as good as the book and the book, for me, was wanting.<br/><br/>Oh, joy! The movie rocked!<br/><br/>Personally, I think that the actors were all chosen perfectly and that the director did a superb job with the sets and costumes and (most important for me) improving the climactic scenes tenfold. And, even aside from comparisons, the film was, on it's own, brilliant and thoroughly enjoyable. <br/><br/>The story begins in the English village of Wall, where a wall (no duh) that is guarded 24/7 is the only barrier between our world and the magical world of Stormhold. In the beginning, Dunstan Thorne travels over the wall to go sight-seeing in a magical marketplace, where he meets a mysterious slave-girl who claims to be a princess. They spend a few secluded hours together, and then Dunstan leaves. Nine months later, a baby is left for him at the wall, with a note saying that it is his son, Tristan.<br/><br/>18 years later, Tristan is in love with a girl called Victoria, who constantly slights him for Humphrey, a suave and sophisticated bully. But Tristan still persists, until he swears to bring Victoria a fallen star in exchange for her hand in marriage. She consents, and Tristan crosses the wall and finds his prize, only to discover that in Stormhold,stars aren't clumps of rock or gas, but celestial beings - and that he now has to deal with the feisty and beautiful Yvaine, instead of an inanimate object.<br/><br/>On top of that, three witches are searching for the star so they can cut out her heart and eat it, to regain their lost youth and beauty, and two princes are involved in a race to the death for the necklace Yvaine carries, for whomever can turn it red again is king of Stormhold. Soon, Tristan and the star are not only running back to Wall, but running for their lives. <br/><br/>I suggest reading the book first, only so that you may truly see how it differs - perhaps you will agree with me, perhaps not, but either way, it's a terrific, fun, must-see!"
"jpschapira","8","3","5","12 August 2008"," Magic again
","Our life continues and we keep on watching films about magical words, far away from reality but with another reality altogether. I haven't seen all the most recent ones, and I won't mention them. Should we worry about all of this similar tales based on novels? Are we tired? I don't have the answer, but I also don't know how filmmaker keep coming across books and novels and take them to the screen. Maybe writers should stop writing for a while, but then again I never care about finding out if the novel a movie's based on is a recent one. Maybe most of them are old. <br/><br/>Of the films of the type that are not so recent, ""The Golden Compass"" is one of my favorites, and it presents magical elements in the reality we meet when it begins. In ""The Chronichles of Narnia"", what divides reality from fantasy is a wardrobe; in the amazing ""Bridge to Terabithia"" it's this bridge; in ""Stardust"" (based on a novel by Neil Gaiman) it's a wall. <br/><br/>""Stardust"", directed by Matthew Vaughn (in another one of those challenges some directors take by doing something they've never done before) and adapted by Vaughn and Jane Goldman, however, has a difference with the other two films: its hero, Tristan (the natural Charlie Cox), is not a kid. He has 18 years old and possesses the maturity to deal with the destiny prepared for him. From the start (an this is among the film's positive aspects), even before we meet Tristan-when we his father, who also crosses the 'wall' and spends the night with who would be Tristan's mother-we are liberated from the usual surprise kids usually experience when they find magical elements in these films. <br/><br/>Tristan is surprised when he meets Yvaine, (Claire Danes, with a great British accent) a girl who is actually a star, but in his face we don't see the wonder of Lyra when using the golden compass, nor the wonder of Lucy when she finds herself standing in snow after closing the wardrobe, if you know what I mean. Therefore, the technical team isn't very worried about wooing us, or so I believe. <br/><br/>Because magic doesn't feel so magical for the one individual that needs to transmit it to us, the magic in ""Stardust"" comes from another place: characters and relationships. Unlike some of the constant jumps from one part of the story to another in ""The Golden Compass"", ""Stardust"" stays most of the time close to Tristan, focusing on his adventure and the people he meets along the way.<br/><br/>First, there's Yvaine, the hero's love interest, played by Claire Danes with a sweetness we're not used to see in her. She's a serious, independent actress; and what she achieves here shows how wide her range is (even if some of us already knew that). Then there's Lamia, a selfish witch played with mischief by Michelle Pfeiffer; the greedy prince Septimus (Mark Strong), who would do anything to be king; and Captain Shakespeare (a delightful Robert De Niro), who hides a predictable secret. <br/><br/>There are others of course, and they are all developed enough for a movie like this one. I won't tell you which role each of them plays in the story (of which I've mentioned almost nothing), because there's also a certain charm to it. But believe me when I tell you that you'll become so involved with the characters that in the end it will be just like a romantic comedy or, more fit for this matter, a classic love story in which you're waiting for Prince Charming to come and save the Princess; whether with a kiss or by getting rid of everyone in his way. <br/><br/>Don't doubt for any second that this is how it will be, and you'll forget any trespasses."

","I went into Stardust today expecting a decent, entertaining movie, but if I am very honest I wasn't expecting a masterpiece. The trailers looks fun, the storyline sounded interesting and the big names in the case obviously made me a bit more excited. But as I sat down with my friend, the only friend of mine who would watch it, I was expecting just a light, easy movie. And that is what I got, a light, easygoing movie. Its a nice movie, its a movie with magic, evil villains, dashing heroes, heroins in need of rescue and all that other traditional stuff. This is a fantasy movie that is just so enchanting that I guarantee you cannot help but leave the cinema with a huge smile on your face. Sure there is a bit at the three quarter mark the quality sags slightly, but the ending more than redeems things and the rest of the movie beforehand is as perfect as you could ever hope for. The movie works so well because its a perfect blend of fantasy, romance, action and comedy all into one. In many ways I can see this as a new Pirates of the Caribbean, it has the exact same mode, and believe it or not there is a new pirate threatening to steals Johnny Depp's thunder. And that man is Robert DeNiro, in his best performance in ages! The effects might not be to the big Hollywood standards, but they are passable, and besides the scenery is so beautiful you don't actually care. I never though that England could look as good as New Zealand until today! <br/><br/>So first on with the cast, and there are some big names to mention here. But first there is the newcomer, Charlie Cox taking on leading man duties. I expected Cox to flounder to be honest, most newcomers when put on the screen with the likes of Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro are shunned aside and just there to propel the plot. However, Cox actually proves he has a huge amount of talent and is a very likable person. Of course he's overshadowed when the greats are on the screen, but he more than holds his own for the majority of the time. Also he does comedy with great aplomb, and in general he seems just a great talent that I hope to see in more movies. Claire Danes, of Terminator 3 fame, sorry that's all I know her from, does a pretty decent job as the actual Star from the title. At first she doesn't seem to be that great, her character seems a little bit irritating to be honest, but towards the end she does really grow on you, and its surprising to find that you actually care for her. However, the real star of the movie for me has to be Michelle Pfeiffer as the evil witch Lania. I thought she was impressive in Hairspray, however her villain performance in that seems more preparation for Stardust than anything else. She literally chews the scenery and spits out her lines with a real venom. This is one of her best performances of her career and she is a true joy to watch. Another big surprise is just how good Robert DeNiro is in this movie, and what's better is just how surprising his character is. I don't want to ruin his character as its just too much fun, and he definitely has the best scene in the movie. Mark Strong plays the role of Prince Septimus very well and has a few great moments, especially a very good bit near the end. Special mentions must go the Ian Mckellen who narrates, sorry I had to mention him as he's my favourite actor of all time, Sienna Miller and Peter O'Toole. Oh and Ricky Gervais is in it, very briefly I might add to people who really dislike him.<br/><br/>The key however to Stardust's perfection is the storyline and comedy really. The storyline itself is a bit more multi-layered than I expected. In many ways it follows three plots at once. Firstly there is Tristan and Yvaine's story to get back to The Wall, secondly there is the princes story who I won't ruin and finally there is Larnia's quest to find the star to restore her eternal youth. Along the way their stories coincide and they meet interesting and bizarre characters. This storyline, while pretty simplistic and kid friendly, just works because of its simplicity, its just nice and easy to follow. The nice blend of comedy to lighten proceedings makes things all the better, in fact there are many surprisingly funny moments in the movie. Also, to be honest I am amazed this got a PG rating, there are some pretty violent moments for kids, especially towards the ending, and also some of the jokes might be a bit raunchy for the little kids. But that's a mere quibble. There are a couple of pretty impressive action set pieces to balance the humour. A very impressive sequence involves Larnia's trap in an inn, that scene is superbly executed, and the final big battle, which I won't spoil, there are various parts to the battle, all of which are perfect.<br/><br/>So any flaws? As I've mentions the movie does sag a bit at the three quarters bit, unsurprisingly enough its the bit when we see the least of Larnia. But when the movie threatens to drag thankfully the ending comes in sight and the superb ending arrives to save the movie. In terms of entertainment this is the best movie I have seen all year. Funny, action packed and entertaining. This is about as perfect a movie for Half Term you could ever wish for and is certainly a movie I shall watch again and again. You have to see this movie as it truly is a magical experience!"
"greenylennon","8","3","5","16 October 2007"," Stardust
","Stardust is really, really magical. More than the whole Harry Potter series, because you can feel the weariness and the desire to hit the box-office more than they can in Harry Potter movies, while in Stardust all comes from the heart and all is heartfelt. And the viewers feel that: the movie theatre was nearly empty (apart from me and my friends, and some lustful couples), but near the end we all burst into an applause.<br/><br/>I think the best actor-actress here has been Michelle Pfeiffer. Villain without redemption, she portrays perfectly the bitchy witch Lamia, and probably she's even prettier than Claire Danes and Sienna Miller, although Mrs. Pfeiffer is nearly 50-something. Charlie Cox won't be a great movie star, but a good actor; Robert De Niro is funny, funny, funny, funny (my friend Federica and me couldn't stop laughing); Claire Danes is a bit false, but works as the falling star Yvaine; Sienna Miller appears for few scenes, and it's better this way: I can't stand her! Costumes, sets, cinematography, all first-rate, not like the computer graphics; to make up for it, we have what an American film fantasy can't offer: good actors, valid screenplay, imaginative direction.<br/><br/>I hope they won't do a sequel or a prequel so Stardust won't be spoiled, but Neil Gaiman didn't write a second book and we can heave a sigh of relief."

","When I read the description of this film I truly expected to hate it with a passion. Then I saw the trailers.<br/><br/>Unlike most films where if you've seen the trailer you've already seen the best bits, Stardust has a lot more to offer than just it's trailer contents. A LOT more.<br/><br/>Running over 2 hours if it's supposed to be a movie for kids then they are going to fidget through this. It's overly long for the sake of it in places. Based on a book by Neil Gaiman I assume the film is long to stay as true to the book as possible.<br/><br/>Surely they should know you have to cut a lot for pacing. There are a lot of big names attached to this although the main 2 lead parts are played by unknowns (to me at least). You can tell this was a film that Terry Gilliam should have done (he turned it down) but it doesn't suffer for his absence.<br/><br/>Take all the Gilliam classics like Time Bandits, Brazil, Fisher King & Baron Munchausen and this film would easily slot right in there with that very excellent and extremely prestigious company.<br/><br/>It has all the makings of a cult classic but could very easily do extremely well in cinemas as well.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer plays a wicked witch very well, Peter O'Tooler as a dying king, Robert De Niro as the very camp pirate. There are many recognizable faces especially for the British audience like Ricky Gervais and several of the deceased brothers.<br/><br/>The effects and locations are fantastic. The film is only spoiled by how long it is and would truly benefit from a harsh cutting of about 20 minutes or so.<br/><br/>Still it is a very enjoyable movie which will stand up well to several viewings."
"prandtauer","10","3","5","7 October 2007"," Original, unconventional and great humor.
","Unlike most of Fairy Tales StarDust is a little unorthodox. The character Yvainne is not the typical angelic princess in distress. She is a spirituous and clever girl. Tristan is also an unconventional character for the place he holds in the story. In the beginning of the story he is a shy and somewhat clumsy young boy who will eventually become more mature by strength of circumstances. The King of Stormhold and the so-called Princes are ruthless and insensible creatures who will stop at nothing to complete their goals (with the exception of one or two, perhaps). Stardust is worth a lot by its unconventional story and characters. It is probably one of the best of it's kind of the last few years."
"iainwatson","9","3","5","3 October 2007"," A stunning surprise
","Stardust - Tristan (Charlie Cox) is a young dreamer in olden days England, obsessed by Victoria (Sienna Millar). They see a shooting star crashing to earth and Victoria promises to marry Tristan if he can bring it to her. He goes to find it and crosses a wall where normality ceases and the land of the surreal and bizarre come to life. He finds the fallen star in the shapely form of Yvaine (Claire Danes) and starts a quest to take her back to Victoria. However a battle is taking place for the kingship of the land, and the princes fighting for it need the ruby around Yvaines neck that the king flung into space and that caused her to crash land. Also hunting her is the evil witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her evil sisters who want to cut out her heart and consume it to retain their eternal youth.<br/><br/>It goes full steam ahead from the great opening, right to the best ending for a film I've seen in ages. With a massive A-list ensemble cast and a veritable who's-who of British acting talent almost without exception giving fantastic performances. Pfeiffer in particular brings a depth to Lamia that makes you hate the character and want to see her get her comeuppance. Newcomer Cox seems a bit wooden at first, and up against acting royalty he looks a bit out of his depth, but I soon warmed to him as his character changes through the film and he seems to embrace Tristan's burgeoning confidence.<br/><br/>I admit that I was extremely sceptical of the film when I started watching it, but I was completely won over after the first half hour. Stardust is in the vein of those great epic action fantasy films like Baron Munchaussen and Time Bandits. It shows up Harry Potter for the clunky shallow children's story that it is. The action slightly slows in the middle of the film, and a few small trims could have made this the 10/10 it nearly was - 9/10"

","That's not a very good summary line above, but this movie is very hard to sum up. It's just that good, that it defies pigeonholing. All the characters are quite convincingly played, and all seem very real and human, even the ones we only see for a few minutes such as Billy and the guard at the wall. It's dramatic (the final confrontation was engrossing), it's heartwarming (you'll cheer for Tristian) and while it's hilarious (Robert De Niro in an over-the-top comedic role? One more aspect of this film's genius) the humor never overwhelms the drama. Instead they coexist quite harmoniously. If there's been a lot of comparisons to The Princess Bride, well, if the Princess Bride had had modern special effects it would have been this good. And that's the best compliment I know how to give."

","Well it's finally happened for me; a movie that surpassed the book! My friends would have you know that that never happens for me. I'm usually the one who goes to see a movie based on a book I've read and leaves screaming of how it was unfaithful. Was Stardust a perfect representation of the book it is based on? No, it was even better! I'll start with the acting, which was top notch. Claire Danes and Charlie Cox have effective chemistry and are fun to watch. Their eventual romance and marriage is predictable but fun to watch none the less. I had never heard of Cox before this movie but suspect he'll be around for some time to come.<br/><br/>Peter O'Tool, in his bit part, is fabulous and his little laugh (you know which one I'm talking about) is classic. Mark Strong is excellent and gets extra kudos for his excellent acting when he is ""duling"" with Tristan.<br/><br/>This movie, however, belongs to two of my favorite actors: Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer. As Shakespeare (changed considerably from the novel) De Niro had me rolling in the aisles. The scene when Septimus finds him in his leisure is fantastic and you can tell De Niro is just hamming it up and having a blast. I would have pictured someone like Robin Williams for the part but De Niro is nothing short of amazing.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer is equally having fun in her role. Don't know what she thought of the cosmetics but whoever was in charge of make-up gets even more kudos than Mark Strong. They successfully made Michelle Pfeiffer (a woman who constantly makes me question my sexual orientation;)) look like a hag and I never thought that possible.<br/><br/>Overall movie making is wonderful and beautifully paced. The music flows well and I can't wait for Take That to release ""Rule the World."" This is on my Christmas/Thanksgiving/Halloween wish list.<br/><br/>In a summer filled with sequels and action movies, this one reigns supreme and unique. My only wish is that they would have waited until Fall to release it as it may have been more fondly received at the Box Office. While it might not be the Princess Bride, it certainly is comparable and easily one of the best Fairy Tales I've seen in a long while."

","A feast of fun! I've read the illustrated novel, and while it was one of Gaiman's better excursions into the genre of fantasy, it wasn't as good as this movie adaptation.<br/><br/>I was particularly taken by the acting and characterisation. Lamia in particular was a PROPER fantasy villain, the likes of which hasn't graced our screens for quite some time. Her ""counterproductive beauty routine"" was hysterically funny, but she was still scary, in fact she got scarier and scarier as the movie progressed.<br/><br/>The ghosts of the Stormhold Clan were hilarious, Robert De Niro delivers a performance that should steal the movie but the rest of the movie's so good it *just* gets away from him, I even ended up liking snooty Victoria and Humphrey! All of the characters were likable, even the nastiest of the witches.<br/><br/>The thing I like best about this movie is the way they handled the magic. There's always a sense that it costs something, that it has rules. And there's magic happening all over the place, but it never really dominates or interferes with the movie, it just spices it up beautifully! A romp! I felt 10 years old again!"

You would think you could make that interesting, wouldn't you? But, no, you just sit there saying ';get on with it!'

","This movie would have worked so much better if they had left out the 21st century dialogue and mindset. The 21st century is great for special effects which was almost excellent. But when a movie takes place in another period, please leave out lines like ""This is the part where you tell me..."". De Niro can say that all he wants when he plays a cop or bad guy, but why waste great acting on really bad dialogue? Unfortunately, the writing often seemed cheap and non-relevant.<br/><br/>What saved the movie was good special effects and the presence of Michelle Pfeiffer, De Niro and Claire Danes along with some very good performances by side-kicks and lesser-knowns.<br/><br/>Throughout much of the movie, you have to accept ""changes in the rules"" like it were some game that was played by rules which could be changed at anytime(especially at the end). It's like watching a Superman movie where you know what powers he has and you wonder what he will do to get out of a mess. In this movie, disaster can be avoided by simply having a writer toss in a ""Scooby-Doo"" type explanation to appease the audience rather than enveloping the audience in beauty, awe and mystery. In this case, when beauty and mystery made itself obvious, writing all too often drew the viewer away from its comfort zone by tossing it into a kiddy carnival atmosphere.<br/><br/>I accepted the fact that the writing was not geared to the more mature audience. I also accepted the fact that the movie was not quite what it could have been. I think it is safe to compare this movie to Haunted Mansion. It started out good but cheap comedy changed a good story into something that didn't have a ghost of a chance at being a huge hit.<br/><br/>I gave it a 7 out of 10 because most of the time, I had hope it might get better. Just don't hold your breath thinking the same."

","I went to the pre-screening of Stardust last night and am very glad I did. Aside from the movie, the offer of free Stone Cold ice cream and a free massage, plus raffle tickets for the book, and then free posters were over the top. Unfortunately, they didn't have many posters. Everyone got a card with a peel-off, silver stick-on star on it as an additional promotional for the movie.<br/><br/>No need to really comment on the storyline since others here already have, but it was a wonderfully fun story to follow. It was incredibly detailed and imaginative ... so much so that there isn't another movie out there that can compare (as some already have done). This movie was so uniquely different it made it a pleasure to view. There is various tidbits of humor interlaced within this movie that are so well executed that they are an additional bonus detail. Someone I spoke to last night said the author of the book detests taking baths and hasn't bathed in years. He told me, too, that the author has other books with movie deals in the fire, so I am looking forward to more. There is a scene in the movie of one of the princes' in a bathtub (won't tell the details), but suspect this was the film-maker's symbolic tribute to the author done in a most clever way. There was a lot of attention to detail in this movie I was astounded.<br/><br/>It was evident as I left the theater that there wasn't anyone who didn't like the movie.<br/><br/>I am somewhat biased because I love fantasy films ... if they are well done, and this one was!

","Is it weird that the one thing that really sticks out about Stardust is that one of the small subplots involves Daredevil and Superman getting into an argument? Well, I guess that's not entirely the case, but a young Charlie Cox and Henry Cavill essentially fighting each other probably would have been more than enough to please me. Stardust is far more than a simple love story or fairy tale, it's irreverent and oozing with genre fun. Oh and you also have an extraordinarily gifted cast across the board.<br/><br/>Films aren't really made like this anymore. It's so hard to come by a big budgeted/genre film with a lighthearted tone and with this type of humor. You could see it on TV, or perhaps in the 1980's, but good fantasy films are so disappointingly rare these days. The closest could perhaps be something like the Kingsman movies (which Matthew Vaughn also directed), but even those could just be labeled as success due to comic-book background.<br/><br/>But the pure fantasy adventure is surely something cinema's could use a little bit more of these days. If movies can get actors like Robert De Niro to do some of the ridiculous things he does in this movie, then I think we have a winning formula. But in all seriousness, Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Michele Pfeiffer, Henry Cavill, De Niro, and Sienna Miller make for a fantastic ensemble cast of witches, Kings, a star (?), and one special prince to make for a thrilling adventure.<br/><br/>7.6/10"

","Just a quick disclaimer; I'm fully aware that, being a 23 y old guy, I don't belong under the ""targeted audience"" group and my review/rating would probably be better if I was younger. The only major issue I have with this movie is that after the first 10-15 minutes, I pretty much knew what was going to happen throughout and at the end of this movie. When a movie is predictable and too transparent it really hinders my ability to enjoy the movie entirely. If I was younger this probably wouldn't be the case and I would rate it much higher.<br/><br/>Now then, that being said.. I do have to say that I still did enjoy the movie as it was really fun and exciting at times. It's by no means a spectacular piece of work, but it's decent nevertheless. The cast was great and they really did the characters justice. The story was, as I said, quite predictable, but enjoyable nevertheless. The scenes with Robert De Niro were hilarious, same goes for Ricky Gervais. The flow of the movie felt really smooth and it didn't really get boring at any point, which is a major plus.<br/><br/>Overall, a decent movie that's well worth the watch. It's entertaining and fun!

"bowmanblue","10","2","3","26 January 2015"," A classic modern fairytale
","There's really little I can find that is negative about 'Stardust.' For what it is, it's possibly as perfect as a film could be. It's a fairytale – pure and simple. It has everything you'd probably expect to see in a 'classic Disney' cartoon – dashing princes, beautiful princesses, evil witches and more magic than you could shake a wand at. There really is nothing new regarding the plot. If you've seen one fairytale then, technically, you've seen this story and nothing will come as much of a surprise when it comes to the plot. However, 'Stardust' isn't your average fairytale.<br/><br/>If you check out the tagline on the marketing, you'll see it says something like, 'The fairytale that won't behave.' I can see where they're coming from. It's a cheeky little number that accomplishes what few films can – it's very watchable for both adults and children. Kids will love the simple 'boy meets girl' story. Characters are very easily identifiable as either 'good' or 'evil.' But the film's really bonus is its much darker undertones. There are simply dozens of visual and scripted gags which will probably go way over children's head and be picked up by adults.<br/><br/>But, it's not just the script that's fun – every cast member is a recognisable face in their own right. Whether it's the narrator – Sir Ian McKellen, or the dodgy seller of lightning in a bottle (and other magical goods), Ricky Gervais. Naturally, the film likes to highlight its two 'trump cards' – none other than Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro. Of course they turn in as excellent performances as you'd expect (I won't go into DeNiro's performance for fear of spoiling it for people who don't know what he gets up to on board his flying lightning-harvesting ship when his crew aren't watching and Pfeiffer smoulders as the evil witch, ruthlessly hunting our young couple). But it's the film's two leads that really have to carry the film. Clare Danes is more recognisable than her heroic counterpart, Charlie Cox, but their chemistry is just perfect.<br/><br/>All in all, you'll be guaranteed a good time with this film whether you're young or old. You'll have to have a heart of stone not to be enchanted by its simple tale of princes and princesses, told to perfection for a modern audience.<br/><br/>And, is it just me, or is the soundtrack one of the most uplifting ever in recent times?"
"JolinKnight","10","2","3","20 July 2013"," The most emotional movie about the most fantastic love story I have ever seen for now!
","The first time I saw this movie is in 2007, when it released as well as I was still a freshman in Uni. It is an English class, not as usual, I didn't escape from the class that day, and I am sure that was the most wisdom decision I made about running away from the classes or not. Maybe for attracting students to come back to class, our English teacher surprisingly projected a movie for the rest of us. Only less than 20 of us got the opportunity to appreciate the movie (You can image how unpopular his classes are), unfortunately I was late so missing the name of the movie......<br/><br/>One thing I can clearly remember is that it is the most attractive English class I've ever attended in that age, and I was never distracted for only a minute. The reason why I fell in love with this film, I think is because that I was still a freshman on love and I was thirst to find a true lover. However, I found I was wrong about myself when I finally found this movie and watched it for a second time three years later. I was still a undergraduated student, still single, but I had been refused by two girls, the thirsty turned a little bit to desperation. This time the more feeling I got from this movie is admiring, touchable and disappointed of myself.<br/><br/>Our poor Tristan is the same as me at the beginning, swearing to bring the girl happiness but being played by her. It seems like I am the Tristan at the first 10 minutes, which made me strongly identify with him. I carefully watched and wanted to find some moments I can learn from to break my curse. Honestly, after watching this movie that time, I was disappointed and concluded that it is the bloodline making our poor Tristan become a prince and helping him get every thing a man fights for.<br/><br/>Very soon, I forgot the name of the movie. Fortunately, I can hardly believe that I didn't delete this movie three years ago after it disappointed me. It is maybe my potential personality functioned and kept it for the future me. I opened the player without aware of it is that one, and this time I felt a new life come out of my mind. I finally understand that our prince Tristan is not happened to be the prince and not totally depends on the luck to get Yvaine. There are willpower and sacrifice when he steps into the unknown world to bring the star back; responsibility and loyalty when he insists to fulfill the promise; kindness and courage when he decides to save the girl, twice, once for a recognise girl and another for his true lover. Although the luck can't be overlooked, it is Tristan the young man with quite many good qualities can take the luck to happy ending.<br/><br/>I am not disappointed, not thirsty to make a girlfriend, and I exactly know what I want and what I should do now. I will not be a lost young man any more. It is this movie help me commit to my heart, find a example learning from and teach me so many bright characteristics that I should occupy in my long rest of lifetime. Abusolutely happy ending for everyone, in the movie and in front of the screen."

","If you enjoyed Princess Bride or Neverending Story, I can almost guarantee you'll love Stardust. Loosely based on a hit book by Neil Gaiman, this movie will have your full attention from the prologue until the last words. Oh, but I'm getting ahead of myself.<br/><br/>Wall is a small town in England, named after, well, a wall that runs just by it. Tristan (Charlie Cox), a lovable yet clumsy good-for-nothing shop boy, makes a bet with Victoria, a girl far out of his league - if he can find a shooting star they saw fall and bring it back, he will have her hand in marriage. He only has a week for that. Time is, however, the smallest of his problems, because he's not the only one who's after the star - so is Lamia, an evil witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) and Septimus, a prince of Stormhold, to both of whom getting the star before Tristan means unimaginable power.<br/><br/>So begins an adventure in spirit of classic fantasy movies. You see, while on the one side of a wall is England we know, the other side hides Stormhold - a magical kingdom of witches, fairies, unicorns, and, well, magic. What starts as a simple errand almost instantly turns into a grand adventure when Tristan learns that the star is not simply a fallen rock - it's a beautiful girl, Ivaine (Claire Danes). Now Tristan has a week to get back to the wall and marry Victoria - by the end, will he even want to? On the way, Tristan and Ivaine will meet a lovable cast of characters - most notably the sky pirate captain Shakespeare (Robert de Niro delivers a winning performance) who tries hard to maintain his reputation as a fearsome buccaneer in front of his crew, despite his sensitive (and stereotypically homosexual) persona.<br/><br/>Stardust is a magical movie in spirit of classic fantasy films that, chances are, you watched as a kid.

","Just when you think you've seen it all cometh a fairy tale right out of Never Land. However, you won't find Peter Pan or Tinker Bell in this fantasy adventure, rather, an original set of characters in a truly magical world. <br/><br/>When young Tristan Thorne promises the girl of his dreams the moon and the stars, he sets off on a fantasy quest literally reaching for the stars. Caught between malevolent witchcraft and greedy heirs to a mythological kingdom, his adventures take him on a perilous journey through air, land and sea arriving at an enlightened conclusion that true love can never be bought; no matter what the price.<br/><br/>Penned by graphic comic novelist Neil Gaiman, this is a fantastic tale set between pre-modern England and the netherworld. On screen, it's a film filled with action, suspense, romance and comedy and goes on to breathe life back into a genre that hasn't enjoyed much significance since ""The Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. Even so, while ""The Lord of the Rings"" is mainly an intense battle between good and evil, Stardust appeals to a wider audience for its atmospheric plot, flamboyant acting, exhilarating score and surreal cinematography and is a refreshing change given its originality. Acting is just stellar thanks to an ensemble cast starting with an initially unrecognizable Michelle Pfeiffer as an evil and conniving witch and Tristan's main adversary. Her first brush with magic may have been in ""The Witches of Eastwick"", but given here role here, her character is both ugly and cinematically flawless. Excuse the pun, but Pfeiffer fans will be most certainly zapped! Claire Danes also gives in a commendable act as a fallen star turned fragile mortal. If her role is meant to symbolize the frailty of purity and innocence surrounded by greed born of evil, then she does so with all that we have grown to expect form her. Opposite Danes is newcomer Charlie Cox in the lead as the blindly infatuated Tristan. For one of his first major film roles, Cox delivers unexpectedly with a performance equal only to Orlando Bloom's rookie days as an up and coming actor. <br/><br/>Perhaps the most surprising and stand performance in the entire movie comes from Robert De Niro as Captain Shakespeare, a mean swashbuckling pirate on the outside, with an embarrassing secret on the inside. In my opinion, De Niro almost single-handedly steals the show despite his limited screen time, not because he is one of my favorite actors, but solely due to his hilarious antics behind closed doors. Now if you are accustomed to De Niro's Mafioso demeanor complemented by his signature repetitive dialogs, then like me, prepare to laugh your head off. And trust me, you won't see it coming either, so avoid the built-in DVD/Blu-ray trailers. Rounding off the cast are some memorable contributions from Mark Strong, Nathaniel Parker, Sienna Miller and a cameo from Peter O'Toole. <br/><br/>Co-written and directed by Mathew Vaughn, this is a film not to be missed especially if you liked his previous work in ""Layer Cake"" and ""Snatch"". Special effects though seldom, do create a visual impact when used and is punctuated at the right moments. Even so, blink and you might miss some of the best moments. If you haven't done so already, this is the perfect film if you have been considering an upgrade from DVD to Blu-ray."

","A philosopher once asked, ""Are we human because we gaze at the stars, or do we gaze at them because we are human?"" Pointless, really... ""Do the stars gaze back?"" Now *that's* a question. <br/><br/>And, so begins the unlikely, and incredibly inventive tale that is Stardust. <br/><br/>Stardust begins with a young man named Dunstan Thorne (palayed by Ben Barnes, one year before his breakout role as Prince Caspian in the second Chornicales of Narnia film) lives in a town in England known as Wall, for the stone wall that has surrounded the town for 150 years. No one knows what lies beyond the wall, because no one has ever gone beyond the confinement. But, Dunstan Thorne breaks that streak, by venturing beyond the wall, and into the magical realm known as Stormhold. While there, he meets a beautiful woman who he has a short, but memorable affair with. He then returns to Wall, but 9 months later, the elderly gate watchman (David Kelly) arrives at Dunstan's home with a baby, which he claims belongs to Dunstan. The young boy is named Tristan (played as an adult by Charlie Cox). Tristan is smitten with the beautiful Victoria (Seienna Miller), who is dating an asshole named Humphrey. One night, Tristan gets his wish of spending more than a few seconds in with his true love. <br/><br/>Meenwhile, the King of Stormhold (Peter O'Toole) lays on his death bed. 3 of his seven sons still remain alive, because the only remaining one is crowned king after their father dies. Two brothers (Rupert Everet and Mark Strong) plot the death of the third brother by pushing home out the castle window. The King tells the two remaining brothers that the first one to retrieve his necklace will be crowned king. He then chucks the necklace into the sky.<br/><br/>The necklace hurtles through space, knocking a star out of the sky. The star crashes to Earth, but not before it's seen by Tristian and Victoria. The two make a bet that if Tristian can go beyond the wall and return the star before Victoria's birthday, in a week, then the two will be married. <br/><br/>Using a strange candle given to him by his mother, called a Babylon Candle, which posses the power to transport a person hundreds of miles in the blink of an eye, Tristain ends up in the middle of a crater, with a strange girl. The girl, named Yvaine (Claire Danes) turns out to the human form of the fallen star. The two set out on the 100 mile journey back to Stormhold.<br/><br/>Along the way, they encounter a cast of quirky character including a witch (played by Michelle Pheifer) who is obsessed with looking young, a band of lightning collecting pirates lead by Captain Shakespeare (Robert De Nero), and a black market trader named Ferdy (Ricky Gervais.)<br/><br/>For those who did not see this film when it opened in theaters back in 2007, simply because it looked like a fairy tale, you missed out on one of the most entertaining films of the decade. Yes, it is a fairy tale, but, overall, it is simply an epic fantasy, albeit an epic fantasy where you know that the two main characters are going to get married in the end, director Mathew Vaughn, who made his directorial debut in 2004 with the mob thriller, Layer Cake, starring Daniel Craig, and most recently directed Kick-Ass with Chloe Moretz and Nick Cage, takes some interesting paths in arriving at that point. It wasn't hard for me to fall in love with this movie, which Vaughn adapted from the Neal Gaiman novel of the same name."

I would definitely watch it again, although not as many times as the Princess Bride. Robert De Niro somewhat stole the show, but Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer were excellent as well."
"beresfordjd","9","2","3","27 March 2010"," Surprised
","I was surprised how much I enjoyed this film. It was not the best thing in fantasy I have ever seen but it was really entertaining. A fairly original story well told with excellent special effects. It was a joy to see De Niro in a real departure for him and also thoroughly enjoying himself. Michelle Pfeiffer I love in anything she does and she too has fun with the part ( and a very passable accent too). Jane Goldman and Matthew Vaughan have made a good job of the writing but I would have liked a little less modern idiom and something a little more classic in the way that characters speak. The humour is spot on appealing to children and adults alike. Mark Strong gives excellent value as a dark villain, brooding and menacing. I loved seeing all the British comic actors like Mark Williams, Ricky Gervais and David Walliams in small but effective parts, adding atmosphere and amusement to the movie. I have watched it twice now and enjoyed it more the second time. Well worth a viewing."
"el_gee","9","2","3","12 January 2010"," Fantastic Fairytale
","I had previously read the illustrated novel of this story. I had thoroughly enjoyed the book and was keen to see the film. However, two years later I finally got to watch this film.<br/><br/>Needless to say I thoroughly enjoyed it. The story centres around a boy in a small parochial town in England who gets involved in a fantastical adventure.<br/><br/>The film is quite long at two hours but passes quickly. This is helped by the balance between lighter and more serious moments. In terms of cast, you can see the enjoyment they obviously had making this film. I thought the young lead was excellent as the small town boy and thought Michelle Pfeifer was excellent as the villain. I'm glad I bought this film as surely it will warrant further viewing. I would highly recommend this film. It is a perfect escapist fairytale with a lightness of touch that stops it becoming prurient or bogged down in special effects. If you want a great movie for an enjoyable evening of fun and relaxation then you won't go far wrong with this."
"marianna_s","9","2","3","4 December 2009"," Why we should love this movie
","Although Stardust seems to be a fantasy film with predictable ending and average performances, it is certainly not. When i saw the movie, i knew it was going to be one of my favorite movies. And i was right. <br/><br/>Stardust is more of a fairytale than an adventure film. It has this magical 'aura' from the beginning to the very end of the movie. The storyline is well written , and it keeps you on the edge of your seat. Like every tale , it has some short of morality. Therefore we know in our hearts that the evil brothers won't take the throne but the innocent boy who manages to overcome every obstacle and difficulty he encounters during his journey. We also know that the true love is Yvaine and not Victoria , the material girl who is shallow and manipulative. <br/><br/>I have to give extra credits to Claire Danes. She literally shines in this movie. Her eyes have this sparkle that fit totally in her character. Moreover, she and Cox do have chemistry which makes the romance in the film even more notable. The rest of the cast are well known actors and actresses which of course make Stardust an interesting and ''high classed'' movie<br/><br/>Overall , the movie is FANTASTIC, the locations magical and the plot interesting.I was very disappointed that the film didn't get nominated for more awards. I have to give at least 9/10 stars for this."
"olukotun","7","2","3","13 August 2009"," Lighthearted, pleasant for an early night
","This is a very lighthearted film. Pleasant for an early weeknight.<br/><br/>The characters were all charming, and I liked that it had all the fine elements of a good myth: metaphorical characters with a neatly wrapped up ending. I especially enjoyed the goat-man. Very funny, not unlike Peter Pettigrew of Harry Potter without the eeriness.<br/><br/>The chorus of ghosts is a pleasant device that balances out several gruesome on screen deaths. In fact, their banter was very funny. Pushes the appropriate age limit up a bit -- young kids might be disturbed by the killing.<br/><br/>Plenty of silly laughs come from seeing characters like De Niro and Ricky Gervais out of character. Their haggling scene is one of the funniest, snappiest pieces of acting that I've seen. Gives Monty Python in the Life of Brian a run for its money.<br/><br/>In fantasy tales it can become annoying when magical characters run amok without any real parameters, casting spells at whim or manipulating the elements. I usually find such stories to be the result of lazy writing. Stardust pushes the limits in this respect, but manages to stave off total absurdity.<br/><br/>Sit back, relax and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>--dejiridoo"

"Gunn","8","2","3","22 July 2009"," One of the Top Fantasy Films!
","While it doesn't come close to ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy, ""Star Wars"" or ""The Wizard of Oz"", it is a pretty decent little fantasy/fairy tale film. I'd rank it with ""Labyrinth"", ""The Princes Bride"", ""The Dark Crystal"", ""The Spiderwick Chronicles"" and other very good fantasy films. The cast is terrific with Charlie Cox and Claire Danes as the two leads and a supporting cast of Peter O'Toole, Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Ricky Gervaise, David Kelly, Sienna Miller and others. It has a very nice film score, dazzling special effects, wonderful cinematography of Scotland, Iceland and elsewhere and an involving story. It is quite long, but moves at a good pace. It has action, mystery, suspense and humor. What more could one ask of a neat little family movie. It's a quest movie with a complex plot that would be better seen than described. I'd recommend this as a nice rental for a rainy or winter's day."
"BaronBl00d","9","2","3","22 July 2009"," This Star Shines Brightly
","Highly enjoyable, very imaginative, and filmic fairytale all rolled into one, Stardust tells the story of a young man living outside a fantasy world going inside it to retrieve a bit of a fallen star only to find the star is alive, young, and beautiful. A kingdom whose king is about to die has said king unleash a competition on his several sons to see who can retrieve a ruby first to be king whilst a trio of witches want the star to carve up and use to keep them young. These three plot threads weave intricately together throughout the entire picture blended with good acting, dazzling special effects, and some solid sentiment and humour as well. Stardust is a fun film and has some fun performances from the likes of Claire Danes as the star(I could gaze at her for quite some time) to Michelle Pfeiffer(I could gaze at her at full magical powers even longer) playing the horrible witch to Robert Deniro playing a nancy-boy air pirate to perfection. Charlie Cox as the lead Tristan is affable and credible and we get some very good work from a group of guys playing the sons out to be king who are constantly and consistently trying to kill off each other. Mark Strong, Jason Flemyng, and Ruppert Everett plays their roles well in both life and death(loved this whole thread as well). Peter O'Toole plays the dying killer daddy and watch for funny man Ricky Gervais who made me laugh more than anything in the entire film in his brief five minutes(nice feet). But the real power in the film is the novel by Neil Gaiman and the script made from his creative and fertile mind. Stardust creates its own mythology and its own world and it works."
"yeomanflood","10","2","3","29 March 2009"," This movie is excellent!!!
","All I can say is WOW! I didn't know what to expect about this movie after having read a ton of reviews. I was afraid it would be too clichÃ©, cheezy and predictable. I was pleasantly surprised. Alone on a Saturday night, I had the pleasure of watching the movie myself - left alone to laugh out loud several times. Sure the movie was predictable at times and had its clichÃ© moments, but overall it was incredibly well executed. The casting and acting was very good - Charlie Cox did well in the lead, Michelle Pfeiffer did as well as you would expect, as did Robert DeNiro; Claire Danes did an amazing performance whether you're a fan of hers or not. Overall, the supporting cast did a great job as well. And although the story was a fantasy and therefore had familiar elements to it, it definitely, as several other reviewers have commented, has a uniqueness that I have not seen of late. There were no real parts that dragged, the special effects were well integrated into the story line and did not seem forced and the details were simply awesome. When you watch the movie, you can really see a lot of detail work was done on the sets and you notice the details when you observe the subtle body language of the actors. Like most reviewers I would say it might not become quite the classic of Princess Bride (with it's most awesome quotes) or have the romance of Say Anything, but it is likely to continue to hold its own in the future due to its unique style, story line and execution. Great date movie, though the violence (even if it is relatively cartoonish overall) will turn off some and makes it inappropriate for kids. I really liked this movie for its combination of fantasy and romance...and that's coming from a guy."
"rauh-georg","9","2","3","28 February 2009"," Stellar!!
","What a brilliant movie! This fantasy tale entertains from the very first minute to the end with no lengths in between.<br/><br/>This movie is very polished and it has everything one would expect from a good fantasy movie - including a fair bit of humor without ever getting ""too cheesy"".<br/><br/>This movie will entertain kids as well as adults alike. Adults will like it since it is not ""childish"" in any way, and kids will like it since the story is not too complex.<br/><br/>I especially like: * the movie is beautifully shot. Watching this on a 52"" plasma guarantees entertainment from the first minute to the last. Its not on the ""epic level"" like LOTR, but it comes very close in terms of ""creating"" the right feel and ambiance needed for good fantasy entertainment.<br/><br/>* Even if there's violence and fighting it is not a bloody movie at all, doesn't idolize violence as ""solution for all things"". (Refreshing after seeing a bunch of Mel Gibson movies....) * A nice bit of humor throughout the movie * No ""morale teachings at all cost"" as seen in SO MANY movies. There are so many movies from Hollywood which win prices because they always *need* to teach a morale, like ""family is important"" or things like that. They have an overly emotional plot like featuring a dying mother with 7 kids, and, at all costs, need to ""embed"" a morale lesson, over and over again.<br/><br/>This movie does NOT lift a finger trying to teach a lesson. Thank God! This is fantasy entertainment as its supposed to be, perfect in any sense! I don't know whether this movie earned any awards - in my opinion it deserves them. Stellar movie! G."
"houndtang75","9","2","3","13 December 2008"," Some magic in it...
","For some reason I had no great desire to see Stardust, the reviews were lukewarm and the trailers didn't look too interesting (too much Ricky Gervais!), so it was only tonight when it came on TV that I watched it. I was pleasantly surprised; Stardust is a very enjoyable fantasy film, not unworthy of comparison with The Princess Bride. The story maintains interest over almost two hours and satisfies as good fairy tales should. The cast is strong with the beautiful Claire Danes doing a rather good English accent, Charlie Cox a likable hero and Michelle Pfeiffer and Mark Strong appropriately hissable baddies. A candidate for most under-rated film of the last year or so."

","After seeing this movie I have to say that I was really impressed with it. I really liked the adventure in this movie and it was really thrilling to watch.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer did a great job acting as Lamia and so did Charlie Cox acting as Tristan. I was really surprised on how Robert De Niro acted his role out because i'm not used to him acting like that but still he did a fabulous job as always. The ghosts in this movie who follow Septimus around were kind of funny and entertaining at the same time.<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie were spectacular but I do have to say that in one part where the goat gets thrown into the wall you can tell that it was a fake one. There was also this one part where Lamia is a very old witch and right away she turns into a beautiful women and I thought that the visuals in that part were amazing. Another part where the visuals were outstanding was the part when Lamia created a hotel to fool Yvaine. Also to mention that at the end of the movie when the glass was shattering all over the place, that was pretty amazing as well.<br/><br/>So like I said earlier this movie really impressed me and it will impress you as well."

Michelle Pfiffer as a witch is outstanding in her vileness . Peter O'Toole is also in fine form as the King who must choose an heir to his throne . He expects his sons to use murder as a tool for claiming the crown and reminds them that he himself had to dispatch twelve brothers to claim the crown . His four previously murdered sons hang about the palace as ghosts who provide a ton of comic relief . This movie is well worth the price of an evenings rental fee ."

","I had a sneaking feeling that when I went to see this film it was going to be one of those that was going to be a complete waste of time or a quiet masterpiece and thankfully it is the latter.<br/><br/>After a quiet but intriguing start which the adults will probably enjoy more than the children, we are thrown into the deep end by watching the king of the magical kingdom offer a challenge to his potential heirs in order for them to become king, whilst the hero of the piece tries to bring a star back for the spoilt brat that he thinks he loves. After various scrapes we watch as the boy of the start becomes a man and realises what is important in life. Plaudits go to the gorgeous Michelle Pfeifer who has a great time in the best role she has had for years, but the scene stealing award goes to Robert De Niro who is simply amazing and I'm not a De Niro fan! But in this film he plays completely against type and is a revelation, which, for an actor of his years is no mean feat.<br/><br/>Get it on DVD when it comes out. You deserve a treat"
"sg2790","10","2","3","22 December 2007"," Brilliant Brilliant Brilliant
","This film was absolutely brilliant i really must say. It was a new, fresh look at fairy tales. The main things that set it apart from others is that strangely in some elements it has a sense of realism to it, for example they don't have posh ridiculous accents, and the various cameos such as Ricky Gervais and Robert De Niro really added to this.<br/><br/>Even though i guest what the story would be about 15 minutes in, it didn't take away from the enjoyment one bit! This definitely isn't a just a kids fairy tale it appeals to all ages. Don't be fooled by the trailer, when i saw it i really didn't like the look of it and thought it would be another meaningless blockbuster but it really isn't.<br/><br/>I would 100% advice anyone whatever age you are to watch this it is really a brilliant, warm funny film. Robert De Niro does a funny and different performance, at first when he came on i was thinking it would be the same old role that he usually plays but this film is just full of surprises! WATCH IT its a must see movie! 10/10 and usually I'm very critical of films."

","10 out of 10 and MORE!!<br/><br/>Everything from the strangely-effeminate Robert DeNiro to the all-of-a-sudden re-hottiness factor of Michelle Pfeiffer (looking great for 49!). Not since Ladyhawke has she looked this appealing.<br/><br/>I knew absolutely nothing about this movie when I watched it, and I was amazed. Great characters, wonderful effects and visuals, along with a very interesting story of a boy who falls in love with a girl, who wants him to prove his love and devotion to her by performing some seemingly impossible task. Oh, so you've heard this one before? Well, not quite like this one is told, at least I don't think so. There's enough danger and darkness in it to keep it from being a Hollywood fairytale. It plays more like a Grimm's fairytale, with humor and a very pleasant love story intertwined in it.<br/><br/>I laughed, I felt sad, I was amazed and entertained. I wanted it to end a certain way, and it did. I can't ask much more from a movie, especially one I've never even heard of, and I enjoyed every minute of it. I will be buying this one on DVD, with or without Special Features. It's a hit, with lots of stuff I'm sure I missed the first time through because the kids can't stop talking during it, and I'm looking forward to watching it again and again. Great casting with funny, beautiful people and awesome locations. What a treat!"

","I've read the novel, seen the film 3 times in theatre, got the poster&the illustrated novel, rent the DVD, bought the DVD as for friends, and planned to buy one for myself as well. In other words, I love it. It offered much more than the trailer suggested & I am ecstatic every time I watch it. The cast is superb (""Ian McKellan & Peter O'toole"" pretty much seals the deal but the movie had much more). To make sure my praises speak volume, I must mention some shortcomings that bothered me personally. Although I'd have loved Claire Danes to have a more natural accent (which would work since she is a star and not necessarily English), she seemed to manage well. A forced climactic scene near the end disappointed me but the humor around it made up for the fact. I wish the film would have kept the greater length of the ""journey"" from the book but this would have taken away the urgency and excitement which made the movie so good to watch. W/o a doubt, the scores alone would've impressed me but they complemented the scenes quite well. Visually, each frame was a sight for sore eyes: a wide range of locations all wonderfully cinematographed (if that's a word). The thing about Stardust is it offers everything you would want to see in a film: creative storyline, likable characters, content, action, adventure, comedy, romance, suspense, awesome score and a healthy dose of violence. I will admit however- its atmosphere and pace are different from the novel (if you love the novel, there is a SMALL chance that you might disagree w/ the movie adaptation) but my personal assurance is that this movie delivers."

That really saves any film in my book - perhaps this is down to Jane Goldman. Some nice twists and turns.<br/><br/>The sort of silly medieval gibberish that many producers sanction for feature films is avoided by the little quirks.

","I've been a fan, somewhat, of most of Gaiman's other works. At times I do find him a bit pretentious and tedious. I have the original graphic 'novel' of the Stardust stories and enjoyed them quite a bit. It was with trepidation that I went to see the film version as Gaiman has a very unique writing style that has often found difficulty in translation (the Neverwhere TV series was mediocre at best).<br/><br/>I was wonderfully surprised that Vaughn and company were able to temper some of Gaiman's more tedious tendencies and make a wonderful and enjoyable picture.<br/><br/>I never found myself feeling bored or distracted and by the end of the movie, unlike most romantic pics, I walked away feeling lighter of step and smiling. I remembered sequences of the film and light touches and happy occasions, despite the seriousness of the threat in the film, with great relish.<br/><br/>I also remembered one of the few films of the past that have left me with this same feeling. The Princess Bride. Both were irreverent, to a point, poignant, yet not maudlin, and exciting, but not overdone.<br/><br/>This film, for me, is a buy.

The big screen viewing experience is KEY to maximum enjoyment of this movie. I'd bet money that Claire Danes went to the Gwynyth ""Emma"" Paltrow voice coach to prepare for this role. Charlie Cox as Tristan in the male lead is effective & adorable. Michelle Pfieffer is a treat (& somewhat of a surprising choice) for the wickedest of the Weird Sisters.

I must admit that I will see any movie that Peter O'Toole is in, even if I am not familiar with the lead actors. And, of course, he was his usual ""fabulous."" The theatre was brimming over and we had to scramble for one seat on the aisle. For a few minutes, my husband sat next to me on the stairs (he had the food!) until we coaxed the seat-savers one row down to give up an empty seat. There was one enchanting scene after another. Just when I thought I had seen it all, there appeared another scene to revel or bask in.

","""Stardust"" is, at first glance, a typical fairy tale. A magical world, evil, ugly old witches, all the fairy tale elements. But dig deeper and you'll get a beautiful story of love and heroism. The story: A boy promises to bring back a fallen star for the girl he wants to marry. He crosses ""the wall"" and finds that the ""star"" is a beautiful woman. Meanwhile, three witches learn that the star has fallen, and go to get her for their own means. And finally, the remaining sons of the dying king compete to kill their brothers and gain the crown. These three stories come together in a thrilling climax that will have you on the edge of your seat. The previews don't give it its due credit.

"keithhaugen","9","2","3","21 August 2007"," Neil Gaiman is underrated
","This movie was another instance of Neil Gaiman's intriguing imagination. I would describe this film as 90% Terry Gilliam's Adventures of Baron Munchausen with a little bit of the dark side of a number of fantasy films, most recently Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix. If you are not familiar with other Neil Gaiman works of other literary forms, check out Smoke and Mirrors (a collection of stories) or his graphic novels (comics) The Sandman and Black Orchid.<br/><br/>Stardust has a little bit for everybody, plenty of romance (obviously), slapstick comedy, and wit. The acting and actors are not bad either -- not a lot of movies will include DeNiro, Pfeiffer, and Danes in the same movie all with pivotal roles that they took seriously."

","I like Neil Gaiman and I love Jane Goldman. I really didn't know if I would enjoy this as much as I thought I should and was surprised to have been blown away. The movie starts off slow but builds momentum as it goes. It is visually stunning (Cinematographer and Art Director or just the Director I wonder?) with a good soundtrack and is well acted by most of the stars. Ricky Gervais and Robert Deniro over act a bit but there is a chance that it is intentional. I just read that the director is taking on Marvel Comics Thor next, and if he keeps with the fell and quality of this piece, it should pretty sweet. The director also did Guy Ritchie's Snatch and Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels which I would recommend to fans of the hardboiled/Brit gangster/dark comedy genre. This is my first IMDb movie review and although it sound as if I am gushing, this doesn't happen often as will be reflected in any other review.<br/><br/>as a last note; The volume of the speech track seemed very low as opposed to the sound effects and music tracks.

Every time I've watched it, I've caught new little things that I enjoy. For instance, the pirate rolling his eyes whenever Captain Shakespeare fumbles his attempts at a tough reputation, or when the prince ghosts says, ""Isnt this ironic"" while sitting under a sign that says, ""The Slaughtered Prince"".

It shows our hero, Tristan Thorne, crossing large distances to collect a fallen star for the woman he loves (but who seems to view him with nothing but mild amusement). The star is a woman, since the wall that separates the small town of Wall with where the star fell is actually the border between realms, one real and the other fantasy. What ends up happening is a chase between three different people, all of whom want the star for their own purposes.<br/><br/>First, there is Tristan, who wishes to prove his love to his beloved. Second there is the witch who wishes to cut out the star's heart, eat it, and extend her life by another few hundred years. Lastly, there are the final sons of the king of the realm (Stormhold) who are all trying to off each other in the process of succession that holds in the country. It is Septimus, the last of the princes, who wants the star's heart for similar purposes as the witch.<br/><br/>Tristan and the star (Yvaine) have a very typical meet-cute falling in love, but the story is told charmingly with winning actors. The central story is also surrounded by wonderful details like Captain Shakespeare, the captain of a flying vessel that captures lighting to sell, and the ghosts of the fallen sons of the king, who are doomed to watch the progress of succession until it resolves, offering a macabre chorus to the scene.<br/><br/>Through it all, there's great set design, a wonderful score, and everyone gives performances that fit very well with the overall tone and feel of the film. And, oh, again that tone. It's not merely light and airy. It does move to more dangerous territories at times when the action needs it (the showdown at the inn the witch conjured between her, Tristan, the star, and Primus is a stand out).<br/><br/>It's not great cinema (it's perhaps a bit too effortless with the world-building to hold together as well as it should, and the resolution of everything at the end is rather pat), but it's still a great time at the movies."

Acting is pleasant - Cox is sweet little (big) boy, Danes is beautiful like a real star, typical ""evil crone"" Pfeiffer, charismatic Strong, brilliant de Niro as transgender captain :)<br/><br/>The movie does not try to be too serious, well, sometmies there was too much humour for my taste.

","This is not a great movie, but it is a very good one.<br/><br/>Unlike, say, Harry Potter or such, it doesn't get bogged down in its own mythology. It's in the back, a setup for making some funny situations and having some fun in general.<br/><br/>Michele Pfeiffer is _great_ as the main witch, villain. There are several very nicely staged and done jokes. In general, the humor is not ""thematic"", so you can't get annoyed with it. There's wordplay, physical comedy, story-jokes, one-liners... BTW, Michele Pfeiffer has maybe the best part of physical comedy, when she uses magic to stop her advance aging, but it has interesting side-effects.<br/><br/>But, it's not just humor, it has a story to tell. It's a naïve story, but, it's nice.<br/><br/>I didn't like the extended cameo of Robert De Niro very much, but, it, too, was OK (and it's, like, the worst part of the movie). Second worst is, unfortunately, the ending, which misses a few shots and kind of drifts off the main point of ""forget the fantasy, we're just having fun"" (and, again, for such a movie, it's OK).<br/><br/>With just a few bad elements and none of them being really bad (more not good) and many nice ones, several very good ones and a few great, this gives for some very nice time spent watching this, having fun."

","What a charming, new fairy tale! I'm a bit late to the party, as I've only just watched Stardust, and it came out in 2007, but I'm so glad I found it on Netflix. Heavy star power (pun intended) makes this light, sweet story great fun to watch. A much younger Cllare Danes looks every inch the shining heavenly body, and Robert De Niro makes the pirate captain hilariously lovable. The bad guys are bad, the guys are good. Simple is better in the world of fairy tales and Stardust meets that mark without sacrificing any magic. Made me with I could escape to the heavens occasionally! Ian McKellen makes the perfect narrator, but we only hear him at the beginning and end. The plot carries itself without explanation. The only bit that might upset some viewers, especially children, involves some off-camera killing of animals by witches to read their entrails. However, even the animals have their day, which is just as it should be. Wonderful family, escapist entertainment."

","Stardust is a pretty entertaining fantasy film. One of my favorite aspects of this film is the spot on casting and the acting by the cast members. Michelle Pfeiffer was just so great in her role! She was my favorite part of the entire movie, she just really stole the spotlight. Robert De Niro, who doesn't come in until later on did well and carried his own in my opinion. Claire Danes was perfectly cast in her role as the lead! She was sweet, delightful, enjoyable to watch and very likable. I was just really impressed by the impeccable performances here, very impressive! The love story between the two leads was well paced and put together, I really enjoyed it! The effects were very impressive and cool looking to see as well, not cheap looking at all. The action sequences were pretty good, no complaints here on that part. My one complaint is in the beginning of the movie, the pace was just a little bit too slow for me personally, but that's really my one and only complaint. 8/10."

","I went into this film not knowing what exactly to expect. Trailer made it look like a fairy-tale kind of film, like Princess Bride. Reviews were excellent, so I gave it a try, viewing it with the wife and kids. Everyone was attentive the whole time, and enjoyed it. A nice mix of humor, fantasy action, and fairy-tale kid quality. It has its scary moments, but any kid that can handle Lord of the Rings or Harry Potter can handle this. It was uplifting, and had mildly scary stuff too to keep it interesting. The whole story was tightly written and very interesting, without being confusing and without being too basic and straightforward. Of course a big thumbs up for having been narrated by Ian McKlellan; like having Gandalf telling the story. A thumbs up to the beautiful super-long hair they gave the witch who took on a young form for most of the film. Much better than the ghastly appearances they witches usually had. This story was so tightly and perfectly written that I can't find anyone deserving of my trademark punch in the face comment that I reserve for a character who does something deviantly evil or stupid, so I'll refrain this time. Overall, a nice family film with enough to keep the adults interested as well.<br/><br/>See my profile for my rating philosophy."

","A fantasy- Harry Potter film: that is Star Dust. Actress performance (Claire Danes) makes the movie magnificence. You will be happy also with effects and scenery. The problem is, in my opinion, too much childishness. If they try to make a joke, it sounds too infantile. Not always, but very often, which counts down some points of the film. Star Dust has quite interesting story, which could be better overworked I think. For example the witch could reach her goal a long time, but she waited! Nobody knows why and at the end she died. Royal brother relationships are together with habits in the kingdom funny. I would say that Star Dust is a connection between a sweet romantic movie and action plot. This is well played by Claire Danes, which became my favorite after this movie. If you have time, then watch Star Dust…"

It's certainly the most commercial film to have come from the pen of comedic fantasy author Neil Gaiman but you can be assured that his tongue never leaves his cheek throughout.

","Robert De Niro needs to go find Billy Crystal--""I go fag, you die"" (and only for his mafioso character do I permit and forgive the use of the word fag). I think dancing in a tu-tu with a fan sends De Niro into a flaming fit of flair and glamor that will have the audience dissolving in giggles. In addition to De Niro's massively entertaining parade, the film is a winner. It addresses love, and how more often than not people are more in love with the idea of being in love than actually being in love. It explores the path that one must follow towards self-knowledge, and it blooms in its charm, lovely cinematography, and the beautiful fairy-tale sway of the plot. Clair Danes is positively luminescent as the Star, and Charlie Cox is a charming take on the hero of Neil Gaiman's novel. Overall, while the story itself is another fairytale of a faraway place that perhaps cannot meet the epic battles of others, it is a sweet, blissful escape that brings you back to earth feeling content with the belief that every once in a while you truly can catch a falling star."

","This being my first comment and review ever, it's an honor to write for a movie such as this. It has all the elements of a grand fairy tale - princes, princesses, witches and ordinary common human beings aspiring and dreaming of something better and of course the everlasting quest for unconditional love.<br/><br/>The story is excellently paced; it warms your soul and takes it to a magical journey through a magical land where stars come to life literally. If you ever have chance to watch this movie don't hesitate and take it. It would be a perfect gift for someone you care for.<br/><br/>As you can see I am tiptoeing carefully not reveal anything from this wonderful story, the magic presented is powerful and dismisses your disbelief right out the door. Besides who needs suspension of disbelief - it's a fairy tale! Plus the magical feats are not complete nonsense and are a just representation of many different spiritual cultures of the real world. Anyway it doesn't matter how much you know about magic, the story is wonderful and compelling and it won't let you go till the end.<br/><br/>There is also a sufficient amount of good humor too. The camera and fictional landscapes as well as the special effects are so well put together that you will hardly even notice that they are special effects.<br/><br/>The cast is perfect, starting from Michelle Pheipher, along with the two lead characters and ending with a ""notorious"" captain Robert DeNiro.<br/><br/>To end this I'll just say this review in it self is completely obsolete and the only thing that I can say to you dear reader is to stop reading this review and go watch the movie."
"surf-kai","8","1","1","30 March 2008"," Love the Book--- Liked the Film
","I absolutely went over the moon in rapture when I saw the poster for this film. I love and horde all of Gaiman's works and I thought this particular story was very fitting to be translated to the silver screen (don't get me wrong-- I think all his books/comics would make singular movies. For the right audience that is...). <br/><br/>I must confess my first thought was...essentially-- ""god I hope they won't tone it down."" The novel is one of my favourites of Mr. Gaiman's for its simplicity, but as always with his works-- the surprising passages that step it up to a darker, interesting- dare I say provocative- level. The book is the perfect sci-fi/fantasy fairytale that I seek out in my heart of hearts. The type of thing I expel constant bursts of laughter over that have passersby asking what I'm reading. The book I read passages out loud to whomever I may be in the company of (boyfriend, friends, parents, little brother..). It is the quintessential fairytale-- with a bit of an edge now and then.<br/><br/>Anywho-- when it comes to the movie-- I was beyond excited. And it delivered. I only wished I hadn't read and loved the book first. Otherwise the film (almost) would have stood on its own. I will count it among one of the modern fantasy movies I always crave more of (the like of ""Big Fish"", ""Pan's Labyrinth"", ""Mirrormask"" (another Gaiman film), the ""Lord of the Rings"" and ""Harry Potter"" adaptations (if you go for the Potter films, check out ""The Worst Witch"" with Fairuza Balk), ""The Science of Sleep"", ""Amelie"" (Also, ""A Very Long Engagement""), bits of ""Finding Neverland"", and uh... lots more I can't think of... probably ""Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind"" too. Well, mostly just Pan's Labryinth and Big Fish. Stardust just has more of that big, flashy, Hollywood, all round audience appeal.<br/><br/>I could go into the parts of the film that.....um..made me mad-- being familiar to the book- but I don't want to give tooo much away. (Well OK... the time line is messed up, of course many of the characters lines are far from accurate, many of the personalities of the characters are manipulated (especially De Niro... and erm.. his little secret. His addition and his role seemed purely for his big name and empty laughs), also Ricky Gervais (while I love him-- seemed (again) to be added merely for comedic relief and so he could do his schtick from his schtick in the TV show Extras (""you havin a laugh? Is he havin a laugh???!""), also- it seemed many of the headlining actors did not have very much acting direction at times. Accents failed and delivery sometimes seemed more read, rather than felt. One of my favourite scenes was drastically altered- I suppose it was quite violent in the novel- but it dealt with how the Star (and Tristan) meet the Unicorn). Huh-- enough of that silliness.... sorry..<br/><br/>I do like the film and the book. But they both are quite different from each other. Perhaps in this case, you may not be let down if you see the movie and then read the book. Well, only if you don't have high expectations. From the point of view of someone who did do it this way-- my father-- he liked the film but thought it had lots of holes and wasn't particularly logical. I knew he would appreciate the book, so I suggested he read it. It explains and rectifies a lot. <br/><br/>Hokay so-- the point of these ramblings... ... .. . I recommend both to anyone who enjoys a good fantasy yarn. !"

","""Stardust"" is a magical story of Tristan (Charlie Cox) who takes a journey to find a fallen star to give it to her love (Sienna Miller). Young Tristan is not the only one who is after the star. A trio of witch sisters are after it also. They need the star to revive their youth. But the star is not so easy to catch...<br/><br/>The story is very funny and an adventure of adults. Neil Gaiman's original story includes extraordinary characters (Goat man/Billy and Ferdy the Fence played by Ricky Gervais are brilliant!) and bubbly, black humor. The director Matthew Vaughn (producer partner of Guy Richie) has had a special privilege of working with a superb cast including stars like Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Robert De Niro and narrator Ian McKellen himself. 25 years-old Charlie Cox is talented, new face to the star line of the actors. De Niro has a very delicious role indeed... It has been Vaughn's luck to have so capable cast because sometimes his directing gets loose which can be seen when actors are left only with their imagination and improvising.<br/><br/>In summary ""Stardust"" is a fantasy story with action, humor and especially love. The visual effects are great and support the story. ""Stardust"" is entertaining and it was sure a positive surprise in the field of fantasy genre. High recommends!"
"poor_irish_girl","9","1","1","27 February 2008"," My personal favorite of '07
","Normally, I don't let it slide when movies aren't very faithful to the books they are born from - but this is most definitely an exception. Most movies that don't follow their books tend to have continuity problems, and are plagued by bad screenplay. Stardust as a movie, however, flows particularly well and has a mass of beautiful special effects to accompany it.<br/><br/>Take it from a movie addict, this movie is worth watching based on how visually captivating it is alone. Another perfect example of how advanced technology is making watching movies even more unforgettable.<br/><br/>Of the movie's admirable qualities there is the skill level of the actors and actresses. I must applaud them all! Not one character was introduced that I didn't love (or at least love to hate). Charlie Cox and Claire Danes worked well together on screen and had few flaws to speak of - but truly, Michelle Pfeiffer just about stole the show! I've no doubt that most everyone will also enjoy the stories of the Princes of Stormhold (at least what's left of them), Captain Shakespeare, and a certain unlucky trader.<br/><br/>I don't want to give away too much on these characters - I wish you all to be as pleasantly surprised as I was. I'll just say that you will definitely not be bored, and this is a movie I will watch over and over again!"

","I love movies! The Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter I watched after I read the books and then re-read the books. Then I listened to all the books on CD. I just finished listening to Neil Gaiman read Stardust-magnificent, but not the same as the movie, there were some changes made, but that is not to say the changes were bad because they were fine, it is just that they filmed a variation of the story Neil wrote. And what a story, such imagination. I cannot fault a single performance. Claire Danes is a favorite of mine and I loved her performance, Robert DeNiro pulled no punches and was delightful, Nathaniel Parker is always worth watching, as Thomas Lynley, Gabriel Oaks, even that nasty character from Bleak House, Charlie Cox grew into a man right before my eyes, an outstanding job, I thought Peter O'Toole's performance, though short, was perfect. I look forward to seeing more of Charlie Cox. I have recommended this movie to everyone who will listen to me. It is a joy!

","I watched the movie without really expecting much from it. Actually, I was expecting a mish-mash of celebrity cameos, glitzy but pointless special effects, and a weak story. But I was completely wrong! This is a rollicking romp of a romantic fantasy, full of charm and wit. It's a story and setting that might seem more suited for children, but completely sparked my imagination as an adult. Many fantasy movies, especially ones adapted from books, fail to capture the world that the author imagined and created. But this one succeeded wonderfully--the atmosphere, the characters, even the political nuances, seemed real and believable.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer was excellent as the wicked witch, and Clair Danes made a lovely Star.

","Synopsis: To win the heart of his beloved Victoria (Sienna Miller), Tristan (Charlie Cox) promises to bring her a fallen star by her birthday. However, he gets more than he bargained for when the star turns out to be a woman named Yvaine (Claire Danes) who is being pursued by witches and princes alike...<br/><br/>I floved it! This movie just captivated me from the beginning - I went in unspoiled and knew only the bare-bones of the plot. All around solid acting - the characters weren't particularly deep or nuanced but it's not a character-driven film anyway. Danes and Cox had great chemistry, but there really wasn't a weak link in the cast.<br/><br/>The plot is rather predictable for the most part (it is a fairy tale, after all) with a few small twists. I do have a few minor quibbles (e.g. there was that old movie cliché where the villain could've easily killed the protagonists but didn't because they moved too slowly) but at the end of the film, I wanted to watch it again - which is surely a good sign (and I did eventually watch it again, on a plane, and enjoyed it then, too).<br/><br/>It's simply a beautiful film, and the cinematography is excellent. Stardust is good enough become a beloved classic, so it's a shame that it did poorly at the box office, and that it seems like no one knows about this film! It's suitable for all ages and would be a great family film. But unlike movies like Shrek, the reason it's appealing to adults is not because of some adult jokes and themes but because it brings out the child in you. It's just an enchanting, gem of a film that I totally fell in love with."

It had a little something for our whole family - romance, magic, humour, pirates, etc. It's so unfair that a great fantasy film can get lost in the shuffle amid the 'less than spectacular - but hugely promoted' movies of the summer. This movie will be one of our favourites I'm sure."

","I just want to say that i think this is the best, most beautiful movie of all time and its totally worth watching. Now i don't want to spoil the experience for anyone but i can say it's full of love, humor and action, it makes a great adventure for any day. The humor spikes several times and you cant help laughing out loud. Except from some minor goofs, such as non-synced audio-video during a minute the film is pretty goof free too, and i have seen my share of bad movies. The actors are all great, how it would have been with other actors we'll never know but i don't think Stardust could get any better though. I was deeply touched several times during this film. You have not seen a good movie until you see Stardust, try it.Ten out of 10 stars<br/><br/>p.s if anyone knows any movie like this please tell me"
"crmorrison","10","1","1","29 January 2008"," A beautiful, magical and wonderful story..
","Stardust stayed with me long after i watched, enthralled, the first time. Claire Danes is one of my favourite actresses and her portrayal of Yvain is magnificent. Yvain is punchy and feminine. The best kind of heroine. Throw in Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Mark Strong and the strength of each performance pulls the eager viewer through various unfolding plots. <br/><br/>On so many levels Stardust was more than i was expecting. Less Disney and more labyrinth, less twee and goofy, somehow more solid and totally enchanting. <br/><br/>The combination of a stellar cast, some of the UK's finest comedians and the surprise of a relatively unknown but undeniable talent in Charlie Cox - who comfortably handles the male lead - Stardust is both genuinely comedic and engaging. A very satisfying adaptation, Gaiman obviously knew who to trust."
"AloysiusWeasley","9","1","1","24 January 2008"," Simply fabulous!
","*********Quite Minor Spoilers******** Warning ahead of time - this is one of the (very small) handful of movies where I have not yet read the novel upon which it is based! Okay, on to the review! This movie has been called one of the sleeper hits of 2007, most likely because it didn't get near the promotion it (richly) deserved. Imagine my surprise to visit the IMDb page to find such a well-deserved high rating! Definitely brightened my day.<br/><br/>So let me tell you why I think this movie is fabulous. With such a-list actors, you knew the performances were going to be stellar (no pun intended ;), but they exceeded even my lofty expectations. The soundtrack was wonderful, and though the F/X left a teensy bit to be desired, they were far better than many other films I've seen. The story was quite original and moved along briskly - even though there were some slightly slow points, they were filled with rich emotion, and by the end of the movie, you'll know exactly what Clair Danes meant in her lengthy scene on love.<br/><br/>Now, why didn't I give this a '10'? Well, for starters, I don't hand out the highest rating but sparingly. For second, there were two specific things I did not particularly enjoy. For one, when the goat-turned-landlord was turned permanently (and probably lethally) back into a goat, when the body hit the floor (for which we are gifted with a close-up), it is OBVIOUSLY a mannequin. I don't know if this was to absolutely satisfy the rather alarming organization known as PETA, but it did not even bend as it hit the floor, as though the goat was made of wood.<br/><br/>As for my last complaint, as I said, I have not yet read the book, but somehow I doubt it contained a cross-dressing, rather....(light-wristed, shall we say?) pirate. I'm sure there were far more interesting things cut from the book that could have been used in place of this...this...polite words fail me. All I can say is, I felt Robert DeNiro was sadly utilized in this manner. For a few minutes of the film, I was sharply reminded of his role in ""Meet the Parents"", and this was certainly undesirable.<br/><br/>However, other than those two small mishaps, this is one of my new favorite fantasy films of all time, a few steps below the LotR trilogy, and slightly above the first Harry Potter (the first was great, the second was decent, but the rest are trash). This film is indeed wonderfully magical, and something my heart, jaded from far too many book-to-movie Hollywood disasters, sorely needed."
"my_anywhere","10","1","1","21 January 2008"," A Star Rises From the Dust
","Once upon a time there was an author by the name of Neil Gaiman who decided to dazzle us all by presenting us to a magical world unlike any other we'd ever seen. In this world there was magic and fairies, witches and pirates. There was everything you could ever want in a fantasy. He named it Stardust.<br/><br/>Eight years later, Paramount Pictures Movies Production Company hired director Matthew Vaughn to bring to life this fairytale for the big screen. A tremendous job since the book was so beautifully written and eloquently told. With a limited budget he was to create a movie with outrageous special effects, spells at every turn, and action on a large scale. All while making it believable and entertaining.<br/><br/>Could he pull it off? The answer is yes.<br/><br/>Very seldom am I able to use the sentence: The movie was better than the book. Seldom, but here it fits the case. The movie Stardust was filled with mind-blowing action sequences, witty humor, clever lines, and a gripping plot line that slightly differed from that of the novel but was completely for the better. There is something for every viewer: action, romance, comedy, fantasy, horror; all brought together in a near-perfect way.<br/><br/>A modern fairytale, Stardust begins in a different place, the fictional country of wall just outside Great Britain. The city is named Wall because of the stone barrier surrounding it. Nobody is allowed to cross the barrier, neither citizens of wall, or those outside wall. Yet young Dunstan Thorn is mischievous and tricks the guard and escapes to the outside world where he meets the lovely Una at the fairy market. They fall in love and she gives birth to their son, Tristan Thorn, who is the main focus of the movie. When he is grown, he is just like his father: wanting to be outside the enclosure in which he has grown up. To win the heart of the icy Victoria, of whom he is love, he promises her that he will bring her the fallen star they see as they picnic on a grassy starlit hill.<br/><br/>From there the movie only gets better, drawing to a close with a satisfying climax and the perfect ending.<br/><br/>Even though it is two-plus hours, the movie didn't feel a minute too long as most movies of the same length do. Charlie Cox (Tristan) and Claire Danes (Yvainne) delight throughout the entire movie, taking us along a ride that includes Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Sienna Miller among others. If there was any flaw in this movie it was that it was severely under-promoted and could have done much better had it been advertised more."
"kajecounterhack","9","1","1","20 January 2008"," Brilliantly done
","Really brings out the meaning of love as a word, a true love story...a classic. The story is absolutely beautiful and the acting is funny at nobody's expense. The killing is sort of sudden - everyone gets pushed down a cliff or stabbed in the chest without much thought; I thought that added a lot to the affect of the movie, as did the ghosts. Danes' acting was superb and the movie pulled off a great balance of action comedy and romance. I think I enjoyed this movie also because the female actresses were not overly gorgeous or overdone (being a guy, I don't know if the same goes for De Niro) but the charisma of the characters is what creates that ethos a person will feel during the movie. It was definitely one of the best movies I've seen this year."

","It's too bad this film was overlooked both in award nominations and in recognition from others. It was also overlooked in the theaters because it was only shown for about 2 weeks I think. This film is imaginative, beautifully photographed, well-acted, and just plain entertaining. It has humor, suspense, action scenes,romance, and more. How did this gem get through without a lot of hype,and without any nominations for awards? It has a lot of good people in it  and the part Robert DeNiro plays, he does SUCH a good job at.

The concept of the Star was exceptionally original.<br/><br/>My spoiler is in my comments below re the book.<br/><br/>I think others have said it all re the movie, which we will want to see again (and perhaps again!) I'd just mention the book which is charming although slightly too fey in style to be perfect. And it's rather sadder than the movie - with something of the same fate for the Star as Elrond sees for Arwen in Lord of the Rings, the only difference being we don't know what happens to the Star eventually. That said, a very good read, don't miss it!"

True to its genre and form. Simple story and easy to follow unlike some other fantasy films. Very enjoyable with great cast. Funny moments abound. I loved Gervais and Deniro. Cox and Dane are lovable and fun to watch. Special effects weren't WOW, but did not distract. The lines are typical British witty and sarcastic at times.

He finally finds away to the other side of the wall and finds the star. The other side of the wall is a land of magic and witches, of 2 headed miniature elephants, of flying pirate ships, of kings, etc.<br/><br/>The main story is about trying to return the star back to his town and to the girl that he thought he loved, within a week...... before she would marry another man.<br/><br/>............. I will say this. Although I loved the whole movie,... Robert DeNiro stole his screens. I never thought I would see him like this. You will see what I mean.<br/><br/>(end spoilers)"
"denis888","8","1","1","30 December 2007"," A Fairy Tale Not For Little Kids
","Oh, what a mixed impression! Take Michelle Pfeiffer, add Robert De Niro, Rupert Everett, Sienna Miller and then throw is some brutal jokes, gay innuendos, magic worlds, incantations, miracles, Unicorns, blue blood (literally), love story, flying ships in the Lexx style  and what will you get? A tasteless, banal, lascivious mess of a film? No, Stardust  a very humorous, deeply funny and highly entertaining 2 hours of a very good movie. At the very start, the film smacked of some bad, borrowed Lord Of The Rings  style parody, but with the course of time, it got only better in amazing proportions. Be warned, this is not the film for little kids, it has such gooey moments like De Niro as a gay pirate captain, or Pfeiffer as a merciless murderer. The film has so many gory scenes and sexual hints that it borders on adult fringe. This is not a classic fairy tale in a classic sense of the word. No, it has so much of a tragedy, so much of a broken romance and of violent historic costume drama. There are many highlights here. Peter O'Toole as a senile dying king is one of them as well as the seven dead but very much alive ghosts of king's murdered sons. After all, De Niro's gay dance with cross dressing is a pure explosion of risky but extremely clever humor. 10 points go to his pirate crew, the bunch of slightly dumb but yet valiant commandos. A very exceptional treat for those with wide world view."

When it comes to this genre of movie, it has it all: a super story line, a great cast peppered with unexpected ""names"", and in the end, a roaring, never-let-go, predictable yet 100% satisfying tale.<br/><br/>Excellent direction, top notch production values, a satisfying and well performing cast.<br/><br/>Stardust is near perfect.

This movie's highlight I think is the music, perfectly in place with the on screen action (or romance) and is the perfect companion. The acting is top notch, and I must give Robert DeNiro a round of applause for his role. But, as with any movie,it has its faults. Some of the lines were delivered a little too forcefully, and also some inconsistencies which are too obvious detract from this gem. This is a must buy if you did not see this in theaters.

"gradyharp","10","1","1","20 December 2007"," More then a whiff of stardust! MAGIC!
","Films that depend heavily on special effects as created by computer generated graphics have never been too interesting for this viewer - and that, of late, covers a lot of territory from the Harry Potter series through the continuous glut of sci-fi films, vampire tales, and apocalyptic epics, etc. But there is something very different about STARDUST that brings it into a realm of solid storytelling simply enhanced by well-done special effects, and that difference is in the story itself, an unabashed fairy tale populated with wonderful characters played by some of our finest actors.<br/><br/>And it all begins with a wall (according to the narrator, Ian McKellen) that separates the real world from an enchanted place and through that wall runs a young lad who starts the frolic. Flash forward and the child of the runaway lad, Tristan (a magnetically alive Charlie Cox), has groan to maturity and has fallen in love with the beautiful Victoria (Sienna Miller) who demands a star from Tristan to prove his love. The magic begins when that 'star' falls from the sky in the form of Yvaine (Claire Danes, radiant even without the halo that surrounds her). The foul witch Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) and her wicked sisters become aware and plan to cut out the heart of Yvaine in order to gain immortality. The little village is also under the stranglehold of the impending loss of their king (Peter O'Toole) and there is a struggle among the seven sons to ascend the throne: the seventh son Septimus (Mark Strong) defeats his now spirit brothers and sets off to gain the stone that Yvaine wears which will give him immortality. The on-the-run groups encounter a pirate, Captain Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro in a splendid role), who captures lightening in a marvelous flying ship manned by a swarthy crew. Of course Tristan and Yvaine become his 'captives', only to discover that the fey closet queen captain is on their side against the forces of evil. As the film progresses Tristan and Yvaine gradually fall in love, negating their past histories, and the ending is another act of pure magic: evil succumbs to good in the best of fairytale ways.<br/><br/>The cast is uniformly excellent, from the true star turns by Pfeiffer, DeNiro, Danes, and Cox to the secondary roles equally well cast. The special effects are beautiful and very much in keeping with the story instead of simply breeding monsters to emerge from the bowels of the earth to destroy civilization. Everyone involved, from the director Matthew Vaughn to the writers Jane Goldman with Vaughn (and of course the creator of the novel Neil Gaiman) to the cast, seem to keep tongue in cheek and appear to be having as much fun as we the audience. It is a light, exceptionally beautiful fantasy that is pure joy! Grady Harp"

","After my huge disappointment with ""Golden Compass"" I spontaneously decided to give this one a try. I didn't get disappointed. Though ""Stardust"" only takes two hours it makes excellent use of every second. Great storytelling (also thanks to the novel by Gaiman), well done cinematography, effective music, good acting and the long breath you need to tell fantasy like this.<br/><br/>In my point of view especially the first hour was a fabulous experience. In comparison to ""Golden Compass"" I think that ""Stardust"" director Matthew Vaughn did right what Chris Weitz did wrong. Though ""Stardust"" works with typical and familiar fable schemes it feels fresh. The story never shies away from making unconventional use of these schemes.<br/><br/>In a short: so for those who wonder how good fantasy might look like on the big screen 2007 I'd just say: here you go !

"burakarslan","9","1","1","8 December 2007"," Fantastic story, combined with love and today's humans
","I had seen the movie not before anyone, or with a premier, but rather later than everyone I guess. The movie was released in the beginning of 2007 and it has been 9 months when I first had the chance to see it. The story was first a kind of interesting but regular stories; at least it seemed so in the beginning 30 minutes or something. However, when the star had hit the other side of the Wall, it began to seem interesting. I will not talk about the content, most of the people who are reading these will probably have seen the movie. But what is really good about Stardust is first the combination of the actors, both young talents and the experts meet up in the movie. In addition to the combination of these actors, although the movie passes in a fantastic world in a non existing kingdom; the idea is simple. It basically represents the greedy, power hunger people around the world and those who are pushed hard by these people. At all, I really recommend you guys to see it if you have not, the effects are well done, the actors are fantastic (especially Robert De Niro while dancing in a woman's dress and while serving meals and drinks to the two others) and the idea beneath makes me think about today's worlds of power..."

"jluis1984","8","1","1","6 December 2007"," An excellent tale of romance and fantasy...
","In the late 80s, a new generation of writers changed the American comic book industry forever with the complex mature-themed nature of their stories, effectively transforming what was considered an unsophisticated literary genre into a well respected art form. Among that group of storytellers was Neil Gaiman, a young British writer who decided to try his luck at comic books convinced by his friend, Alan Moore (writer of the classic graphic novel ""Watchmen""). After landing a job at DC comics, Gaiman started the series that would make him famous, ""The Sandman"", the comic book where his taste for fantasy and great imagination found no limits. Years later Gaiman returned to prose, and so he decided to make a fantasy novel in the style of classic English fantasy, the one that used to be done before the days of Tolkien and Lewis' high fantasy. And the result was ""Stardust"".<br/><br/>""Stardust"" is the story of Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox), a humble young man hopelessly in love with the most beautiful girl in his town, Victoria (Sienna Miller). To his misfortune, she has accepted a marriage proposal by Humphrey (Henry Cavill), so he decides to give her an ultimate proof of his love: a star has fallen from the sky, so he tells Victoria that he'll bring it to her, even if that means to cross the legendary wall that separates their town from the mysterious forest. What Tristan doesn't know, is that the wall exists to separate his world from the magical realm of Stormhold, and that he is not the only one looking for the star, as a powerful witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) wants it to be young again, and two princes (Mark Strong and Jason Flemyng) need it to claim the throne of Stormhold. However, the biggest surprise will be the star's identity.<br/><br/>Screenwriter Jane Goldman and director Matthew Vaughn make a nice adaptation of Gaiman's novel that keeps the story's core points, although they toned down the darkness of the novel quite a bit. This is not really a bad thing, as in the process, Goldman and Vaughn remained faithful to the novel's spirit and the result is a movie that joyfully plays with witty comedy, fantasy and romance, and yet it's still completely in tone with the fantasy stories that inspired Gaiman's book. In essence, ""Stardust"" is what could be called ""a fairy tale for grown-ups"", as it's fantasy is whimsical, clever and very imaginative, but with a greater emphasis on the characters and their development than in any epic scale adventure. And this is where ""Stardust"" has its strongest point: the character development is remarkably well done, and even those characters with very short screen time are unforgettable.<br/><br/>While ""Stardust"" is a very different (and more ambitious) film to his previous movie, 2004's ""Layer Cake"", director Matthew Vaughn manages to make it work by concentrating in the story and letting everything else grow from there. Since comedy and romance are now the main ingredients of the film, Vaughn focuses the film on his characters, specially in the relationship the main couple. Still, while ""Stardust"" lacks the epic scope of high fantasy films, Vaughn manages to make his story a very beautiful looking one, giving life to the kingdom of Stormhold with a beautiful Victorian style and good care for details. Sadly, a fantasy film like ""Stardust"" fantasy films tends to relay a lot on special effects, and budgetary reasons prevented Vaughn from making truly stunning visuals, however, the ones that appear are good enough to make Stormhold come to life.<br/><br/>As written above, ""Stardust"" is a fantasy movie where the characters have more importance than the story, so a good cast is needed to make it work. Well, the movie is benefited by a great supporting cast that includes Ricky Gervais, Peter O'Toole, a truly unforgettable Robert De Niro and Michelle Pfeiffer in what is definitely her great return to mainstream movies. Sadly, the main couple, Charlie Cox and Claire Danes, get easily overshadowed by the supporting cast's performances, specially Cox, whom despite having great natural charm still feels a bit weak in the lead role. Danes fares a bit better, as there are scenes that truly allow her to shine in her character. By the way, I must say that while his role is kind of limited, Mark Strong is excellent as prince Septimus, and delivers some of the best swashbuckling scenes of the last times.<br/><br/>Being an accomplished mix of fantasy, romance and comedy in the classic style of fairy tales, ""Stardust""'s worst enemy may be it's very consciously attempt to pay homage to that kind of fantasy tales. In a time where adaptations of high fantasy books like ""The Lord of the Rings"" or ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" are popular, it would be easy to expect ""Stardust"" to follow that pattern, but it doesn't and it may turn off people expecting epic battles instead of romantic swashbuckling. If there's a recent movie that bears any similitude to this film, that one would be ""The Princess Bride"" (also based on a novel), although Reiner's film is certainly grounded even more on the comedy genre. There are details in the lead actors' performances, and the already mentioned troubles in some visual effects, but these are minor quibbles that don't really hurt the film.<br/><br/>While not exactly a masterpiece of the genre, ""Stardust"" is still one of the best fantasy films of the last years, and most definitely a worthy adaptation of Gaiman's novel. Whimsical and lighthearted but also witty and clever at the same time, ""Stardust"" proves that not every fantasy film must be about saving the world from an evil dark lord, and that romantic comedies must not be unnecessarily sappy affairs. This excellent tale of fantasy and romance is great for fans of both genres. Comparisons to ""The Princess Bride"" can't be avoided, but this film is almost as good as that fantasy classic.<br/><br/>8/10"

","Even considering the risk of being accused of plagiarism I cannot help but think that the summary I mentioned is perhaps the best thing to be said about this movie. I can not blame the side that chooses to discredit the film, nor the other one. I find that, in order to appreciate this film you need to have the kind of spirit that still believes in fairy tales, as long as they aren't exaggerated and do not give you the exact feeling that they are what they're supposed to be... not real. The movie, if compared to masterpieces of the fantasy genre does not excel through anything. However it provides a well cooked recipe of different stereotypical fantasy elements as well as a handful of original ones, while not wearing out the prior. It manages to stop things exactly when you believe they are going to become corny, provides laughs in the most unexpected of situations, and makes you leave the cinema with a warm feeling in your heart. At least that's the kind of impression left on most of the people I've talked to after they saw the movie. The acting isn't excellent (except for Robert De Niro's portrayal of a fairly gay captain :)) ), however it delivers as it should, and doesn't end up being lackluster in certain areas. The fighting scenes, although rare are very entertaining and fun to watch, especially the concept of a corpse being controlled via a voodoo doll. However I will stop the foolish analysis of all the separate elements of the film because the quality lies in the sum of its parts, not in the individuality of them. All in all, the first impression that the film left on me was that of a pleasant surprise, when I realized that decent adaptations of fantasy books can still be made. If you enjoy fairy tales that end with a happily ever after, without exaggerating it, then this is the movie for you. If you fall in the other category, you might still enjoy the film as a general experience."
"ga-bsi","10","1","1","29 November 2007"," Stardust
","When I watched this movie for the first time it was like seeing a fantasy movie that was actually more fantasy for a change and not convoluted by too much romance, too few villains or over the top effects that were placed in a part to fill space. The performances in this movie were wonderful, and didn't reek of reading from a board or being too over practiced. The cast meshed naturally and didn't feel the need to act as if they really were just acting for a film. The ideas of the story were great too, and they really stuck to the book. I'm also happy that they used cynical humour if you will, rather than humour that was too obvious or complex. The emotions that the characters also portrayed were not those of a soap opera, but believable enough to be put into everyday life. When Claire Danes confesses her love for Charlie Cox, it was so cute because he was a mouse in that bit and she was a star who claimed to be cynical about love. Also Claire is absolutely stunning and manages to be a good actress without making other females get wildly irritated with her because she obviously sold her looks rather than developed her acting. Charlie was so sweet too, he portrayed boyish charm and innocence, as well as being slightly inexperienced in many areas without seeming too dim. Sienna Miller was lovely as the stuck up love of Charlie's life, perfect as the girl in the small village who is beautiful and has been spoilt by obvious attention from every male this side of the seven seas. Micheal Phiffer was absolutely superb as the wicked witch, managing to be beautiful and hideous in the movie and still make me laugh. And the cast of brothers were so hilarious that the fact that they each had a hand in one another's demise didn't make me utterly shocked and stuck on that matter. Peter O' Tool was very funny as the father too in his cameo. I am absolutely in love with this film all round! I went to see a fantasy and also got love, adventure, drama, dark comedy, and I wasn't so bored that I could guess every line the actors would say before hand and also expect a happy ending from the get go! It was also refreshing to see Robert Di Nero as a transvestite pirate! What more can you possibly hope for in a movie? Trust me previews and trailers and teasers of this film do not do it justice!!"
"rockhallfame","9","1","1","25 November 2007"," Impeccable work of high fantasy empowers the genre and showcases a great array of international talent!
","Nutshell: Fun, endearing and exciting movie. High quality entertainment which I will be returning to very soon with equal anticipation.<br/><br/>Having not had what I can imagine is the pleasure of reading Gaiman's novel before seeing this film, I entered the cinema with an entirely open mind. Arguably without the dynastic nature of Tolkien, Rowling or Pullman's stories being imposed upon the source material it perhaps would have had less bearing anyway. The fans can be the greatest threat to an adaptation so with some relief I can avoid the concerns of whether or not it was a faithful conversion.<br/><br/>Overall I can only say that this, from any critical angle, was a tremendous film. Naysayers of the fantasy genre will frankly have to keep their traps shut; if you don't like fish, don't eat it. Stardust is a wonderful experience visually and emotionally, with an entirely appropriate and enjoyable score/soundtrack to support it. The story itself keeps an excellent pace and absolutely epitomizes the wonderful nature of fantasy, with a diverse array of intelligently conceived, multidimensional characters. It doesn't dwell on irritating issues like the acceptance of unusual circumstances by our protagonist Tristan but most importantly is coherent and comes about full circle. Really a very great job by the screenwriters and presumably initially Gaiman. The beautiful motif of the worthlessness of eternity without love runs subtle and yet strong throughout. <br/><br/>Every actor is a delight to watch on screen, from the main characters to the supporting roles. The British audience will see a myriad of nationally renowned stars, many of whom are pushing the international forum with continuing success, as well aided by this film. Charlie Cox stands out strongly and brightly in his debut lead, an excellent performance. Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer are marvelous and even further refute the long standing taboo of Americans attempting English accents. The character of Septimus (well played by Mark Strong) as with chief villain Lamia (Pfeiffer) both have much superior depth to most film antagonists, a rare treat, and Sienna Miller portrays the bratty village beauty perfectly. And De Niro... oh De Niro.. thank you. I shall say no more of him. It was perhaps a little cheeky giving McKellen (narration) and O'Toole primary billing but regardless both castings in their respective roles were a nice touch, as were every recognized face from Gervais to Everett to Fleming, Fletcher and Williams... (deep breath), and more! The audience loves a cameo, especially when it doesn't appear exploitative and by intelligent management of character involvement, Stardust also avoids the ensemble cast effect.<br/><br/>In closing, another strength was the elegantly applied use of CGI and Spectacle (with a capital S). In the wake of the sword and sandals/epic fantasy boom we've seen a number of films rely heavily on grand set pieces that usually lack enough creativity to make up for other deficiencies in story or acting (how many can you name?). Stardust spares us the ordeal of a mighty battle or vast employment of special effects, rather choosing to let the characters and well timed pace keep you riveted. This is not to say you will leave feeling cheated for oohs and ahs moments. When they come they are expertly executed and the violence can and probably will catch you off guard at times.<br/><br/>Stardust comes with my highest praise, I would recommend it to anyone. Let's see if the Golden Compass can keep the ball rolling for fantasy!!"
"andyhodges","10","1","1","24 November 2007"," Spellbinding
","This movie, for me, is what going to the cinema is all about. I was captivated from start to finish and can only wish more movies are made like this. If you go to the cinema to enjoy yourself and to suspend reality for a couple of hours then this film is for you. Everything is balanced perfectly. First of all the characters are all either very well rounded and engage you completely (eg Claire Danes) or at the very least just great fun (Michelle Pfeiffer, Robert DeNiro). <br/><br/>The story itself is very clever. On face value the plot is very simple, however it has several strands to it that all come together perfectly and in hindsight it is only the quality of the storytelling that makes the plot seem so straightforward.<br/><br/>Emotionally the movie engaged me thoroughly. The love story element was balanced nicely with humour and as a result the film is both funny and romantic.<br/><br/>Finally the action pieces are fast moving and imaginative and cleverly interwoven with the romance and the humour. (In some places all three aspects are strongly present at the same time).<br/><br/>In short this is a spellbinding film. In many ways it is old fashioned storytelling at its best and yet this is one of the best 'modern' films I have seen in a long time."
"lynda-steele","9","1","1","23 November 2007"," Great fantasy - superb characters
","Loved it, and had to stay right through the credits to listen to Take That's 'Rule the World'. A rip roaring adventure with many a humorous line. Great cameos from the likes of Ricky Gervais (The Office) and Mark Williams (Mr Weasley in Harry Potter). Good parts also played by Michelle Pfieffer and Robert De Niro. It was a real story not a bunch of effects but there were enough effects to take you out of this world and into Stormhold the world beyond the wall. A true laughing out loud film which uses subtle humour and not profanity to titillate the audience.Its rated PG in UK but only as scary as any fairy tale so most kids would lap it up. Iwould recommend this to anyone who wants to escape the toil of daily living and who still has the heart of a child"

","This movie is what we go to the cinema for. Everybody compare it to Princess Bride and with very good reason. How good was Princess Bride? this one is even better, with contemporary acting and nice effects this movie really stands out among the rubbish that we see today. Very good acting and a very good story line (actually one of the best I've recently seen) make for one of the best cinematic experience in recent years. Most of the people I know loved it and you need to be a bit dark hearted / highly pessimistic, maybe someone who watched too many horror movies for his pleasure, not to like Stardust. Go see it, you won't be disappointed."
"vinsond21","9","1","1","10 November 2007"," A magical tale with twists and surprises at every turn
","It's a long story, as one often says, but in this case, the ride is well worth it. Stardust is a wonderfully inventive fairy tale, filled with twists and surprises at every turn. If you enjoy movies like Ladyhawke, then you will like this one even more. And for a film that is just 127 minutes long, it sure packs a lot. The engaging storyline, accompanied by a rousing score, unfolds like a gift being teasingly unwrapped; and by the end, the package is neatly tied-up again, topped off with a resplendent bow. Young Charlie Cox leads a starry cast, and they all gamely deliver deliciously off-beat performances. Stardust is a visual feast, and a tale that satisfies both the mind and the heart."
"kurosawa14","9","1","1","10 November 2007"," Not your typical Fairy Tale
","Star Dust turns out to be more than a fairy tale, it's a STAR tale and it is indeed a star movie to catch. I had gone to the cinemas expecting a break from the typical school stress just before the winter break and I was rewarded with more than what I had expected from it.<br/><br/>Yes it has a happily ever after ending, that was just part and parcel of a huge and well-plotted fairy tale production. More than that, Star Dust featured budding leads and had a strong supporting cast. The animations were superb. Their costumes were very detailed and elaborate (you know how mundane magical characters costumes can be). The dialogs were engaging. The characters were very nicely characterized, I have to admit I even felt for the bad characters at some point in the movie. Star Dust had indeed brought me on a ride for the full 2 hours.<br/><br/>If you want a taste of fantasy but felt that stories such as Die Hard have a plot too real for such, Star Dust will be a good movie to satisfy your craving for an action-packed, fun-loving fantasy that don't just end with a happy ending but also a smile on your face. Highly recommended to watch it with your loved ones! <br/><br/>WQ"
"pveggie","9","1","1","10 November 2007"," A great adaption
","As a fan of Neil Gaiman's book on which this film is based, I was very excited about this film's release and simultaneously expecting a let down. The film was very satisfying though, and one of my favourites this year.<br/><br/>Set in the town of Wall and the fairytale world of Stormhold adjoining it, Stardust is the story of Tristin Thorn, a young man prepared to go to unusual lengths to prove himself to the woman he loves.<br/><br/>Tristan crosses into Stormhold to retrieve a fallen star for his intended sweetheart, but his quest is complicated by a number of other interested parties - including a trio of powerful and deadly witches hoping to regain their youth, and the Lords of Stormhold battling it out for succession to the throne.<br/><br/>The story mixes adventure, humour and emotion to great effect, and it is enjoyable to see how disparate threads become woven together.<br/><br/>Reader's of Neil Gaiman's book can expect a number of changes from the original story, but the charm of the novel still abounds here. Besides, I was to busy laughing to be concerned with adaption blasphemy.<br/><br/>Expect top-notch performances from all the cast. Claire Danes in particular surprised me with a spot-on portrayal of Yvaine.<br/><br/>All in all highly recommended, but go easy on the soda as this film is fairly lengthy.<br/><br/>A last minute addendum - don't be put off by the dodgy Take That song in the promos, I promise you will not have to hear this until the credits."
"Willard1975","10","1","1","5 November 2007"," Captivating
","This is a fairy tale about fantasy, humor, and love. Rarely do we see these elements combined together in a movie this way. There are usually always war and slaughtering involved to tell the tale/story in a fantasy world.<br/><br/>With all the wrongs going on in our world, this is just what we need. A love story that will make the human heart tingle with warmth, and respect love for what it is, something truly amazing.... And maybe, just maybe we can all learn something from it.<br/><br/>I mainly concern myself with the story in any tale, whether a movie or a computer game. Graphics/effects etc are not so important to me. So here are some of my character remarks:<br/><br/>Claire Danes: Is absolutely adorable as Yvaine. Cute, funny and vulnerable to the new world she finds herself in.<br/><br/>Charlie Cox: I can't say very much about him since i've never seen him in a movie before. But he is perfect for the role.<br/><br/>Robert De Niro: Is a good as always, complementing on his comedy streak from his Meet the parents performances, which i personally like.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer: I always knew she had a mean streak when i first heard her say ""I'm Catwoman"" in Batman Returns. She excels in her role as villain.<br/><br/>Ian McKellen: Is a great actor/voice actor and brings a softness to the prologue and epilogue with his soft/English-accent voice.<br/><br/>Supporting Actors: Also very well cast, no complaints here.<br/><br/>Deepest respect to the writers of this wonderful story, and the director for making this a warm, and lovable movie to remember for a long time to come.<br/><br/>May you all live happily ever after."
"sweavo","9","1","1","4 November 2007"," But of course! Nothing says ""romance"" like a kidnapped injured woman!
","Comparisons to the Princess Bride are inevitable, but unlike PB this movie does not break the fourth wall. In Princess Bride much of the humour comes from in-jokes with the audience, parody of the genre, and knowing caricature. PB comes off as a sort of audience-participation experience.<br/><br/>Stardust does not come out of the screen to meet the audience, it draws the audience into the world. We watch as a world of wonder unfolds, just a short walk from Victorian England. The story is of a naive village boy's growth into a man, and the lengths he goes to to win true love.<br/><br/>Direction is for the most part smooth and natural and the film flows beautifully apart from the intro (though I think there was a technical problem in the theatre). The real genius here is that the moments of comedy never compromise the drama of the situation. The scenes in the Inn are a great example of tense crisis perfectly interwoven with a number of hilarious sub-plots. This is British humour at its best - humane, warm, unexpected, and present even in the darkest of situations."
"Exeron","8","1","1","1 November 2007"," Stardust
","It was filled with Adventure,excitement, and some humor scenes too.<br/><br/>In the beginning it didn't look much, some stars forming the shape of the title. And a Shakespeare theme that made it all a bit special. The movie didn't have any long and unnecessary parts , which made me happy. And then the moment i've been waiting for...De Niro....as a pirate. One of the best role he've ever had, he must been going through a change of his acting style or he got paid a lot, Because he've never played a more unique role then that, so this goes out to you De Niro fans, he's good in this one. anyway so the movie had some good laughter and some cool special FX scenes, other than that it was just a normal fantasy movie, but filled with great actors, was surprised when Richie Gervais appeared. So that's why i rated 9. Excellent choice of actors and screen play."

Every single role is well played. Robert deNiro and Michelle Pfeiffer must have had a good time while shooting this movie.

"Naoum","8","1","1","31 October 2007"," An unfortunate change of events (from the book)
","Being a great fan of Neil Gaiman I expected something more like the book... Have to say this is my favorite book! However, the changes from the book were at many times distasteful to the original feeling of the book. From being a mastery of writing this movie left me unsatisfied with mainly the changes of the plot as to the end, the character of Una, the romance parts and the acting abilities of Yvaine... In some points towards the end it reminded me of the movie ""Sweet November"" in a ""love conquers all"" kind of way which trust me, was not good...<br/><br/>So, my main question is... why not trust the (original) writer? My hypothesis on that would be that nothing is to be left for thinking or implied - much like a ""fast food"" movie... What a pity for such a masterpiece of a book!<br/><br/>Just to be fair, I have to add that Robert De Niro is absolutely brilliant in delivering his character!"
"ja_kitty_71","10","1","1","30 October 2007"," A fantasy in the tradition of ""Howl's Moving Castle""
","As I said many,many times: I have a nack for literary films (movies that are based on books), and fantasy is my favorite genre. Stardust is truly a fantasy in the tradition of ""Howl's Moving Castle"": a Victorian-style setting and with fairies and witches from another world. <br/><br/>After I have seen the movie, I thought it was an excellent film, and I have even read the original book. You know, in the original book, Tristan's dad Dunstan, after his encounter with the lovely Una, he married a woman named Daisy Hempstock, and after Tristan was found on the door step, they had a daughter named Lousia. So that means in the book, Tristan had a stepmother and a stepsister.<br/><br/>I love Yvaine, the star that fell from the sky because of the medallion of Stronghold. Claire Danes was perfectly cast as her, although it's kind of hard to pronounce the ""y"" and ""v"" together of her name. And It was so beautiful to watch her quite literally glow as she fell in love with Tristan; they are really a cute couple. I mean Victoria & Humphrey deserve each other; she (Victoria) really wasn't worth IT!"

"bmoredlj","9","1","1","19 August 2007"," Stars fell on Wall
","But it's okay. Stardust is a fun, optimistic romp that doesn't take itself too seriously. The storytelling is rich and intriguing, and all of the characters play their roles with genuine relish and exuberance.The plot has some holes, the movie drags in places, and the score is unspectacular (to say the least) but none of this was enough to ruin the very palatable 130 minute film (not so long, in this age of LOTR and Harry Potter films pushing or surpassing 3 hours.) Of course the film isn't as epic as LOTR, but nor does it borrow heavily, stylistically or narratively.<br/><br/>I never read the 200-odd page novella the film is based upon, but I felt like this was a case when the story did not suffer from the conversion in the way a 700 or 800 page fantasy novel inevitably does. This is not a fantasy film for everyone. Whereas no one ever breaks a smile in LOTR, and even when jokes are told they're stilted, Stardust is very much a film of casual conversation, which really brings the film down to earth. Ominous portents and portentous ominations spouted by deep-throated she-elves is all well and good, but its cold; detached (incidently, Sir Ian McKellan provides a few minutes of narration in the opening and closing, but that's it.) That brings me to the sizable cast. I thought I would hate the protagonist, Tristan (Charlie Cox) but he wasn't that bad. He and Claire Danes have the chemistry required for the love story. Danes is extremely watchable as the extremely blonde fallen star whose attitude towards Tristan starts out as hilarious loathing, but evolves, as it must. Sienna Miller, Peter O'Toole, and Ricky Gervais, while all competent, play admittedly small roles. The main antagonists, the witch (Michelle Pfiffer) and the selfish prince (Mark Strong, from Sunshine) are not the deepest characters in the world, nor are they implacably dim-witted and boring; they were entertaining villains. And I cannot forget Captian Shakespeare (Robert DeNiro), the Sky Pirate with a secret. A virtuoso performance. After crap like Meet the Fockers, its great to see him in a role that was undoubtedly tough to pull off without looking like and idiot, or like young Vito Corleone. Of all the supporting characters, he's the most...complex.<br/><br/>I was expecting to see a film that unfolded like a Final Fantasy game. You have kings and princes, mages, fences, knights, airships, and a really really tall, elaborate, cool-looking royal city. And you have the whelpish everyman whom you control and run around the world map from place to place, having to deal with lots of stuff along the way, and growing in the process. In many ways, the film didn't disappoint on that level, and probably wouldn't be a bad basis for an RPG.<br/><br/>That's not a bad thing in my opinion. The film has a great mood to it, and a very unique feel that I can't quite put my finger on. But it was quite entertaining, even if it wasn't nonstop kinetic action, there was enough going on to stay interested. Like I said, the music wasn't great It may not be revolutionary, but has its fair share of original ideas, so I'd recommend it as a fresh take on fantasy films. Go check it out."

","STARDUST is truly a magical film with a massive cast of wonderful actors and a performance from Robert DeNiro which is out of this world to see playing a character that lights up the screen with drama and a dash of devious humor that pilots the story forward. Michelle Pfeiffer, once again as in HAIRSPRAY, plays a nasty role which is such a change from her previous ""glam roles"" and she is in tip top form. Claire Danes continues to rise to the top as a ""real star"" and her English accent is superb.<br/><br/>The sets, costumes, locations and the acting prove once again that along with a well written story magic can transform the screen as you see in STARDUST. However, perhaps Act Three might have been edited a tad shorter to reach the fairy tale climax, but as a whole STARDUST is a joy to behold."

There is absolutely nothing to complain about.<br/><br/>The casting was good, the script was good, the continuity was good, the ending was good. Everything about it was good.<br/><br/>Robert DeNiro practically stole the show with his scenes. I don't want to go into it, because it would ruin the enjoyment.<br/><br/>At certain points of the film, I felt some shades of ""Princess Bride"". Not in plot, but in styling. Much of the dialogue and the chemistry is very reminiscent of that book/film.<br/><br/>I just can't stop smiling, cause I just really really enjoyed this film. What was nice about it too was that it was original. It wasn't a rehashed follow the formula sequel. A lot of people said that it was like Shrek for grownups. That is rather odd, cause if you think about it, Shrek was for grownups in the first place.<br/><br/>But if I had to compare it to something that already exists I would say this; It's a little of the above mentioned Princess Bride, with a touch of the Tenth Kingdom, and a twist of Charlie and the Chocolate Factory...just a twist mind you...<br/><br/>I know some people whined that it didn't hold up to the book... Quite frankly I never read the book, but do plan on purchasing it, and reading it. However if anyone in their right mind ever thinks that a movie is going to be everything the book was especially in the 21st century, then that person is either deluded, or does not see very many movies. Besides most people never even knew that this was a book to begin with until it was made into a movie, so quit complaining.<br/><br/>It was a great film, with a great story, who cares if it didn't follow every little action and what not... Besides from what I have read of the ending of the book vs the ending of the movie, I prefer the movie ending rather than the typical dramatic bittersweet ending of the book...<br/><br/>so nya >8-P<br/><br/>My wife and I thoroughly enjoyed this film, and will most definitely buy it when it comes out on DVD."

They're two different mediums, for Pete's sake! What may read well on the written page may not play well on the big screen.

I've gotten THAT off my chest!<br/><br/>My partner and I both thoroughly enjoyed ""Stardust."" It has action, adventure, humor, and magic. It starts off a bit slowly, but once it gets going, it's great fun. And unlike other fantasy films of recent years, this one is self-contained. The end of the movie is the end of the story. Michelle Pfeiffer seems to take delight in portraying evil women these days (viz. ""Hairspray"" and now ""Stardust"") and she's wonderful. Peter O'Toole is fine as the old king. Robert DiNiro is absolutely hysterical in his role as Captain Shakespeare. The rest of the cast couldn't be bettered. All the threads of the story wrap themselves up very nicely in the finale.

If you like magic or fairy tales, this movie will do. To be honest, I will even go as far as to say this film is better than ""Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix"" because it really is.<br/><br/>This film is surprisingly imaginative. People teleport with candles, fire burns green, pirates fly, and there are tons more to go. What more can you want? Is this film funny? It's weirdly humorous, if that's possible.

","... as much as any movie I've seen this year. I'm a big Neil Gaiman fan, but have not read the book yet (I have the comic on my nightstand - will start it now). Noticed that some fans were disappointed in the liberties taken with the story, but my understanding is that Gaiman had final say over the changes, so I'll give him the respect due the author and view it as another take on the same material. DeNiro was a hoot - he played it thisclose to over-the-top, but held back just enough to create a real character instead of a caricature.<br/><br/>All in all, it's been an exceptional year for fantasy (at least for me). ""Pan's Labyrinth,"" ""Children of Men,"" ""Paprika,"" ""Order of the Phoenix,"" and now this. The trailer for ""Beowulf"" looked promising, and the screen writing combination of Gaiman and Roger Avary gives me goosebumps. Just hope Zemieckis doesn't serve us up a bunch of CG-animated corpses like he did in ""Polar Express."" Honestly, the character animations in that were flat-out creepy - looked like they'd been made up by an inexperienced undertaker and attached to marionette strings."

Fine acting by the entire crew, especially newcomer Charlie Cox and Claire Danes herself. I hope Charlie sticks around. He's very talented from what I see. And personally, I found Claire Danes to be on the same level of beauty as Michelle Pfeiffer.<br/><br/>And if for no other reason, go see it for Robert De Niro's portrayal of a gay pirate. I promise you it's hilarious.<br/><br/>I'm afraid it's going to be one of those movies that does terribly in theatres though.

"EUyeshima","9","1","1","13 August 2007"," A Witty Fantasy and a Soaring Romantic Adventure Combine Seamlessly
","This 2007 Victorian-era fantasy took me by surprise and most pleasantly, as the ads make it sound like it would be a CGI-saturated conglomeration of The Brothers Grimm and The Princess Bride with a little Time Bandits thrown in for good measure. What it turns out to be is an adult fairy tale that doesn't make the mistake of taking itself too seriously. Even though much of the credit belongs to the source, the highly acclaimed 1997 graphic novel by Neil Gaiman and Charles Vess, director and co-screenwriter Matthew Vaughan (along with co-writer Jane Goldman) does an impressive job balancing the comically ribald and pitch-black elements into a compelling albeit rather convoluted plot gift-wrapped in a romantic adventure.<br/><br/>The fanciful tale centers on Tristan, a gawky shop boy who is completely smitten with the beauteous Victoria, who is naturally to be engaged to the more dashing Humphrey within the week. Tristan and Victoria strike a deal whereby she will marry him only if he can deliver a falling star to her before Humphrey proposes. In order to do so, Tristan must pass through the sacred wall into the magical kingdom of Stronghold, his birthplace and where his mother may still be held captive. There in a newly formed crater, he finds Yvaine, a star that has fallen out of the firmament against her will. Now vulnerably earthbound, Yvaine also elicits the attention of two unsavory characters - Prince Septimus, Stronghold's remaining heir, who wants a jewel necklace she wears in order to ensure his ascendancy to the throne, and Lamia, a 400-year old witch looking to reclaim her youth and beauty by taking out Yvaine's heart...literally. Their paths criss-cross throughout the film in ways both dazzling and scarifying.<br/><br/>To Vaughan's credit, the movie never feels overwhelmed by the special effects necessary to sustain the fantasy, including airborne galleons, mystical creatures, and all the magical shape transformations due to witchcraft. Moreover, it's the sharp wit of his and Goldman's script and the quicksilver pacing that really keeps the story aloft in an unexpected manner. The casting is close to ideal. As Tristan, the reluctant hero, Charlie Cox elevates a potentially callow role into one with genuine romance and indiscriminate vigor. At first, with her contemporary sensibilities, Claire Danes' ironic take on Yvaine feels a bit off, but she transitions nicely into the heartfelt aspects of her ethereal role. Making her venal Velma Von Tussle in Hairspray look like a suburban amateur by comparison, Michelle Pfeiffer has a grand time playing Lamia switching back and forth from her stunning beauty to decaying harridan, all the while plotting and conniving her way to her end goal. She has obviously entered a phase of her career where she feels comfortable acting malicious without remorse and sending up her incredible looks.<br/><br/>In brief roles, Sienna Miller perfectly captures Victoria's capricious and superficial nature, Rupert Everett epitomizes gallows wit as the splattered Secundus, and Ricky Gervais goes for the funny bone as the opportunistic Ferdy the Fence. Even Peter O'Toole shows up as a dying king (perhaps coincidentally, he played an actor playing a similar part in last year's Venus), and Ian McKellan provides the stentorian narration. However, the real scene stealer is Robert DeNiro, doing little to hide his Bronx accent, as Captain Shakespeare, who maintains a surprising dual identity to keep up appearances for his crew. It's hardly his finest hour, but he is far more amusing here than in Meet The Fockers. The technical aspects of this sprawling, imaginative world are first-rate, in particular, Gavin Bocquet's meticulous production design (he was responsible for the design of the latest Star Wars trilogy) and Ben Davis's dazzling cinematography. This is superb entertainment for fans of this genre."

","As has been said repeatedly in these reviews, this is a pale copy of ""Princess Bride"", with the emphasis on pale. Everything in this movie (acting, story, direction, score) is bland and tasteless. The protagonist Tristan is not so much a hero as just the guy in the center of the lens, wandering around with a dumb look on his face. Claire Danes, too, sleep-walks her way through every scene. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro easily outshine everyone else anytime they're on screen (never together, sadly) but the script they've been given is so weak that it's just sad to watch actors of their talent trying to make something of it. It's literally pitiful to see. (Pfeiffer's been AWOL for quite a while, but does DeNiro really need a paycheck so badly? Can we pass a hat for him?)<br/><br/>One of the too-few bright spots: the somewhat Python-esquire banter between the ghosts of the murdered princes as they observe the goings-on like spectators at a ballgame.<br/><br/>This film is not BAD, per se; if it had been just a bit worse it might have been enjoyable as a laughably bad movie, but I couldn't even work up interest enough to hate anything about it. It's just so... MEDIOCRE. Imagine a bowl of unsweetened oatmeal. Lukewarm. With a glass of tapwater. <br/><br/>I've not read the graphic novel source material for this film, but I can't imagine that it was as mediocre as the resulting movie; no one would have been inspired to turn it into a motion picture. If you must waste two hours on this, at least wait for its second run in the dollar theaters. In a few months, you won't remember ever having seen it.<br/><br/>-----------------<br/><br/>My prediction proved true. Now in 2010, I had to read my OWN review twice to recall this movie at all, and even at that, my clearest memory is of an afternoon wasted."
"shiftyeyeddog","4","9","25","13 August 2007"," Maybe Fantasy Just Isn't My Genre
","With the success of Lord of the Rings and Harry Potter, Hollywood went scrambling to grab up any literary fantasy properties they could get their hands on. Unfortunately, most of them don't seem to be translating to the screen very well, and they're apparently really scraping the bottom of the barrel to find new ones to turn into film series. The latest example: Stardust. Now, I haven't read the book, but I've heard a lot of good things about Neil Gaiman's works, so I have to think that in this case either the fault lies with the filmmakers, or maybe it's just a good book that doesn't make for a good movie. ...or maybe the book sucked too. I don't know.<br/><br/>I really wanted to like it going in, but by about ten minutes in, I already knew I'd be disappointed. I was hearing comparisons to The Princess Bride in some reviews, but beyond the fairy-tale type aspect, there's no comparison. This film should not be mentioned in the same sentence. The direction was lacking, the story completely predictable and silly (and not in a good way), and the casting questionable. The biggest offender here is Robert Deniro in a dull, pointless turn as Captain Shakespeare, the man with a mean reputation who it turns out is very sensitive and effeminate. Look! It's Deniro acting gay! Isn't that hilarious?!? ummm... NO. (Though there plenty in my theater who were laughing like crazy. The same crowd, I would guess, that made the painfully unfunny Wild Hogs a smash hit.) I also have to wonder about the casting of Sarah Alexander (Coupling) as one of the witches. Here you have an attractive young blonde actress who you put in ugly, decaying, old witch makeup. I assumed that, like Michelle Pfeiffer, they cast her because you'd see her young again at some point. But we never did. So they could just as easily have put an actual old woman in the role. I don't get it. Maybe there were some scenes cut out or something.<br/><br/>One other observation: the guy who did the score has SERIOUS Hans Zimmer envy. Practically every music cue sounded like it was lifted directly from Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>The movie wasn't a complete disaster, but I can't recommend it to anyone, and I doubt I'll ever watch it again. Like I said, maybe fantasy just isn't my thing. I enjoyed the LOTR movies, but the rest of the series they're scraping up to cash in on the trend are just falling way short. Potter, Narnia, ...next up is The Golden Compass, from Philip Pullman's His Dark Materials series. The cast looks good, and the trailer is somewhat interesting, but I'm going in with low expectations, based on my disappointment with the latest genre entries. Hopefully it will prove me wrong."

What I mean is, that this movie is not exactly appropriate for children, yet the subtlety of the dialogs, the depth of its characters and the meaning of the story would not even satisfy an intelligent 12 year old. With all its special effects and all, the extreme corny-ness and false depth of the script made me want to hide under my seat, especially during the most idiotic dialogs. If at least the movie was short, but NO they had to make it long and painful. I can't believe I wasted so much time seeing this amazingly useless movie.

"Blueghost","Null","3","6","21 February 2010"," Impressive, but where are the men?
","This chick flick fantasy was supposed to be the after thought also-ran competitor to Disney's ""Enchanted"", the ""Narnia"" films and ""Golden Compass"", but winds up being the better film. It's an improvement on a product that is a rarity when one is trying to follow the market leader in order to sponge his run-off.<br/><br/>The sets and situations are all fantasy, but the care taken to execute this film, particularly by hiring the ever beautiful Michelle Pfeiffer to thesp the antagonist role, is quite striking. To me this film surpasses the standard of what ""The Golden Compass"" was trying to set, and also surpasses the ostensibly more young male oriented Narnia films.<br/><br/>Do I have any quibbles with this flick? Not as such. Pfeiffer does her usual bang up job of showing us her top of the line acting talent. The film benefits from it. And unlike Nichole Kidman's film, where Kidman has to try to carry a film that seems to have bitten off more than it can chew, Pfeiffer's talents aren't the central focus here. There's a solid cast of actors with excellent acting talents who deliver us characters that stand on their own. As an entertainment piece it's a solid performer when cast and story meld with the SFX and other film elements. A thing that ""The Golden Compass"" never quite achieves.<br/><br/>Quibbles? Yes, there a few. Not many, but some. The martial arts exposition was needless. Mixing in east Asian martial arts with western saber fighting, and tossing in Kung Fu theatrics (somersaults and so forth), for me, pushes the film into the outer edges of high-kamp. Just once I'd like to see a masculine hero does what he does best. Unfortunately those days are probably long gone, so we have corporate film making placating to a female demographic.<br/><br/>And therein lies the the film's real fault. Right now it's just a solid fantasy film. The acting level is right for this kind of flick, and the plot and story are well received, but it seems to really down play any masculine positives. Which makes one wonder about the fans of this film. Me, I happen to like the exposition, and I have the DVD in my collection, but I would've liked the male leads to have been more proactive. Such a movie would've had a larger cross market appeal, garnished a larger market share, and, most importantly of all, been a better movie as a whole.<br/><br/>But, regardless, we do have a solid piece of cinema, even if skewed by corporate studio heads.<br/><br/>So... where are the men? Or are they all black hats in this thing?<br/><br/>Okay, that was overly harsh. Truth be told I do like this film a great deal. See it."

This is easily one of the best, if not the very best film I have seen this year (I have probably seen over 25 movies this year, this week alone I have seen Bourne Ultimatum, Rush Hour 3, and Stardust.

"wildheartxxx","8","3","6","10 August 2007"," Flawed but still a must see!
","Well i've been waiting to see this movie for a while and got the chance to see it Friday morning. Overall it was definitely worth the ticket. Despite the fantastic cast Michelle Pfieffer owns this movie. Every minute she is on the screen it lifts what is a pretty good yarn into something really worth seeing. Whenever the picture gets in the danger of straying into Pirates Of The Caribbean territory(more later) She brings the whole thing back on course and is a delight to watch and you can tell she absolutely had a blast doing it. If there was an an Oscar nomination for most entertaining female actress in a movie she would win hands down in fact she should get a nod for a best actress nomination.<br/><br/>Besides Pfieffer. Rupert Everett also gets props as the other actor who really brings something to the movie and like Pfieffer he helps propel the narrative along. De Niro is great fun but Danes and Cox are merely adequate as the leads and the movie stalls whenever they have a lot of screen time together.<br/><br/>If there is a flaw with Stardust, it's the Pirates Of The Caribbean syndrome. There are occasions where the movie is in danger of losing its way with too much going on and some of it rather extraneous and it's down to Pfieffer or Everett to bring it back on track. Even De Niro's part, though entertaining, is not that necessary.Ricky Gervais has some screen time as a market trader and plays, well, Ricky Gervais.<br/><br/>The first half of Stardust is better than the second, mainly because it's tighter,peaking with the movies best scene at an Inn which Pfieffer 'builds'. Stardust could've been a classic instead it's merely very very good and visually it's astounding and it really delivers when so many movies don't. This could well do $200 million+ at the box office. 8/10"
"vitaleralphlouis","1","19","68","22 December 2007"," Where Do the 10-Votes Come From?
","The primary selling point for STARDUST is to enjoy seeing Claire Danes and Michelle Pheiffer -- two for the price of one. Claire Danes is definitely worth seeing, but Michelle is too-often made up to look age 95+ and/or she's either murdering people or transforming them into animals. One big negative on Claire's part: She plays a star. No, not a Hollywood star, I mean a rock, mineral. I prefer my women to be flesh and blood, but herein she LOOKS human enough, but she's a rock! <br/><br/>Lots of man-to-animal transformations, too many really; and other stuff borrowed from other pictures. There are no rules, no restraint, no real purpose guiding the story to any sort of resolution. We meet Robert deNero as Captain Shakespiere, a super-mean pirate who doesn't have enough sense to sail his ship in the water. No, he sails it in the sky via a helium balloon. How stupid! Also he's a cross dresser who likes to doll-up and dance the can-can in his cabin.<br/><br/>There are 8 dead brothers, sons of King Peter O'Toole, handing around in faded black & white, all murdered, one enjoys keeping an ax implanted in his head -- the show-off! Once a man, now a goat. Once a man, now a mouse. Boring! We've seen all this fantasy stuff before, usually not silly or stupid, but STARDUST truly makes no sense at all. The entire movie collapses in excess of magic in the final and stupefying 15 minutes.<br/><br/>Question: How does an indisputably dreadful movie garner so many 10 votes? Are the studios inputing votes or paying voters? After all, they've paid for rave newspaper reviews for decades. Too bad there isn't a good way to keep this site from corruption.

","This film really has the cast one usually dreams of. There are so many familiar faces explicitly there that it's easy to overlook several others who are partly masked by their roles as dead people, for example. Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert de Niro both coast through, relaying on their innate magnetism and charisma to make up for the deafening lack of direction and appalling script. Above all else, this is a lazy film. It depends on a trite, cliché-ridden musical score to lift every change of scene and hint at a chase: it really pounds one into submission (not me, I hasten to add) with its feeble, derivative invention. The editing of the film seems almost random. One moves from one strand of the plot to another with the randomness of a game of snakes and ladders. The premise of the story is enchanting; everything was in place for a great fantasy adventure; but first one needs a bit of drive and flair from those in charge. Apart from a few witty moments, not least with Ricky Gervais almost reprising his Office persona, this film is a waste of two hours and a huge sum of money."

","I keep reading all of these rave reviews for this movie. I don't understand why. It's a pretty good movie at best. Overall the acting was good. I wouldn't say there were any standout performances like I have read. The overall concept was interesting, but I think it is more a movie for teenage girls, cause lets face it, it is a Fairy Tale Love story, and as a 30 yr old male, not my thing. I went to see this movie only because it was written by Neil Gaiman, an author I recently started reading (listening to) and I enjoy his work, and because my girlfriend wanted to see it. I hear the book is a little different than the movie, but I probably wouldn't bother cause it is a fairy tale. Back to the acting. Though not a big fan of Claire Danes, I'd say she was my favorite character and best acted part in the movie (mostly because she is a smart alec, and I have a certain liking for smart alecy girls in movies). The guy who plays Tristan was OK. Michelle Pfiffer (is that right) plaid the evil witch nicely. Here is the one that gets me, Robert DeNiro. Everyone is saying how great his part is and how it'll take you by surprise and you'll never see him the same again. He plays a gay, cross-dressing, pirate captain.....so what. It didn't take me by surprise or make me think of him any differently. Granted it was well played and different than most movies you see him in, but all it does is ad on to the great parts that he has played (remember awakenings). He gets to show that he can be comedic and it ads to the range of roles he plays and helps remind us what a great actor he is. That's all I gotta say about this movie. Like I said entertaining, but Not as Good as Everyone says, a One-Timer"
"OldAle1","3","8","25","7 September 2007"," A bigger budget does not a better fairy tale make
","Well, where to begin with this one? Let's start by saying that I don't pay much attention to mainstream movies coming out these days, unless they involve a director (Eastwood, Scorsese, Gilliam, etc) that I'm interested in, or the reviews from critics I trust are great. So this one showed up without my knowledge. Initial reviews were mostly decent, and I investigated a bit, as I like fantasy, especially the more fairy-tale type and even moreso such tales that have any orientation towards adults. This might fit the bill! Ah, it's based on the Gaiman/Vess graphic novel; I hadn't read it, but I'd paged through it and loved the art, and I liked Gaiman's work on Sandman. And there just weren't many films playing theatrically here in Vermont that looked any good at all. So, off I went.<br/><br/>It starts out OK, typical young-man-goes-off-to-see-the-world sort of thing, in this case the world beyond the wall outside of his village, literally another world called ""Stormhold."" How it got to be juxtaposed with this little slice of England, why this particular man gets to enter it -- never explained. Not much of anything is explained, in fact, anywhere in the movie. The man comes back after a night of bliss with a young maiden in the town of Wall on the other side; a few months later, a song arrives on his doorstep. 18 years later the son, Tristan (a fairly dull Charlie Cox) disappears over the wall himself to literally catch a falling star for the bitchy, stuck-up girl he wants to impress (Sienna Miller, showing no talent). The star turns out to be a girl (Claire Danes) and it turns out that everyone in the kingdom wants to get his or her hands on this fallen star, mostly for nefarious purposes.<br/><br/>The film lumbers along, entirely predictably (gosh, Charlie and Yvaine, the star, don't get along at first -- what could be the end result) and at times seems to be trying hard to show a sort of ""Princess Bride"" wit and self-mockery, but it never gets there for a host of reasons, including dull and obvious direction, very choppy and equally obvious editing, a mostly lethargic and too-serious principal cast, and one of the most overbearing and unoriginal film scores I have ever heard. What few saving graces there are belong to the seasoned veterans in the cast (Michelle Pfeiffer, Rupert Everett, Robert DeNiro and Mark Strong among them) playing character roles. The film feels at least 45 minutes too long, and certainly doesn't help raise my hopes for genre pictures in the future. The CGI was mostly distracting and not all that convincing.<br/><br/>In short, pretty abysmal."

","I finished reading the book yesterday, which I absolutely adored. It was one of those books that unassumingly wraps itself around your heart and palpitates your imagination back from the choking state it can find itself in after drowning a few days in the banality of a rather mundane life that most of us live. Suffice it to say it was a good book.<br/><br/>So, like a complete and total eejit, I decide it might be a good idea to go and watch the 2007 adaptation of said book. Now, by 'might' I mean 'most definitely believed it to be' and by 'good idea' I mean 'was ensorcelled by the stupidity of said notion enough to convince myself of such.'<br/><br/>Now I've known, as most modestly intelligent folk these days do, that the adaptations of books by Hollywood are often deviant (to say the least) from the original story and in some cases must be altered entirely, in bits and parts, in order to expedite a story line into the limited time-frame allotted by production budgets, run times and the very shrinking attention span of the average consumerist viewer. But never, in all my years and in my wildest imagination, did I ever conceive of an adaptation so wholly different from it's source material that I found myself chanting the the acronym 'wtf' like a Benedictine Monk chanting the Breviary. The movie was almost entirely devoid of everything contained within the pages of the novel. The only similarities, and dare I not say that without qualifying it with the notion that I am using the term 'similarities' loosely, were the names of the characters and a few (very, very, few) plot points.<br/><br/>The entire endeavor was like that of an apprentice mage fumbling around his masters book of spells and attempting to produce a complex Simulacrum but instead creating a deformed homonculus, or a badly rotted Golem.<br/><br/>That being said.. <br/><br/>If you like your stories to start where they end, to give little concern for Character development, to rush the plot lines along at an exponentially rushed pace and to trade all of these for attractive actors/actresses and dynamic special effects, not to mention trading ALL THE MAGIC for poorly executed humor, then this is most definitely the movie for you."

The business is all about creating worlds, weaving realities. The big challenge is getting us into a world that makes enough sense for us to rattle around in it, and perhaps be manipulated using its laws. If we are lucky, those manipulations will matter and the film will be worth watching. But that first hurdle is helping us to enter the world.<br/><br/>This fails at that front door. Like many other big budget productions with a weak creative coordinator, different bits have been parceled out to creative teams all over the world, and each has created their own miniworlds whose only commonality is that they are ""inspired"" by the book.<br/><br/>But they are also inspired by other movies too. The problem is that each team used a different set of movies and thence different worlds, with different symmetries and hinges and refractions. Its incoherent.<br/><br/>One single thing could have helped. Nothing ties bits of a movie together like the score, especially when it is heavy like this one. The problem is that the composer used a Wagnerian approach. Now, you don't have to be very knowledgeable about music to have strong opinions about whether Wagner is a burden on or wings for our souls. But either way, it implies a world of its own, a world of Olympian lusts, of simple honor and vast battles. Love isn't a basic force in Wagner's world, its a prize. In the simple story we have here, it is the unified force of everything that happens, a sort of light that affects everything. (The metaphor here is the stars as gods.)<br/><br/>So every time something happens in this movie, they turn on this music machine that snaps the world away from any of the worlds we see. Its schizophrenic, like a TeeVee laugh track over Hamlet.<br/><br/>It would have helped if they had gotten real actors, too.<br/><br/>There are two scenes that are okay. One is the incidental bargaining over a chest full of lightning. Another is the ""landing"" of the ship in water that DeNiro's character pilots. All else is failure.<br/><br/>Oh. If you saw ""300"" or ""Perfume,"" you will have seen two recent versions of the incidental redhead as a sort of token of purity.

","What happens when a young director (Matthew Vaughan of ""Layer Cake"") films the adaptation of the work of a successful writer (Neil Gaiman), tosses in a narration by a ""Lord of the Rings"" alum (Ian McKellen), spins one tale of a dying king (Peter O'Toole), another of a literal fallen star (Claire Danes), a young hopeless romantic (Charlie Cox), a love triangle, a transvestite on a flying boat (Robert DeNiro), and a Shakespearean trio of witches (headed up by Michelle Pfieffer)? We get ""Stardust"", a disappointing, tiring piece of cinema that wants to be ""The Princess Bride"" for the modern era, but seems much too busy tossing in a dozen more plot points than the standard two hour film. It makes for a very taxing viewing and none of the innumerable sequences ever make it worth the effort."

","I was looking forward to see this film six month before its release. I really like fantasy and fairy tales. When I watched this film I found it all right - it had a topic, nice dresses, decent actors and some nice CG - but something essential was missing. In the second half I was even bored and wondered how much longer this movie goes on. I am not in the movie business, so I don't really know, but I think the director's work was to blame. Neighter the hero nor the heroine was appealing for me, so I could not live the story with them. There was humor in the film, but it was pretty random: I did not know whether to laugh at certain comments, or take them seriously. Parts of the visual ""world"" was exceptionally magical, but it did not create a solid, homogeneous world like lets say Middle Earth in LOTR. It was not a bad try... but it fell to decent pieces, instead of forming a film."

","I just saw this movie at an advance screening yesterday, and I loved it. Admittedly, I have not read the book upon which it's based, but I went with my best friend who is a die-hard Gaiman fan and had reread the book to prepare for seeing the movie. According to her, she had expected to hate the movie, and it is apparently quite different from the book, but she still walked out raving about it. It is sweet and often hilarious (Robert De Niro totally steals the show, but not in a way I've ever seen him do so before). The best parts are the constant surprises: though there are some formulaic and predictable moments, often a situation suddenly develops in a way you did not see coming. The beginning and end are perhaps a little rushed, and the special effects occasionally leave something to be desired, but other than that, I have no criticisms. Excellent performances by all and a really fun ride."

I will SO go see it again, and then also get it on DVD. It also made me a little envious that my life wasn't such an awesome adventure!!! I highly suggest to go see it. Definitely worth your time."
"sullibrandon","5","6","19","22 August 2007"," Chaotic, Contrived, and Confusing
","Stardust's downfall is that, in trying too much to be like old school fairy tales (Lord of the Rings and such), it carries the air of trying too hard. You can tell that it wants so bad to be the kind of classic fairy tale that everybody loves, but too much of it feels fake and pretentious, and there are several uselessly added layers that don't do much to enhance the story.<br/><br/>The film begins with a deliciously wonderful voice-over by the incomparable Ian McKellen, who narrates throughout the movie, and is undoubtedly one of the best things about it. His soothing voice carries us to a small English countryside town whose wall borders on the magical land of Stormhold. A man journeys forth into the magical world, and 18 years later his son, Tristan (geez how fairy tale-ey can you get?) (whose mother resides in Stormhold) has grown up into a man who is in young puppy love with a rich girl who lives down the street. Alas, he cannot win her heart because he is a mere shop boy, but luckily for him, a star falls from the sky that he promises to retrieve for her in exchange for her hand in marriage. He journeys to the star, only to find that it is actually a fallen star named Yvaine, and together they must weather other people who are after them, including a devilish witch (a smart but underused Michelle Pfeiffer) and three sons of a recently dead king (Peter O'Toole in the best role of the movie) who must retrieve an amulet that will give whoever finds it kingship over all of Stormhold. Yeesh. If that plot isn't enough to show you how contrived and pretentious this movie is, let me continue.<br/><br/>Stardust's greatest downfall is how much it believes that it is such a great tale of whimsy, fun, and fancy. But with such a convoluted plot (and believe me it gets convoluteder, er, more convoluted), there's no way it can claim to be a simple adventure. For starters, there are several things about the plot that should have been completely done away with. One is Robert De Niro's character of the gay pirate. Yes, I know everyone's raving about how he's playing against type and how great he is, but I don't really care. Once you get past the superficial ""ha ha ha he NEVER plays this type of character!"" there's not really much there, and the entire scene aboard his flying lightning harvesting boat (admittedly this is a pretty cool idea) is basically useless.Another useless point, however hilariously forgivable it is, occurs when De Niro sells his lightning to a trader, played by Ricky Gervais in, personally, my favorite moment of the entire movie, as Gervais milks the role for all it's worth, trumping, with three minutes on screen, De Niro's pirate effortlessly. Him, Ian McKellen, and Peter O'Toole are worth the price of admission all in themselves. The end result of the useless plot threads is a story that's so unnecessarily complicated that there's no way it can claim to be any kind of whimsical fairy tale. The extra plot threads wouldn't have bothered me if they had been woven into the tapestry of the movie enough to be unnoticeable, but they're so sloppily done the careless craftsmanship is almost unforgivable.<br/><br/>Aside from the useless, sloppily done plot threads, another thing that bothered me was the anything goes use of magic. Supposedly, when the witch, Michelle Pfeiffer, I don't even remember her name, uses magic, it takes a toll on her borrowed youth so that she ages. So she uses magic several times, sparingly, of course, and when she does two bits of magic, both of her arms fade to withered skin dotted with age spots. Understandable, as both of these bits of magic weren't that large. But then she conjures an entire inn, complete with rooms, a bar, baths, a stable, a dining room, and everything you could possibly imagine in an inn. This doesn't take a toll on her at all, and it is never explained. Other instances abound. You might say, ""It's magic, it's not supposed to have rules!"" but if magic has no rules, then anybody could do anything, and then there wouldn't be much of an interesting plot, would there? And in the grand finale to the film, all previous supposed rules of magic are tossed out the window in favor of an over-the-top (albeit semi-visually impressive, if a bit derivative) climax.<br/><br/>My other qualm with this movie is how its modern elements are completely disparate with its fantasy elements. When the star falls from the sky, we go up above the Earth and look down. What? This isn't sci-fi! Another way that this ""fairy tale"" rings false is how the characters easily jump into bed with one another as if they were part of the cast of ""Friends"", when the sleeping together does nothing to advance the story, and even detracts from it as the immediate physicality just reeks of lazy writing and a refusal to do anything new with this kind of storyline. It also diminishes the love the characters share for one another. Other amusingly ironic but ultimately too obvious pop culture references pepper the mix.<br/><br/>Too often Stardust seems to be trying to be this grand sweeping epic movie, but then it will go into moments where it strains almost to the breaking point trying to whimsical and charming. It never mixes effectively the parts are too different and not woven well enough together to create anything reasonably entertaining. All this being said, though, it can be an enjoyable ride if not over-analyzed, but for me, its slipshod craftsmanship and poorly woven storyline were too much to really give it a good recommendation."

Halleluja, the cynical executives got what they wanted, they can dumb their stuff down as much as they like, and still make millions out of it. Just follow the recipe and you're good, whatever the awkwardness, the lousiness of the product.

","As religion sets in the West so the appeal of another form of escapism - Fantasy - is fulfilling young people's need for a set of values, a vision of a simpler,better world with a reassuring if simplistic philosophy where decency and ""Good"" will prevail in stark contrast to the harsh reality that exists outside their books and computers. We're all aware of the appeal of Tolkien's cuddly hobbits and Rowling's Boarding School Gothic. ""Stardust"",while perhaps primarily appealing to this pre - sold audience,is also sufficiently Mainstream to satisfy the picturegoer who happens on it perchance as I did on FilmFour two nights ago. I am not conversant with the writings of Mr Gamain and have never seen a graphic novel other than on the shelves at Borders.This is not something I am either particularly proud of or particularly ashamed of,it's simply because I don't feel that they are aimed at my generation. I mention this merely to disclaim any prejudice one way or the other in commenting on ""Stardust"". A dying King.Three witches.Star cross'd lovers.An enchanted land.A voice - over by a theatrical knight.A pirate called Shakespeare.All satisfyingly throw - away gestures perhaps,but indicative of the fun the makers of ""Stardust"" were having.Gratifying too,was the enthusiasm displayed by the cast for the material;even the ""names"" seemed to be having a good time.Such goodwill is contagious and even a cantankerous old grump like me could hardly avoid exclamations of delight at several stages of the film. A resume of the plot - treated with straight - faced seriousness by the cast,an absolutely essential element in any good fantasy movie - will be unnecessary here.Sufficient to say it borrows freely from the Fairytale tradition. As the young boy on a quest Mr C.Cox changes convincingly from breathless youth to adulthood.Miss C.Daines as the star that falls to earth is enchanting. Miss M.Pfieffer as the chief witch proves you can be a fully - clad woman and still be really sexy. I am not an admirer of Mr R.Gervais and his performance here does not endear him to me.He may be a deliberate anachronism but it just doesn't work I'm afraid. I loved the lightning - catching air galleon and it's scurvy crew,the wonderful unicorn,the sinister village inn,the crumbling castle,the 98 year old ""minder"" at the wall dividing fantasy from reality........... I think you could fairly say I was happily caught up in the artlessly artful world created by ""Stardust"". I was even ready to accept Mr R. de Niro as a cross - dressing Can - Can dancing pirate and no movie can do more."

Whatever the reason, I thought it was pitch perfect.<br/><br/>While less enthralled this time, it's still a very engaging movie with an interesting story and some terrific stuff. I was perhaps more aware of plot holes, found Charlie Cox slightly bland, and thought it was weird that Claire Danes had an English accent for no discernible reason, but it's a really fun movie and well worth watching.<br/><br/>Now I'll let the me of 20 years ago talk about it:<br/><br/>This is a very funny and clever movie. Great, intelligent story, beautiful effects, excellent acting (especially De Niro, who is awesome). This movie made me happier than I've been for a while. The running joke of the kingdom's history of prince savagery and the aftermath, the way indulging in magic affects the witch and dozens of smart little touches all kept me enthralled. That's much of what makes it so good; it's an elaborate, special-effects-laden movie with more story than most fairy tale movies, yet there is an incredible attention to small things.<br/><br/>I feel like just going ahead and watching it all over again."

","Because of the little publicity in Germany I got to know about this movie just in April 2008 (unfortunately). So I had to watch the DVD version but none the less I was very enthusiastic about it. I think it is like a fresh breeze in this age of movies because if I were asked for I couldn't name another movie to compare with this one. <br/><br/>First of all I would like to say that I loved this amazing story about a fallen star in the shape of a beautiful woman. I loved Claire Danes in this movie as well as in Romeo & Juliet. She did a great performance and put the finishing touches to ""Stardust"". But of course I loved the other actors too. Charlie Cox, for me an absolute unknown, did also a great job as ""Tristan Thorn"". In my opinion he an Claire Danes are perfectly suited to each other. <br/><br/>I was very impressed how they managed to combine action, suspense, romance, humor (a lot of funny irony) and this great story in one movie. So it is really a ""whole-familiy-movie"" because on the one hand there is this exciting three-piece chase (Tristan-Witches-Princes) after the fallen star and on the other hand a lot of romance between Tristan and Yvaine that developed from funny ironic conversations to very emotional love scenes like in the inn called ""to the slaughtered prince"".<br/><br/>In addition I loved the great background music (epic as well as romantic) and sound effects they used. It perfectly underlines the current situation in the movie above all in combination with the gorgeous visual and special effects they used (computer animation as well as beautiful ""real-life-landscapes""). <br/><br/>I also read the book after I had watched the movie and in my opinion the movie is the much better one especially for those who has already watched the movie and loves classic fairy tales with a perfect happy end.<br/><br/>So to cut a more or less long story short I scored the movie in seven weighted categories:<br/><br/>1) [12.5%] action - 8.0/10<br/><br/>2) [12.5%] suspense - 8.5/10 <br/><br/>3) [10.0%] music/sound - 10.0/10 <br/><br/>4) [10.0%] visual effects - 10.0/10 <br/><br/>5) [35.0%] emotion - 10.0/10 <br/><br/>6) [05.0%] humor - 9.5/10 <br/><br/>7) [15.0%] story - 10.0/10<br/><br/>total: 9.5375 => 10 points<br/><br/>So my personal t.o.p.

"DICK STEEL","10","2","4","27 October 2007"," A Nutshell Review: Stardust
","I approached Stardust with apprehension, because of late, fairy tale movies like Pan's Labyrinth, Mirrormask and Brothers Grimm somehow didn't appeal to me, even though they are helmed by acclaimed directors, and critically praised by many. Moreover, the movie had premiered in the US for ages now, and the trailer has been played too often over here, while waiting for the movie to make its debut, that it actually looked quiet tired.<br/><br/>But I am extremely pleased to have stuck with my gut, and gone for the screening anyway, and boy, was I thoroughly surprised and entertained! Let me say this - the trailer did not do the movie justice, being overly long, and cut in a rather plain manner that seemed to harp on the big names, and made it look pretty ordinary. Doubt not Neil Gaiman's creativity in crafting an adult fantastical fairy tale filled with witches, pirates, sword and sorcery, and beautiful people too, in a fictional land area in England separated by a wall, where inhabitants from one side is forbidden to cross over.<br/><br/>For all the more recognizable names in this feature, Charlie Cox takes up the lead role of Tristan, a shopkeeper's assistant who is smitten with the lady in his life, Victoria (Sienna Miller), to whom he vowed to bring back a falling star they witnessed in order to ask for her hand in marriage, and in time for her birthday. Naturally the lady thinks he, being the olden day wimp, probably couldn't do it, so in jest strikes that deal with him. But little does Tristan know that in crossing the wall, and meeting up with the fallen star Yvaine (Claire Danes), his life will forever be changed through a series of adventures, involving a sisterhood of witches led by Michelle Pfeiffer (on a revival after Hairspray) who are after the heart of the fallen star because of immortality, Septimus (Mark Strong) in his quest to become King by retrieving a ruby now worn by Yvaine, and with allies such as Robert De Niro's Captain Shakespeare and his merry pirates aboard a flying ship.<br/><br/>At its core, this is a whimsical love story, and I thought while predictable, was delivered most excellently. though your goosebumps won't have that much of a field day (various characters were actually rolling their eyes at different junctures and situations in the movie). It translated the notion that one usually glows when one is in love and/or in the presence of a loved one, and here, it does so quite literally as well. It has a beautiful coherent story that you would expect of a fairy tale, and plenty of magical artifacts introduced through the course of the story, like any respectable and enjoyable story amongst its peers, do serve their purpose at the right time - there is no wastage, and everything impeccably planned out.<br/><br/>The strength is indeed in the story, with unexpected twists to characters, though in its structure some might complain that it is predictable to a T, but yet it met expectations, and surpassed them. Visual effects were top notch and serve their purpose, and there's a fair bit of comedy courtesy of the princely ghouls. What made it a blast, were the actors, most of whom are big names in their own right. Ian McKellen lent his voice as the narrator, and Michelle Peiffer you just got salute for taking on a villainous role which doesn't stop poking fun at aging. Claire Danes was pretty as the wide eyed ingenue angel from above, and Charlie Cox opposite her do make a pretty couple. Peter O'Toole, Ricky Gervais and Rupert Everett had bit roles, but the one who stole the limelight was De Niro's pirate captain. Not that he does it in Jack Sparrow fashion, but here's a man whose first and foremost principle is impression, and you've just got to see him in action to believe! Aarrr!!<br/><br/>Nicely paced and never a dull moment, Stardust has bits of everything that made it a delight to watch - star power, story, magic, comedy, effects, intense buildups and moments, and the list goes on. If I may, then I must say I do enjoy the tried and tested moments that it tossed about on its notion of love - that sometimes you meet someone special quite oft by chance, and it'll take some time for you to realize that hey, the person standing in front of you is really that soul mate you're looking for. Call me a sucker for such predictable scenarios, but I like what I like, and I was impressed with how Stardust was packaged as a whole.<br/><br/>It has been far too long that I've emerged from a fairy tale movie feeling so very pleased, and Stardust wins that honour of having put the faith for such movies back in me. As such, it wins a well deserved slot in my contender list for top 10 movies of the year. Don't miss this one when it premieres on Thursday!"

Special effects were beautiful, yet even novice movie goers noticed editing mistakes and scenes that ""bumped"" rather than flowed into one another.

","People are comparing Stardust to The Princess Bride because of it's fairy tale content and humor. Stardust is a nice enjoyable film, but it does not match the wonder and beauty of The Princess Bride. Robert DeNiro is brilliant as Captain Shakespeare. Shakespeare is a different type of role for DeNiro and he embraces the role to create a wonderful character you care about. You can see that DeNiro enjoyed his role within every shot of screen. Claire Danes is magnificent as Yvaine. Danes creates the inner beauty the character needs to make the story work and you root for her the entire film. Michelle Pfeiffer is wickedly delightful as Lamia. Pfeiffer not only plays the wicked witch, but brings some humor and life to the character to make her more interesting. Where the film is lacking is in the lead role. Charlie Cox is very weak as Tristran. He does not have the charisma that Carey Elwes had in The Princess Bride and he does not bring life to his character. Cox has more of a cardboard type performance that almost brings the film down to a B-movie standard. Overall, this is a wonderful film. The creators should have gotten a better lead to make it a better movie, but it is still highly enjoyable and worth watching. Not The Princess Bride, but close enough."

","Matthew Vaughn's adaptation of Neil Gaiman's novel of the same name was my introduction to his directorial genius. At the time, the story, the ensemble cast including Charlie Cox, Claire Danes, Robert De Niro, Michelle Pfeiffer, Mark Strong & the narration by Ian McKellen blew my mind. But I was also impressed by how it was directed.<br/><br/>I mentioned being blown away by the ensemble cast because when i first watched Stardust it was dubbed in French - yes I'm fluent in Molière's language. I fell in love with the movie then but once I saw it in English I realized the nuances that were lost to me in the French version. For example, I had always assumed - despite the story partly taking place in the UK - that all of the actors were speaking in an American accent - I know, I can be stupid sometimes. So it was weird to hear British accents, coming out of Danes' & Pfeiffer's mouths.<br/><br/>The fairy tale epic has everything we came to expect in a Vaughn movie, an awesome storytelling, great cynical jokes intertwined with a captivating adventure. Stardust is surprising and incredibly entertaining, as the story unfolds you dive into big new fantasy world that manages to feel very intimate. The film gets so riveting that it's a good escape, a relaxing movie that helps to take your mind off of your problems.<br/><br/>The cast is just amazing, the acting is good, and it feels like each and every part - big or small - was written for a specific actor that would give the part what it needs to shine when on screen. For example, Peter O'toole's part is small but memorable, Robert De Niro's character is so much fun and not as cliché as I thought he'd be. He's probably one of the most surprising character in the film. Watching the movie now is even more impressive because so much of the people cast in it are big stars now e.g. Henry Cavill. So it's an added bonus to watch the film these days and notice these then unknown actors who helped make the Stardust experience magical. <br/><br/>Stardust is not perfect but it works, you can't really hate it even if fairy tale, fantasy movies are not your thing. @wornoutspines"

With a superb cast led by Mark Strong, Michelle Pfeiffer, Claire Danes, Charlie Cox, Robert De Niro and a list that surprisingly goes on and with a beautiful score that compliments every scene, Stardust is truly a sum of its parts; a film that recaptured our imagination and fantasies and reminded us of those rare ""happily ever afters."""
"johnnyboyz","7","0","0","17 June 2011"," Inventive and oddly compelling adventure film about a character experiencing things outside of his comfort zone running on an engaging chase narrative and blunt hybridisation.
","For the most part, Stardust unfolds like some kind of concoction of Peckinpah's Ride the High Country with Midnight Run by way of the magic or ingenuity of a J.K. Rowling novel - and all of it filtered down and through a lens for people of about fifteen and upwards. Not that there's much wrong with any of that, Matthew Vaughn's 2007 follow up to his quite blistering 2004 debut Layer Cake coming to form that of a fair old frolic through some territory engulfing rather a lot of black comedy; some neat creativity born out of the film's alternate world setting full of ingenuity and its own infrastructure; affectionate characters undergoing somewhat moving arcs and a wonderfully clinical sense of progression as things are kept moving along without ever being allowed to slouch.<br/><br/>The film begins with a voice over, a voice over read by that of Ian McKellen, whom just has the natural ability to make absolutely anything in the world sound as if it's the most important thing you've ever heard. Like a bedtime story, like someone that has read the same tale a thousand times and knows both the precise pitch as well as the tone which ought to accompany proceedings from the off, this fable-like telling of a fable-like tale begins warmly and enthusiastically, and is difficult not to become as involved in as the above suggests would like you to be. The opening tells the tale of how a certain Tristan came to be born, Charlie Cox's character coming about to exist when his father escaped from his sheltered existence in a remote English village named Wall and into the magical mythical world full of wonder; enchantment and young enslaved women named Stormhold – a place kept apart by a lone stone wall of a few feet in height one wonders why it is not harder to cross.<br/><br/>Fast forward twenty or so years, and Tristan is a bit of a wimp whilst still living in the town of Wall; a place in which nothing has changed and everything has remained stilted. While allured by the portal into Stormhold, still guarded ably by an elderly man who's no slouch with a crook, his more immediate concerns lie with his love for Sienna Miller's Victoria, a girl already with a potential suitor whose request for marriage has already come through, but someone whom appears loose enough to break off such an engagement if it means Tristan is successful in a quest she playfully sets him. This item, the Macguffin, of which is later provided with its own personality, so not just a pretty face needing rescuing, is a fallen star named Yvaine (Danes); an item both the power mad brothers, sons of a dying king whose throne is up for grabs, predominantly focusing on Septimus (Strong) need in order to garner said rule but whose quest will not be any easier as they go up against three evil witches, whose fate of eternal youth and grossly enhanced magical powers is on the line should one of them, Lamia, fail in bringing it back. The three witches live life as old; bedraggled; wrinkled coots self-knowingly ugly as sin, Lamia's transformation from this into something a little more 'photogenic', so as to blend into Stormhold more easily, sees her morph not into some model-turned-singer-turned actress under thirty the film may have cast, but Michelle Pfeiffer - such is the manner in which Pfeiffer has aged so gracefully.<br/><br/>Principally, the film is about this young man in Tristan desperately wanting to venture out beyond what he knows and entrusts to impress somebody he barely knows beyond that of looks from afar and bare bones reputation. His experiences in Stormhold, making up the crux of his circular journey, turn out to be rather frightening and somewhat dangerous and his coming into contact with this fallen star Yvaine sees him learn to both accept and respect what it is he has to begin with as well as to come to learn how to love a member of the opposite sex through ties and bonds which unfold naturally over a set period of time over lusting for the town's pretty-girl everybody wants a chance at. In depicting such notions, the film is quick to portray the predominant female characters as vampish or even evil; Yvaine representing the ultimate in purity or innocence whom, in the eyes of the film, are far more accessible and righteous and allow the protagonist to see sense.<br/><br/>The film is a road movie of sorts, a touching enough romance contributing to a young man's exposure to the world and an at once brutal chase movie documenting some fairly desperate characters each chasing the same item for sake of respective goals leaning towards absolute power and/or pride. Its combinative aura of hybridisation and homage is encapsulated in both its dizzy supporting cast of screen legends and lower-key British talent whom, up until only a few years ago, were more inclined towards televisual work as well as its spasmodic leaping from content more inclined towards fantasy, fairytale and adventure clashing with some rather violent sequences egged on by the infrequent helping of animal cruelty. Regardless, Vaughn is a director that knows how to keep things moving along; he knows he's running off of a plot that might've been torn from a mid-50s, Classical era Hollywood B-movie Western feature of about 85 minutes and just runs with it – the results, of which, are more often than not really quite funny; somewhat practical and remarkably absorbing."

","I didn't think I would like this film, but did. I took a chance and am glad I did. It reminded me of The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe but better. I think the part of the film that stands out is that alone and poor was the destiny of a king. The stars saw his love and determination and one came to claim him. Whoever the writer was had an incredible imagination. I am glad that it was a film that could please an older audience as well as a younger one. I hadn't seen Claire Danes in awhile and this time she had no eyebrows!! I wasn't ready for that part but got used to it throughout the film. Michelle a witch and Robert a pirate-no surprise there, but then again if you have seen the Witches Of Eastwick, it makes sense."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","0","0","2 July 2008"," Wit and charm win out in ""Stardust""
","Sometimes in cinema, being clever and silly can hide a movie's obvious flaws, or at least make you forget about them. ""Stardust"" fits right into that category with its colorful cast of characters and witty little British sense of humor. This is not a fantasy film of ""Lord of the Rings"" proportions and it doesn't try to be (except for an overabundance of transition scenes laden with grandiose music), instead coming more out of ""The Princess Bride"" vein, only with not as talented acting and not as well-developed characters. Basically, it's enough to wet a fantasy lover's whistle, providing just over two hours of engaging, swashbuckling entertainment.<br/><br/>""Stardust"" is classic fantasy plot, delivered to us by well-known fantasy writer Neil Gaman. A boy living in a re-imagined England that is surrounded by fantasy lands is infatuated with a girl and promises her a piece of a fallen shooting star as his commitment to her, only to find an unfathomable adventure waiting for him as he sets out to find it. In fact, he finds stars are actually people and this one is a young woman (Claire Danes) with a bit of an attitude. After this fantasy world is established with a few side plots, one including Michelle Pfiefer as a witch seeking the star to restore her youth, the plot becomes rather predictable.<br/><br/>The dialogue, to be honest, is atrocious in most of this film. The comedic scenes work better, but the ones where the film actually takes the plot seriously are no good and the acting doesn't help out. As much as Pfieffer looks the part, she's not much of an actress, coming across as a laughable villain. Claire Danes gets better as the film progresses, but she just feels like a poor woman's Gwenyth Paltrow and nothing more. Stealing the show, however, in his limited opportunity to do so, is easily Robert DeNiro as a lightning-harvesting sky pirate named Cpt. Shakespeare to whom there is more than meets the eye. He is fantastic and comes at a critical point to save this film from being plain old boring. There are a few other great cameos as well thrown in the mix to cover the otherwise unmemorable acting and half- developed characters.<br/><br/>While ""Stardust"" bounces in and out of being a film that takes itself seriously as an adventure flick and one that tries to be silly and completely not serious, the overall tone that encompasses both is still plain old ""fun."" Fun doesn't have to be well-executed or perfectly scripted, it just has to make you smile and forget about that kind of stuff that would normally matter in a serious movie-going experience. In that sense, all the kudos to Matthew Vaughn and this giddy little project of his. If only it had gotten better advertising."
"JoeytheBrit","Null","0","0","10 April 2008"," Entertaining time-filler
","Hurled into the UK public's consciousness late in '07 largely on the basis of the Take That single over the end credits and Jonathan Ross's shameless plugging of wifey's script on his own chat show, Stardust is an enjoyable enough fantasy adventure aimed presumably at the early-teens, which you sense never quite manages to be as magical as it is trying to be.<br/><br/>Charlie Cox gets his big break here as Tristan Thorne, a likable young man who crosses the Wall to a mystical land to find a star that will prove his love for the fickle Victoria (Sienna Miller). Cox is amiable enough but is a little too bland or my liking to sustain a career as a leading man. Despite an eye-catching cameo from Robert de Niro as a cross-dressing sky pirate who likes nothing more than slapping on the make-up to dance the can-can when alone in his quarters, it's Michelle Pfeiffer, in her first role for some time, who steals the show as one of a trio of decrepit old witches who are also in pursuit of a star to rejuvenate themselves. This is largely because de Niro bungles his part, seemingly unable to manage the camp feyness he reveals to Tristan but which he conceals behind a bluff macho façade in front of his crew. Ricky Gervaise is also amusing, even though he's pretty much playing David Brent in a pointy hat.<br/><br/>The story is entertaining enough, even though it adds nothing new to the genre and bears a strong resemblance to Princess Bride at times. It's the kind of film that will probably delight the kids without boring their parents, even though some of its ideas seem underdeveloped. At times the editing leaves something to be desired with a couple of scenes ending too abruptly and emphasising more adroitly how important rhythm is to a film than any editing masterworks could ever do.<br/><br/>Watch it, though, and you'll be entertained even though you may well not bother recommending it to others."
"RevolverConnery","9","0","0","16 March 2008"," A must see from 2007
","You wouldn't be able to tell by the previews that were shown on TV and in theaters that this is a must see movie. Like several good movies in 2007 it was over looked. If you're a fan of fantasy movies that don't take themselves too seriously, something along the lines of the Princess Bride then you will love this movie. During some sequences I almost fell out of my seat from laughing so hard. It's a great film. However it's not for younger kids even with the fantasy setting. Additionally, they might not get some of the jokes so it won't be as fun for them. It's fine for teens and adults though.<br/><br/>I don't give it a 10 out of 10 though because for all its greatness Stardust has a few flaws. It gets slow at parts and the ending is predictable. The acting is good for the most part and some major movie stars really shine on screen (De Niro in particular) but at the same time let the other younger stars flourish in their own roles. However it does have some tedious parts.<br/><br/>A very solid film that should be in your collection."

","On seeing the Stardust Trailer upon the Tele-box, I didn't expect much. Just another quick fantasy-tale, I thought. Not something worth watching.<br/><br/>However, I was convinced by a friend of mine to go and give it a try. I thank the creators of Stardust, for it has really iterated the phrase ""Don't knock it until you've tried it."" While far from completely true to the book, Stardust is a sweeping tale of fantasy, love, violence and magic. There are moments of complete and utter tension, which is occasionally followed by swift and witty humour. The chemistry between Claire Deanes and Charlie Cox is highly prevalent throughout the film, and the clichés to the stereotypical fantasy story are there and are sometimes incredibly funny. <br/><br/>Some scenes and characters are actually surprising in how well they are played and scripted. Robert De Niro's portrayal of Captain Shakespeare is a totally new direction to most of his threatening, hard-man character, one which he pulls of with amazing potency and skill. Charlie Cox truly does the character justice, and I'm sure we'll see more of him. While unable to outshine the great De Niro or the gorgeous Pfeifer, he has this spark and talent to him that we saw in both of the A-list stars early performances. Claire Deanes once again proves herself to be both absolutely stunning on screen and able to act very well indeed. The Pirate scene where Prince Septimus boards the vessel is brilliantly choreographed, with the fighting and music timed brilliantly.<br/><br/>Matt Vaughn has done well in differing from his usual films, such as Layer Cake, to create an honest and spectacular adaption to the book.<br/><br/>My only comment is that I occasionally felt slightly bored, mainly during the Inn-scene. Michelle Pfeifer was almost too homely. I'm sure others will disagree, but I didn't feel that horror and tension I really should have.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, anyone who enjoys a Fairytale that will surprise you with it's combination of hilarious humour and magnificent storytelling, this Film is for you."

","When I first saw the preview for this, I really didn't think much of it. I thought that the fantasy movies had been beaten to death over the years, and it was now a dead genre. But from the mouths of friends and the extremely high rating it had on several websites, I gave it a chance and put it on my netflix list. I watched it late one Sunday night.<br/><br/>The next 2 hours and 7 minutes was probably the most enjoyable time I had watching a movie in all of 2007.I realized that this isn't just a good movie, it's a GREAT movie that is an instant classic.<br/><br/>As for the aspects and elements of Stardust, everything was perfect to me. The acting is very well done with a few newcomers like Charlie Cox, and the same goes for the more familiar actors like Robert DeNiro, and Michelle Pfiffer.<br/><br/>The effects were stunning, and very freaking cool as well. The best part about that I thought stood out was the writing. I haven't read Neil Gaiman's novel, but I'd like to. The script is awesome and some of the ideas in this film seemed brand new to me.<br/><br/>So in short, after you've seen the movie, I want you to ask yourself, how does it get any better? Sword fights, evil witches, awesome magic, seemingly masculine flying pirates, dancing, wisecracking ghosts, Ricky Gervais, and true love. It's the most beautiful of elements all rolled into one great movie.<br/><br/>10/10"

","After seeing abominations such as Transformers and movies with great acting but nearly no plotting (re: There Will Be Blood), it was a genuine delight to experience Stardust.<br/><br/>Except for the unfortunate character stereotype (sort of) Captain Shakespeare, the script is superb for its genre, the performances are scintillating, and the production values are excellent. It never takes itself too seriously (a contemporary methodology) and moves along rapidly while providing adequate amounts of humor, pathos, and the occasional special effects.<br/><br/>It was not successful in its USA theater run, but seems to be doing just fine in rentals and DVD sales as the word becomes widespread that people have missed a genuinely good film."

","The wife and I were arguing our way through the video store and decided to rent this title.<br/><br/>It was quite obvious from the DVD case that it was geared towards a female audience but a quick scan of the screen captures on the back made it look like a fairly fantastic movie that promised to impress. The synopsis read a little weakly but we were'nt expecting to end up with an A+ movie at this time of the year anyways.<br/><br/>We were greeted with a fairytale-like introduction but it was quite apparent early on from some minor innuendos that this movie was geared towards an older teenage or adult audience.(I would recommend pre-screening it before showing it to a younger audience.) If you find the content is not too strong for your children then I can guarantee this movie will rivet them down for a quality family movie night.<br/><br/>My wife described the best quality of the movie as a sort of ""Je ne cest quoi.""(I don't know what.) While I must say the first thing I noticed about the movie was it's fantastic score of music which acted like an engine driving each scene along.<br/><br/>There are many reasons why one might enjoy this movie though; The videophiles will find that the visuals although not flawless are still definitely worth mentioning. A high definition version of this movie would definitely please your eyes and put your expensive TV to good use.<br/><br/>To the audiophile you will find that the sound effects are very balanced and appropriate. As I mentioned above the music is a key factor in how I scored this movie.<br/><br/>The plot is to die for if you are into fantasy/ epic/ adventure/ romance/ all of the above movies. At a quick glance it seems very far fetched but when you look back again you will not be able to look away until the credits come up. The acting is solid and will leave you quite satisfied.<br/><br/>The entire movie is well presented and with all of it's elements combined came out of the blue and completely shocked me. I wasn't expecting to be so dazzled by a movie I had previously never heard any mention of. My immediate reaction was to look for other movies directed by Matthew Vaugn but I was disappointed to find a very limited filmography. The next fantasy movie he does I will definitely be seeing on the silver screen."

","I am writing this review as if the movie was standalone. Granted, much of the credit for the plot will go to the book author, but this is a movie review site, and I have yet to read the book anyway (though I greatly wish to, after seeing this movie).<br/><br/>That aside, on to my mini-review: <br/><br/>*** <br/><br/>It is very difficult to make a movie that will entertain both the young and the elder, especially when it comes to that crowd in between, specifically the breed of creature known as ""tweens,"" ""teens"" and the like. Most films don't even bother to take the challenge, and the older audience is left to watch these films simply for the sense of nostalgia rather than for serious enjoyment.<br/><br/>Stardust takes this challenge on without breaking a sweat.<br/><br/>The only thing Stardust asks at the door is for an openness to magic and warm, fuzzy love stories.<br/><br/>In fact, if I was to describe the movie in a word, I'd have to use vocabulary practically unheard of in a standard American 20-year-old's dictionary: Cute.<br/><br/>So, whether you're a young lad(y) who knows little to nothing about love's more intimate activities, or you're a strapping young (wo)man who has outgrown the bedtime stories, Stardust will deliver to you a world that you'll not soon forget."

","Another fantasy movie! Or should I say, another fantastic movie! This was on my movie ""hit list"" ever since I saw the trailer. Another sweet old fantasy, with elite actors, amongst which the unmistakable, immortal Robert De Niro. But no, this is so much more. I can't believe that such a movie could be concocted in our present time, and what's more unbelievable is the fact that the story is in itself a masterpiece, the special effects are refreshing and used to wrap said story in a veil of immaculate detail and beauty, they are not just used to fill in the blanks. Strong female characters bring an extra sparkle to the plot, as one is a radiant beauty, confronted with the reality of a world she has always spied on, but never lived in, and the other is at the opposite side of the specter, being one of the most well-designed villains I've seen in the past few years. I haven't laughed so much in quite a significant amount of time. It was probably the scene that took place on Captain Shakespeare's ship, in the glorious rhythm of the French Can-Can, or maybe the constantly present, and forever enlarging audience of ghosts, watching the spectacle and adding tiny, but well-felt comments to the tale. The dialog was so alive, the characters moved their lips and spoke with a clear purpose, that of telling their own stories, of helping you see and feel everything a little better. This movie will make you laugh, but it will also make you cry, and learn. It contains one of the most significant monologues regarding love, and the numerous symbols used to portray this immensely crucial, but nowadays under-appreciated power have managed to bring me to tears. Watch this movie, and understand it. A metaphor for the meaning of life, and a reason to actually come down from the skies in which we all wonder sometimes, and live, and it is all disguised in a modern-day children's film. Everything, starting from the perfect image, stunning landscapes, tangible, inspiring characters, well-thought and chiseled story, to the music, plot and moral-filled ending, will make you shine all throughout this great work of art!"

","I didn't know what to expect when I picked Stardust up at the video store, but I just love Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert DeNiro, they're two of my favorite actors/actresses in the world. But after hearing some decent reviews, I figured this would be a film worth looking at. I think in some ways this is the new Pricess Bride for a new generation, we've been needing a good fairy tale movie for a while. Stardust is magical and a wonderful story that will charm it's way into your heart. The cast was so wonderful and a great match. Although I'm going to be a bit traumatized for a while with Robert DeNiro's part for a while, but it's all good... I guess... since he's already proved that he's a man's man... OK, moving on. Stardust is a wonderful family film that I'm sure will be a classic for generations to come.<br/><br/>Tristan is just a hopeless romantic looking for the hand of the fair maiden, Victoria, but she's a bit of a brat with high standards and says that if he captures a fallen star that crashed into the Earth that she will marry him. He goes for it and finds out that the star is a person, Yvaine, who is a beautiful girl, she does go with him with promises to get back home. But there is one problem, she's a wanted lady, she will restore youth to three ugly and evil witches and also if captured, by some greedy brothers, will be rewarded with the king's crown and kingdom. But Tristan and Yvaine face a mighty adventure and fall in love with each other.<br/><br/>Stardust is a wonderful fairy tale that doesn't over do anything and is just lovely to watch. But I tell you, Michelle Pfeiffer is just like the most beautiful woman who is almost in her 50's! How does she stay so perfect?! I think this movie was more of a documentary than a film, lol, just kidding, but she does look amazing in Stardust and does a chilling performance.

For some reason, I was quite sure that the story would either prove uninteresting, or (more likely) the writers would be so ""clever"" that they outsmarted the audience. I was sure it would be so confusing that I would have no idea what the movie's about. I sort of expected only so-so acting, too. Well, I was pleasantly surprised Stardust. This very engaging story held me from beginning to end, and the characters were well thought-out and well-portrayed, with the heroes holding my sympathy and the villains my disdain.

The, literally, luminous Claire Danes shines just like Robin Wright did so long ago, each in their own special way. A golden god of a young man playing the romantic lead: in this case it's Charlie Cox, not Carey Elwes. Two parallel worlds so close to one another, yet so different.

","Ever since the last installment of ""The Lord of the Rings"" came out in December 2003, it seems like there hasn't been one single fantasy movie that has been able to pleasantly surprise me, maybe because the bar was set so incredibly high. The one exception to this rule was ""Pan's Labyrinth"", without discussion a work of genius by Guillermo Del Toro. ""Eragon"", ""King Kong"", ""The Chronicles of Narnia"" and many other LOTR-wannabes were all but sheer garbage, and it seemed the fantasy genre would never get back up to speed, until ""Stardust"" caught my over-critical attention.<br/><br/>First, the story doesn't seem to have anything remotely connected to Tolkien's mythology, which goes to show it is possible to write fantasy without ripping of ""The Lord of the Rings"". All is kept light, witty and easy to follow for big or small children alike. The casting is also one that is ""worth repeating"", as the starting reels on the classics from the '30s and '40s would say.<br/><br/>The second thing that is captivating about this movie is the level of fun it seems to radiate out towards the audience. It's clear to see that the actors had lots of fun making this movie, and it shows both in their acting and the rate of the movie, which seems to be rolling in front of your eyes at the speed of sound. Time indeed flies when you are having fun.<br/><br/>This movie goes to show you once again that with the right cast, you can pull off just about anything. Robert de Niro for example is fantastic as the queer pirate captain, making fun of himself and his reputation as an actor that supposedly only plays mob bosses or other tough guys. Claire Danes is radiant (no pun intended), and Michelle Pfeiffer makes for a good witch.<br/><br/>The only points of criticism on this movie is that the humor is sometimes just a little too much (I guess this was done to keep this movie suitable for all members of the average family), and the movie suffers from the blatant overacting during about half of it. But hey, if it's worth doing, it's worth overdoing, right? Seven star(dust)s!"

","This was a fantastic movie. The trailer gave it no mercy; the real movie was so much better.

Her named is Victoria Forester and has already planned a marriage with another man. Tristan is mortified to learn that he might lose Victoria so he decides to make her a promise. he sees a star go over the wall. he promises he will get it for her if she will marry him.

","I just finished watching this movie, and i want to watch it all over again. Stardust, to put it into a few words, is one of the best movies to come out in 2007, if not the THE Best, and I can safely say that next to Lord of the Rings, its quite possibly the most spectacular fantasy movie I have ever seen. it has all the makings of a classic, and is surely destined to be one. The settings and scenery are lush and beautiful. The effects are seamless and spectacular. The score by Ilan Eshkeri is dramatic. Narration by Ian McKellen is compelling. And the casting is exceptional, from Robert De Niro as the delightful sky pirate Captain Shakespeare to Pfeiffer as the sumptuously evil witch to the absolutely radiant Claire Daines as Yvaine.<br/><br/>The story revolves around a star that tumbles to earth as a result of the aforementioned family feud, assuming human form in the likeness of Claire Danes, who certainly does have the right sort of luminosity to pull off the role. Soon it's open season on Yvaine, for that is the name of the star, with Tristan (Charlie Cox) seeking a gift for the girl he loves, Lamia the witch (Michelle Pfeiffer) out to gather some heart of star beauty treatments, and the last (but not least) prince seeking his kingdom.<br/><br/>Packed with excitement, magic, comedy and romance, as well as morbid humor, lots of murder (without blood or gore) and Robert DeNiro as you've never seen him before, you won't even notice that you've been glued to your seat for over two hours.<br/><br/>I simply cannot describe how much I enjoyed this movie, its simply flawless, It's combined elements of humor, action, fantasy, and surprise, make it a must see movie for the whole family. If you have not seen this movie yet, you're missing on a great deal. not only you definitely must watch it, but the DVD is a must buy."

The casting was also superb, as all actors fit their roles perfectly. Even DeNiro, who is already a well known actor might surprise people in more ways than one with his performance.

","What can I say about Stardust? Well everything that's what! It was nearing the end of it's run here in New Zealand and I heard it was one of those hidden gems. I only went in with that knowledge and that it had Robert DeNiro, Michelle Pfeiffer and Claire Danes. DeNiro I was already a fan of and Pfeiffer was also a villain I saw in Hairspray (I guess she wanted something wicked this comeback season). Enough about that, what about the movie? <br/><br/>I was quite surprised that the UK side of the cast had quite a punch with Sir Ian McKellan narrating, Peter 'O Toole playing a less than scrupulous king and the likes of Rupert Everett and Mark Strong as part of the 7 princes. Their antics were quite enjoyable and showcased classical and sometimes surprisingly simple deception and trickery mixed with more contemporary humour. Ricky Gervais was also there as Ferdy the Fence with some pretty witty dialogue if you are familiar with him.<br/><br/>Prominent names aside for a moment, Charlie Cox managed to pull off what I would call a tightrope role. Playing Tristan Thorn, he had various qualities that seemed awkward and subtle, something unlike the typical fairytale hero archetype. I didn't think he was a total clumsy oaf, or a godly saviour like most fantasy genres tend to overdo. He managed to stay real and convincing which is a delightful rare occurrence. Cox will be big some day.<br/><br/>Claire Danes, the literal star of the film. I just loved how they used the SFX appropriately and many people would agree that the effects with Yvaine were indeed special. Playing this out of the world character was bang on the mark for Danes this time. It's been a nice comeback for Pfeiffer and her role as Lamia seeking youth is ironic as she is really one of the most gracefully aged actresses I've ever seen. Lamia is basically fearful like your normal witch but with the looks of a dangerous vixen. Oh yeah, DeNiro can still do it. I won't even bother to detail him as he is something that is best experienced firsthand! <br/><br/>All of this has been packed into a deep and magical world created by Neill Gaiman with a nice original score (with some orchestral classics). The plot goes in many directions and may seem a little bit cluttered, but when approached with an open mind like when you heard your first fairytale you'll fall in love with it."
"HogwartsBean","7","0","0","4 November 2007"," Predictably magical...
","Just like many others I didn't expect much from this film, and for me it didn't really deliver as much as it could have. It was as predictable as every other fantasy film that gets released these days. The writers had obviously attempted to come up with a new idea, the idea of stars falling from the sky generally doesn't conjure up the image of Claire Danes. However it comfortably falls into its role as a stereotypical fairytale and if your after a happily ever after story then this one is definitely for you.<br/><br/>The acting in my opinion generally delivers, with Robert De Niro particularly shining. Charlie Cox and Claire Danes play their characters well, even though they lack originality which would have really given this film a spark. My personal favourites came in the form of the Severn Brothers including David Walliams and Rupert Everret. Cameo's from Mark Williams and Ricky Gervais both managed to raise a smile. <br/><br/>Overall I'd give the film a 7 out of 10, it needed just a little more sparkle."

","One of the hats I have worn in my life was a kindergarten teaching hat. No, the hat didn't have Barney on it, but it was an intense year, where I prepped for hours just to make something ""simple"". One thing that made life easy though were the abundance of material to be gleaned from fairy tales, be them Hans Christian Anderson, or the collective works of Wilhelm and Jacob Grimm. Not only did I get a chance to relive a time that was less complex, it was full of great inspiration and images for stories of my own.<br/><br/>Well, it seems it has also inspired Neil Gaiman, who has really made his mark in the world of film as a writer of fantastic stories. Neil announced his presence with MirrorMask, an absolutely absorbing visual journey into the abstracts that were dominated by geniuses like Lewis Caroll, George McDonald and C.S. Lewis in the previous couple of centuries. He has also scripted the screenplay for the upcoming production of Robert Zemeckis' ""Beowulf"", which I await the screening of with great anticipation. Original fantasy has taken a back seat until recently, and I am deeply heartened by the release of ""Stardust"".<br/><br/>This movie has all the attitude and atmosphere of a deep, rich fairy tale. It's full of magic, spells, witches, pirates, mortals and immortals. And, a fallen star. It is peculiar that the plot isn't really about the fallen star, but a story about power. It is infested with side stories, but unlike many other movies, the side stories all fall into place and enhance the film without substituting it with sacrificial flashbacks or projections into the future. No, this film keeps a steady pace, laced with humor and some great twists. There is a dependency on CGI, but for the most part, the CGI never intrudes on the live action in ways that would detract it from it's fairy tale roots. The plot, seeing it is bound by the premise of power, firmly revolves around a dying king and his 7 sons and who will get to wear the crown after the king has departed. However, there are sub plots: Seems a mortal wants to marry the prettiest girl in town, promising to bring her a shooting star that has landed in a mysterious plot of land on the other side of a ""protected"" wall. There is also a witch and her sisters that wants to be immortal, young and beautiful again. Whatever the case may be, all the subplots are all bound to a beautiful ""Star"".<br/><br/>The theater experience was pretty damn good. It wasn't overcrowded, and there was a good mix of ages. But the one thing I will say is that even the kids that came to watch this film were held captive from almost the opening scene. There was little talk, and I think only two people got up throughout the entire 126 minutes that this film required to complete. Its just enough time to remember you still have popcorn left in your bag and finish it and your super-size Coke. I recommend this for children over the age of 8.<br/><br/>For the child in you that reveled in the wake of imagination and fairy tales, you really need to see this film. On the big screen. Soon before it goes away. Its opening weekend box office was a disappointment. It deserved more. I could find very little wrong here."
"ptb4life","10","0","0","13 August 2007"," A Princess Bride for a new decade
","2007 has been a great year for movie lovers. Sure you had to look through the big name drek that was Spiderman 3, Shrek 3, or Transformers....but it was there. Pan's Labyrinth, Children of Men, Letters From Iwo Jima, Ratatouille and I'd even go as far to say that the latest Harry Potter film were all great. I would like to add another film to the list of great 2007 releases...Stardust. Stardust has been gathering lots of comparisons to The Princess Bride and I can see why. They are both fantasy films with a fairly quirky sense of humor. And they both share the central theme of love and acceptance. So yes, they are similar in that regard, but that's about it. I didn't get the sense of deja vu while watching Stardust at all. Is Stardust the better movie? I love The Princess Bride, and I now love Stardust, but PB is a classic movie that has stood the test of time...I wouldn't dare say that Stardust is better...but give it 10 years and we'll see how it fairs. The movie takes its time getting to the meat of the story, but it's nice to see a movie that actually lets us get to know these characters before throwing them into some big adventure. A clumsy shop boy named Tristan is madly in love with the beautiful Victoria, but she plans to marry someone else (unless Tristan can convince her before her birthday). When the two see a falling star, he tells her that he'd retrieve the star for her in exchange for her hand in marriage. She agrees and that's the start of our little adventure. In an effort to keep spoilers to a minimum, I will not go into great detail on the plot. Let's just say that Tristan is not the only person seeking the star (who turns out to be in the form of a young lady named Yvaine). A witch (played by the still incredibly sexy Michelle Pfeiffer) seeking immortality and a trio of princes seeking to become king are also hot on Yvaine's trail. Along the way Tristan meets some unusual characters, but my favorite by far was Captain Shakespeare (played by Robert DeNiro). Captain Shakespeare is just a classic character if there ever was one. I thought DeNiro was a great choice for the role. Since I don't want to spoil any of the jokes or the various twists and turns, I'll keep it simple; I loved the movie. It was quite funny (and not afraid to poke fun at itself), exciting, romantic and good hearted. I give the movie my highest recommendation and I pray that word of mouth can give the movie a bigger box office take than it got this weekend (or perhaps a bigger life via DVD....again like Princess Bride). One more thing, there are few movies out there that I feel have perfect endings (Before Sunset, Pan's Labyrinth, ROTK...), but for me, Stardust's ending was pitch perfect. 2007's top 10 is going to be an interesting one!<br/><br/>A+"

The book is very good the way it is and I'm delighted to say that the film follows the book very nearly to the letter, almost nothing from the story has been changed or omitted, some of the settings have been slightly modified and the ending changed somewhat. Neil Gaiman's fantasy worlds combined with ironic and somewhat suggestive humor are also preserved in their entirety.<br/><br/>The movie is VERY well done, the casting is nearly perfect with the actors fitting into their roles very well and matching very much what I had imagined when reading the book. I was glad to read that sarah michelle gellar turned down the role, Claire Danes is perfect as Yvaine, it's also very nice to see a still very stunning Michelle Pfeiffer doing some work again.<br/><br/>This is one of the best fantasy films made in a long time, it doesn't try to match the epic flair going around lately and keeps itself light hearted and entertaining all the time while still delivering thrills and emotion.

","Although I'm giving it a generous 4 out of 10 for the good cast and acting, this is the biggest pile of shite I've clapped eyes on since time immemorial. There are major tonal problems: at one end of the scale we have a general air of frivolity, with Robert de Niro dancing around in a dress pretending to be gay (which is just offensive for all involved) and Mark Williams hamming it up as a goat-person, whilst at the other end of the scale a man's limbs are broken by voodoo, and various animals slaughtered and their entrails used to predict the future. It's the same mixture of casual violence and stylized frivolity that annoyed me in ""Layer Cake"" by the same director. The film is just endless sound and fury signifying nothing - it's extremely overscored, and there are endless unnecessary pans of dramatic scenery and mountainous vistas in a clear attempt to leach a sense of grandeur from the Lord Of The Rings films. After 2 hours of this unpleasant claptrap, the film ends and Take That come on over the credits. Money back, please."
"kenvandenbussche-2","4","5","16","26 October 2007"," Too much dust on this star ...
","I love science-fantasy movies more than virtually anything else! Aliens, terminators, gremlins, wizards, hobbits or Jedi ... I love to travel to other worlds full of weird and wonderful creatures. So naturally: as soon as I found out that ""Stardust"" was also going to be a fantasy film, my expectations ran very high. I ended up being somewhat disappointed because of two reasons. First of all: I expected too much. I thought this would be another dazzling film that would spawn many sequels such as ""Star Wars"" or ""Harry Potter"". Secondly and most importantly: this movie is a soft-hearted fairytale for children. There are no dark creatures or massive battles to be found. There is hardly even any magic at all; with the exception of three ugly witches doing what they do best. Thus the movie was not what I had anticipated.<br/><br/>The make-up department of this movie surely had their work cut out for them for they had to turn Michelle Pfeiffer into an ugly witch. They did a great job seeing as how one of the most gorgeous women ever in Hollywood indeed looked unattractive in this film. Fortunately: we get to see a lot more of the original Michelle Pfeiffer than the transformed ugly one. Ever since her come-back, this is the second time in a row that the beautiful blonde plays an evil character (the first one was in the hilarious musical ""Hairspray"") and she clearly enjoys this change in her career. Another famous actor who stars in this fantasy film is Robert De Niro. He plays the part of Captain Shakespeare and both his character as well as his performance are quite something else and funny at the same time. There is also Claire Danes whom you may recognize from ""Romeo & Juliet"" and ""Terminator 3: Rise of the machines"". She plays the part of Yvaine - the fallen star who becomes the centre of everything that will occur in this movie.<br/><br/>The storyline however is the cause for my discontent. It is so lifeless. It doesn't contain much more than a young man named Tristan searching for a fallen star and bringing it back as a present to the woman he loves. The entire movie shows us Tristan and Yvaine walking from the fantasy world to the human world. During their journey they encounter many mildly interesting characters. An extremely beautiful witch, a brave yet corrupt warrior who turns out to be one of 7 sons of the king and the only one who's still alive and a flying vessel full of pirates who desperately need to catch as much lightning as possible. The duel at the end of the movie is by far the most captivating moment; I believe. The rest of the movie is mediocre at best.<br/><br/>Nevertheless: I found the sons of the king to be very entertaining. Virtually all of them had died and thus were mostly ghosts throughout this film. That's why they served as an audience delivering clever one-liners and always having a front row seat with everything that transpired in this movie. Unfortunately: such delights are few and far between and whilst this movie is probably entertaining enough, it is almost never really funny.<br/><br/>In short: A perfect movie for children or anyone who likes cute and cheerful fantasy films that hold no darkness whatsoever. I, on the other hand, prefer more mature fantasy films that feature awe-inspiring battles as well as numerous ingenious creatures! The everlasting beauty of Michelle Pfeiffer is always a joy to watch and makes up for this!"
"screenwriting-2","3","11","46","11 August 2007"," A bad movie, maybe good for kids.
","Firstly, you get attached to the main character who turns out not to be the main character. The switch doesn't work because everything that's supposed to make you attached to the new guy is done way to fast and you can't feel what he does. Next, the characters' decisions are not the guiding force of their quest. What I mean is, everything happens TO the characters, but they make no relevant decisions to sway the outcome. Everything good is coincidence, or someone else's doing, and everything bad, well that's generally someone else's doing anyway, but the point is, there's no struggle of the characters, just THIS HAPPENED< THEN THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS HAPPENED THEN THIS. And therefore, since the movie overall fell flat, all of these great jokes that would have been really funny, fall flat too cause you're so damn underwhelmed by what's happening.<br/><br/>This is a good movie for kids around six or eight years old. If you are seeing it with them you'll get a kick out of this movie for the aside jokes for adults, since you're not expecting too much. But as a movie, standing alone, for normal people to watch, IT TOTALLY SUCKED."

"dbborroughs","6","3","8","5 January 2008"," I like it not love it-I'm just pecked to death by little flaws...which I'll tell you about...(SPOILERS)
","(Contains lots of spoilers) Too long ago I read the source novel by Neil Gaiman, or rather half, stopping not because the story was bad but rather because I disliked the way the story is told. I'm of a similar mind concerning the film adaptation.<br/><br/>First and foremost I have to say I like the film. Its an okay time killer. Its not the be all and end all that some people have claimed-most recently a person in my office who basically accosted me with her ""best film"" talk. Its an okay film thats wounded by some deep flaws. Keep in mind I do like the film (even as I break it into pieces) Do I need to tell the plot or can we just assume that most people reading this already know the story is that a young man promises to get a falling star for his lady love never imagining that the star would be a young woman.<br/><br/>As a fantasy film it looks pretty good, though to be perfectly honest in the bootleg copy I've looked at actually looks better since its less ""flashy Hollywood dress up"". The effects mostly work and I don't think I can really fault the film on a technical level.<br/><br/>The problems for the most part are two fold,namely some of the casting and the script or perhaps the work of Matthew Vaughn (and sometimes both at the same time).<br/><br/>Sienna Miller is wasted and her part so badly written that there is no sense why Charlie Cox has any interest in her- other than she looks beautiful. She is bland. The same can be said for Claire Danes who looks good but is so incredibly dull. She radiates nothing as the love interest at all. Robert DeNiro looks good but his fay reading of Shakespeare is often amusing but more often than not really belongs in another movie. Its a choice, which like several other ""knowing"" choices that make me want to slap director Matthew Vaughn around.<br/><br/>Let me get into the script and Vaughn's choices. First off the knowing nods that pervade the film wobble it. If the film had been a knowing homage like the Princess Bride (damn I didn't want to mention that) where most of it is tongue in cheek things would be fine, but Vaughn wants to have to it both ways, he wants a serious fantasy with a hero and villains but he also wants to be silly and send it up.<br/><br/>Examples? The way Michelle Pfeiffer looks in the mirror seems much too out of date. We have Captain Shakespeare being overly swishy, which doesn't quite work, we have some of Ricky Gervais' schtick being anachronistic and we have the ghosts of the dead which serve no purpose except to act as redundant Greek chorus and to take an edge off the blood letting. They made me think that they had some left overs make up designs from Pirates of the Caribbean and since Vaughn was such a fan of the Frighteners he decided to use them. Is the movie silly or serious, I don't think the film knows and it cuts down the suspense since neither the witches nor the princes (especially the princes) are ever truly frightening.<br/><br/>The other thing that really bothers me is that it makes no sense internally. Never mind that its top heavy with foreshadowed contrivances (oh please I knew how it was going to go from the start) and cheats (candle), this movie makes no real sense whats so ever.<br/><br/>Want examples? How long was the trip on the sky boat? There's a long sequence of Shakespeare teaching Tristan and yet the time that passes for the witch and the princess seems so much less. Even if its not how fast did Tristan learn? The unicorn would never have brought Danes to the inn. Why? because if it would know about the other dangers it would know that the whole place was bad.<br/><br/>How can the magic (candle) work in Wall when there is some inference that once you cross the wall the magic is gone.<br/><br/>The climax in the witches castle doesn't play right from the cutting of the strap onward.<br/><br/>There are more instances but those are the ones immediately stand out (The Unicorn one got me shhhhhed when I said that the unicorn would never have taken her to the inn out loud.) I could go on and I could dismantle the film (pieces that serve no purpose, The out of place music, the over done riding shots, the goats-which sound good on paper but make no practical sense) but I don't see the point. Its the type of film you're either going to love for what it is flaws and all or you're going to find annoying because it pecks you to death with little details. Personally I've been pecked.<br/><br/>A good but not great movie. Certainly not something I need to see again, but which is worth seeing with a bag of popcorn and soda in the right sort of mind-frame.<br/><br/>Strangely I'm very disappointed. I know some thought I would hate the film and dismiss it out of hand, but I don't, and I'm not. Actually its good enough that I'm really angry that its not better. I'm annoyed because what I think are glaring errors could have and should have been fixed. This is one of those movies than almost works and falls in the cracks. I mean this is taking the line about reaching for the stars and having what we want exceed our grasp a bit too literally."

","This is one of those rare modern properties that seems stuffed to bursting with good ideas. It also seems well able to carry off most of it's high flying whimsies. However, about half way through the film I began to notice a slight air of overcrowding and desperation. It was as if the enormous cast of very loud and very busy characters were tying themselves up in knots trying NOT to fall over each other. It seems a shame that the idea of the homicidal Princes who are forced to hang around after death waiting to see which of them ends up as king ends up competing for screen time with the rather more pedestrian nasty witches who seem to have been rather clumsily lifted from ""Hocus Pocus"". Perhaps these two factions might have somehow dovetailed together better without the LONG and far from convincing ""Deniro as A NELLIE Pirate"" nonsense...( couldn't ""out"" stars Rupert Everett or Ian McKellan take a second to tell SOMEBODY...ANYBODY how unfunny this was...or what a fool Bobbie D. was making of himself? As a gay man....I would gladly have given a little hint about it's being tasteless AND terribly done. I might have put it down to rather innocent insensitivity if the author of the original story hadn't used the word ""Fairies"" quite so blithely in an interview on the DVD).<br/><br/>All in all...there is a moderately appealing 95 minute movie buried in here somewhere...with several sharp and funny performances. Unfortunately the film is SO busy hopping around from plot thread to plot thread that NONE of the characters are ever fully developed...or given much chance to really shine...(which is a shame...because Danes seemed always on the verge of really beginning to glow).<br/><br/>A near miss...which deserved better than it's paltry box office take...<br/><br/>Better luck next time all around."

","Stardust is the story of Tristan Thorn, a young man who sets off on a journey to a land of magic and adventure to bring back a fallen star as a token of his love to the girl he wishes to marry. On the contrary to his expectations, the star isn't just a lump of rock, but a vibrant young girl, who reluctantly has to follow Tristan back to his home village, while she's also hunted by an evil witch, who needs the star to restore her youth, and a number of power-hungry princes, battling each other for the throne of their kingdom.<br/><br/>Based on a novel by Neil Gaiman, Stardust is an adventurous fantasy movie slightly unlike other recent films of the same genre. It draws its inspiration from English folklore, which gives it a fresh touch and original enough a setting. However, the movie fails to capture the spirit of the book that was originally Neil Gaiman's take on classic fairy tales - fairy tales as they were before they were sanitized by Perrault, eventually Disney. It's an honest fairy tale for adults, following the classic pattern of the coming-of-age story of a young man through a quest, without the sugar-coating seen in the kid-friendly re-tellings of stories that weren't originally even aimed for children. This is something director Michael Vaughn appears to have missed, having turned the story into something that resembles action-packed family movies more than the fables the book imitates.<br/><br/>I have mixed feelings about the casting. Charlie Cox is likable enough as the hero of this modern fairy tale, but Claire Danes just isn't convincing as the stubborn star girl, unable to channel the extra-terrestrial earthiness that made the book character so interesting. Sienna Miller, on the other hand, steals all of her few scenes as the spoiled Victoria, giving such a delicious little performance that I wished she had been casted in the leading role instead of Danes. Ricky Gervais and Robert De Niro both have remarkably unfunny supporting roles, at least compared to their usual standard, whereas Mark Strong really caught my eye as the sinister prince Septimus. The real star of Stardust, however, is without doubt Michelle Pfeiffer, who plays the beautiful wicked witch Lamia, easily outshining her co-stars with her charismatic performance and cool charm.<br/><br/>Overall, Stardust is mildly entertaining and passable, but not really outstanding in any way. It has a few action scenes too many, a climactic yet tremendously boring final battle that seems to drag on forever, and a leading romantic couple that lacks the chemistry required for the viewer to be genuinely interested in the fate of their relationship. The quality of the film would have improved a great deal if at least half an hour of it had been left on the floor of the cutting room."

It also has a lot of comedy and some very good FX, so it should have been a bigger hit with general audiences as well. Personally I found it just a pleasing diversion, but somehow missing the qualities that would really make it stand out from the current pack of fantasy epics.<br/><br/>Tristan (Charlie Cox) is a young man who swears to bring back a fallen star from the magical land ""over the wall"" to prove his love for shallow Victoria (Sienna Miller). He discovers that in the magical world a fallen star would take a feminine form, in this case Yvain (Claire Danes), and eventually (at LONG last) falls for her instead. Along the way they're hindered by the sons of the former King (Peter O'Toole) who need to recover the star to claim the throne and by a trio of evil witches headed by Lamie (Michelle Pfeiffer) who can use the star's heart to reclaim their youth. They're also aided by a pirate (Robert Deniro) with a secret.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film for me were the scenes with Deniro and Pfeiffer. Pfeiffer, who I admit I've never particularly liked (or, for that matter, disliked) comes off the best. It's not a difficult part but she balances the comedy demands without making her fearsome personal seem ridiculous, which is an accomplishment. My favorite gimmick in the movie was the way that using magic would gradually age her, which produced some humorous results. Deniro has a short, showy, and comedic part. His role in the film as well as his performance are reminiscent of his part in Terry Gilliam's ""Brazil"" (a far superior film). Most of the really funny scenes in the film come courtesy of Deniro's flamboyant buccaneer.<br/><br/>Aside from that, my favorite bit was probably the continued presence of the princes of the realm, who must stick around as ghosts until a new King is chosen. Rupert Everett was particularly great in the role of the most ruthless of the princes.<br/><br/>I didn't care particularly for either of the leads. Nothing in particular wrong but they just did not have cinematic presence; they were like TV actors stuck in a movie. Ricky Gervais' bit didn't hold up the weight the director apparently thought it would and his death scene felt jarringly gratuitous. The parts with the hero's mother could have been done better and integrated into the larger story more smoothly.<br/><br/>But I think the main thing that kept me from really entering into this fantasy world was just the poor definition of the fantasy world itself. The separation between the ""real"" and the ""faerie"" world was not maintained in the way that you need to in order to really establish a good fantasy world. The people in ""Wall"" are too much aware of the existence of the faerie world, and the people likewise in the faerie world are too aware of those in ""Wall"". That blurs the line between the fantasy and the real and destroys the validity of the story as a faerie tale. I only became conscious of this after watching the film and reflecting on it, but this connects up to some of the things Professor Tolkien said in his brilliant essay ""On Faerie Stories"". The problem isn't the comedy in the fantasy world (Tolkien himself wrote many whimsical fantasies including ""Farmer Giles of Ham"" and the original ""Hobbit""), but rather in the lack of definition or absolute separation between the two worlds, which seem to co-exist even in the same physical space much like ""Oz"" in the original book by Frank Baum. However at least in ""Oz"" Baum makes it very difficult to move between the faerie world and the real world; in this story all it takes is to trick a dude that's standing guard on a wall and you're in the faerie world. This is not to place extrinsic values on the film, but it's a weakness of the fantasy aspects of the film that prevent it from reaching its full potential.<br/><br/>People have compared it to Reiner's ""Princess Bride"" perhaps because of its combination of heartfelt romance and whimsical ironic humor. I recognize these points of comparison and I do think this was probably a good ""family"" film because it could entertain both kids and adults (though personally I thought the violence too heavy for younger kids). I'm tempted to talk about how much better ""Bride"" is, but it's a movie that sort of grew on me over the years. I'm one of the people who actually saw ""Princess Bride"" in the theater (people forget that it wasn't any more of a box-office hit than ""Stardust"" is) and I didn't care for it much at the time. I guess the two share some weaknesses IMHO  occasionally distracting humor, weak leading actors with no presence, and perhaps too much sentiment at times. But over time I was able to look past those things and see ""Bride"" as a great fantasy romance, partly because of its self-consciousness. It's hard for me to say whether ""Stardust"" will grow in my affections in the same way, but I wouldn't rule it out. I also wouldn't be surprised if audiences discover it on DVD and make it a ""cult hit."" My only real doubt is that in ""Bride"" there were at least a few really memorable scenes, especially the duel on the cliffs. There was no real powerful scene like that in ""Stardust"", nothing that provided a lot of action while advancing the characters. I didn't think it was a great film, but it surely has something different and special to offer and I feel it deserved better treatment on its first release compared to most of the other stuff I've seen this summer (especially that awful 3rd Pirates film)."

","so like i dragged 5 friends out to see this movie opening night based off of internet buzz and name (Neil Gaiman/Matthew Vaughn), i go to one movie all summer, what was i thinking. i mean, i paid for this crap, yet saw the Simpsons movie for free! i feel so bad, this flick sucked! we all knew little of the movie other than the terrible print ads that made the film look like an upcoming fall TV show, but based on the promise that this was based off of a Neil Gaiman graphic novel and directed by the guy who did Layer Cake, and reviews that touted it as a spirited romantic comedy fantasy similar to the Princess Bride, we were all unduly interested.<br/><br/>out and out this movie Stardust sucked. while it started off promisingly with an unpredictable plot trajectory, by the time Claire Danes appears, everything starts to go down hill. first off, her acting is mediocre, (i was like Angela!), as does most of the acting in the film, and there was no chemistry between her or Charlie Cox who plays the hero Tristan or whatever, who at no point has the gravitas to come across as at all heroic, not even by the end battle scene. while the dialogue is not particularly bad, every scene is directed in a style where it's like the director and cast are all in on the joke and they're all winking at the audience. now while some people in the audience i was with ate the jokes up like pigs at the slop, by the time Robert Dinero appeared as the closeted gay pirate, the whole film just lost it completely. every gay stereotype comes out in dinero's hammy performance, and here's the joke! they got tough guy Dinero to act like a queen and ham it up and put on women's clothing, oh how clever, aha ha ha! by this point the film was just stupid and insulting, and downright homophobic in it's regurgitation of queer stereotypes. what was Robin Williams not available? <br/><br/>anyways, by the time the whole thing comes stumbling to a conclusion, everything is so corny, hokey, and cheeseball, i was left wondering, where was the actual adventure? or the action? all i remember was some walking around and fuzzy overdone cgi. and choppy editing. there was nothing memorable or special like say, the princess bride, which this was striving so hard to be. this ain't even Legend. this ain't even Krull. leaving the film, i could see how this story could have worked as a graphic novel, and i could see how it could have possibly worked as a film adaptation had the filmmakers and director Vaughn spent more time playing straight and telling the story and directing his actors, and less time winking at the audience and assuming that it's still fashionable to be all postmodern and break the 4th wall in every scene.<br/><br/>finally, i must say, Charlie Cox is no leading man, contrary to some predictions, he will not become a big star. the kid can't act, and the hairy chest is a deal breaker."

As you can guess from my rating this is the bad one. A predictable plot, unmemorable lead male, bad translation from book to film, lacking in original humour and a stupid ending.

"taki_leniwy","4","4","13","26 October 2007"," rewriting the book?
","Every time a novel is launched to theaters, the writers of the script must decide whether to adapt the story faithfully or to add their touch, maybe to shorten it or mix it with their own ideas. Peter Jackson's crew did a fine job, creating an entertaining story for both standard movie goers/non-original book readers and those who believe words written by Tolkien are sacred. The Stardust writing team, however, did not.<br/><br/>Although I must acknowledge their efforts to develop characters that were not as significant in the novel, like Captain Shakespeare (or Shake-spear if you prefer) giving Robert De Niro a chance to express his creativity, or making Secundus' death something more than just a line in Septimus' bio, the writers went definitely too far when they... changed the ending! The witch-fighting scene is one of the most ridiculous scenes ever (those mirrors breaking, but not hurting anyone - what was the point?). But then, the sword-fights (although none have taken place in the original) are quite well choreographed and somewhat entertaining. The film drops some of the important characters, introducing others instead. All in all, the movie lacks balance between creative additions and radical changes to the story.<br/><br/>What can be said about the actors? Charlie Cox, does his job I guess. Like Orlando Bloom in Kingdom of Heaven. You watch him on screen and wonder: ""Is the movie really about this guy?"". Claire Danes - again, nothing special and a little too old, if you'd ask me, for the role of a never-aging Yvaine. It's always fun to watch De Niro, but his role also does not stand out. The same goes for Michelle Pfeiffer. Acting is simply mediocre and uninspiring.<br/><br/>In the end it all comes down to your attitude towards book adaptations. Some like them strict, others like it when directors get carried away. Maybe I'd see it in another way if the credits stated: 'Based loosely on the...'. I did like the blue-bleeding Primus though - something truly original."

Unfortunately, I've never read the book, though I've heard good things about Neil Gaiman, of course. Therefore, I can't comment on how close the film was to the source material. I can, however, say that this was a terrible movie.<br/><br/>Visually, it's not bad: there's a lot to look at. The acting is all right, even though some of the accents are quite off.<br/><br/>But the movie can be best summarized this way: it is plot without substance. There's nothing to this movie: the storyline rings shallow, and there's no real feeling to it. It's simply one plot point after another without any depth. The humor doesn't hit the mark, and the film just ends up very flat and lifeless. It's obvious from the first five minutes how the plot will be resolved, and the film never seems to make an effort to get the viewer to care about that ending.<br/><br/>I've seen worse films, certainly, and parts of the disjointed plot are mildly entertaining, but overall this film was quite a failure."

If you are willing to overlook the flaws of the first half, you are likely to have a good time. It gives you everything you could want from a fantasy film.

"flyingamon","Null","1","2","15 April 2011"," Just wonderful
","Stardust is just a fantasy movie like I want it to be. It does have excitement, humor, colorful characters and a good story. That it does contain magic and witchcraft is a plus too. I rather have this than the endless battle scenes you got to see in for example Lord of the Rings. There is not much fighting going on in this movie so the filmmaker concentrated could concentrate much more on the plot and does a very good job of that. The story might have been done before but it's certainly not something that I would expect in a fantasy movie. I want to give a special mention to Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert de Niro who really excel in their roles. They do have so much experience and prove despite their age they have not lost any of their great acting abilities. Michelle was perfect as the bad but beautiful witch which was not her first time in such a role as she played some kind of a witch in the Witches of Eastwick long before this one. De Niro was really funny in his role as the commander of an air ship and I really had a good laugh with one particular scene of him. Yes the humor is absurd at times like the princes who die one by one and land as ghosts into a waiting room watching the story develop as if they were sitting in theater as well. Bu that didn't bother me one thing, on the contrary it was refreshing. Okay the love story of this movie might be quite cliché and predictable but it didn't make me think of the movie less. I just love it and would recommend it to anyone who loves an entertaining movie."

I haven't read the book so I can't say much about it being close to the original, but it really captures the feeling you had as a child when you were read fairy tales. The empathy you have with the characters truly keeps you wondering what will happen next! Knowing Hollywood they'll throw loads of money in special effects and gloat when the audiences stare at the pretty colors and awe, so i can't say much about that. But the overall feel of the film is full of emotion, with unexpected twists that keep you glued to the screen. Those moments just make you feel love, compassion, sorrow, hate... taking you back to a warm bed where the world was so small you could touch the edges with your spread arms, and the words written on the pages of fairy tales really made you hold your breath."

","I was only vaguely aware of the film when it came out but became interested in catching up with it after being bowled over by Vaughn's KICK-ASS (ditto for his debut LAYER CAKE [2004], which I have just rented). In retrospect, it is one of the best fairy-tales of recent memory – though it does not quite possess the vision of a Tim Burton.<br/><br/>The director in any case has managed to rope in a great, eclectic cast: the ladies seem especially well-chosen – though both Claire Danes and Michelle Pfeiffer are clearly past their prime, they still deliver as a fallen star assuming human form and a wizened sorceress seeking to restore her beauty; the others are LAYER CAKE's Sienna Miller as the obligatory snobbish town belle and Kate Magowen as a bewitched princess. Incidentally, Vaughn apparently likes to work with the same people – such as the afore-mentioned Miller and Mark Strong (though now becoming rather typecast in villainous roles). His siblings-turned-ghosts include Rupert Everett and Jason Flemyng (Calibos from CLASH OF THE TITANS [2010]); actually, it was sheer coincidence that I would watch this right after that one and ROBIN HOOD (2010), in which Strong appears as well, having rented the STARDUST DVD for the best part of a month! Robert De Niro is featured in one of his most bizarre characterizations as a literally gay pirate, though it is one of the film's ultimate drawbacks – exposing a certain lack of cohesion – that his entire subplot could be dropped without the narrative losing anything (as it is, at 128 minutes, this definitely feels overlong though never boring). Peter O'Toole turns up briefly, too, at the start as a dying sovereign.<br/><br/>Having a wimp bloom into manhood through a series of extraordinary adventures also seems to be a prime concern for director Vaughn; consequently, here, bland hero Charlie Cox is involved in many a scrape – peppered with laughs, thrills, romance and menace – capped by a doozy of a climax (which even sees a corpse contracting a' la the EVIL DEAD movies). The whole makes for a most enjoyable ride, one which I consider worthy of a cult following."

To be guided, they always made the film easy to follow if one hasn't read the book yet, and they were successful on it. Stardust's story was easy to follow, but of course the history and other relative accounts how the world existed, how things get so magical, what is that and how is that questions can be explained by the book. I was also struck that Peter O' Toole, Ben Barnes, Mark Strong was in this film! I didn't even recognize Robert De Niro was that transvestite captain Shakespeare! And Ian Mckellen was narrating all the time! I got the laughs all the time. I would love to read the book as they say it was darker, graphic and detailed.

A credit must also be given to the crew that successfully wrote, directed, produced and added the finishing touches to this film.<br/><br/>This ill-behaved fairytale begins when young Tristan Thorne (Charlie Cox) a boy who seems a failure at everything and is desperately trying to avoid it promises the girl of his dreams who never quite loved him in return (Sienna Miller) that he shall bring her a fallen star that they recently saw. He journeys into the magical kingdom of Stormhold that is now in great disarray. There he finds the star that is in fact a beautiful young woman (Claire Danes.) Nevertheless, he wants to take her back home through the gateway.<br/><br/>Along the way the quarrelling couple Tristan and the star are hunted by cunning, brutal and merciless villains wanting to slay the star for everlasting youth. They are also helped by strange characters that greatly differ from what they appear to be. At the end of their journey Tristan discover that the answer to all isn't that simple.<br/><br/>Directed by Matthew Vaughn and narrated by Ian Mckellen it's a rare masterpiece in which the many deaths  rather than having no rationale  add to the suspense and wake you up to the danger our hero and heroine are in. You'll find aspects of horror, adventure, fantasy, drama, romance, mystery, moral and occasional humour so as it flies by you begin to wonder whether there's anything this film cannot do.

Michelle Pfeiffer is the perfect witch and it's wonderful to see her anger and frustration as she loses her youth and Tristan and Yvaine continually escape her. Mark Strong is a wonderful--or should it be terrible?--Septimus.

Shakespeare, they are the best of the movie, providing quite a few of the funniest moments in the movie.<br/><br/>Stardust is quite reminiscent of The Princess Bride.

After watching such an original and creative movie I hoped that the ending wouldn't be the classical ""Everyone lives happily ever after"" one. It would be much better if they left it in the scene where Tristan became the king.<br/><br/>Except that the movie is fine, and it is great to watch with the family because it reminds the grown-ups their own childhood and magical worlds while it also appeals to the kids whose worlds are magical. Watch it!"
"garboventures","9","1","2","28 December 2008"," Hugely enjoyable fantasy film with plenty of heart
","I am not generally a fan of the fantasy film genre (I loathed the Lord of the Rings films, for example), and usually only watch children-oriented films because I have been whined into submission by my eldest daughter demanding I take her to the cinema. Based on rather less than stellar reviews, I happily gave Stardust a miss when it hit UK cinema screens in 2007, and didn't bother renting the DVD.<br/><br/>How very wrong I was. Having finally watched Stardust on the small screen, I am amazed I missed out on this first time round. It is a genuinely enchanting piece, elaborating a gloriously imagined magical world. The film sparkles with some mesmerising performances, most particularly from the romantic leads, newcomer Charlie Cox as Tristan and Clare Danes, luminous as Yvaine, a fallen star, who literally glitters throughout. A string of Hollywood veterans put in a strong showing, especially Robert De Niro as a cross-dressing pirate with a heart of gold, and Michelle Pfeiffer, equally camping it up as a decrepit old witch whose main design is to ensnare the fallen star for her own murderous, self-seeking purposes.<br/><br/>There are also marvellous comic performances from some of Britain's finest acting talent, including Rupert Everett, Mark Heap and Jason Fleminge as mutually murdering princely brothers, vying for their dying father's throne. Mark Strong as the wicked Septimus, the longest surviving and most bloodthirsty brother, is a villainous gem.<br/><br/>I am shocked and disappointed that Stardust failed to shine at the box office. The film's marketers at Paramount should be ashamed of themselves. Stardust deserved a bigger audience and I suspect it will gradually gain a devoted fan base through DVD rentals and multichannel TV. It really is too good not to: a dazzling fantasy adventure with a true emotional core."

","A feel good fairy tale that one would tell their children as a bedtime story. Pretty much predictable without any complexities involved.

Her chemistry with Charlie Cox deserves a special mention.<br/><br/>º Robert De Nero has so many accolades in his past that it becomes impossible to judge if he has done full justice and we little mortals are incapable to judge the performance. So safe to say ""No Comments"".<br/><br/>º Special mention is reserved for Michelle Pfeiffer who infuses life into the role of Lamia, the witch. She was an absolute delight to watch.<br/><br/>º Sienna Miller, seriously she picked the wrong role. Anytime Yvaine to gold-digger Victoria. Rupert Everett was wasted in the role.<br/><br/>º Its good to see Peter 'O Toole.<br/><br/>Worth a day's out activity for an one-time watch with kids."

","This is one of those rare movies that I actually enjoyed more than the book it was based on. In fact I have almost no complaints about the film at all. <br/><br/>I liked the way the story was written, the dialog was fine, the cinematography was great, and the CGI was right where it should have been, playing a supporting role instead of dominating the movie and in your face. My interest was held and there was more than enough suspense. The transformation of the handsome Charlie Cox from fumbling dork into handsome prince was done believably and he was convincing in the role of Tristan. <br/><br/>Michelle Pfieffer (as always) was gorgeous, luminous and perfect. Deniro turns in a great performance as a closeted, cross dressing sky pirate, Peter O'Toole was a surprisingly pleasant cameo, and I really liked the way the ghosts of the brothers watched invisibly from the sidelines as they were offed one by one. <br/><br/>The only real complaint I have is the casting or Claire Danes & her accent. The accent to me was completely off and I thought, why not cast the British born Sienna Miller in the role of Yvaine and Danes in the minor role of Victoria? Or even another actress for Yvaine all together (for some reason i'm thinking Julia Stiles would've been really cute.) It's not that I dislike Danes, I just think she was kinda miscast. <br/><br/>Even with the Danes casting the movie still is more than worth the watch. Lots of adventure, magic & fantasy. A lot better IMO than the book it was based on."

","I could easily put this movie in my top ten list. It's one of the few ones I have ever bought the first day it came out. , the movie, is an enchanting story with humor, suspense, and love. You can't really do wrong with it. I bought the book this past week and read it in one day. I was shocked at how different the book is. Now I'm not pulling the overused ""book is so much better then the movie"" comment but they are black and white compared to each other. There is no such thing as Captain Shakespeare in the book, there is a boat but the scene is only two pages long. The King's seven sons and the witch as well play a small roll in the book. I understand why that they had to spruce up the script because it would have been a pretty anti-climatic movie. I wonder though if Neil Gaimon was okay with how the movie turned out. Like I said I absolutely loved both, but am curiously how they ended up so different from each other. Does anyone know anything about it?"

It's a fun, light hearted movie with the element of waiting. And what I mean by that is, while watching it you have wants and needs for the character, which are often correct.

Claire Danes has somehow escaped my notice until now, but after her fantastic performance in this film, I am going to be looking for more of her.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer was simply wonderful as the witch and really gave a great performance in every scene.<br/><br/>And, Robert De Niro.

There are only a couple of other films that I have felt this way about being Big Fish and the Shawshank Redemption.<br/><br/>As such, and despite the occasionally wonky special effects, and horrible Gervais 'cameo' any film that manages to draw me in to such an extent gets a 10."

","This is one of those movies that crept in, seemingly from nowhere, and simply delighted, and enchanted me. I had seen one or two ads earlier in the year for it, but never saw it at my local cinema, nor much promotion about it. But it is one of the loveliest films I have seen in years - classic hero fairy tale, granted, but the romance works (oh, to glow so!) and the good vs. evil works with humour which ensures it retains its lightheartedness without sacrificing drama. The effects are so seamless and artistic as to happily suspend disbelief.<br/><br/>Clare Danes (Yvaine) and Charlie Cox (Tristan Thorn) are both delightful, with a bubbling enthusiasm for the unfolding action. Michelle Pfeiffer is quite, quite amazing, and as for Robert De Niro - simply outstanding.<br/><br/>I would very rarely give a 10/10 rating - but there is no-one to whom I would not recommend this - even the most jaded and cynical would heed a reminder that the world would benefit highly from a little more of what values are so wonderfully crafted here.

"Thrashman88","6","1","2","21 January 2008"," awkward!
","One thing's for sure: STARDUST is not your average, epic-fantasy, lord-of-the-rings rip off kind of movie. On the other hand, it is hard to categorize. While I wasn't overtly crazy about it, it's not a bad film, but the question still remains: was this a comedy? A parody of epic/fantasy films? IMDb description of the movie says ""fantasy"", while I might put ""comedy"" right next to it. I must say I did have a few good laughs, but I tried to make sense out of everything I was watching. It all evolves about a falling star who turns out to be a pretty girl/princess (Claire Danes). There's no explanation as to why she fell to earth, other than ""the stars were aligned"" and all that astrological mumbo-jumbo. On the other hand we have Tristan Thorn, the offspring of a normal peasant and a princess from another, alternate world. A lot of bits and pieces are left unexplained, and just when you feel an explanation is on your way, along comes a funny/campy moment. The alternate world thing could've been better developed me thinks, without sacrificing the comedic edge of the movie. The acting, in some parts, looks forced. It's very rare for me to spot a movie where I think the actor is just ""acting"", but STARDUST was the case. Michelle Pfifer was great, as well as Robert De Niro (so what's new?). And it was a real show stopper to see De Niro in a drag, dancing can can music in what is easily the movie's funniest moment, as well as the scene where a man's voice is turned into a parrot. I bent over laughing.<br/><br/>Still, for all the laughs, STARDUST played to me more like a spoof movie rather than something more epic. I guess the director and writer where aiming for something different in the fantasy genre, but it still looks half baked. I'm sure next time they'll get it right!"

I enjoyed this movie more than any of the pirate movies, potter movies, or lord of the rings movies, which SOMETIMES lacked great story telling trying to make up for it in special effects. The story has an incredible flow and captures you from beginning to end. What is even more surprising is its wit! Every joke was a clear winner with me not coming off to corny and lame. It does have its sappy romance story that the women will enjoy so its a great compromise for a date movie, but also a good movie to watch with your children.

People from England are not supposed to cross, and there is a guard, but one man manages to and has an overnight fling. Exactly 9 months later the old guard brings him a basket left at the wall for him. It contains a newborn boy that he names Tristan. <br/><br/>The story resumes 18 years later and Charlie Cox has grown into Tristan Thorn. He is smitten with a local beauty (Sienna Miller) and says he would do anything to gain her hand in marriage. They see a shooting star, that lands into the fantasy nation, and he vows to retrieve it for her. <br/><br/>The star turns out to be Claire Danes as Yvaine, who contains the secret to eternal life. Most of the rest of the movie involves Tristan trying to bring this ""star"" back to the object of his affection, but in the process he and Yvaine begin to fall in love.<br/><br/>The movie is fun and funny, with what amounts to an all-star cast. There is no message different from the standard one, but it is fun to watch. The critic Ebert has a complete review."

On the bad side, the story was too big to be fitted in 2 hours movie, so some parts i felt like they were jumped upon. It reminded me so much of Eragon, just not boring at all (yes i found Eragon extremely boring and useless), but hope you get what i mean, it's that kind of movies with fairies and imagination which you'd like and smile after watching it. I hardly recommend it to almost any movie fan. Merry Christmas everyone."
"MichaelMargetis","7","1","2","23 November 2007"," A Notch Above Your Average Fantasy Movie
","Old Pirate: (to Captain Shakespeare, after finding him in drag) We always knew you were a whoopsie...<br/><br/>Usually I hate these types of 'fantasy' movies. With the exception of the brilliant 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy' and the charming 'Princess Bride', these fairy tale movies can't hold my interest. Going into 'Stardust' I didn't know what to expect. I thought it could be great, but it could also be a huge, long, stupid bore like most films in the same genre. Well...what I got was a very good film, nothing spectacular, but in a year like 2007 where most of the movies are laughably bad, 'Stardust' is one of the best thus far. The story is silly and doesn't make 100% of sense, but for the most part aside from a few dragging sequences 'Stardust' is a vastly entertaining motion picture with humorous performances. Michelle Pfeiffer returns to the screen after a hiatus of sorts as the film's villain. She is great. Charlie Cox is solid as the lead, as is Claire Danes. The rest of the cast is solid, but I'd like to give kudos to The Office's Ricky Gervasis and of course, 2-Time Academy Award Winner Robert DeNiro playing against type as a gay cross-dressing sky pirate. Even though he doesn't show up until over half of the film is over, DeNiro was the highlight of 'Stardust' for me. Some critics panned his performance as being too hammy and over-the-top, but seeing as though 'Stardust' is a ""FANTASY"" movie, I saw the more hammy the better. DeNiro made me laugh uproariously, along with most everyone else in the movie theater I was in. The biggest downfall of 'Stardust' is that it's overlong. It would have been a better film if they trimmed a few minutes especially towards the end. All in all, I recommend 'Stardust' for anybody in the mood for an enjoyable little action romp. Grade: B"
"Torandi","7","1","2","29 October 2007"," Good as a parody
","I went to the cinema and saw this movie with some friends. At first we were rather skeptical (and everyone blamed someone else for selecting this movie). But after a while we started to realize maybe it wasn't a serious movie. And as a parody, I was really funny. You could guess what should happen in almost every scene, except those that where really unexpected, for example when the 80-years-old man makes a back flip over a wall, and beats the young man with his stick... When the movie was enclosing the end (about 20 minutes to the ""happy ending""), my friend and I made a guess about how the movie would end: ""He will kill all the evil persons, save the girl (and marry her), and become the king."". I wasn't surprised when EXACTLY this happened in the end. In the end the movie also lines up ""last-second-save"" after ""last-second-save"". In the movie there are also a terrifying captain (of a flying ship), who likes to wear ladies clothes and listens to classical music (and is not so terrifying after all). So in conclusion, this was a really good movie, as long as you watch is as parody."

The story was delightful and original. The humor was thoughtful. The acting and special effects were excellent.<br/><br/>I would consider this relatively kid safe.

I had already seen most of the big hype cinema, and some genre's just didn't appeal to me. So I picked Stardust, knowing only what I could read on about the first page of IMDb. A few big names in Supporting Roles, Adventure / Fantasy / Romance Genre, a setting bordering a magical realm, where a young man is going on a quest to prove himself to a pretty woman he pursues.<br/><br/>I was not prepared for the incredible impact of this movie. And still, what was it? There are familiar plot elements from many popular movies and fantasies. Kings, Princes, and Princess, Witches and Magic, Pirates, Ghosts, Transfigurations, Adventure and Love. But is a Story Line I had never heard of, well intertwined with Action, Comedy, Peril and Yearning.<br/><br/>Was it the Stellar Performances of Supporting Roles, like Michelle Pfeiffer, as Lamia, a desperate aging Witch losing her Youth and Beauty? Robert De Niro playing the Pirate Captain Shakespeare turned Fairy Godfather? Sienna Miller as the vain and fickle small town Victoria? Was it the Music that supports every scene, even with adaptation of the familiar Classical ""Can Can""? Was it the Role or the Actress, as the Beautiful and Talented Claire Danes, a real ""Star"" named Yvaine, teaches us the difference between Love and a Crush. Or watching Charlie Cox go from Awkward Young Suitor, to becoming a Man as Tristan? <br/><br/>What I discovered here is something far more important than watching Actors on a Stage, or a Story Line with Action and Plot Elements that can thrill us, Comic Relief that can amuse us. It's not what the Characters Feel and how well the Actors perform it. The measure of a Great Movie, is how it can make the Audience Feel.

There is so much more in this world worth experiencing. Maybe not on the scale of a fairytale kingdom on the other side of a wall, but people ignore the beauty of this world in favor of material gain.

It is obvious that this is fairytale. It has every element of it. Witches, stars, pirates, magic and everything else. Fairy tales are usually made for children, but I think that these stories are made for everyone who is not afraid to say that he still hasn't grown up completely; that he still has something childish left.<br/><br/>Predictable. The whole story was too predictable to me. At the beginning I knew how everything is going to end and that isn't good. I like surprises but I couldn't found any in this movie. I also think that children will enjoy this movie more than teenagers and adults. <br/><br/>Funny. Some scenes are funny and very cleverly made. Like the characters of Primus, Secundus (Rupert Everett is great) and all of the king's sons. I am aiming on their ghosts. That was very funny just like characters of Ferdy the Fence (Ricky Gervais), Guard (David Kelly), King (Peter O'Toole) and especially Billy - the goat (Mark Williams). Also I admire Ian McKellen because of his voice (he's narrator of the whole story). I'm just sad that he didn't show his brilliant acting abilities in these movie.<br/><br/>De Niro. I left him out in section funny because he is story for himself. I think his character is simply great and all of his scenes are great. His appearance is my favorite part of the movie. For me he was very funny, although someone will think that he's only throwing away his reputation. But why don't we all just admire his scene when he wears women clothes and dance? I did."

","People will tell you that that this kind of movie is made for a preteen audience and, hence, should not be judged by the same standards as grown-up entertainment. I get that, but I still think kids deserve better than this. It's a shallow story told as a string of cheap tricks. The script has been soaked in random CGI, like an espresso shot drowned in milk froth. As a result, ""Stardust"" is banal and boring rather than magical and mysterious: the Chronicles of Yawnia. I appreciate the fact that the filmmakers have cast Claire Danes as the fallen star to give daddy something to look at, but I will never forgive them for making her talk in that gruesome boarding school accent. Although I must admit she's pretty good at it for a SoHo girl. So why avoid an obvious pun? Claire Danes' star quality is unrivaled even by an A- list of guest appearances: Ian McKellen as the off-screen narrator, Peter O'Toole as the old king, Robert DeNiro as a gay pirate, and Michelle Pfeiffer as a vain witch reminiscent of Edie on ""Desperate Housewives""."

","There are four points I wanted to make about this film. One: This movie's plot would seem more feasible if it were a typical rated ""G"" Disney movie, but for a movie rated ""PG-13"" I want something more plausible. (Yes even in the fantasy genre, movies can be creditable, this movie wasn't) Two: There was no explanation offered for why Tristan's hair suddenly grew on the ship. If this was a magical ability of Shakespeare then why wasn't this more apparent? Three: Not one single character in the movie wondered what would happen if Shakespeare flew his ship over the wall. (I wondered this immediately after first seeing the ship.) Four: Too many continuity mistakes. Normally this is my least favorite of mistakes that movies make, mostly because I don't even notice them until I read about it on web sites like this one, however I was able to spot several on my first viewing of the movie. Having said all that I still recommend this movie, but only if you have nothing else to do. It's not bad, it's not great either but I don't think it's worth avoiding. I am reminded of something Ebert once said when critiquing a movie. He said ""A great film has at least three great scenes, and no bad ones."" Unfortunately for Stardust I can only think of one great scene and at least three bad ones."

","This movie came highly regarded from coworkers who couldn't believe I hadn't seen it. 20 minutes in I knew I wasn't a fan, but when I checked here I was baffled at the high rating/view count! Did we watch the same movie?<br/><br/>My issue with Stardust is that it's heavily plot/dialogue based and moves the story line quickly, but it's not a particularly great story. It feels like a stream of clichÃ©s delivered by uninspired acting. Everyone in this film is white and cis. There are no surprises. It tries so hard to let you know how dramatic it is. You'll notice the ""epic"" music occurs every other scene.<br/><br/>Maybe the strange badness of this movie is part of its charm, but I found it difficult to sit through. It's not completely unwatchable; mildly interesting stuff happens frequently on screen. I'd probably enjoy it more if it wasn't such high production, or had better actors. I really just wanted to turn it off and watch Harry Potter instead."

","I'm amazed at the good reviews for this boring, amateurish and overlong stab at a PRINCESS BRIDE-type fantasy. There's a reason why this tanked at the box office -- because it's a mess. It's like someone took a bunch of fantasy film elements, threw in De Niro as a gay pirate as a sop to PIRATES OF THE CARIBBEAN fans, then tossed in a Renaissance Faire and threw it all in a blender, set to ""baby food puree."" Maybe the book is really good or something and the film just didn't capture it, but I don't have much desire to read the book after seeing this. Charlie Cox was just about the only watchable element; Claire Danes seemed seriously miscast (maybe Gwyneth Paltrow was unavailable?), while De Niro and Pfeiffer did the best they could with what little they had. Subplot with murderous princes wasn't very interesting (and the dead princes commenting on the action just wasn't amusing at all). Special effects were hokey when they weren't pointless (did we need an extended scene of shards of shattering glass, and three falling chandeliers when one would have done?), the film had no original visual style whatsoever, and the score was pedestrian. I would like to see Charlie Cox again in a better film, though."

The characters are not really developed at all, remaining cardboard cutouts on a colorful backdrop - but at least they are cardboard cutouts that are pleasant to look at. The aesthetics here are top-notch, but they are disguising a flimsy, weak story that has been told many times before.

You can feel it working overtime to create the same kind of whimsy that infused a movie that IS a cult classic, ""The Princess Bride."" But that movie was small, charming and simple. It didn't stuff itself to the brim with digital effects and thunderous action the way ""Stardust"" does, and the latter film doesn't come close to the former. But I did appreciate the humour in ""Stardust"" and its refusal to take itself seriously. Charlie Cox and Claire Danes are likable enough as an impetuous English lad and the fallen star he falls in love with, respectively. Michelle Pfeiffer looks gorgeous (at least at first) as a witch intent on regaining her former beauty, even if she's not at home with the film's comic elements. Unfortunately, Robert De Niro is miscast as a swishy pirate with a penchant for corsets and boas, and his big comic scene just feels uncomfortable. But Ricky Gervais adds some fine comedy in a couple of brief scenes, and Peter O'Toole lends the whole thing some credentials by virtue of his mere presence.<br/><br/>Even if it has its faults, I liked ""Stardust"" and hope to see more films like it.<br/><br/>Grade: B+"

"Leofwine_draca","6","1","4","30 December 2016"," Sugary, effects-filled extravaganza
","STARDUST is one of those flimsy, lightweight, CGI-fuelled effects extravaganzas that have been all the rage in cinema as of late. Eschewing plot and character in favour of pithy one-liners and outlandish caricatures, this is an adventure yarn aimed squarely at the masses and focusing on style over substance. Needless to say I'm not the ideal target audience; I'm a guy who likes something solid in his films among the effects, and I didn't find it here.<br/><br/>That's not to say it isn't entertaining. On a superficial level, it definitely is. The CGI effects are pretty good and the fantasy world is well imagined. A near-continuous plethora of cameo appearances also helps out on the entertainment front too: Robert De Niro has a ball as a camp pirate, Michelle Pfeiffer equals him as a wicked witch, and Mark Strong does his snarling bad guy routine very efficiently. Then there are brief turns from Jason Flemyng, Dexter Fletcher, Sienna Miller, Peter O'Toole, Ricky Gervais, David Kelly, Rupert Everett, and Ian McKellen as the sonorous narrator. These help pass the time. Claire Danes is a bit wishy-washy as the fairy-type character, though, and I never did end up warming to Charlie Cox's lead.<br/><br/>Still, there are moments of inspiration amid the chaos and the fantasy stereotypes. The ending, in which Strong's character is exposed to all manner of dark magic, is very well realised. There are twists galore, and a level of breathless imagination usually missing from fantasy films. The resultant concoction is a bit like a sugary sweet: fun at the time, but not something you'd want to return too for fear of an upset stomach."

It is interesting that Michelle Pfeiffer chooses to do another evil character after her role in Hairspray.

Cox and Danes had great chemistry together. However, De Niro just didn't work as the gay pirate. The scene in the closet was painful to watch.<br/><br/>The special effects were as good as they come but they are not enough to overcome the poorly crafted dialog. A poor choice of words made some the close moments between Tristran and Yvaine sound like two third-graders in the hall. Even some of Michelle's threats sounded laughable instead of scary.

","I approach Stardust as someone who has not read the source material, so I do not have the benefit of being thrilled to see familiar characters brought to life on screen. For me, this is a very strangely distant, disjointed film. There are plenty of interesting ideas, clever lines and fantastic images, but the whole simply does not engage me.<br/><br/>The problem, I think, is the directing. The angles, shots, editing; they do not assist the actors and visuals in connecting with the viewer (read: me). It feels like an anthology of scenes that are linked by story but not put together in such a way as to comprise a cohesive whole. As someone else said, it is ""episodic."" Perhaps that is how the book is, but if so, then I would question the wisdom in adapting such a structure. It feels like a classic example of something that is only the sum of its parts, not more.<br/><br/>As someone who generally enjoys fantasy, is a big fan of Claire Danes and can appreciate a story that plays imaginatively with genre tropes, I expected to enjoy Stardust more. I suppose that to some extent, it just does not synchronize to my sense of aesthetic or sense of humor, the way that it does for other people.<br/><br/>Ultimately, I think that this film is simply a matter of acquired taste. Many people find it tremendously engaging, beautiful, inspiring, romantic. I can see the shards of those things, but ultimately I find myself bored by how it is all put together.

There seemed to be no cleverness to the situations and too many unbelievable moments which was probably due to not enough plot development. I really was waiting for a movie like this one and was hoping that it had the same magic as The Princess Bride, but it just barely missed the mark. The sound was great, the score matched the movie and the special effects well enough but if you have to keep asking how or why that happened then you will never fully be engulfed in the magic of the film.

","This movie was well presented in the trailers, so I decided to go see it. The cast was also part of this decision, being Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro among my favorite actors. When it comes to the story however, one may think that Americans are desperately seeking for a moral recovery, for the restoration of lost values, for love, for a message of peace (the American one though, like the Pax Romana in ancient times) to the world. It seems they want to present themselves to the eyes of the world in a way which is so in contrast'to the reality which we see every day in the news. The story has nothing to say which has not yet been told. There are parts which add nothing and are more ridiculous than funny (like the brothers which become spirits after been killed and act as fans and spectators to the events). And what kind of witch is Michelle, if she is not able to solve her tasks on her own? Seems the production has no clear concept."
"rjm-geo","6","1","7","5 October 2014"," Too uneven in tone and style to be memorable.
","The elephant in the room is The Princess Bride, to which Stardust compares poorly. There are many ways to make a fairytale-romance movie, and rats of unusual size need not feature, but Stardust gets it so inexcusably wrong on so many levels that you can't help coming back to ""Princess Bride"" to show how its done.<br/><br/>Which is a shame, because there a lot of good elements here, some great cinematography, and some first-class special effects / set design. One of the few instances I can think of where the witches' magic spells actually feel dangerous. The casting is solid, and the acting is nothing if at least good-natured.<br/><br/>So what went wrong?<br/><br/>With a fairly tale, the cardinal sin is winking to the audience letting them know the characters know its all a big joke. The characters have to take themselves and the story - the risks, the danger, and the emotional investments - seriously. The silly stuff (i.e. rats of unusual size) can be silly, but only to the audience. The characters must behave as if those rats are really dangerous. That's part of the fun.<br/><br/>Stardust strives for a similar mix of humor and emotional weight, but 1. there's very little actual wit, just sight gags and slapstick and 2. no one seems to take anything seriously. Certainly not Robert De Niro or Michelle Pfeiffer. They are clearly having way too much fun chewing scenery to care about what happens Yvaine and Tristan.<br/><br/>That's problem one. Problem two is the story. The concept is basically fine, I'll accept the basic premise that there's this magical world you can get to from just outside an English village, a world with evil witches and unicorns and where stars fall to earth as young women. If that's the conceit, fine, let's run with that. And I'll accept that there's a king who has seven sons all out to kill each other over the inheritance. And, sure, lets add in a flying pirate ship that collects lightning. No wait. A flying pirate ship, which isn't actually doing anything piratical, since, I mean, they are just out there harvesting lightning for some reason. I mean, wouldn't they be more like fishermen? And why would people want to buy the lightning? What can you do with it? And why do we never see any other kind of flying ship? Why is everyone else traveling by road, by horse, even the king's sons? I mean if lightning harvesters can have flying ships, you'd think the king would have access to cool flying dreadnoughts or something. <br/><br/>And while we are at it, what's up this enormous kings palace, at the center of a city which looks to hold hundreds of thousands of people? Why is it we never meet anyone from there, outside of the kinds son's and one or two attendants? Until the last scene that is, when suddenly there's a football stadium filled with people! And if there's this clearly large, prosperous, and powerful city - what is their relationship with the witches? They would seem to be a nuisance, why wasn't there a war or something to get rid of them. What do the people do all day? And if there are unicorns, are there dragons? Why not? And what happened to that unicorn anyway?<br/><br/>The movie does a very poor job of convincing you the world it wants you to believe in actually exists. It's like no one thought it through, even superficially.<br/><br/>All nicely rendered/shot, mind you, just totally unconvincing as a unified, functioning world.<br/><br/>Finally, the last complaint, which concerns the traditional flow of a fairytale. Yes, we know roughly how things are going to end. But a fairytale is about the journey where the hero proves to us he is deserving of getting the girl, the gold, and of living happily ever by being both smart and good. The point is there are challenges, puzzles, riddles, and often actual suffering, which by overcoming the hero both learns some important lessons and proves his worth.<br/><br/>In Stardust, Tristan never proves his intelligence, resourcefulness, or moral fortitude in the face of need. He's given two incredibly powerful magic items by his mother. He's taught how to fight by Captain Shakespeare - for no especial reason, there was nothing he did to deserve the special treatment. And Yvaine stepped in to save him in the final battle with the witches. Basically anyone could have taken his place and done just as well, it was a cakewalk.<br/><br/>I think that's the most irritating thing with this movie. For all the great special effects, and cool cinematography, and can-can dancing, the vital elements which make a fairytale work as a fairytale got left out."

But STARDUST adds a good dose of tongue-in-cheek humor, plus a bit of romance. It has several plots and sub-plots, keeping the viewer interested, and making it impossible for me to figure out in advance where it would all lead. The film handles violence in a tasteful way, and does not get too caught up in special-effects. While STARDUST contains the usual trappings of any fantasy film, for me it was a lot more fun to watch.

","This film suffers from trying too hard. Unfortionately it falls short of any real enjoyment for its audience. Fantasy films don't need plot, story or any character development (not that this film had much of these elements) they just have to be fun. Fun for the kids and fun for the parents who are dragged along. I'm not sure who, is meant to enjoy this film. Rupert Everett, Dexter Fletcher,David Williamson, Peter O'Toole should have been given much more, Michelle Pfeiffer and Robert De Niro should not have been in it!!!!! (There is nothing more pretentious than most British film makers, which is why this film needed an American director) The Farrelly Bros, Kevin Smith, Harold Ramis, Frank Oz, John Landis, Rob Reiner or even Coens!!! The Americans, are the big stars needed to get this film made but there are plenty of other big American stars who would have been far more suitable for this material (And funnier)<br/><br/>At the very least where was Martin Clunes and Neil Morrissey, Matt Lucas and French and Saunders or even David Cross. Ray Winston was born to play Shakespeare, Kevin Kline could have been his boy friend. Where was Cher? Or the wacky guys like Bob Goldthwait Steven Wright or Lee Evens? Stardust doesn't take ""any"" risks. This film is sterile, with no atmosphere, and above all no fun!!!! Its has a kind of; ""I hope we brake even and don't offend anyone"", mentality. Some producers think that this is their job!!! Not making films, cos making films is for weirdos!!! The dialogue in this film is slow, boring and just not funny. Good films are not made by accident. Great actors like Claire Danes and De Niro can't just think up dialogue on the day of filming. It has to be planed, rehearsed and the rubbish has to be put to the side."
"BA_Harrison","3","1","17","25 October 2008"," The best thing about this film is its catchy theme song by Take That; what does that tell you?
","Clare Danes plays a falling star (although perhaps Robert De Niro, one of the film's other big names, would've been more convincing, given his recent track record) sought after by a love-struck young man (Charlie Cox), a trio of witches (led by Michelle Pfeiffer's evil Lamia), and a prince hoping to become an immortal king (Mark Strong).<br/><br/>With a rating of 8.0 on IMDb, a splendid array of dazzling special effects, and a brilliant cast featuring several Hollywood big hitters (plus the inexplicably rich and famous Ricky Gervaisa case of scriptwriter Jane Goldman's husband Jonathan Ross calling in a favour, perhaps?), I was expecting Stardust to be the perfect Saturday night family movie for me, the missus and the kids. Boy, was I wrong.<br/><br/>Adapted from a book by cult novelist Neil Gaiman (who wrote the equally disappointing and over-rated Mirrormask), Stardust is a bland, unsatisfying mess of mis-matched moments cobbled together from a plethora of stale fantasy ingredients: wizened witches, a magical kingdom, a hero unaware that he has already found his true love, a benevolent unicorn... etcetera, etcetera, etcetera. Occasionally, there can be found the odd spark of originality, but, more often than not, these moments are quickly extinguished by the film's endless tidal wave of terribly predictable tosh. <br/><br/>Another major problem I found with this film is that Layer Cake director Matthew Vaughn desperately wants it to be all things to everyone: an oh-so magical experience for the kids, but a more subversive ride for the adults (for a family film, there is way too much sex and death, and that's coming from a bloodthirsty pervert like me!!!). The end result fails on all levels: it's too meandering and meaningless for children; its mawkish sentimentality should have most adults gagging; and parents will probably be squirming in their seats for the duration, hoping that their children don't understand the more suggestive content or suffer nightmares from the violence.<br/><br/>Reading others' comments here on this website, I have noticed that many have likened Stardust to the brilliant The Princess Bride. There's only one thing I can say to that: 'Inconceivable'!"

","This movie had some really good elements, but sadly it wasted them with mostly awful characters, a horrible beginning and predictable storylines. So many things went wrong here in my opinion; Tristan is a horrible person (it would have been better if his quest was motivated by the want to save or free his mother), I don't buy the romance, the storylines are boring and predictable, and there are a lot of stupid moments.<br/><br/>I liked certain elements as stated, like the cloud roaming pirates in serach of lightning (unfortunately they ruined it by poking fun at the captain and making light of sex slavery). I liked some of the magical elements, like the magical chain, the dice etc. But there were so many times where stupidity completely took over. The ending was horrible and predictable, and I mean the fact that Tristan invited his ex crush to his coronation just once again displays his poor character.<br/><br/>The relationship between the star and Una was also completely out of the blue and could have been better established if Tristan's kidnapping was in order to save his mother. That would also make it easier to buy her forgiving him and ultimately ""falling"" for him.<br/><br/>Would not recommend this movie, they could have done so much better. If you're looking for something to watch, then go watch The OA instead."

This may be a weird criticism but I actually liked Victoria a little better than Yvaine. Maybe that's because she was a more relate-able realistic woman compared to the perfect princess type of character of Yvaine. I felt bad for her in the end. But it is a fairy tale after all so realism isn't quite what they were going for. The CGI was a little over the top at times but it never got too distracting.

","The UK film industry is in a bad enough state without some producer coming up with this feeble idea about ""stars"". All he could muster was two worn-out old ladies: Claire Danes (who looked really plain in some shots) and Michelle Pfeiffer. It was impossible to understand whence Claire Danes's role came: the Moon? Anyway, lots of much bigger stars turned down the role, probably as soon as they read the vacuous, derivative, extremely thin, screenplay written by Jane Goldman. Just to assure himself that he would lose the studio about $50m, the producer Neil Gaiman hired Robert De Niro for a cameo role. Huge loss guaranteed by that choice. The characters rush about, although we the viewers have little idea of what's happening. Peter O'Toole, in what must have been his last role, spoke his lines clearly enough to set up the ridiculous plot, but we still did not understand.This is Neil Gaiman's revenge on Britain, I guess, since he's moved to the USA."

"Steve G-2","6","0","4","14 June 2014"," Fun, but with a big flaw
","People seem to need to compare this to The Princess Bride, and I'm not sure why; they have very little in common but being fantasies (this one much more so than TPB) with good production values and not relying too much on big excitement. That's about it. OK, if that's an obligatory comparison, here are the differences: Stardust has magic, and The Princess Bride has likable, enjoyable characters. Oh, and TPB has a tremendously witty script, which Stardust doesn't; just clever in parts. <br/><br/>To be fair, there are two or three distinctly likable characters in Stardust, but they aren't present for the greater part of the movie; and for me, that was a big issue. Most of the characters are well done, but they range from truly evil to wantonly vicious to somewhat immature and peevish. In the abstract, taken as story elements, they seem like great ideas, but you wouldn't actually want to spend time with them. <br/><br/>Watching this film as escapism is fine. It's almost suitable for young children, but not really: sexual references and violence are not graphic or gross, but the prevalence of selfishness, including random and thoughtless killing, although not bloody, would be disturbing. Clare Danes is fairly magnetic, although not lovable, and the premises and story line are nicely twisted. Mark Williams turns in a nicely quirky performance, as always, and the visuals are smooth and attractive. Robert De Niro is charming as well as whimsical, but oddly, he's the only one. There's something wrong with that."
"SnoopyStyle","6","0","4","29 December 2013"," Charlie Cox weak lead and too much time with villains
","There is a doorway to the fantasy kingdom of Stormhold from the English town of Wall village through a break in the town's wall. About 150 years ago, a young man walks through the break and encountered an imprisoned princess. Later, a baby is left at the wall for the young man. The baby would grow up to be Tristan Thorn (Charlie Cox). Tristan pines for reluctant Victoria (Sienna Miller), and goes to catch a fallen star in Stormhold as a gift to win the hand of Victoria. The star's name turns out to be Yvaine (Claire Danes). Others are also looking for the star. Heirs to Stormhold need to find a ruby with Yvaine to get the throne. And a trio of witches led by Lamia (Michelle Pfeiffer) want the star to make them young.<br/><br/>There are a lot of characters and a lot of story to get through at the start. It's too much. It's too complicated before Tristan ever starts his journey. Simplification is the name of the game. There are just too many characters. And the story really should only follow Tristan and Yvaine around. Instead there are too much time spent on the other characters. We keep switching back to the bad guys' plot lines.<br/><br/>The other problem is that Charlie Cox is too weak to lead. He doesn't have the acting chops. With so many great actors around him, he just feels very small by comparison. And Claire Danes doing an English accent is very odd. Those two make a strange couple. And they keep trying to tell sly jokes. Maybe it works for the Brits, but it mostly fell flat. I'm sure it was a fun novel to read, but it just ran on as a movie."

","You'll find this hard to believe, but right next to England there is a walled-off kingdom called Erewhon or Shangri-La or something which, having sealed itself off from the world, remains in the Middle Ages. A young Englishman (Cox) is sent into this benighted place to retrieve a star that has fallen inside the walls. The star turns into Claire Danes, whose astral qualities reside in her emerald necklace. The three sinister sisters (Michelle Pfeiffer in various stages of old-age make up) who have magical powers. There are numerous subplots involving the heir to the throne, a desperate mother, a unicorn, and other characters. The story is accompanied by an epic orchestral score.<br/><br/>Something like that, anyway. The story is a lot of episodic whimsy with CGIs used judiciously for effect, for a change. There is comedy and there is an abundance of action.<br/><br/>Award for the best performance, not counting the lovestruck boy and the beautiful Danes, is Robert DeNiro as the mean pirate captain who is secretly gay. He claps his hands with glee. He outfits Cox with new clothes and squeals, ""Oh, that's tres YOU!"" He does Cox's hair. He's captured when his enemies find him in a corset, doing a fan dance in front of the mirror.<br/><br/>Michelle Pfeiffer hasn't been seen much lately, which is too bad because she looks fine. Claire Danes is attractive too, with large fleshy features. When she grins, even her teeth look enticingly big. Her bite would tingle nicely. She's a good actress too. To these alien ears, her British accent is reasonably convincing. Cox is boyishly appropriate to the role and if he doesn't shoot out the lights, well, he gets the job done.<br/><br/>It's not worth going on about. It's no masterpiece but it is diverting. I don't follow the Harry Potter stories or anything like them, never having got past ""The Wizard of Oz."" This movie just happened to come up on the channel I'd been watching and I was too lazy to turn it off while I did some reading. But I followed it all the way through."
"itamarscomix","9","0","1","27 December 2011"," A wonderful fairy tale
","I'm hard to please; usually, when a film based on one of my favorite book deviates this much from the source material, it simply won't allow me to enjoy the film. It happens all too often that a literary work with real originality and spark is marginalized on the big screen for the sole purpose of selling more tickets.<br/><br/>But for once, the result was so good that I just can't object. Stardust has little to do with Neil Gaiman's original novel, certainly; the changes make sense, though, and I think Gaiman saw that too. The novel was unique in its mixture of classic fairy tale with extreme sexuality and violence; Matthew Vaughn's film version tones down those elements, as well as the more disturbing horror elements, to make the film watchable for kids too. Normally I'd be dead against it, but Vaughn did a wonderful thing - while Stardust is kid-friendly, it's not a kids' movie. The sex and the violence aren't there on the surface, but the intelligence and the dark subtext of the original are still there. The film maintains a lot of Gaiman's spirit while being quite different, which amounts to that rare thing, a film that can be enjoyed by both children and adults on entirely different levels.<br/><br/>Let's not forget, quality fantasy cinema doesn't grow on trees. Lord of the Rings an Harry Potter aside, pickings are still slim enough that I'd welcome any fantasy film that respects the genre and makes for a good watch. Though Stardust isn't quite as quotable and memorable as The Princess Bride, it shares a lot of its qualities, and there's no bigger praise. Stardust may not be as deep, complex or genre-bending as the novel it's based on - it makes much safer choices - it's an incredibly entertaining film, skillfully balancing comedy, romance, suspense, action and lots of imagination, and it's a film anyone can enjoy - you can watch it with your kids, with your parents, with your friends, spouse or date. You can watch it more than once, and you'll get a kick every time."

","Basically this is a really charming fantasy tale, well acted and directed and with a handsome cast. What annoyed me were Robert De Niro's scenes. Actually a friend recommended this movie to me because there is a gay pirate in it, so I was really curious about this character, and I wonder, why does a family audience - which is I guess what this movie is intended for - need to get the same tired old gay stereotypes hammered into their brains? Of course De Niro's scenes were funny, and it was funny to see De Niro acting such a part, but still I think the writers wasted such splendid opportunity to create something off-beat and intelligent, because *of course* the gay pirate captain has to be queeny and likes to cross-dress. The writers should just have left it at the nice hints that something is going on between the captain and the Skinny Pirate. But what was the allusion at the end that something is going on between the captain and snotty Humphrey about? This was really bizarre. The writers obviously couldn't handle this topic."

However, I found this in Woolworths for £8 a few days back, and having no other plans to keep me occupied I decided to buy it and finally see what all the fuss was about.<br/><br/>The story follows Tristan (the result of a one night stand his father had with a imprisoned princess he met across the wall), who, in attempt to capture the heart of the girl he thinks he's in love with, promises to cross the wall to find a fallen star and bring it back to her before her birthday (time limit - 7 days). What he doesn't count on however was that the star would be a person, ad that darker forces were also after her and her necklace with far more sinister intentions.<br/><br/>He also didn't realise that he may just fall in love with her.<br/><br/>It's a classic fairy tale, witches, princes, heroes and heroines, but whether it's because I've been out of touch with fairy tales these past few years, or due to something special in regards to the film and the story, I really enjoyed watching Stardust, and became swept along with the story - I especially liked the idea of the falling star being a person, capable of falling in love.<br/><br/>The character of Tristan is incredibly lovable, and you find yourself rooting for him right from the start. Charlie Cox portrayed the character brilliantly, believably, allowing the viewers to connect with this unlikely (so therefore rather typical) hero. Although Clare Danes looked the part of a star, I failed to be impressed with her portrayal of Yvaine, and wondered whether they could have made her character even slightly more likable, and believable. But my favourite performance by far belongs to Michelle Pfieffer as Lamia. There's not much I can say really to capture how brilliantly Pfieffer portrays this character, but this is one of the classic cases were you really can't tell an actors playing a role at all, but believe the performance totally.<br/><br/>The film isn't really anything special or unique, its a classic story, it's fun, it's scary (for the kids), it's entertaining - yet, it really works, perhaps because it ticks all the boxes of a classic fairytale. Make no mistake, this isn't one to remain in people's lists of top 10 films for years to come, but I am glad to have finally watched Stardust and would recommend to everyone to at least give it a try. There's a certain charm this film possesses, and I found, that at least for a little while, I was transported back to being a kid again, swept away with the story, rooting for the hero to win, the villain to lose, and the guy to finally get the girl."

Unfortunately, this movie should not be mentioned in the same breath as the others. There are some bright spots, namely, Michelle Pfeiffer, who is perfectly over the top and who does a bang up job with her role.
