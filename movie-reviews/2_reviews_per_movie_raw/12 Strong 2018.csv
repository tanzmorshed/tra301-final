","When I see films like this, it really underlines the programmed ignorance of most Americans, and just how effective the government and the media are at shaping a false narrative. Al Qaeda was never an existential threat to America, and the Taliban was an internecine problem only to local Afghans and different Islamic sects. The conflict and motivation set up in this film is just ludicrous and phony. I am retired US Army, I still have contacts in the service who know the truth about Afghanistan. This film is a sham."

"jaffolicious","7","55","103","9 August 2018"," B for effort - read the book!!!
","The book and story upon which this Hollywood flock is based is awesome, and even important. The movie is a fairly standard Hollywood-version military exercise, and I can't fully fault the production team or actors because they have to tell a big story in 2 hours about a major event that should be well known to Americans and Afghans alike, let alone the rest of the world. Plus, no one behind the special effects or acting or script or direction were there. Much like Lone Survivor it's a pretty decent depiction of a true story for a film production, but also much like Lone Survivor, I wish it had taken the source material a tad more seriously, and attached much more telling and brutal realism (like Saving Private Ryan and The Hurt Locker) in terms of mood and dialog and acting, and even equipment and battle scenes. I don't want a Tears Of The Sun fairy tale with my war movies. I want something that transports us there. More realistic tactics, weapons that fire and report realistically, bombs that aren't full of fireballs all the time, etc... All could have been done here. But many would have lost interest in the drama... It's been dumbed down, and 90% of the audience will have no idea. <br/><br/>Maybe I demand too much, or am too picky, or just don't accept the ""average"" like ""average"" Americans who don't look any deeper at stuff like war other than action films and headlines. I feel like our veterans deserve better. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the negative reviews here are by folks who really have no idea what they're talking about, especially when they call it ""propaganda"". Politics produce propaganda. This is a story based on actual accounts...as in: it happened. Doesn't matter what your politics are. Read the book Horse Soldiers. Talk to more vets. Talk to some Afghani people who know a bit about their own country and the Taliban. <br/><br/>This movie could have been WAY better, but it was sinply ""good"" as what we've come to expect from Hollywood most of the time. I think it was wasted on misguided and detached production values and sensationalism that can only be provided by limited knowledge and devotion. Had Spielberg made this flick? Might have been an all-time great. And I say MIGHT, because it would be almost impossible to bring the reality and education to the screen that the book was able to portray and provide, and the reality on the ground these men experienced. Why we settle for pop culture education on important matters and historical events as our ONLY education is beyond me. But it seems the American audience wouldn't know the difference if REALITY ran over them in the form of a stampede of horses with a team of US special forces and Afghan militia on their backs. So I guess there's no real hard done, right?"
"AudioFileZ","7","137","276","5 April 2018"," Much Better Than The Negative Reviews
","12 Strong is based on truth and it would seem that in itself goes a long way as it took until a decade later for this story to become known through the book on which it was based. Quite simply it deserves the big screen treatment as it was a first victory in a war which goes on as I write this. The heroism is off the charts as everything changed the minute the 12 dropped in. Importantly the movie gets this point across. If it often seems like a lunatic's gamble as the small group of 12 immediately were split due the lack of trust by the Northern Alliance's war lord. Again the movie pulls no Hollywood bombast in depicting this. It seems like even our supposed allies are so distrustful the operation is doomed. As far as the battle scenes go there's that suspicion it may have received some of the Hollywood action movie push. I say don't over analyze this as it gets the point across of how desperate the situation really was and how focused, disciplined, and well trained our brave 12 were. The bottom line is this is a good homage based on real events and that always hovers large. If it could have been better depicted I'm certainly not sure exactly how as the victory was near impossible and that is captured on film quite realistically. I have nothing but praise for these fearless 12 warriors and I'm proud their story is now displayed for all of us who they put it over the line for. See the film and don't pick it apart, rather, be proud there is another great generation and just be glad we have soldiers like these 12."

","This is probably the worst war biopic I've ever seen, excluding thoroughly fictionalized ones such as Michael Bay's Pearl Harbor. In fact, I would hesitate to even call Bay's more recent war film, 13 Hours, a bad film as it at least had a compelling story and fully realized characters that I cared about in spite of it's many shortcomings.<br/><br/>This film is cheesier than the average 80's action flick. Every line of dialogue feels like it came off a script, and not a very clever one at that. It feels like there are dozens of lines in the film from every major character that are delivered with the desperate intention to become quotes.<br/><br/>The main character especially comes off as unreasonably brash. During the introduction, he immediately gives his superiors attitude following the September 11th attacks, and subsequently throws a tantrum, kicking over his desk to protest against his promotion, and immediately gets what he wants for being an impatient manchild, though the movie intended me to get the impression that this guy's valiant and brave. Despite no combat experience, he's confident that he and his team are coming back alive after kicking some terrorist asses, and they're gonna look dope doin' it.<br/><br/>At no point did I feel any tension. Unlike just about every other film of the genre, the soldiers aren't shown as having fear despite lazily uttered lines claiming they do. Characters charge into battle constantly, like birds with their chests puffed up, to such a blatant degree that it's surprising that they weren't going to subvert this trope and found it simply acceptable. There's hardly any struggle for victory in this film, as it feels the good guys are chasing the baddies down like dogs and bombarding them from a distance with air strikes over and over. It's like 300, except with modern weaponry, and less tact, and no style. The American soldiers feel invincible, and they pretty much are as they survive several close-proximity explosions while baddies are turned to red mist, hoist by their own petards. There's no attempt made to surprise viewers, and oddly enough it tries its best to be comfortable and digestible. Though it can be argued that too many films nowadays are dark and gritty, there's a place for that tone, and war films are definitely the place to stick to that. The best war films are the ones that tend to delve deep into the horrors of war, but this film would rather be a positive idea rather than a though-provoking experience. It is easy to evoke strong sympathy for characters of a war film, especially when they're based on true events, but this film misses the mark entirely.<br/><br/>The story isn't all that interesting to begin with. There's good intentions here, which are likely more apparent in the novel they skimmed through in making this adaptation, but ultimately it comes off as the less interesting spin-off in the events surrounding 9/11 and the war in the Middle East. United 93 has an incredible narrative, and it manages to make the most of its incredibly compelling story of real-world heroism while remaining respectful and realistic. 13 Hours, while very flawed, tells the politically controversial story of the Benghazi attacks on the 11th anniversary of 9/11. Zero Dark Thirty tells the story of assassinating Osama Bin Laden and is critically acclaimed. This film feels kind of like Pearl Harbor if that movie skipped the part where Pearl Harbor was attacked and instead focused on Hiroshima.<br/><br/>The editing is sloppy at best. There are many instances of blood squibs that look very digital which cheapen the movie and make it look like a video game at parts. Numerous smoke, fire, and explosion effects also looked quite fake, and resolutions of objects seemed inconsistent. Sometimes objects and backgrounds looked blown up and low-detail or even skewed vertically in contrast to the foreground characters, leading me to believe they must have been chroma-keyed in, poorly. There are annoyingly useless and repetitive clips, such as the needless cuts to the Jafar-esque villain of the film giving menacing stares at our heroes, which add nothing to the plot or characters and just act as padding in an already paper-thin story for an extremely bloated movie.<br/><br/>Also, this may be an error on my theater's part, but the audio was out of sync. Characters' lips were moving about a quarter of a second behind the actual audio, though it wouldn't be unlikely that something went wrong beyond the filmmaking itself, so I won't hold this against the film as of yet.<br/><br/>The humor was cringeworthy at best. There's jokes and gags tossed in here and there which are thankfully not too frequent, but while they're intended for levity they come off as immature and inappropriate, especially given this movie's not depressing and thus doesn't require any levity. One character says he's hungry despite there being no word of this and nothing to hint to anyone in the crew being famished at this point, and he ends up buying a sheep off a local for $300, just to execute a punchline that this guy should be working for military commission, and instead of getting a scene with the crew eating a sheep and allowing for character interaction we skip to more boring military discussion followed by one of the longest action sequences I've ever seen in a movie.<br/><br/>This movie lacks any passion and is simply a paint-by-numbers war flick with no more intention than cashing in on the lowest common denominators, and it will impress none other than the least demanding moviegoers."

","Greetings again from the darkness. During the movie, Afghanistan is referred to as ""the graveyard of many empires"". Traditionally, January is the graveyard of most new movie releases, so it's a pleasant surprise when we see an entertaining, well-made and historically interesting film, and it's still mid-January! Doug Stanton's book ""Horse Soldiers"" is the source material for director Nicolai Fuglsig's first feature film, and it's anything but a disappointment.<br/><br/>The film opens on September 11, 2001 and subjects us, yet again, to those horrific images seared into the minds of anyone alive on that day. What most of us didn't know, was that about a month later, a team of U.S. Army Special Forces (the Green Berets) were being dropped into the rough and mostly unfriendly terrain of Afghanistan. This ridiculously courageous team of 12 men had one mission: secure Mazar-i-Sharif to prevent a takeover by the Taliban. <br/><br/>An early scene tells us this won't be the usual blind patriotism we often see on screen. One of the soldiers, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), is told (with a bit of anger) by his wife, ""I'll love you when you get back."" This contrasts to the usual loyal and stiff-upper-lip military wife we see in most war movies. Another wife scrubs the oven rather than snuggle with her man, while yet another coerces a taboo pledge to come home to her.<br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth (THOR) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, the intelligent but not-yet-battle-tested leader of a special ops team. The plan is for Nelson and his team to connect with General Dostum, an Afghan War Lord in charge of the Northern Alliance, and fight together to gain control of Mazar. After arriving at a local outpost nicknamed ""The Alamo"" (34 miles from town), the team gets their first surprise ... they must split up and cover the ground on horseback. Filmed in New Mexico, the journey is miserable and filled with danger - an ambush could occur at any moment, or perhaps they are being set-up by those they have been ordered to trust.<br/><br/>Horseback riding, caves, the weather, and the elements of the terrain are all challenges, but none of it compares to facing the Taliban forces which number in the thousands, and feature tanks, rocket launchers and an endless supply of weaponry. Director Fuglsig utilizes a ""Days in Country"" counter so that we can get some semblance of time and ongoing misery being fought through by the Americans. But no day is normal when the soldiers are on horseback while being attacked by tanks. The odds seem insurmountable.<br/><br/>One of the more fascinating aspects of the story and welcome approaches of the film is back-and-forth between Captain Nelson and General Dostum. Initially, Dostum shows little respect by telling the young officer that he lacks ""the eyes of a killer"" and isn't yet a warrior, and he spends a great deal of time lecturing and philosophizing on Nelson's behalf. Of course, the lessons may be frustrating in the moment, but aren't lost on Nelson as there is a huge payoff at the peak of the key battle.<br/><br/>The battle scenes come in all sizes - small skirmishes and massive, large scale assaults. Each is intense and dramatic and well-staged, though there are some moments where we shake our head in disbelief. At least we do until we remember that this is a true story, and despite that, it is truly unbelievable.
The supporting cast includes Michael Pena and his snappy punchlines, Trevante Rhodes (MOONLIGHT), William Fichtner with a shaved head, Elsa Pataky - Hemsworth's real life wife as his screen wife, Taylor Sheridan, Geoff Stults and Jack Kesy. Rob Riggle plays Colonel Max Bowers, who was Riggle's commanding officer when he served in the Marines. The previously mentioned Michael Shannon is a bit underutilized, but the film's best moments are those with Hemsworth and Navid Negahban (as General Dostum). You likely recognize Negahban as Abu Nazir from ""Homeland"". It's their exchanges that show how the line between allies and enemies is not always crystal clear - even if they are fighting for the same thing.<br/><br/>Writers Peter Craig (THE TOWN) and Ted Tally (Oscar winner for THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS) do a nice job of character development, and the camaraderie of the 12 men of ODA 595 seems authentic - despite some schmaltzy moments over their 23 days of Task Force Dagger. Early on, we are informed that the most important thing to take to war is ""a reason why"", and then towards the end, Dostum explains that the United States is in a no-win situation: we are cowards if we go, and enemies if we stay. It's chilling commentary on a war that has dragged on much too long ... despite the heroic efforts of the 12 horse soldiers."

","""Depth"":
 This film was incredibly satisfying to me. It definitely had me on the edge of my seat when I was watching it. I really hate seeing these reviews that are complaining about the movie's depth, and I can see why you would consider that one of the film's flaws...but giving it a 5/10 or less because of that one flaw...really? If you think that there are more flaws than that then I would understand...but there's more to a film than it's ""depth"", especially a film based on a true story. I honestly thought this movie was very meaningful and thoughtful of the people that actually fought after the 9/11 terrorist attacks. It seems that critics aren't thinking about that at all, they just care about this one flaw in the film. You know that people don't look into a film as much as they need to when they give a film a pretty low rating because they noticed one flaw, especially one that a lot of people wouldn't notice, and or care about. <br/><br/>My Thoughts On The Movie:
 This movie really showed me what the fights after the 9/11 terrorist attacks were like...and that's pretty much the movie's entire goal, is to educate it's viewers on what happened after 9/11. It was also a very heartwarming movie. Seeing all of the character's saying goodbye to their families was pretty sad to watch, but then you see characters like Mitch Nelson (played by Chris Hemsworth) smiling when they come back home seeing their families joyful reactions, you feel your heart sitting next to a fire (well...unless you care WAY too much about the films depth...). And that is what makes this a good ""War"" movie, that it's not just violence, it also explores the lives of the characters that are fighting in it. Seeing all of the main protagonists bond and joke with each other could also be really satisfying to people who don't like the ""overly-serious"" type films (I, however, am not one of those people). I just like how the writers put some humor into their script for this movie, and that's something you have to appreciate for films like this. If you're into these kinds of movies, I definitely suggest you watch it, and if you don't know, give it a watch, and if you're not, then you probably shouldn't watch it. Just focus on the movie's storyline and not on ENTIRELY on the depth, this movie has a lot of meaning to it and it's not aiming to become a perfect movie (not many films do), it just wants to educate it's viewers, which is what a lot of ""History"" films do, try to educate the viewer. I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Also, I was really satisfied about Michael Pena, Michael Shannon and Rob Riggle's roles in this flick."
"Ramascreen","8","120","246","17 January 2018"," Hardcore Battle Scenes
","12 STRONG has some of the most hardcore battle scenes in any war movie. It's soldiers carrying weapons while riding horses, that definitely makes this one unique. And if you're animal lovers, you are right to be concerned about the horses' safety, I'm sure the production went above and beyond to ensure that but to me what's more impressive is the fact that these guys actually storm into battle like that, with bullets flying everywhere, riding a horse isn't exactly taking a cover, it's very very vulnerable, you're out in the open, impressive stuff.<br/><br/>Starring Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Pena and Trevante Rhodes, directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, based on Doug Stanton's book, 12 STRONG is the true story of a U.S. Special forces team led by their new captain, Mitch Nelson, played by Chris Hemsworth, and after 9/11 they're sent to be the first troops into Afghanistan to retaliate. There they form alliance with a local general, played by Navid Negahban in order to fight their common enemy, the Taliban. The special forces team has to adapt to the terrain and some of the tactics there which means they have to use Afghani horses to go places. They're outnumbered and outgunned by a ruthless enemy who's driven by ideology. <br/><br/>Without sounding too shallow, to be honest with you, the biggest reason why I enjoy 12 STRONG is that it's essentially about good guys kicking bad guys' ass. The war in Afghanistan is one of the longest wars in our country's history with no end in sight, it's still going, it's still happening, so seeing it from today's perspective is quite depressing. But something like this, where the characters are charged up because of 9/11, they go in, guns blazing, sending hell to enemy's territory, they go in they get the job done, boom, it definitely satisfies those of us moviegoers who like watching bad guys getting what's coming to them. <br/><br/>And I'm glad that the movie is rated R and doesn't hold back, so what you get is a depiction that's not watered down. It's graphic, it's intense, it's brutal, it's in your face. And like I said earlier, the battle scenes are explosive and hardcore. You're really engaged the entire time. It's well staged, well choreographed and well-shot, with some excellent sound mix and sound editing work. There's a bit of drama they throw in there with the clash between how Chris Hemsworth's character does things versus how the local general Navid Negahban's character does things, so even though the bad guy is quite one dimensional, there's plenty to go around between those two commanding characters. The movie does a good job of emphasizing the reason why a group like the Taliban needs to be eliminated, it does a good job of pumping us up to keep rooting for the good guys to win. What a helluva film to honor those courageous horse soldiers. <br/><br/>-- Rama's Screen --"

","As a person who didn't know the background to the events of the 12 soldiers after 9/11 I really enjoyed the film. The story was typically set up with the film showing the soldiers family lives and the difficult situation of leaving to serve their country and it flowed on from there. I felt there wasn't the typical Hollywood style soldier being portrayed here, which was a good thing. The one aspect of the film that stood out for me were the battle scenes which were really well staged. One small criticism was the Taliban and their role in the movie, I wanted to see more of a backstory to show how brutal they actually are. The character development was pretty good and the dialogue wasn't that of a Tarantino or McDonagh film, there wasn't a lot the actors could delve into to show how good they are, especially Michael Shannon who I really enjoy seeing. All in all a pretty good way of spending 2 hours of your time."

","Finally a heroic war movie with lots of action that is an interesting true story and the viewer can root for the hero because they are on the right side of history. There have been a lot of war movies recently that are on the depressing side where everyone but one is killed, or it's an anti war movie where the futility of war and being on the wrong side for the wrong reasons, or they are up against overwhelming odds and put up a valiant fight but fail. 12 Strong isn't one of those being set in 2001 before things got all muddied in Iraq.. The story is simple and clearly explained and the mission is easy to understand. They are the first force to go after Al Qaeda and the Taliban in Afghanistan in 2001. As things progress the battles become more and more intense from planes dropping bombs then scary gun battles to tanks vs horses to a grand finale that is a true Western style horses and guns blazing all out battle. The cast is good - Chris Hemsworth doesn't overwhelm the screen so he is convincing enough. Michael Shannon plays a soldier quite well too. <br/><br/>There are a few slightly cheap things about the beginning and ending, it's not as slickly done as a Peter Berg movie. Nevertheless it's a good solid almost old fashioned in concept war movie that leaves you with a good feeling."
"keal","10","117","253","21 January 2018"," THIS is what going to the theaters is all about!
","I have never seen a war movie on the big screen. I never cared to. I enjoy fantasy, sci-fi, and arthouse stuff. I recently saw and enjoyed The Shape Of Water, The Phantom Thread, Jumanji, and Paddington 2. Not into war films. I went to the theater to see The Post and it was sold out. So, I picked 12 Strong at random, seeing Chris Hemsworth on the poster. Hey, it's Thor!. I never saw any trailers for this movie so I went in blind.<br/><br/>Based on a true story, 12 Strong gripped me from the beginning because it explained everything slow enough for people like me who aren't into warfare. You meet the characters, you know what they are about to get into, and because 9/11 happened in my lifetime, I was suddenly drawn into this movie, which depicts the first group of soldiers who attacked the Taliban.<br/><br/>You are told how long this team of soldiers have to accomplish their mission. They say they can do it in half the time. Once the mission starts, you get a constant count of the days that they are on the mission throughout the film. It's a nice timer that helps give you a feel of their progress. It's sometimes tense, and when it's not, you get a lot of development between characters that creates sympathy. It's always entertaining.<br/><br/>When the final scenes play out, it's very, very intense, with lots of terror, lots of anxiety-inducing moments, but all in all, an extremely satisfying conclusion. The bottom line is, this is based on a true story of a team of 12 soldiers whose story was classified until now. So only now are they getting praised for their heroic deeds. <br/><br/>This movie delivered a great, uplifting story of soldiers who were not given credit when they came home from duty. This is their due. I promise you, if you like action films like Jumanji, which I thought was awesome... this movie will NOT dissapoint, and it's based on a true story. I will DEFINITELY see this again in the theater. It just won't be the same experience at home. See it in the theater if you can!"

","Great movie. 6.8 out of 10? Shame. <br/><br/>The movie might/will be criticized by the classic anti-American, anti-West, anti-occupation, anti-war and many many other ideology followers. Though the movie has great story and great battle scenes these will be ignored by them. They will vote it down for their stupid reasons. They dont have the cumulative overall knowledge to understand the movie.<br/><br/>The movie goes on to show whole of battlefield. We are not focused on close shot to heroes who shoot somewhere to the opposite direction of the camera where we cant see (though these type of scenes exist too, its a level that its supposed to be). As viewers we exactly know what is going on there, we are whether directly told or we get to know it by the cinematography. We are informed of the battle tactics and formations. It will feel great for those among you who like to grasp everything down to its each iota. Not to mention the effects of rocket launches, it gives a chill down the spine.<br/><br/>It's very different from the rest of the movies about Afghanistan. Our American heroes/soldiers dont just go out there and save everyone and save the day. It dives down to understand the conflict and tries to get answers to questions such as ""why is there a civil war in Afghanistan, why people of Afghanistan arent doing anything against Taliban/Al-Qaeda, why do we support warlords, isnt Afghan a language, isnt Afghan an ethnicity"" etc.
The viewers are directly let known that there are many ethnicities and languages in Afghanistan. The leader of Northern Alliance is Abdulrashid Dostum and our team goes to meet him and fight alongside him and clear out as much territory as they can from the Taliban rule. We learn that Dostum is a public leader who is ethnically Uzbek and he speaks Uzbek, Dari, Pashto, Tajik and Russian, then we also figure out he speaks English well as well. We are even introduced to Uzbek language and way of life briefly. Then we understand that the actually the Uzbeks and other minorities suffered more under Taliban (including Dostum's own family) so the main ally US can find in Afghanistan immediately is the Turkic peoples such as Uzbeks and Turkmens. <br/><br/>I highly recommend you to watch this for the great battle scenes and tactics that were used during America's campaigns, better understanding to history and to realize the ethnic dynamics of the region to some degree."

The situations where they have to fight while riding the horsed they never rode before & the shots taken while riding the horse are the awesome ones . The brutal killings of women is a thing that is actually true and also that Taliban never allowed women to work so women in that country either begged or were dependent on their Husband, Brother, Father, & any women wandering without either one of them would be killed by Taliban OR STONED to death. This was also one reason the local Afghani people were so angry abut Taliban soldiers. The bottled up anger was released when Taliban started fleeing their respective cities, people started killing Taliban soldiers as brutally as they could. Unfortunately the fight is still ""ON"" in some countries."

"Grumphy","6","31","70","18 January 2018"," Perhaps just not quite strong enough
","12 Strong<br/><br/>Story was ordinary. Nothing you haven't seen thousand times before. Pretty straightforward from the beginning till the end, but it worked. Dialogue was mostly sharp and clever, with a few missteps here and there. As it was yet another ""based on a true story"" there were moments, quite a few, that felt way overly glorified. Artificial even. But perhaps that was a necessary evil to create more meaning for characters. Which, speaking about the devil, brings me to the compulsory over the top villain, because bad guys have to be maxed out on all aspects of vile behaviour. <br/><br/>Acting was solid for the most part. Great cast all around. Hemsworth pulls his weight and the team follows. At times even blindly, which is fine, because the enemy (because they're bad) shoot like stormtroopers. However, the next time I'd recommend taking more cover, and wearing a helmet couldn't hurt either. Perhaps they're too pretty and wanted to show it off?<br/><br/>Which brings me to visuals. Action was engaging and tense, nothing bad to say about that. Some key explosions felt a little flat though. Camerawork was enjoyable. Nothing too fancy and therefore unnecessary. No crazy ""shaky cam"" during the chaotic battle scenes, but a mandatory shell-shock sequence, which seemed a tad too familar.<br/><br/>The score and sound is decent. Both serving their purpose, but don't really go that extra mile. In a film such as this there probably isn't any need to. Unless one likes to challenge themselves to find out exactly how many guns are firing all at once during a scene or a take. If that's even possible. No memorable song to listen to when riding into a battle either. Well. It really wouldn't be much of a covert operation, crawling between the rocks, ""Valkyries"" blasting from the boom-box. <br/><br/>Same goes for directing. It's a job done well. All in all. And despite some minor gripes, the film is enjoyable for the most part. But I cannot help but feel like it fell a tad short. It seemed a bit too clean and cut out. What was coloured in was kept exactly within the lines. I guess that's that ""based on"" aspect. Life itself is much more colourful, it doesn't care about borders. It's ragged, jagged and jaunty. Quite like the truth. And there are many true sides to any true story."

"jdesando","Null","29","67","18 January 2018"," Thor wins, of course. But not the movie so much or The US in Afghanistan.
","Yes, Thor wins the battle but has lost the war ever since. Chris Hemsworth plays a stalwart, heroic Captain Mitch Nelson in the docudramaed engagement by Special Forces in Afghanistan after 9/11. On horseback, much less. The movie is called 12 Strong and 12 American soldiers did succeed in beating back an Al Qaeda warlord. Not one American soldier was lost.<br/><br/>This feat, through a pass that would be considered Thermopylae at any time, was successful because of the cooperation of Afghan warlord General Dostum (David Negahbon), a joint venture that surely must have set the model for our endless and fruitless attempts to bring justice to that rogue country. No country has achieved success in over 2000 years, a testimony to the difficult warfare well described in this film.<br/><br/>
Beyond the rocks and hills are no memorable lines (ironic because the writers penned superb Silence of the Lambs and The Town) and no twists of fate. 12 Strong just trudges forward to a mountain pass that promises death except for the dashing captain's Lawrence-like rush to save the day. <br/><br/>In other words, this is another B war movie with not even 1940's stirring wisecracks or satisfactory twists. I should note that hints of writing greatness occur when the captain and the warlord engage each other in philosophical repartee. Too little.<br/><br/>The obligatory goodbyes to family and children are there at the beginning and at the hellos in the conclusion. This formulaic stuff does not a great film make.<br/><br/>That's all folks except the waste of Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Hal Spencer. While Hemsworth can never seriously be wasted because of his heroic mien and film provenance, Shannon is too good an actor to be given such a lean role.<br/><br/>If you want to make some sense of the Byzantine world of Mud-eastern battle, then see 12 Strong. If you want solid filmmaking, re-see Saving Private Ryan."

","After the tragic events of 9/11, the US determines that the Taliban in Afghanistan is the source of many of the attacks on US citizens and assets. Their first step in confronting the Taliban is to send in Special Forces teams to link up with the Northern Alliance, the enemies of the Taliban, help them in their fight against Taliban, including through coordinating air support, and reduce the Taliban's territory. The first team ""in country"" is Operational Detachment Alpha 595, lead by Captain Mitch Nelson. The 12 of them face overwhelming odds. This is their story.<br/><br/>War movies generally fall into one of two buckets. First is the engaging, plot-and-character based, realistic, gritty type, e.g. Saving Private Ryan, Platoon. Second is the superficial, gung ho, all-action and nothing else type, e.g. this movie.<br/><br/>Quite weak, formulaic and lacking in substance. From the outset the clichés start to flow and they never let up. The attempts at engagement are so badly done - the trite family life scenes, the clumsy attempts to create some sense of camaraderie - that you already know the director isn't much good and this isn't going to go well. Anything that's not a battle scene is generally eye-rollingly bad.<br/><br/>The battle scenes, however, are quite well done and prevent this movie from being a total waste of time. A bit over-the-top at times but still interesting viewing.<br/><br/>Overall, give it a miss. This is not to detract from the bravery and achievements of the actual ODA 595, whose feats are worth capturing in a film. Just not this film. They deserve better."

","I saw ""12 Strong"", starring Chris Hemsworth-The Thor & Avengers movies, Vacation_2015; Michael Shannon-The Shape of Water, Jonah Hex; Michael Pena-CHIPS_2017, Vacation_2015 and Navid Negahban-American Assassin, American Sniper.
This is based on a true story. You probably have never heard about it because it has been classified for years. On 9-11-01, the World Trade Centers came crashing down in a terrorist attack and the next day, plans began on a top secret mission to be launched about a month later-in October-against the Taliban & Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, who were the perpetrators. Chris led the 12 man team of Special Forces soldiers on the first retaliation. Their bosses tell them it is a suicide mission and they don't think they can accomplish the job in less than 6-8 weeks. Even with Michael S & Michael P on the team, the 12 can not just take on the whole Taliban by themselves-no matter how good of soldiers they are-so they meet up with Navid, a local Warlord that hates the Taliban, and plans on leading them into battle. Their best means of transportation is by horses and some of the 12 have never even ridden a horse before-they get quick, on the job training. So, with all these issues in their path, it is pretty amazing that any of the 12 make it out alive-I won't spoil it for you here but you do find out how many by the end. It is an inspiring story. FYI: Chris' wife in the film is played by his real life wife, Elsa Pataky.
It's rated ""R"" for war violence and language and has a running time of 2 hours & 10 minutes.
I enjoyed it enough that I would buy it on Blu-Ray."

"kjproulx","7","11","25","8 February 2018"," A Solid Flick With A Great Cast
","Everyone knows that once the Twin Towers were attacked on September 11, 2001, soldiers went into battle and wars have been occurring ever since. That part is well-known by everyone around the world. These wars will soon be talked about in history classes if they aren't already, so it goes without question that films will be made about certain aspects of the war, due to the significant impact that it has left and continues to leave. The story that 12 Strong presents is something that has been classified until recently, so it should be quite the surprise to many. There are many aspects about this film that follow the standard war film formula, but as long as it's supported by a solid cast, great sequences, and solid direction, the premise itself should be enough to carry its audience, and I believe it does just that. Now playing in theatres, here's why I think 12 Strong deserves a watch, even if not immediately.<br/><br/>Following the first twelve men that stood up to make the first attacks after the collapse of the Twin Towers back in 2001, this movie explores the true story of courage and ambition that these men displayed for the world. As a film, it does feel slightly formulaic, due to the fact that it pretty much takes you from one location to another in a fairly simple way, but I can also see this being exactly what went down in reality, so I was able to forgive that flawed aspect pretty quickly. This is a film about intensity and the characters surrounding that intensity and for that, it succeeds with flying colors.<br/><br/>From Chris Hemsworth to Michael Pena, Michael Shannon to a fair newcomer in Trevante Rhodes (whom I loved in 2016's Moonlight), this is a stacked film. I always appreciate when a movie delivers crazy amounts of action, while also finding the time to slow down and give each character their moments to shine. No, the character development here isn't anything to write home about, but I have to admit that I was wrapped up in each of their stories. Simple moments of characters sitting by a fire and reminiscing gets to me if it's done well, and 12 Strong accomplishes these feats quite well.<br/><br/>This movie definitely isn't for the faint of heart in terms of gore or being turned off by too much action, because when this movie wishes to display its reign of terror on the people who have some sort of involvement in the terrorist attacks, 12 Strong does it in a very visceral manner. From showing executions to showing towns being bombed, I found this movie to be a fresh dose of reality to people who seem to forget about the horrors that go on around the world on a daily basis. As I said, there's nothing spectacular about this movie, but I think it's a little more important than people are making it out to be.<br/><br/>Although director Michael Bay hit a high point in his career with the film 13 Hours (at least in my opinion), I feel that 12 Strong is a film that shows real promise for director Nicolai Fuglsig. This is his first mainstream outing, and I have to call it as I see it and say that I believe this man knows how to portray action on-screen and I can't wait to see the progression of his career as a filmmaker. In terms of action, I would recommend keeping an eye on this name for the future. Overall, 12 Strong is a solid and important war flick when it comes to the core story and I believe everyone should check it out at some point, but I could also recommend quite a few better movies in the same genre. Impressive filmmaking, but just good as a whole."

","In short: ""12 Strong"" is based on the book ""Horse Soldiers"" by Doug Stanton. In the weeks following 9/11 an elite squad of soldiers from the Army's Fifth Special Forces Group were flown into Afghanistan and dropped behind enemy lines. Their mission: work with a local, CIA-paid warlord, Gen. Abdul Rashid Dostum, and his ""Northern Alliance forces"", defeat the Taliban, and secure the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif.<br/><br/>Whoopsy, no one told this group of ""12 Strong"" American badasses, led by Captain Mitch Nelson (Thor himself, Chris Hemsworth), that the fight will have to be done on horseback. Oh, and ""you have six-weeks to do it."" Says Thor: ""We'll do it in three.""<br/><br/>If you're expecting an action-packed two-hours, you'll be disappointed. When the action does eventually start, it moves quickly from location to location with carpet-bombing-B-52's doing most of the heavy-lifting. Sure, it's fun to watch American air-superiority blow the shit out of the Taliban, but I paid to see Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Peña and Trevante Rhodes (Moonlight) gallop and shoot their way to glory. But, this is a true story and the truth can be anti climactic sometimes.<br/><br/>Two things you'll LIKE about ""12 Strong"": 1) Although the action scenes are short, they are awesomely intense and loud. 2) This is a guy movie. There isn't much in the way of romance, only bromance (if you're female, well, there is Chris Hemsworth but you may as well stay at home with the book version and a bottle of Chardonnay).<br/><br/>Two things you'll DISLIKE: 1) There's a lot of reading to do. It seems like every five-minutes the team is going from Taliban stronghold to stronghold and apparently we need to know exactly who is who and where they are, in white bold, CAPS-LOCKED titles on the screen. 2) There's no emotion, and very little chemistry between the characters."

"regula1","6","17","45","19 January 2018"," An adequate interpretation of events, but lacks depth
","The story of the Horse Soldiers, a group of twelve Special Forces soldiers who were sent into Afghanistan in the weeks following the 9/11 attacks to lay the groundwork for the Taliban's downfall, forced to ride horses against tanks and rockets, is an extraordinary tale of heroism against inconceivable odds and a proud moment in the history of our armed forces.<br/><br/>While this film tries, and mostly succeeds in retelling these events, there's just something off in the way the whole thing is packaged.<br/><br/>First off, there's the characters, mainly the three big names: Chris Hemsworth as Captain Mitch Nelson, Michael Shannon as Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spenser, and Michael Peña as Sergeant First Class Sam Diller. Their motivations and development is done only to the bare minimum, with Hemsworth being the only one with a true character arc. Of the other nine soldiers in the team, only three or four actually get their names spoken more than a couple of times throughout the film. <br/><br/>The main supporting character is Navid Negahban as Afghan General Dostum, who provides most of the character drive for Hemsworth's Nelson to change. He has a couple of powerful moments, but he is sopposed to be portraying one of three Afghan commanders who are fighting the Taliban, but also would fight each other if the chance arose. This conflict is only brought up in passing, though it is built up multiple times.<br/><br/>Then there's the main reason the story of the Horse Soldiers is so extraordinary: the fact that these twelve soldiers and a few hundred Afghan tribal warriors had to face fifty thousand Taliban and al-Qaeda fighters, facing off tanks and artillery on horseback.<br/><br/>The battle scenes are well shot, with only a handful of scenes with excessive cuts. The final horse charge is especially well done and feels earned. However, they don't seem to convey these overwhelming odds as well as they could. <br/><br/>With all of this being said, this film leaves me with the same feeling that World Trade Center (2006) did. Both of these films portray events and people under extraordinary circumstances accurately, more or less, but it just feels like those involved in both films were just going through the motions, trying to replicate feelings around events that may never be able to be truly replicated.<br/><br/>All in all, 12 Strong is a thoroughly average depiction of extraordinary events, not bad but not great. You're probably better off reading the book on which this film is based."

"ThomasDrufke","6","17","46","20 January 2018"," Incredible Story, Forgettable Film
","It's always amazing to me when I see another non-fiction war story that I was previously unaware of. It makes me wonder how many incredible stories we never hear about because there wasn't a book or a screenplay. 12 Strong, about the 12 Soldiers first to enter Afghanistan after 9/11, is yet another impressive true tale even if it doesn't quite reach the heights of it's real life counterparts.
The most gratifying aspect to 12 Strong is the interesting bond and relationship between Chris Hemsworth's Captain Nelson and Navid Negahban's General Dostum. The two have such different viewpoints on the conflict in Afghanistan and without much context a few weeks after 9/11, the moral dilemmas the two face are clearly the staple of the film. Even with a mediocre script and direction, there's enough back and forth between the two to keep my attention.
In terms of the actual war aspect to 12 Strong, it's a less than subpar affair. In a day when battles may certainly be more difficult to differentiate between sides, it seems 12 Strong accidentally played into that. While the dialogue indicates clearly to me who is ""in the right"", the shootouts in the desert and mountains are sporadically shot and chaotically structured. It really makes it difficult to tell what is happening where and who is getting shot or bombed. Perhaps that's exactly what the director intended because it could be closer to how the war actually is, but it doesn't play as well on film.
Overall, small character moments are what makes 12 Strong worth it, but it ultimately is a forgettable war film with a real life story that is better than what was put to screen.

Yes, horses. <br/><br/>Yes, most of the movie is about a Green Beret Team of 12 that needs to capture this town and that town in Afghanistan to get to the objective Mazar-i-Sharif (Taliban Stronghold) which would put a serious crimp in Taliban operations. So we will see a lot of war fighting with CGI, of course, and these scenes are absolutely brilliant. Yes, we must keep in mind that this is not just a movie, but what we see on the screen had actually happened, maybe not in the exact same way, but happened nevertheless. We are looking at true heroes as we would have seen in those other war movies I chose not to watch. Because of the success of Seal Team 6, we will be inundated with these war movies for some time. <br/><br/>The area of contention in here, besides all the fighting is the small war between Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), the leader of the Green Berets and General Dostum (Navid Negahban), the leader of the Afghanistan Army (actually a tribal War Lord). They go at each other mostly because the General won't tell Captain Nelson all he needs to know. That spilling of info was a long time in coming, but it finally did. Then later they differed on strategy. Hey, can't have everything to run smoothly and this is a serious war, don't you know?<br/><br/>The acting all around was excellent and very convincing . The cinematography and overall photography was stunning. <br/><br/>Yes, they used horses to knock out the big missile battery and now there is statue of a Green Beret on a horse near the site where the Twin Towers used to be. Why? The 12 Green Berets that went on that mission were bound not to talk about it because it was a very classified mission. Also, this was the First foray into Afghanistan after the 911 attack. Now you know. <br/><br/>Notables: William Fichtner as Col Mulholland who sent Captain Nelson on that mission even though Capt Nelson had never been in combat; Rob Riggle (Yes, that ""comedian"" on NFL Today) as LTC Bowers, Capt Nelson's Commander; Michael Pena as Sam Diller a key member of the Team; and Michael Shannon as Warrant Officer Hal Spenser, 2nd in command to Capt Nelson.<br/><br/>Even though you know most things that happened, this is still worthwhile movie to see.

","I guess now that it has been something like fifteen years after the event I'm not surprised that we are now seeing movies appearing about some of the battles that were fought during the early days of the war on terror (probably because they have been declasified). Well, there have been a few movies previously, but most of them have involved Iraq, and weren't your traditional war movies. However, this one is, and one of the things that struck me was that it sort of reminded me of the raft of World War II movies that had been filling our screens for the last fifty odd years (as well as the occasional World War I movie).
 The story goes that shortly after September 11th, the army was mobilised and some special forces operatives were sent into Afghanistan. The idea was to link up with the Northern Alliance, a loose collection of tribes that were joined together to fight a common enemy - the Taliban. However, the catch was that when they were dropped into Afghanistan the only form of transport that was available to them were horses. Well, not quite, it was just that the rebel leader that they were working with preferred horses to vehicles, and in a way I'm not at all surprised - while the traditional cavalry unit has changed over the years to now refer to mechanised infantry (and the last cavalry unit to use horses was in the 1940s), the good old horse still works quite well in that they are more agile, and can get to places that vehicles, and even tanks, can't.
 One of the things that permeates through this film is how Afghanistan is the graveyard of empires, and many nations over the centuries have attempted, without success, to conquer the region. While they mention Alexander the Great as being one of the many who tried, and failed, to conquer Afghanistan, that isn't quite correct - he was successful, it was just that his empire didn't survive his death. Afghanis who I have spoken to (I used to work with one) actually said that he is treated as a legend, and a hero, among some of the tribes.
 I guess that is the problem, and fifteen years since the events in the movie, Afghanistan still hasn't changed, and the Americans have been slowly winding down operations there. However, it could have been successful, if they had not used September 11 as a justification for an unprovoked attacked against Iraq.
 It is interesting to see how they used airstrikes in the campaign, but then again it was suggested that while the Americans may have ruled the skies, it was the warlords who ruled the land. Yet, the attacks against America did tilt the scales of the conflict for a while since the rebels now had air support which gave them an edge over their enemies. However, as history has told us, the Taliban eventually changed tactics, and while the Americans didn't take long to reach Kabul, what eventually happened was that they disappeared into the population and soon they had an insurgent war on their hands."

","As usual after I've seen a movie I check it out on IMDb. I was a little surprised to see the average review sitting at 6.6 so I started reading the reviews. The reviews are largely polarized with just a few in the middle. When you look at reviews under 5, and particularly the 1's and 2's, it's obvious that these lower reviews are, to a large extent, politically based. They tend to focus on negative portrayal of Afghans I didn't see that), overly positive portrayal of the special operators and cast doubts on the reliability of the plot. In other words, this movie, based on actual events, doesn't match the reviewers world view and therefore it must be a bad movie.<br/><br/>Don't be taken it by this. It's actually a well done war movie that does a pretty good job of portraying the down in the dirt reality of war. The acting is straight forward and the characters are pretty true to life based on military folks that I know. I really recommend it. Now let's see if this review actually gets published ..."

","'12 Strong' was an insightful look into the lives of 12 soldiers who were deployed to Afghanistan following the horrific 9/11 terrorist attack. They were a small group sent on a seemingly impossible mission but selflessly ignored the odds for their country. After watching this film, I have an even greater respect and admiration for our military and the sacrifices they make to secure the freedom and safety of this great nation. The actors did a phenomenal job portraying the real-life men who embarked on this mission, particularly Chris Hemsworth (I call him Captain Ameri-Thor, because in this film he plays a captain in the U.S. Army, and he also plays Thor). The action scenes were very intense, although they were a little confusing to watch at times because I couldn't always tell who were the good guys and who were the bad guys. Otherwise, it felt like I was right there on the battlefield with them. It's also worth noting that the scenes where the soldiers were on horseback were very cool to watch. It's amazing that the horses never tried to run away from the danger, but kept running towards it. I think those horses deserve extra carrots! In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this film if you want to see what real-life heroes look like and the lengths they'll go for our country. To all of our military, past and present, at home and abroad... ""Thank You""."

"skipknight","8","5","11","18 May 2018"," Negative reviewers, do they understand what Green Berets actually do?
","This was the 1st battle in Afghanistan after 9/11. Green Berets imbed with local militia to help them fight the enemy. That is what they did in Viet Nam. They are not a Infantry Battalion with massive numbers that fights on its own. At the end of the movie one character points out that the won the battle but the war was not over.
The Green Berets were able to call in air strikes against the Taliban to take out large numbers of the enemy. They were able to supply the ""Northern Coalition"" with much needed supplies through air drops. They caught the Taliban by surprise. 
The movie noted that there were at least three Northern Forces that would just as soon fight each other as fight the Taliban. That was not a factor during this operation but did become one later. The area is very Tribal, and trying to get the various tribes to work together is extremely difficult.
In one battle scene the Afghan general waits until he can confirm his nephew has left the village. The Green Berets are told that people frequently switch sides there, which is another problem they face.
The United States is partly responsible for the Taliban. When Russia invaded Afghanistan they were fighting with WW1 weapons. We, the CIA, supplied them with modern weapons, AK47s and RPGs, and taught them how to use them against Russian helicopters. We even supplied then with shoulder launched surface to air missiles to shoot down Soviet planes and jets. 
The Afghan General tells the Captain if he leaves he is a coward but if he stays he will become the enemy. Once again the US is in a country where we do not fully understand the culture, the politics, the people. We expect they will just immediately convert to OUR way of doing things. Our country is 300 years old. Their country is over 2000 years old.
The 12 man Green Beret team was able to get in, work with one of the local militias to strike a quick, damaging blow to the Taliban. It was a knock down blow, not a knock out. The Taliban was able to regroup. 
The movie did a great job telling the story of how these SF soldiers were quick to respond after 9/11, work with a group of people who did not trust them and who could have killed them at any time, in some of the most brutal terrain in the world, and carried out a mission in just over 3 weeks that some thought would take 2 years."
"chrisjhembury","4","5","11","31 January 2018"," 12 Strong **
","The true life story of how after 9/11 the U.S government sent a group of 12 special forces members on a mission to take a Taliban hot spot within 3 weeks. <br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth (Thor) leads the charge with a excellent supporting cast with Micheal Shannon (The Shape of Water),Micheal Pena (End Of Watch) and Navid Negahban (Homeland). 
 
The story itself is captivating but the mistake here is the telling the story as commercial as possible this could have a been a TV movie by the Producers Bruckhiemer's company that tel the film as if it was one. This is a American story the error is Americanising the telling of it in the usual fashion. If they could have told the story in a independent gritty way it could have been totally absorbing. 
 
Mel Gibson made big choices of how Hacksaw Ridge would have to play out in two halves and the second is full out absorbing horrific war. Spielberg made Saving Private Ryan visually 
 
12 Strong features almost TV coverage from the swirling aerials, pans and dolls shots by fails to have a distinctive independent style or vibe. 
 
The film's true life story is well worth telling and in the hands of someone like Joe Carnahan (Narc) for instance it could have really found it's tone.
 
By trying to look and feel like every other commercial film it loses chance to be truly original like it's source story. 
 
One sequence in particular where the soldiers charge the Taliban with missiles flying over their heads is a thrilling set piece. This shot POV or Normandy Beach style from Saving Private Ryan's opening could have been a masterpiece of a cinematic battle. 
 
A by the numbers style war film of a truly remarkable achievement. It's not a bad film by any means it just fails to be as remarkable as the achievement that was made in the story. If the filmmakers had been as fearless as the real life heroes who knows how daring this could have been. 
A nice touch is showing the statue dedicated to the soldiers at the 9/11 site, fitting tribute."
"3xHCCH","6","11","31","18 January 2018"," That Final Charge on Horseback Saved It All
","About a month after the NYC attacks of 9/11/2001, a 12-member US Army Green Berets code-named Operational Detachment Alpha 595 (ODA 595) were chosen to be sent on a covert mission to Afghanistan. As part of Task Force Dagger, they joined forces with General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban) of the Northern Alliance to reclaim key Taliban-held cities there.<br/><br/>The members of ODA 595 all had to ride horses because of the inhospitable terrain and distance they needed to cover. This was no problem for their charismatic leader Capt. Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), who grew up on a ranch, but this was his first time in actual combat. The other members, like Cal Spencer (Michael Shannon), Sam Diller (Michael Pena), Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes), Vern Michaels (Thad Luckinbill), etc, had to master their horse-riding skills overnight on top of their combat skills in order to keep up with their dangerously harrowing mission.<br/><br/>When they get to Afghanistan, it took some time for the war action to get going, as our heroes still needed to acquaint themselves with their unfamiliar allies. While the intense battle scenes took us in the middle of the gunfire and explosions, there was point when the action actually became repetitive as we would see the same strategy of attack (get coordinates of the camp, launch airstrike to decimate the enemy, engage the remained on the ground) for all the Taliban encampments, with just a little dramatic variation here and there for the sake of distinction.<br/><br/>The centerpiece battle scene however was only upon us by the final thirty minutes or so of the film. This was the grand charge of Nelson's ragtag troop ON HORSEBACK to attack the superior numbers and firepower of the Taliban troops. That was an elaborate but very well-executed battle sequence for which this film would be remembered for. It was certainly unique, exciting and exhilarating to watch, worth the whole price of admission in itself. <br/><br/>This was a good war film even if the 12 Americans all seemed to lead charmed lives despite the overwhelming odds stacked against them. On the other hand, the Taliban were all portrayed as cruel religious fanatics, as there were scenes commenting on their inhumane beliefs and practices particular about women. A strong all-American patriotic sentiment swelled at the end, fully expected in a true to life story of modern heroism as this. 6/10."

","Review:
This is one of those typical, heroic American war movies, were the Americans fight for pride and glory, for the good of there country. I liked the character building throughout the film, which gave the movie a meaning, and I liked the fact that you saw some of the soldiers at home with there families before they went into battle. The fact that it is based on a true story, also made the film enjoyable but it isn't anything that we haven't seen before. The movie is based around 9/11 when the terrorists attacked the World Trade Centre in 2001. While the attacks are happening in New York, Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) is moving into a new home with his family but he receives an assignment to staff duty under Lt. Col. Bowers (Rob Biggle). Mitch wants to gather his old unit to fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan but Bowers turns him down, even though his unit is fired up for the task. Veteran Soldier, Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) manages to convince Bowers for Mitch to command the 595 unit to go into battle, so he is briefed about the mission from 5th Special Forces Group Commander, Col. Mulholland (William Fichtner). After leaving their families, the unit head towards Uzbekistan to fight against the Taliban, alongside a Northern Alliance leader Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban). It takes some time for Abdul to trust Mitch and his team but once they work out there differences, they get on with the mission to capture Mazar-i Sharif, a critical city in Northern Afghanistan, from the Taliban. They also want to take down the Taliban leader Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), who rules local communities brutally under strict Sharia law and has murdered several of his own people, including Dostum's family. Before they leave for battle, Dostum tells Mitch that he only has 6 horses spare, which means that he has to leave 6 of his unit behind, under Spencer's command. Using American AirPower, and Dostum's knowledge of the Taliban methods, they manage to destroy many of the Taliban's compounds, on the way Mazar-i Sharif. Spencer and his team join the unit but he is badly damaged by a suicide bomber and is forced to make his way back to safety. With the use of heavy attacks from the Air Force, and the Northern Alliance, they manage to destroy the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, and Dostum comes face to face with his enemy, Mullah Razzan, who he doesn't hesitate to kill on the spot. It's extremely intense throughout, and the performances from the whole cast made the film seem real but the outcome wasn't surprising. When you see the real soldiers towards the end, I did feel quite emotional, especially after watching their amazing journey on horses and the fact that they were only the second unit to fight against the Taliban after the attacks, which means that they were going into the unknown. They were also fighting against the weather because it would have been impossible for them to fight against the enemy during winter, so time wasn't on their side. Anyway, I found the movie entertaining, mainly because of the performances but I have seen this type of movie many times before. It's still worth a watch, if you want to see Chris Hemsworth out of his Thor suit but don't expect an original masterpiece. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up:
This movie was directed by Nicolai Fuglsig. Who also brought you Exfil in 2017. As I haven't watched any projects before, I can't really compare his work but from a stand-alone point, he did a good job in terms of authenticity and reality. Being from Denmark, he took on a big task to take on an American, true war story but with Chris Hemsworth being very much in the public eye at the moment, he must have known that this movie was going to get a big audience. For his second film, it didn't do to bad at the box office, and I'm surprised that he was able to make a war movie with such a low budget. Anyway, it didn't do Michael Shannon, or Chris Hemworth's career any harm, mainly because he stayed true to the original story, and he made the American's look like true heroes, once again.<br/><br/>Budget: $35million
Worldwide Gross: $70.5million<br/><br/>Genre: Action, Drama, History
Cast: Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Michael Pena, Rob Riggle, William Fichtner, Navid Negahban, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, Austin Stowell and Elsa Pataky. 6/10"

This story should be a mini-series at least. There's a LOT going on in the month following 9/11 and squeezing into 2 hrs gives important events short shrift.

","'12 STRONG': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>A war film about CIA Paramilitary and U.S. Special Forces who were sent to Afghanistan, immediately after the September 11th attacks, to combat Taliban soldiers there. It's based on the non-fiction book 'Horse Soldiers' by Doug Stanton, and it was scripted by Ted Tally and Peter Craig. Sophomore feature filmmaker Nicolai Fuglsig directed the movie, which stars Chris Hemsworth, Michael Shannon, Navid Negahban, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, Geoff Stults, Thad Luckinbill, William Fichtner and Rob Riggle. It's received mixed reviews from critics, and it's expected to be a modest hit at the Box Office as well. I found it to be pretty dull and uninvolving. <br/><br/>The story begins with the September 11th terrorist attacks being witnessed on TV by Captain Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth), and his family. Mitch is eager to retaliate against those responsible, and he begs his superior officers for his Captain position back, in order to do so. Mitch, along with Chief Warrant Officer Cal Spencer (Shannon), Sergeant First Class Sam Diller (Pena), and other U.S. soldiers, are then sent to Afghanistan to attack the Taliban forces there. Once there, they partner with the leader of the alliance, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Negahban), and quickly start to plot their revenge. <br/><br/>The movie looks like a fun war action flick, and I like the premise to it, but for me the film is just way too boring. I couldn't even get into the action scenes (which I'll admit happens a lot for me with recent action flicks), but the whole story, and character development, is pretty weak and uninvolving. The performances are pretty dull and uninspired too, and it's definitely a talented cast. With the exception of Navid Negahban (he's a scene stealer in it), most of the actors seem to be just there for their paychecks. I could not wait for the movie to be over, for most of it's 2 hour and 10 minute running time, but I'll admit that I'm sure some action junkies, and war film fans, will probably enjoy it. Technically speaking, the movie isn't half bad."

Both films give us heroes to cheer for and plenty of intense action, while mining the backgrounds of the men involved - and their complex interpersonal relationships - for considerable emotional impact. ""12 Strong"" is thrilling, entertaining, heart-felt and serves as a great reminder of the courage and determination of the men and women who defend the homeland by fighting overseas. ""A-"""

"jake-young96","3","4","9","10 May 2018"," Walking between being two different kinds of war film, 12 Strong fails to succeed as neither.
","In the wake of 9/11, the United States military is rattled by the catastrophic event in a jingoistic war film following the ""based on true events"" story of 12 soldiers that made it their mission to work with an Afghan warlord to fight the Taliban on their home soil.<br/><br/>Despite the based on the declassified true events nature of the film, suggesting a more grounded and character-based story. 12 Strong finds itself trying to be two different types of war film. Director Nicolai Fuglsig seems to be unsure of the tone of the story he is telling, one-part brutal, harsh realities of war - another part that might as well have explosions in red, white and blue. The consequence of this takes its toll on the characters most of all, the film tries its best to implement character development as well as moments to produce audience empathy, a darker message about people in war or a connection but sadly that is never realized. Stooping into tried and overdone clichés, this is certainly the low point of the film. It takes away from this potential for a middle act that is purely explosions and Chris Hemsworth brooding, following into a final act of more explosions and forced empathetic situations that borderline on parody.<br/><br/>Even viewing 12 Strong on the flip side of being a patriotic fueled action flick still leaves much to be desired. The action is done well for the most part and is enjoyable to see something a bit different (being they fight on horseback in the desert). I found that in its build up or more reserved scenes the action was far tenser and brutal. Some commendation has to be given for the lack of shaky cam in hyperintensity scenes as well as not shying away from the gore, but again this is walking in between being two different kinds of war film. Where 12 Strong's action-fueled flashes lack, is the score or innovative new ideas to make the audience feel the intensity of the situation, there is no heroic fist in the air, worthy moments here.<br/><br/>So, when the dust has settled from the firefights, 12 Strong's real problem is exposed, its lazy writing and lack of ambition with its story. Familiar dialogue and lack of deeper character development squander the potential for this otherwise entertaining film that doesn't quite display any edge of your seat action but can be a decent time as long as you don't expect too much from it."

It felt like everyone was rewatching the attacks in 2018. People were literally speechless after this happened. They used to see the WTC in pictures of NYC's skyline, in movies, videogames, from the airport, then boom, it was all gone. People couldn't believe this happened in America. It only happened in other countries.<br/><br/>The attitude was that Afghanistan had to be taken and the Taliban and Al-Qaeda had to be dealt with. The goal was to get Bin Laden and correct the injustice the Taliban were inflicting onto their own people. The History Channel only broadcast shows about the Taliban every week, back when it was basically Pentagon propaganda and not a reality TV/bad history drama station.<br/><br/>There was basically no effort to let anyone know this was 2001. Anything from CRT monitors, cellphones to cultural oddities, hairstyles, was left out.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, like Black Hawk Down, the movie, I think this was basically another Pentagon sponsored movie focused on being Army recruiting and war promotion to the public than telling a truthful story. Nonfiction war novels are far more honest and gritty, unfortunately. Maybe I'll pick this book up, but this didn't pass the smell test."

From a historical perspective, the details of what actually happened back in 2001 colors the film w/the same kind of brush that films which dealt w/the Vietnam War like The Green Berets or more recently We Were Soldiers act as if the moral & ethical realities of that conflict didn't exist putting this film into a kind of 'ship in a bottle' state of existence. Good actors appear here like Michael Shannon & Michael Pena but they're not given much to do but shoot their weapons & look like warriors doing it. A much better film I felt was Lone Survivor (or 4 Strong) which told the same kind of story w/the appropriate level of gungho-ness & loss. A nice bit of stunt casting is of Hemsworth's wife played by Elsa Pataky, his wife in real life."

","I saw the movie after doing some research and reading the book. I first listened to the interview on FOX of a few of the men involved--in the movie making and in the incident, then I bought the book. The book is very detailed and goes into more detail of exactly how hard this was to do --of the helicopter pilots who couldn't see the mountains due to the dust (only briefly shown in the movie) and of the incredible dangerous trails they had to ride the horses on. The battle scenes while graphic in the movie, were described in more detail and were accurate. If people don't like the movie after watching it, all I can say is remember what General Sherman said, ""War is Hell."" These men were amazing and are depicted as such."
"ivko","7","3","6","18 May 2018"," incredible story
","This is the quasi-real story of the first days of the war in Afghanistan following 9/11, when a small team of special forces soldiers entered the country to support our new battle against the Taliban. I say quasi-real only because this is a Hollywood production, and there are almost inevitably changes made to amplify the drama and excitement no matter how exciting the real story was, but then again for all I know maybe it did go down exactly as depicted.<br/><br/>In any case, the movie depicts how the American soldiers went in with very little information or planning and only a vague goal that boils down to ""support this guy because he's fighting these other guys"", and found themselves in a world where people are living with roughly the technological sophistication we had here about 150 years ago.<br/><br/>It's not exact, of course, there are aspects of modern life here and there, but it's pretty stunning none the less. People live in structures without plumbing or electricity, travel on horseback, and communication is mostly done by face to face conversations or with walkies. In fact, the most common artifact of the modern world are the weapons.<br/><br/>Speaking of, seeing the contrast between the so-called first world and life in Afghanistan the thing that struck me was just how much effort humanity has put into efficient ways of killing each other. Looking at a world where you live in a hut and keep a herd of sheep for clothing and food, now filled with tanks, surface to air rockets, grenades, machine guns, and bomber planes, I couldn't help but think of the monumental effort it took to create all of that. The tons of raw materials mined and refined, collected from around the world and passed through sophisticated factories where it was pressed and molded and assembled, the chemistry bent towards creating reliable mass-produced explosives, the advanced rocketry used to create handheld weapons capable of firing explosives thousands of feet with accuracy.<br/><br/>It's kind of awe inspiring. Truly. It might actually be one of mankind's most impressive accomplishments. The ability to produce and transport such a bewildering array of lethal power, to bring it even here, about as far from anything resembling the modern world as it's possible to get, is pretty amazing.<br/><br/>We tend not to think of war as an ""amazing"" thing because the effects are so horrifying, but when I saw this I wondered how many other areas we can say we've developed with such single-minded purpose. The cell phone is often held out as one of the main marvels of the modern world, but even that technology owes most of its existence to the military, where the core technology was built for more effective battlefield communication, as were most of the technologies it utilizes like GPS and the Internet.<br/><br/>In any case, the movie is well made and paced, and it depicts a piece of the culture and history of a region many of us know very little about despite the fact that we've been engaged in a war there for years. I don't know if it was actually filmed in Afghanistan (my guess is probably not), but the cinematography is beautiful and seems authentic. Also, the stars are charismatic and engaging and the story is unique; it's worth a view."

","Ever since I first heard about this movie almost a year ago, I have had high expectations for this movie. After all it's a war movie with Chris Hemsworth based on a true story. How could it go wrong? Right? ... Wrong.<br/><br/>There are several things that war movies must have in order to be good and this movie failed in several categories. One facet of a war movie that absolutely must be present is realism. This is a category most war movies get right. This one did not. During the entire movie special forces troops blew away with their automatic weapons at Taliban bad guys and I only counted two times where a character reloaded. Now, I'm not going to complain if a movie like Fast and Furious is a little unrealistic with its reloading but in a movie like 12 Strong there needs to be frequent ammunition changes. Also, in the final battle Chris Hemsworth charges into the teeth of enemy tanks riding on horseback and somehow makes pin-point accuracy shots. The final battle scene felt very exaggerated and unrealistic. Now I realize that it is based on a ""true story"" but I guarantee that the movie touched up some things in an attempt to make a better movie. In a war movie, there needs to be a lot more gritty realism.<br/><br/>A second thing that bothered me about the movie was that the bad guy was honestly lame. They pretty much slapped in one scene to make sure you know that he is a ruthless killer. There needed to be more development present.<br/><br/>Finally, none of the action sequences were impressive or memorable and most of them centered around panning shots of B-52 bombing tanks which was pretty boring. I will never watch this again and I would not recommend it to anyone who is expecting a serious war movie."

","In 12 Strong you follow the journey of 12 US soldiers, mostly their captain named Mitch Nelson (Hemsworth). A man who has never been to war, however that doesn't stop him to go headstrong to the battlefield. His men follow him with no hesitation, and they are good at firing a couple of jokes at times, considering where they are and what they are doing. This makes the movie nicer, as you can see how humor help loosening the mood up a bit.
Nelson has to work together with the Afghan General Dostum (Negahban), who isn't very good at cooperating. However one thing is sure, Dostum wants to take down the Taliban and he needs the help of the US army, as he doesn't have enough firearms on his own.<br/><br/>The movie has a nice pace to it, as it starts out showing us the different soldiers, their reaction to the 9/11 attack, but also their wifes/families, who all have a different way to send off their men. When they get to Afghanistan it's Nelsons' job to convince his superiors that his team is ready to be sent out there. Luckily Nelson is an intelligent man who knows how to speak his mind and case.
Nelsons' first meeting with Dostum isn't the best, and because Nelson doesn't have those *Killer eyes*, as Dostum so nicely puts it, the trust takes a long time to build.
At the same that all of this is happening you get small glimpses of some of the things that the Taliban is doing, shown in the scenes with Razzan (Acar), someone who seems like the leader of one of the Taliban groups, and one with whom Dostum has a big grudge against.<br/><br/>12 Strong is one of Fuglsig first movies, and he has done a good job. The images are very beautiful at times, and the explosions are quite realistic. I really like the casting too - and not just because of Hemsworth, even though he does make up most of the film - and characters such as Diller (Peña) the comedic one, and Spencer (Shannon) Nelsons' right-hand man are very important to the building of the story and characters, but also to lighten the mood.<br/><br/>All in all I really liked this movie, and it's crazy to think that it's taking from a real story.

It isn't though - and as such comes across as a confused, rather gung-ho, interpretation of facts that don't really stand up to too much scrutiny if you have even the faintest soupçon of knowledge as to the political situation prevailing in war-torn Afghanistan at the start of the 21st Century.

The messages in this movie are charge up with the special effects of Hollywood, and with it a great presentation of the cultural dynamics in war. And of course, there is plenty of action to keep things intense and exciting, laden with all the war time theatrics that portray the American Hero we all love to see. 
 Sadly, 12 Strong suffers from too little editing and trying to get everything into one movie. Much of the length comes from trying to cover every detail of the war, including such small gimmicks as an air drop gone wrong. These moments are immersive, but add little to the movie that couldn't be read in a book. Any details of the soldiers' lives are rushed over, feeling incomplete and irrelevant to the story, a shame given that these components could have helped each member of the team stand out. Unfortunately, the cast of this movie look very similar, with only a few visual features to help them stand out from each other. Chris Hemsworth is the man who gets most of the attention, with the studio relying quite heavily on him in both character development and action fields. The other members got their pitches in, but they weren't as strong as the captain of the group. 
 While not the best war movie to grace the silver screen, it still has plenty of theater worthy qualities that make this worth a visit. It's an exciting, special effects spectacle complete with cultural prowess and band of brotherhood moments that you like to see in these movies. And while it paints the pictures of heroes, the movie needed some more fine tuning to really get all 12 heroes the portrayal they deserved. A little more development and a little less time at the opening may have further strengthened this movie, but ha good shot nonetheless."

","We were going to see The Post but I changed my mind when I read that the story of the Pentagon Papers was basically presented as the WaPo owner's dilemma and not a journalism thriller. Meh. So we saw this because I like a good war movie based on a true story, which this is. It didn't disappoint. Is it Saving Private Ryan level good? No. While the battle scenes are intense, it isn't as unsparing and conflicted as SPR. They have a mission and you cheer them on to fulfill it, end of. The acting is very good, even if it seems the director could have asked more of them. The humor could have been a bit darker, but it's still deftly handled and genuine. I love the actor who plays the Northern Alliance leader, and how he and Hemsworth's character evolve in their relationship. And the final battle scene is crazy!!! Horses and modern weaponry together? Yeah, it's wild. Again, it's not a brilliant war film, but it is a well-done, engaging movie with rousing action scenes and heroes you can root for. Worth seeing."

","Firstly for those saying Afghanistan is a failure, that is laughable. the point of the action in Afghanistan was to reduce state level support and host terrorist groups with large scale international reach capable of killing thousands of American civilians at a time. That has been 100% successful. Erecting nonsense, strawman goals like making Afghanistan some kind of fully stable modern democracy, or fully ending islamacism is not a serious arguing point, since this was never a goal.<br/><br/>Let's get to the film. If you know the book it has lots of license, and the film takes even more license: as do all war films. Is 12 strong as faithfully accurate on SO as Zero Dark Thirty? No. <br/><br/>As far as acting and character development, there are some problems. Interestingly the most talented actor, Michael Shannon does terribly here, really showing no resemblance to anything I have seen in the military, he can't even hold a firearm properly. But I see that as mostly a casting mistake.<br/><br/>Overall this is a very very well paced, well shot war film. It is not excessively jingoistic. That it celebrates some dramatic successes of the early SO operators, dropping into totally unknown territory, with little support, simply reflects the reality of the triumphs of our operators (although some credit should have been given to the spotters who also went in with the operators)."

","Exceptionalism is on display all the way through this film that depicts the amazing efforts of true life heroes, soldiers and yes WARRIORS. The battle scenes are intense as well as captivating. They illicit true fear and emotion. Hemsworth and the cast do a great job. My only quibble comes from how the story was told. It's very procedural in its delivery. I wanted to learn more about these men as people and wanted to feel the rage of the era. Meaning, I wanted to feel/remember how the country was angry over the cowardly attacks of 9/11 and how everyone was willing to sacrifice anything to combat the dastardly attack and to make those responsible pay. I can't say the movie does a good job in either of those efforts. More set up was in order and more development of depth was needed to do these remarkable men justice. Yet, it's great to see this actual story receiving attention and the heroes being portrayed as such."

","12 Strong shows you more of the raw aspects of war and you can't really compare this movie to Saving Private Ryan or similar war flicks. Here things are getting serious and there is no beautiful storyline that makes you feel for the personal lives of the soldiers. Sure, most of them have families, kids... people to go back home after the mission is finished, but these smaller details get brushed off in a very rushed way. All you, as the audience, have to care about are the soldiers fulfilling their duty to retaliate after 9/11 took place and kick some Taliban accross the field. To make it easier for us to relate to the characters we get Mr. Thor himself with Chris Hemsworth in the leading role, who does a great job on acting though. In this constant grind of war this movie slows down from time to time and tries to give some more depth to the other men of the 12 man strong team, but in many aspects this turns out very genereric and some of this fans of war movies have seen over and over again. The strength of 12 Strong lies simply in the raw intensity when all hell breaks loose and in these moments the movie scores big time. So if you only care for that you will love this movie. But if you want some more in depth character development and a rollercoaster of emotions, you might end up being slightly disappointed."

However, the narrative doesn't do anyone much favours, these bio-pics that are supposedly based on real events really do struggle with creating drama and intensity because the real events are often not that interesting. I am not doubting the significance and sacrifices of the real people behind this very real event but from an entertainment standpoint there really wasn't much source material to create a wholesome narrative.<br/><br/>Like many films of the same tagline this movie has that one punchline that the rest of the narrative has to surround, in this case '12 men' vs the taliban. It is an interesting story but not enough to be a feature length film, and it was a long movie over 2 hours.

","12 STRONG is another Middle Eastern war epic, following on from the likes of LONE SURVIVOR and 13 HOURS.

They join up with a local warlord to take part in some skirmishes in the mountains. This film's strength lies in the quality of the action sequences, which are briskly directed with a maximum of firepower and pyrotechnic effects.

As well - I was not aware of this first effort in the US response to September 11 and the quasi collaborative approach to an attempt on Al Qaeda. Nice to know. 
Otherwise the plot is just a handwritten-on-a-napkin approach to a logistically complicated effort without any depth - Action! - special Forces Identified, 9/11 happens, sad goodbye to family, insertion to country, three campaigns to deliver air support, bad guy identified by killing women, good guy suffers sucking chest wound, bad guy gets it, everyone makes it out alive, warm hello to family, actual group photo during credits - scene! 
One hopes that eventually the likes of Spielberg, Stone, Kubrick and Coppola will bring their warcraft to these middle eastern operations - ( though we do have Three Kings, Zero Dark Thirty and Restrepo ) but this was never WWII or vietnam - this was ""war during pokemon and Halo II"" - a better story than 12 strong has been told by Phil Klay's ""redeployment"" and in such tales I believe we will find the seminal storylines of the Bush era wars."

Graveyard of many empires.
Today you are our friend,tomorrow you are our enemy.
It won't be any different for you.
Soon America will become just another tribe here.
You will be cowards if you leave.
And you will be our enemies if you stay.<br/><br/>I only asked myself one question, after seeing ""12 Strong"". Why didn't the American authorities send 1200 of those well-trained, experienced soldiers instead of this limited group of 12? Then in one fell swoop, they could have wiped out the entire Taliban and the scum that belongs to it. Now after more than 15 years, the American troops are still there and the living conditions and the political situation hasn't improved much. I can believe that these 12 elite soldiers have made a breakthrough in the fight against the Taliban there. That the entire film is based on true facts, I also want to believe. But I think that the event between dropping these soldiers and their homecoming should be taken with a fat grain of salt. It felt like a superhero movie at certain moments and it's the textbook example of displaying American patriotism. The latter a bit too much for my taste.<br/><br/>Any idea how many Taliban fighters these 12 super-elite soldiers had a clear shot at? And how many were eventually sent to the afterlife, where they are awaited for by a harem of virgins, with a well-aimed shot? I lost count after a while. I'm sure that the automatic rifles of the American soldiers were equipped with an auto-aim function because the number of headshots was shockingly high. I suppose the Taliban fighters were equipped with obsolete Soviet arms or weapons from other parts of the world because their shooting skills left much to be desired. Or perhaps they had desert sand in the eyes. Or the American soldiers chose a perfect time to attack. Maybe these Muslim warriors were attacked the moment they rolled out their Persian carpet and knelt down towards Mecca for their prayers. I don't have another explanation. Either that or they are just extremely bad at shooting.<br/><br/>I did admire these elite soldiers because they had to move on horseback through this country. Nothing special, you might say. But not when you find out only one person has experience in this discipline. It's surprising no one fell off an Afghan ridge. They also had an additional obstacle. Not only did the local warlords such as Dostum (David Negahban) thoroughly hate the Taliban regime. There was also the mutual rivalry between the various Afghan warlords. Afghans apparently all have a short fuse (stressful for suicide terrorists). However, I don't understand how they knew at a given moment who they should shoot at, because those Muslim fighters all look identical. ""12 Strong"" is a war film like so many others. Apart from the fact that they go to battle on horses against a force majeure with a hypermodern weapon arsenal. This gives us impressive but at the same time dubious images. It looked like ""The magnificent seven"" mixed with ""Hacksaw Ridge"".<br/><br/>The honor of being the captain of these elite troops was given to Chris Hemsworth, who played it with bravado and conviction. Mitch Nelson is an officer without war experience but with a charisma and intellect that ensures that this impossible operation is fully successful. He manages to convince a general after he interrupted him several times during his briefing (apparently this is not done in the US Army). And he manages to persuade an Afghan warlord in a decisive manner so he forgets a year-long feud for a short time and buries the battle ax briefly. ""12 Strong"" is certainly exciting, contains a whole series of action-packed scenes and shows in a clear way how chaotic the political situation in that country is. My personal opinion about the whole problem is of a very different nature. And many will disagree with it. Let me put it this way. I am convinced that as long as there is money to be earned from these sad conflicts, with ordinary and innocent people being the victims, these tragic conflicts won't stop and nothing will change.

As we now know the war in Afghanistan is still an issue but this mission showed how the spirit and cooperation of an elite team could accomplish so much.

","Probably the most interesting aspect of the battle for Mazar-i-Sharif is the way it combines the 18th century equipment and tactics with state-of-the-art late 20th century weaponry. To that purpose, Nelson and his compatriots charge into battle on horseback, after calling in bombing runs from B52s cruising at 30,000 feet. The lack of psychological complexity and character development shouldn't bea factor to be held against 12 Strong, as the movie does a decent job at what it sets out and will likely please the target demographic (those who have appreciated other recent patriotic films like American Sniper and Lone Survivor). It's well made and, though not sufficiently deep , it gets to offer a salute to determination and braveness, and the importance of diplomacy in developing and cementing alliances.

","Twelve special operations soldiers team up with the Northern Alliance to strike back against the Taliban in Afghanistan in the wake of the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks in 12 Strong (2018). Written by Ted Tally and Peter Craig, and directed by Nicolai Fuglsig, 12 Strong is based on the book Horse Soldiers (2009) by Doug Stanton. Unfortunately, epic battle scenes and a compelling real-life story aren't enough to rescue this film from its lackluster execution and direction.<br/><br/>Green Beret Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) is moving to a staff job when terrorists destroy the World Trade Center on September 11, 2001. With the help of Chief Warrant Officer 5 Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon), he convinces Lt. Colonel Max Bowers (Rob Riggle), Commander of 3rd Battalion, 5th Special Forces Group, to allow him to rejoin his team and deploy with Task Force Dagger against the Taliban and Al Qaeda in Afghanistan.<br/><br/>In Uzbekistan, Captain Nelson convinces Colonel John Mulholland (William Fichtner) to allow his team to go in first by displaying confidence and a knowledge of Afghan history, despite never having served in combat. Prominent members of his team include SFC Sam Diller (Michael Peña) and SFC Ben Milo (Trevante Rhodes). Together, they must earn the trust of an unpredictable Afghan warlord, General Abdul Rashid Dostum (Navid Negahban), and help him defeat his Taliban rivals around the city of Mazar-i-Sharif using U.S. air power.<br/><br/>Mullah Razzan (Numan Acar), leader of the Taliban forces, is a dark-haired, mustache-twirling villain who executes a woman early in the film for teaching young girls to read. After several confrontations and missteps, Captain Nelson wins Dostum's trust and together they overwhelm the Taliban in the ""Tiangi Gap"" and free Mazar-i-Sharif, mostly on horseback.<br/><br/>This is Danish photojournalist and director Nicolai Fuglsig's sophomore effort, his first being a sci fi film he wrote, produced, and directed called Exfil (2017). A more experienced director probably could have crafted this story into something a bit more substantive. It falls victim to the same arcade-style action we've come to expect, and unnecessarily embellishes the truth to make events seem more incredible.<br/><br/>I was disappointed to learn the events of the climactic battle are almost entirely made up. Real-life Capt. Mark Nutsch (Mitch Nelson in the film) told the Tampa Bay Times, ""This is a fictional portrayal - don't lose sight of that."" U.S. Green Berets didn't charge into the fight-they directed airstrikes from overwatches behind the frontlines.<br/><br/>In real life, it took roughly nine hours for help to arrive, and this is explicitly stated several times in 12 Strong. However, when Hal Spencer is severely wounded in a suicide-grenade attack, a helicopter arrives within minutes after the battle to evacuate him to safety. That's because the incident is included for dramatic effect, and none of the team members were actually wounded.<br/><br/>The climactic charge of the horse soldiers against two BM-21 ""Grad"" multiple rocket launchers also never happened. While the Taliban did have BM-21s at the Battle of Mazar-i-Sharif, they were destroyed by U.S. airstrikes. Still, seeing the rockets fire on screen was spectacular and an awesome visual effect.<br/><br/>Overall, audiences generally liked this film, while critics gave it a lukewarm reception (72% versus 54% on Rotten Tomatoes). It delivers on the action and drama, and even attempts a nuanced portrayal of U.S.-Afghan relations, but something misfired along the way. 12 Strong ultimately comes across as formulaic and uninspiring, which is a shame because no Americans come closer to being real life heroes than these soldiers. They deserve a little better than a generic action film."

","Pretty good movie.
Celebrating the troops that fight for our freedom, 12 strong is about a 1st strike that happen after 9/11. In which 12 men went up against al-Qaida in the mountains of Afghanistan, riding on houses.
It was not the best movie I ever seen about the war and about the troops. It has suspenseful action sequences and a decent cast lead by Chris Hemsworth, but in the cast I did feel that they were underutilized. I see this mostly in Micheal Shannon, who I've seen do better with worse material but somehow nothing was fully clicking.
Everything was a little too by the numbers to get any sort of emotional connection out of what was going on."

And within that standard 12 Strong isn't as visceral as Lone Survivor, but a lot better American Sniper that tries to celebrate someone who was a vile racist.<br/><br/>12 Strong does have a solid premise, being about the first American Special Forces soldiers to fight in Afghanistan and how they fought with the Northern Alliance. It could easily have self as a modern version of Lawrence of Arabia due to the focus on the relationship between an American soldier and an Afghan warlord who have to work together.<br/><br/>Sadly 12 Strong isn't as epic or memorable as Lawrence of Arabia and was really a standard Hollywood war film that had a decent final battle.

Even if you hate some critically acclaimed movie, it's ridiculous hyperbole to call it the worst movie. After watching 12 Strong ... maybe I was wrong.<br/><br/>It's hard to believe that a modern, big budget action movie could be this bad. I'll leave it to knowledgeable military people to point out the almost silly portrayals of battle. The, oh so obvious ambushes that they would walk into, but somehow be victorious anyway.The dialogue is non-stop ""action movie"" cliché banter that never rises above adolescent humor. Like others have said, only simplistic portrayals of Americans as super cool, handsome, sharp shooters, filled with buckets of over confidence, bravery, and witty repartee. While Afghans are reluctant fighters who switch allegiance constantly, concerned only with self-preservation. Also, they are sneaky and can't be trusted.<br/><br/>Oh, and just for good measure, civilians in the Defense Dept. don't know anything about real combat and make absurd comments.

There was no sense in what drives or motivates them in doing what they do or why they want to follow their captain in battle. Sure, you have the 9/11 attack as a ""drive"", but I could not shake of the feeling they were more playing ""cowboy"" than taking revenge on the attack. The dread of having an all out war if they would not take the city also felt like missing the mark. The idea is there, but it does not deliver.<br/><br/>On visuals this movie is excellent: the scenery is very nice and the action takes you right on the spot in the battle field, yet again I felt like, as is the case in may more movies, that understanding in being a ""warrior"" instead of a ""soldier"" has more to do with running stupidly and blindly across the battle field all hero-like, than with common sense.<br/><br/>12 Strong failed in delivering and if you want to see a good movie of a war against all odds, go see 300."

"cruise01","7","2","11","20 January 2018"," 12 brave soldiers riding into battle delivers on the action but lacks in character depth.
","12 Strong shows the highlight of the 12 American soldiers battling against the Taliban soldiers after the 9/11 attacks. 12 Strong could have been a really good war film. It may have its problems with a lack of characterization in the script and a repetitive concept with the action. But the cast ensemble and the action sequences are well worth the admission. <br/><br/>The plot follows after the 9/11 attacks. CIA paramilitary soldiers Cpt. Mitch (Chris Hemsworth) was in a hurry to go back into service after seeing the terror attacks in the news. Mitch enlist he brings his team together Sam (Michael Pena) and Spencer (Michael Shannon). Their mission in Afghanistan is to join forces with the alliance Abdul Dostum (Navid Negahban) and his army to help eliminate the Taliban forces. <br/><br/>What I liked about 12 Strong is it does deliver on the action and explosions. May not be the best war film like Saving Private Ryan, Dunkirk, 13 Hours, ect. Seeing the brave men of Mitch and his paramilitary team form a bond with the alliance. After the 9/11 attack. His team motives of going back into service was to go kill some terrorists, no questions ask. They had trouble seeing eye to eye with the alliance. But there bond, that they will stand by the americans side to fight for there country against the Taliban. Like a saying of my enemy of my enemy is my friend or something like that. The film has a few small action sequences were Mitch calls an airstrike to eliminate the Taliban camp site with a little bit of a shoot out. Then, the climax does deliver it all with lots of explosions, intense shoot outs, and an army on horse back riding out into battle. <br/><br/>Chris Hemsworth did great. Michael Shannon was also good. Michael Pena did well. And even Navid Negahban was also good. <br/><br/>What I did not like about the film. I feel like the script was lacking in character depth and the plot was repetitive with the teams mission in Afghanistan. Sure, we learn a little bit about the three main characters. Chris Hemsworth has a family. His wife knows what she is in for. He is a true American patriot, when an attack on American soil happens. He will go overseas to help fight back in battle. Michael Shannon is also a family with a wife that is tired of seeing him go. And Michael Pena's character who has a wife that is also sad and tired of seeing her husband leave. When these characters are in battle there is no emotions to feel for these characters. The script literally lacks in depth that it is difficult to care for these brave soldiers when we really should feel for them. Plus when they are in battle it does feel like the life/death stakes is down to the minimum when everything is taken care of easily. It is always an easy solution of airstrikes. When these guys are hands down fighting, they are easily taken care of from fighting back or avoiding explosions and gun fire. I feel like these characters lives are not really threatened at all. Sure, the direction also lacked in building the suspense and putting you on the edge of your seat to caring for these characters. <br/><br/>Also, the plot was repetitive with the team discovering the Taliban and calling an airstrike. Then it's done. It happens a couple of more times. And every break in between these character chat about their views of this war. And it is also were it missed the opportunity to have development for the characters. And than the final battle when 12 american soldiers are battling on horseback and getting last minute help from the alliance. Sure, these soldiers ride into battle like if it was nothing and they were invincible in avoiding gun fire and explosions. <br/><br/>Overall, 12 Strong is a pretty fair war film. It has some great action battle sequences that will keep you entertained. Chris Hemsworth and the cast were a great choice. The film does lack in character development in the script and the direction was repetitive with the plot. <br/><br/>I rate the film 3.5 out of 5 stars. I recommend in seeing the film in theatres for the action. May not be the best war film but still worth seeing."

In its handling of the dramatic material, the film owes a great debt to the ""Why We Fight"" propaganda films of Frank Capra during World War II, especially in one of the film's captions that claims with no small sense of hyperbole that ""this was one of the U. S. military's most stunning achievements."" <br/><br/>The film opens with the familiar string of events that spawned the ""war on terror"": the first attack on the World Trade Center in 1993, Nairobi in 1998, the battleship Cole in 2000, and, of course, the tragic events of September 11, 2001. There is an interesting sequence of still frames with Vladimir Putin and captions suggesting to his counterpart George W. Bush that ""something big"" was being planned shortly before 9/11.<br/><br/>The balance of the film depicts the brave Green Berets of ODA 595, who become ""horse soldiers"" after linking up with a medieval-style warlord, ""General"" Abdul Rashid Dostum, with the goal of capturing the strategic city of Mazar-i-Sharif. Following the assassination of the Afghan Northern Alliance leader Ahmad Shah Massoud, there is a power vacuum in the Afghan leadership, with Al-Qaeda filling the vacuum. Only a miraculous victory at Mazar-i-Sharif will stem the tide of Al-Quaeda.<br/><br/>The film's action builds to the horrific fight that took place in the strategic Tiangi Gap, the choke point en route to Mazar-i-Sharif. It was there that Captain Mitch Nelson, his fellow Green Berets, and the small contingent led by General Dostum were able to fend off the Al-Qaeda, with assistance from American air strikes. This was the scene in which Chief Petty Officer Hal Spencer, severely wounded by a suicide bomber feigning a surrender, had imagined would be an experience that would be ""kind of like the Apollo program."" But this non-conventional war that later turned into a hopeless quagmire bore no resemblance to a space launch. As observed by the grizzled warlord Dostum, ""there are no 'right choices' here. This is Afghanistan.""<br/><br/>Despite the heroics of the horse soldiers, America's war with Afghanistan has continued in a perpetual struggle lasting more than fifteen years with no voice in the decision-making process from the American people. While the screenwriters offer a few token references to Afghanistan as the ""graveyard of empires,"" the true nightmare of American involvement is never conveyed in this stirring, ""feel good"" film. <br/><br/>The reality of the Horse Soldiers was that the courageous men of ODA 595 returned home to no fanfare. While a statue of a horse soldier was dedicated on the site of the new World Trade Center in 2012, the true face of the war is not the men of of ODA 595, but that of Pat Tillman, a genuine hero killed accidentally by his own men while serving with futility in Afghanistan, graveyard of empires."

","A group of 12 US soldiers is sent to Afghanistan to help an Afghan warlord strike a decisive blow against the Taliban.<br/><br/>This true but previously classified tale of US seeking to weaken Al Quaeda's power base after 9/11 has Chris Hemsworth and Michael Shannon as the senior members of the squad (Michael Pena is the only other member I have ever seen) and the excellent Navid Negahban as General Dostum.<br/><br/>The two main elements of the movie are the uneasy development of the relationship between Hemsworth's character and the general (we are told that Dostum is now Vice-President and that the friendship between the two men has continued) and action.<br/><br/>I'm in two minds about the action. It is well staged and exciting, but I sometimes felt I was watching a western from the 40s or 50s when the 7th Cavalry storms an Indian village and wipes out every one of those pesky redskin varmints. The ease with which hundreds of anonymous Taliban black-clad spear-carriers are mown down by the goodies pays little heed to the fact that, irrespective of how abhorrent you find their beliefs and activities, these were human beings, many of them possibly pressganged into service against their will.<br/><br/>I was entertained, but felt uneasy about it."
"SnoopyStyle","6","1","4","18 April 2018"," old style war movie
","Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth) had gotten a desk job for his family. When America is attacked on 9/11, he pushes to retract from his reassignment to lead his men into the fight against the Taliban in Afghanistan. Hal Spencer (Michael Shannon) is his veteran Chief Warrant Officer. The squad of twelve men joins one of the competing Northern Alliance leaders, Dostum.<br/><br/>This is old style patriotic militarism and it does it well. Hemsworth plays the blonde godlike hero. There is plenty of war action. My biggest complaint is the constant need to get Mitch in the middle of the gun battles. Dostum is needlessly reckless to the point of suicidal. The fighting is geared to be cinematic rather than being realistic. They literally walk into traps more than once. There is one scene where dozen of men carry their weapons offering to surrender. For some unknown reason, the Americans stupidly walk out of their fighting positions into exposed ground. It makes the Americans look bad to do something so dumb. A better way is to have one child soldier surrendering and then set off the booby-trap. This is much more an old style action war movie rather than a deeper portrayal of modern war."
"gcastles-35417","4","1","4","4 April 2018"," Good actors let down by appalling dialogue
","This is another one for the flag wavers. 12 Strong is the story of a Green Beret unit which helped Afghani warlords defeat Taliban and Al Qaeda forces to take a strategically important town in the very early days of the US-Afghanistan war.<br/><br/>First time director Nicolai Fuglsig was a war correspondent in Kosovo, so his experiences no doubt lend some realism to the action scenes; of which there are plenty. However, his inexperience as a director, or perhaps the producers' desire for a return on the budget, reduce this film to a forgettable mash of bombs, bullets and fragile egos.
 
Michael Shannon is IMO one of the best character actors since Philip Seymour Hoffman. He has no opportunity to show his skill here, with some of the worst lines he will probably utter in his entire career being his standout moments in this film. <br/><br/>Michael Pena reprises the role he's been playing repeatedly since the early 90s: a gung-ho soldier who loves his country. Trevante Rhodes gets lumped with all the most cringeworthy scenes. Navid Negahban provides us with the Pashto version of ""Hasta la vista, baby"". And Chris Hemsworth is Chris Hemsworth.<br/><br/>This sums to a film where instead of being immersed in the action, we are frequently reminded we a re watching a film when dumb characters say dumb lines. If you are a fan of Thor et al, then you will probably find this film enthralling. If you have never seen a good war film, I would recommend watching Gettysburg or Das Boot instead; two films which didn't treat the audience like morons."

"CobertNeede","6","1","5","12 April 2018"," Sloppy, Misguiding ; but don't understand all the extreme hate
","12 strong at best, is a pretty ok above average war movie. As much as people wanna say that it is a good guy/bad guy movie and that it is a classic american propaganda movie, they should also realize that despite all these cons they did craft a more than a 'boring' or a 'dull' film. <br/><br/>I, for one had very low expectations for this. Chris Hemsworth's casting for starters. Chris will forever be labelled as the guy who plays 'Thor' and that label hasn't gone off here too. Many critics and reviewers might undermine this film for the casting and general tone of this film alone. 12 Strong starts with the usual sequence that most war movies starts with. A more than predictable story and plot development makes the film a tad uninteresting throughout. With frequent interruptions of 'scholarly advice' and 'fight with heart' dialogues make us cringe and wonder whether this film has something redeeming ; to praise for. Chris's acting was a surprise. Never i would have expected to someone so typecasted to come out with some good piece of acting. <br/><br/>12 strong never suffers from a lack of action or adrenaline rushing moments. In fact, it is one of the few pros that should be mentioned. The slick, undetermined action, but pretty predictable one at that makes it a good thing that stands out from a pile of bad thorns. The film, even produced as a true story never makes it believable. The screenplay looks like it was borrowed from a Chinese robot designed to produce cliched screenplays. The lack of character development, the pretty straightforward interactions and dialogues and a vague, boring reactions to development that rarely take place make the film look like a full on dump. <br/><br/>With some right guidance on how a war film (a real incident at that) should be scripted and directed, 12 strong could have been, potentially a good flick. Even with all the cliches and no original content to produce 12 strong stands on its own as a stagnant, rock solid, sloppy flick."

Film of Choice at The Plaza Dorchester This Morning - 12 Strong. This is the true story of the first special forces unit inserted deep into enemy territory in Afghanistan after the events of 9-11. Forced to work with an Afghan Warlord who is part of the Northern Alliance, Captain Mitch Nelson leads his team into hell. Superbly shot this film tells us of the soldiers on horses who fight against tanks and rocket launchers in a desperate tale of defence, attack and revenge. Once again I'm drawn into thinking about the role the horse plays in societies around the world and through the ages. This wasn't War Horse, these horses didn't even have names, but you have to admire the way they gallop headlong down mountains on the roughest terrain into battles not of their making, yet time and time again they give their all. A superb cast led by Chris Hemsworth as Mitch, this is not a story of any one hero, this is a team of 12 who went into combat determined to return home together. This kind of action film is the best, because it's based on a true story it makes you think more about the images you see on the screen. War is cold, dirty, painful, emotional and gut wrenching and yet it goes on every day. Well done to all involved in this film for not making it bland and mushy."

","With A-Stars leading and B-Stars supporting 12 Strong looked like the movie of January sadly it ain't, had hopes from the great trailer but got let down by the movie itself, felt like those SUPER AMERICAN war movies but with no fighting at all. The whole 2hours is way too long with nothing actually really happening.... At least the 10 last minutes kind of saved the film, the big fight at the end was what we wanted from the movie, what we saw in the trailer but sadly this is the only great scenes we had. Was a great concept but let down because of how boring it was, too long not what the audience wanted and waste of great actors, the movie had potential but delivered it only in it last 10min, and you don't review a film for 10mins of it. So basically the cast are great but don't have that much screentime, only Hemsworth (Thor) has screentime and all he does of it is great yet what he asked to do in the movie is bad, his character is bad and doesn't do much interesting things just thinks and talks that's it! Don't go watch that movie if you're hoping for a big war movie it ain't it feels more like a documentary which isn't bad but wasn't what I wanted to see.

Chris Hemsworth proves himself again as an actor that can do both serious and comedy roles in equal manner. The next step is to see him play the bad guy in a few roles.

Of course the Taliban were monsters and a'holes, but wasn't for another 30 minutes 'til it balanced itself out a bit vs. the Gen. Dotsum character. The other sympathetic element were the Taliban forcing innocent farmers to fight for them, as briefly described. Also Hemmesworth's ""first kill"" was examined in the scene afterwards, but was also by-the-numbers. Any attempt to say ""war isn't pretty"" was brief and cursory vs. the cartoonish and over-the-top depiction of the many battle scenes. American Sniper did a much better job being anti-war, even though everyone was saying it was the opposite.<br/><br/>Some very good actors on a good day, but this really wasn't a good day. A lot of action but barely acceptable directing from Nicolai Fuglsig, who per this site has next-to-no credits. I'd be curious on that story, as I've seen big movies given to new directors. But at least those directors did a string of short films.<br/><br/>Of course it was ""based on a true story"" which I take with a grain of salt.

"bowmanblue","7","0","1","4 December 2018"," Thor vs the Taliban
","When I watch a film like '12 Strong,' i.e. one that's 'based on true events,' I always feel like I should research the true story before deciding on how good the film is. It tells the tale of the first group of American soldiers sent into Afghanistan after the 9/11 attacks who paved the way for the Allied invasion and subsequent regime change for the Middle Eastern country. Naturally, it's all told from America's perspective, but with any Hollywood war movie, what did you expect? Anyway, it's naturally very patriotic and, although I can't confirm or deny on how close to the actual story this depiction is, it's still pretty good fun. And, dare I say that's mainly to do with its leading man, Chris 'Thor' Hemsworth.<br/><br/>Hemsworth plays 'Captain Mitch Nelson' - the squad leader of the twelve special forces operatives sent in to meet up with various local tribes, all of which only too willing to help overthrow the Taliban. There are a couple of familiar faces thrown in there as well - the ones I recognised were Michael Shannon and William Fichtner, but, in my opinion, it's Hemsworth's show all the way. It's hardly controversial to say that he can carry a franchise with ease and here is an example of how he can generally take what is probably a bit of a mediocre and predictable film into something very watchable. He's just so damn easy to watch and somehow doesn't let his (annoyingly, in my bitter opinion!) good looks get in the way of him portraying a kind of 'everyman' soldier who you could just imagine leading a platoon of troops into battle.<br/><br/>As you can probably imagine, the film centres around Hemsworth and his men. There is some attempt to show what's going on in the country at the time, but I did get the feeling that this was there for the added effect of showing how bad it was and therefore doubling down on justifying America's invasion of the region. They try to show the 'villain' of the film (i.e. the leader of the Taliban in the area they're attacking) and what he's up to, but the fact that the story dictates the fact that he's obviously never going to interact with our heroes, he's about as effectives as a villain as a bad guy in the Marvel Cinema Universe (excluding Loki, of course!).<br/><br/>Besides Hemsworth, I thought the other stand-out performance came from Navid Negahban as local warlord/American ally, 'General Dostum.' He actually gets enough screen time to show us that not all residents of the country are our enemies and its good to see the bond develop between him and Hemsworth's characters. Naturally, there are also the obvious battles that you're going to get in any war film. Most of them seem pretty well done and realistic, but I think there were a few CGI explosions thrown in there as well. Like I say, I'm not sure how historically accurate this film is, but there is some text at the end (which I always go by!) that tells us a few facts and it does seem that the film-makers have done their best to tell the actual story, rather than just throwing out some US propaganda. So, if you're interested in the early days of the 'War on Terror,' like war movies, or are just a fan of Chris Hemsworth, this is actually a film that's better than I expected it to be."

","I am old enough to have a vivid memory of the historic events that are described in this movie. I remember 9/11. I remember following the news every day after. That makes this movie interesting from a historic perspective. It kind of takes me behind the headlines I remember so well from back then. However, I think this movie is best viewed as an action adventure movie, rather than a documentary style war movie. If you expect the latter...then maybe you will be disappointed. If you expext the former, this movie will take you on a hell of a ride. The movie offers intense action sequences. But what really makes this movie stand out for me is the cinematography and the brooding score. This movie looks amazing. Its interesting, because I had to look up who did the cinematography. And it turns out its the same guy who also did the cinematography for The Dark Tower, a movie I reviewed last week and where I also pointed out the stunning cinematography. This guy is amazing. Same goes for the director and music composer. What a talented group of people who created this movie. I think the bad reviews must be from people having the wrong expectations.

","12 Strong<br/><br/>Let's be honest, we aren't short of war movies.
The genre is over stocked.
Some of these movies have reached the dizzy heights of greatness but there's been some stinkers too!
12 Strong leans more to the good.
History books are full of stories to tell and the story of the twelve soldiers who where the first deployed into Afghanistan after 9/11 is certainly one worth telling.
Led by a new captain played by Chris Hemsworth his special forces team must work with an Afghan warlord to take down the Taliban.<br/><br/>Nicolai Fuglsig's film tells an important story but does so with no real vigour.
Don't get me wrong this is by no means a bad or boring film, it just never really ignites into anything special.
It's a perfectly serviceable war movie but I got the feeling that the story of these twelve heroes was never done justice.
In parts 12 Strong is slow and cumbersome.
When the action does kick in it is done effectively and with a level of skill.
Ariel shots are sublime.
The dropping of bombs is both destructive yet beautiful at the same time because the cinematography is so captivating. The use of colour is sparsely splashed across the screen to give the entire picture a look of desolation.
Sound is also very good as it should be. This is a war movie. We need the bangs!<br/><br/>Essentially that's the problem with 12 Strong. We get the bangs for our buck but there's not enough character development for me to care about these men.
Of course I do, but apart from Hemsworth's character there's not enough insight invested into the rest of the team.
This is where this film should have shone.
Unlike say Dunkirk which was criticised for its lack of character development, but that film was more of a running commentary. We the audience was thrown into the action with soldiers in Nolan's film. There was no time for pleasantries. It was a duck and cover movie.
12 Strong wants you to get to know it's characters and spends a lethargic first act skipping over the subject offering us not enough insight.
Instead 12 Strong becomes a fairly enjoyable action movie that has grounded and believable action.
This is no Rambo First Blood Part II.
You do get the sense that these men are in real danger, they're not larger than life superheroes. They're real people fighting a very real war.
I can recommend this movie. It's a film that has its highs and lows. Sadly the highs are the action scenes and not the development of its real heroes.
Sadly this is why unlike great movies such as Saving Private Ryan it won't stay in the memory banks for very long."

The film also serves as a portrait for how a religion will be manipulated by evil willed people to justify the fake minded toxic manipulative realities.
The film is layered with good performances by its cast.
Navid Negahban who plays General Dostum manages to outshine the main lead Captain Nelson played by Chris Hemsworth particularly with an effortless investive performance.
The first quarter of the film might feel like a bit too slow paced where the war strategies are formulated but hang in there because the film would definitely serve as a good enough War film leading up to the climax with as many as shooting sequences that you would expect.
Apart from the fact that the flow of the plot takes too much time in the first half to show the viewers how the war strategies are laid out where it almost loses the consistent momentum I didn't come across any other place where the delivery of this heroic story fell flat.

","What makes this Hollywood-good-old-days war movie stand out is clearly evident in the title of the source material, the book ""Horse Soldiers"". Incredible as it seems, this 21st century cavalry story is true, and the depiction in the movie stays close to the facts, allowing scattered artistic/dramatic enhancements here and there. In any event, watching warriors (in whatever century, or even prior) charging like a whirlwind on horseback has an appeal that is eternal. In this particular movie, pain has been taken to highlight the facts that Afghan worriers rely on horses not only for transport, but also for combat. When U.S. soldiers express concern that the horses might panic at the U.S. air support strike, they are assured ""horses know these are American bombs."" <br/><br/>The linear narration is uncomplicated. In the immediate aftermath of 911, it is painfully clear that if Al-Qaida continues to use Afghanistan as a terrorist training camp, more similar attacks will follow. The mission of the first troop of U.S. soldiers to target Afghanistan, 12 to be exact, is to work with local warlord general Dostum (Navid Negahban) to capture Mazar-i-Sharif, a Taliban stronghold. The formidable military task, verging on a mission impossible, is not the only challenge. Dostum is one of the three warlords in what is called a ""Northern Alliance"" launching this 3-prong attack. But any two of these 3 warlords, if they encounter each other during the operation, may well suspend fighting Taliban and instead try to kill each other. Politics in the best vintage! <br/><br/>Heading up this mission-almost-impossible is Captain Mitch Nelson (Chris Hemsworth), who is intelligent, impeccably trained, physically superb, strategically insightful, in a word the perfect man for the job. There is only one catch, he has zero battlefield experience. Even when his men trust him with their lives, warlord Dotsum's initial reaction to this temporary partner is all but predictable. Equally predictable is the gradual development of mutual respect of these two men. Dotsum gives Nelson a few tips such as ""stop being a soldier and be a warrior"". Nelson in return counsels Dotsum of the importance of putting aside tribal rivalry in light of the big picture of fighting Taliban. This sequence is done very well in the movie and, in the ending credits, the audience is informed that to this day, these two men remain good friends.<br/><br/>A better for-entertainment war movie I have not seen for a long time. The heroism is crystallized upfront just before the airdrop to Afghanistan, in the lyrics of a song shared by the 12 ""....100 men we test today but only three will win the Green Beret"". Well-paced action set pieces a paraded through the movie, climaxing in the exciting, rousing charge of the ""21st century cavalry"" to demolish a powerful rocket launcher behind enemy line. <br/><br/>There is good buddy chemistry between a solid Hemsworth and two veterans (in the movie context), Michael Shannon playing experienced Hal Spencer and Michael Pena playing jovial Sam Diller. But it is Negahban who steals the show. Even the great Omar Sharif could not have done a better job."

This gives a slight twist to the whole action war film but they still have top notch guns and targeted air strikes. <br/><br/>They is an okay movie.

No one does this patriotic shit quite as well as Bruck! All the American warriors going to Afghanistan are so patriotic and macho in a good way (yet tender and loving to their families) than you can't help but like and respect them.<br/><br/>The cast is very nice too, starting with the star Chris Hemsworth who has gathered fame with all these hot ""Thor"" superhero movies and always makes a good action man because of his buffed-up body and tendency to look slightly mad when his face is covered by dust, grease and/or blood... which tends to happen in war movies.<br/><br/>There can only be one hero, of course, but we have also Michael Peña and William Fichtner (the always solid supporting men), and, er, all the other ones making up the American or local armed forces.<br/><br/>And then there's Michael Shannon, thinking man's Hollywood star. As an actor, he's always had the best of both worlds really - this larger than life presence that just commands the attention when he's on screen but he's also smart and intelligent, being able to do any kind of project he damn well pleases.<br/><br/>There's not enough of him in ""12 Strong"", because producers think Hemsworth needs to be central to everything, but then again, is there ever?<br/><br/>Having watched some, you may notice that for a war movie, there's not a lot of action. In fact, you don't get any battles some 55 minutes have passed from the beginning.<br/><br/>It's not just that war movies are notoriously expensive, the story is also character-based, so the emphasis is on the team members, their state of mind and relationship with local allied warriors who fight the same war but for very different reasons and with a different attitude.<br/><br/>We see how being in a battlefield is, all this dust and mostly waiting and sitting around in your army pants, waiting for something to happen (which sounds a lot like my 20's, minus the dust and army pants).<br/><br/>Then the battles happen, and I gotta say, they turn out to be not the strongest part of ""12 Strong"". I mean, they are as visually attractive as they come these days, but not standing out in any significant way, except maybe the good work of make-up department creating wounds on the bodies of actors. In short, nothing we haven't seen before enough times.<br/><br/>The suspension never rises high enough because the American soldiers are mostly invulnerable and don't carry heavy losses.<br/><br/>How invested can you be in a firefight where you just know that ""our guys"" are gonna be left standing? It feels like a videogame, not a authentic chaos of war.<br/><br/>Sadly, the story which is meant to be the strongest part of ""12 Strong"" is actually not that strong too. It's always a'ight, but not delving deep enough into the characters or their relationships with local allies (although the contrast of two sides is one of the most important points in the story). Which makes it surprising to see how friendly they are in the end.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it's perfectly OK war movie but it doesn't distinguish itself enough in any significant way, to really offer more than two hours worth of passive watching.<br/><br/>The stakes might have been high in real life (it's based on true story), but they sure are only middling on the screen.<br/><br/>I wish they'd used the original title ""Horse Soldiers"", it's more intriguing. But I guess ""12 Strong"" is a cleaner and better fit for a mainstream project."

","This review of 12 Strong is spoiler free<br/><br/>*** (3/5)<br/><br/>BRAVERY, POWER AND strength take their hold through the plot of Jerry Bruckheimer's produced true telling war drama 12 Strong, based on the alleged declassified mission when CIA Paramilitants and American Special Forces would join forces and invade Afghanistan after the events of 9/11 to kill the Taliban. 
 
However those points aren't just the central nail for the plot, they're also what carries the film through its pulsating action. Sure this idea is often clankingly direct as the film progresses, yet it gives a scent of the decent layout through its 130 minute running time. However, despite the robustly delivered action and an interesting big-name cast helming it, this core idea sadly falls to the straightforward storytelling of patriotic heroism and a weak script which often has it's actors talking through bombastic poster taglines and not really much else. 
 
Saying that though, there's obviously a reason why Bruckheimer attached himself to the film, maybe it's the core material based on Doug Stanton's novel 12 Horses, or perhaps it's the bravery of a dirty dozen who take a chance and fight back - it could also be the chance to do something other than the recently botched plotting of the Pirates of the Caribbean series. It could, in fact, be all of them that gained his attraction, the attraction of Danish first-time director Nicolai Fuglsig and the talented cast. Chris Hemsworth (taking a break from the MCU) plays Captain Mitch Nelson, a man with limited combat experience, who's mostly bunged-up behind a desk, he and his trusty lieutenant (Michael Shannon) are given the task to fight in Afghanistan where they'll be tied with their foreign general (Navid Negahban). 
 
While the sandy dozen tour through the gorgeous desert backdrop, there are a few Sergio Leone-ish action scenes - of horse, guns, tanks and giant explosions clashing together. It's an entertaining war-drama which has keen intentions happily carried through its core performances - sadly the action, though stunning, especially with an explosion taking up half the screen, it isn't anything we haven't already seen before. And it's that thinking where the action often falls to repetition, it's almost as if the editor left during production and recycled the same material. 
 
Still, that said, 12 Strong boasts stunning cinematography, a big name producer and a hefty cast all with brilliant performances there's even a surprise dramatic turn by Rob Riggle. All are big with their intentions to grasp the powerful premise and to grasp the true intentions of bravery from the core material - yet the truth is the film sadly loses another point for lacking in characterization. Indeed it has problems through its forgettable plot it's an entirely brazen film that comes with power, the determination of odds and a strong heart. 
 
VERDICT Invigorating action and a solid cast lead in this fact-based war film that sadly loses its way from limited character a soft core and an underwhelming story."

","12 STRONG had an interesting premise going for it - the true life, just released, top secret mission of the first Special Forces unit to be deployed in Afghanistan following the 9/11 terrorist attack. All set to conduct ""traditional"" warfare, these soldiers must learn to adapt to a different sort of war being waged in the caves and cliffs surrounding them - including fighting tanks while on horseback! <br/><br/>And...with charismatic screen performers like Chris Hemsworth, Michael Pena, Trevante Rhodes, and (especially) Michael Shannon, the ingredients were there for a strong film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, Director Nicolai Fuglsig (in what is, in essence, his big screen debut as a Director) and Writers Ted Tally and Peter Craig squander this opportunity and present a fairly bland, fairly generic action/adventure flick reminiscent of the Chuck Norris Vietnam flicks of the 1980's (like MISSING IN ACTION or THE DELTA FORCE).<br/><br/>Not only that, but with a film entitled 12 STRONG, you would expect the 12 soldiers to be an interesting group of characters (a la THE DIRTY DOZEN or ALIENS), unfortunately, this should have been called Chris Hemsworth plus 3 and a bunch of glorified extras. The lion's share of this film follows Hemsworth's rookie Captain develop into a ""warrior"". This is an interesting character played by a charismatic actor and would have been more interesting had we not spent a vast majority of the film with him. After awhile I wanted to yell at the screen - ""All right! I get it! He has to learn how to kill without losing his humanity"". Also featured in this group are Michael Pena as the ""Gung-Ho GI"" of the group (with a smart mouth, of course) and Trevante Rhodes (following his breakout performance in MOONLIGHT) who befriends a young, local boy (you can guess how that goes). Both of these character arcs play out rather predictably. But the biggest sin in this film is the misuse of the great Michael Shannon as the 2nd in command. Perhaps Shannon's schedule did not allow more use of him, but he was barely in this film and what time he was used it was well below his abilities of an actor - a major disappointment.<br/><br/>To this film some slack, the action is serviceable which makes it worth watching - an element that elevates this mediocre film to something just north of that.<br/><br/>If you're looking for an escape from the January cold, you could do worse, an enjoyable - enough - 2 hours in the theater.<br/><br/>Letter Grade: B-<br/><br/>6 (out of 10) stars and you can take that to the Bank(OfMarquis)"
