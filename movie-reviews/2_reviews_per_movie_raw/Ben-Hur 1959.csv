","When I first saw 'Ben Hur' I was 8 years old and hadn't seen many films, since we were hardly ever allowed to watch television. Imagine what an impact this film had on me (my movie diet had so far consisted of Chaplin and Disney films - which, of course, is not at all a bad thing).<br/><br/>The experience was simply mesmerizing. Awe and wonder filled me as I watched this story of shocking betrayal, revenge and forgiveness unfold on screen - and by the time the heart-stopping chariot race was over, my fate as a future movie addict was sealed. <br/><br/>Despite its 212 minutes running time, this is storytelling at its finest that knows how to entertain; as we follow Judah Ben-Hur's dramatic journey from Jerusalem to Rome and back again, the film just never lets up and immerses you completely.<br/><br/>It's hard to imagine anything more cinematic, especially at the time: if ever there was an epic that was meant to be seen on the big screen in all its bombastic glory, it's Ben Hur. And even now, after I've seen the film many, many times, I feel like this story has a certain sense of greatness to it that is touching (and I don't mean that in a religious sense).<br/><br/>My verdict: this film was and is nothing like the many ""sandal and sword"" or bible films of that era; it is (at least to me) the ultimate film epic. With its touching story and fantastic action sequences - which I think hold up amazingly well - Ben Hur is among the milestones of its era and part of film history.<br/><br/>Pure cinema and a must see. 10 stars out of 10.<br/><br/>Favorite TV-Shows reviewed: imdb.com/list/ls075552387/<br/><br/>Favorite films: IMDb.com/list/mkjOKvqlSBs/<br/><br/>Lesser-Known Masterpieces: imdb.com/list/ls070242495/<br/><br/>Favorite Low-Budget and B-Movies: imdb.com/list/ls054808375/"

","In the ears and minds of any movie lover, the word ""Ben-Hur"" resonates like the quintessential Hollywood classic oozing respectability in every inch of celluloid but the same respect we owe to an old relic. In our cynical modern world, who would enjoy a pompous-looking big-budget swords-and-sandals religious epic when you have Tarantino and Appatow?<br/><br/>I saw ""Ben-Hur"" for the first time in fourth grade, it was part of our history course and being an Asterix buff, I loved watching real-life legionaries, galley slavery not to mention the chariot race, the film also enlightened me on Christianity and on Judaism (when my only religious reference was monotheism number three) and scared the hell out of me with leper. It worked on a cinematic level as much as educational, I guess even in its TV-sized crappy 80's VHS look, we kids enjoyed ""Ben-Hur"" especially the rivalry between Judah (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Stephen Boyd).<br/><br/>I never watched ""Ben-Hur"" after that but nor did I have any doubt over its status as a colossal masterpiece. Watching it again a few years ago and then a few days ago, I was surprised by how engraved in my memory ""Ben-Hur"" was, and how the moments that stood out were still having the same effect. When Ben-Hur and Messala meet after many years, I'm always anticipating that first breech in the fortress of their friendship when the young Roman tribune will have one word too many about Ben-Hur's people, taking for granted their friendship and Judah's nobility as marks of submission. The second encounter is even more thrilling because it's like watching a shaking edifice waiting to collapse.<br/><br/>It was a nice call from the director Wyler to mark the feud between the two ex-friends at the second encounter, hence putting more gravitas around their relationship, that screenwriter Gore Vidal tried to impregnate with homoerotic subtext. The story is known by movie buffs, Vidal wanted to make the interactions look as the two rivals were former lovers, the subtext works even more when you look at Stephen Boyd's ""enamored"" eyes toward Charlton Heston. But 'Chuck' never knew the trick and was annoyed about it, I guess I prefer the way their hatred epitomize the conflict between Romans and Jews sealing as one of the most memorable rivalries in history of cinema, with the most heart-pounding climactic face-to-face (or should I say wheel-to-wheel).<br/><br/>I had positive feelings about ""Gladiator"" but ""Ben-Hur"" is the masterpiece that dwarfs any contemporary masterpiece, a sweeping revenge story that doesn't rely at all on fake CGI and special effects. It took William Wyler's expertise built up in three decades of experience to make ""Ben-Hur"" equal the reference of the time that was Cecil B. De Mille's 1925 version. As a matter of fact, ""Ben-Hur"" has been blockbuster material from the start, ever since Lewis Wallace's best-seller of the late century, it was played on theaters and not with modest budgets. A revenge story, with galley combats, a chariot race and an oblique take on the greatest story ever told, with a hero going from idealism to anger, from revenge to love, all wrapped up in a subtle religious conversion, ""Ben-Hur"" was an instant classic Hollywood couldn't ignore.<br/><br/>If 1925 had the race and the thrills, the 1959 one had a bigger scope, bigger budget, the colors, the talking and all the determination of a big studio like MGM to prove a 50's audience that TV wasn't yet the pinnacle of spectacular entertainmnet. When I hear my Dad talking about going to the movies, like ""Ben-Hur"", ""Spartacus"", ""Guns of Navarone"" or ""Taras Boulba"" you would think he went there, inside the screen. And right now, I can't imagine the eyes of people staring at the screen during the chariot race, there comes a moment where you stop watching the moment as a plot element, but as a real race, and it never, never suspends your disbelief, it's like at any new viewing, Messalah can finally win.<br/><br/>There are so many classic moments that filled the three-hour-and-half journey that you're never in a state of non-anticipation, when the new inquisitor's parade starts, you keep an eye on that loose roof tile, the one that started the whole chain of events. In the desert, you wait for the 'greatest cameo ever made', in the galleys, the big fight and Ben-Hur rescuing Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and it goes on and on. I must reckon after the chariot race, the film gets a tad too long, but only because you can't just sweep off such a rich epic with a five-minute resolution, and Charlton Heston, in his greatest role, contributed a lot to the everlasting appeal of the film, I don't think he gets the credit he deserved, he brings to his Judah Ben-Hur a dimension of emotional vulnerability that could have been laughable from a lesser actor.<br/><br/>Other cast members include Oscar-winning Hugh Griffin enjoying his role as Arab sheikh and Judah's mentor, Israeli actress Haya Harareet as Esther, Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell as Judah's mother and sister... the film is served by a solid cast, editing, directing, having swept off all the major Oscar by breaking the record of 11 wins, only to be matched in 1997 with ""Titanic"" and ""The Return of the King"" and oddly enough, these titles could somewhat apply to ""Ben-Hur"". <br/><br/>I haven't seen the 'original' and I'm in no hurry for the remake, but I don't get I'll be in a minority if I say that this is the ultimate version. I didn't see it many times in my life but it's always present in my memories as if it wasn't about the number of times you watch it but the intensity of each experience. And let's not forget the name of the director: William Wyler who outdid himself by making his masterpiece, which is saying a lot, given his previous streaks.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"": A Christ Tale, a tale of vengeance, in fact a tale of all tales..."
"lambiepie-2","10","37","49","20 April 2003"," One of the Top Five Films of All Time!
","Anyone want to know how to make a darned good EPIC remake? Then this is the film to see. <br/><br/>William Wyler made an epic, a film that is exciting, violent, heartfelt film. Make no mistake, it is the story of two childhood friends, one gets drunk with power and the other who was a Jewish Prince gets thrown into a life of hardship though his boyhood 'friend'. But he has faith and keeps on going. The ultimate battle to beat all battles, to settle the score...is at the Chariot race and that is a sight to behold.<br/><br/>Films like Ben-Hur will NEVER get greenlighted today and if it did, too much CGI and not enough of what Director Wyler and old Hollywood was good at. The actors, well, they are to die for. Excellent acting. And let me share with you my favorite part...(tee-hee) when Pilate holds up his hankerchief to start the chariot race, plays with the racers and audience - he's very smug ya know..then the WAY he finally drops it. Who couldn't tell how he'd eventually turn out, hmmmmmmm? <br/><br/>There is nothing more I can add that others have said. This film is near and dear to me and for my vote -- is one of the top five films of all time. I never tire of watching this film, I find something new in it every time, its done that well.<br/><br/>This is an epic remake, something else that Hollywood has trouble doing -- to remake a film on this scale that finds new audiences year after year, after year. Brilliant, wonderful, every bit of it. A must, must see. Just plain excellent!"

","We are by nature a cynical and critical group.<br/><br/>With the attention span of a bumblebee, moreso the current generation than the earlier ones, because of exposure to mobile devices and other modern disposable non-repairable tech.<br/><br/>It is probably for that reason that epics like this one have become forgotten over time. Even the late CH has become more a societal joke and less of an icon over time. Michael Moore made Heston's participation in the NRA a joke. (If Heston's concerns over where society is headed prove to be true, the final joke may be on Moore.) Back to the film. It is almost perfect. Then, as now. The script continually builds. Modern writers could learn from that. No matter what is presently on screen as you watch, the inevitability of the final climax beckons.<br/><br/>The acting is perfect.<br/><br/>The mixture of myth and drama is perfect.<br/><br/>True the Roman dialog did not benefit from the verbal tricks that Stephen McKnight used in Spartacus (bending the script to match the flow of actual Roman) but it is more than enough to entertain and entrance.<br/><br/>From the ""accident"" early in the film which starts the flow of events, to the chariot race WHICH HAS NEVER BEEN EQUALLED IN THE HISTORY OF FILM, to the reunion with lost family at the end, this is one of the most powerful and entertaining films of all time"
"CubsandCulture","10","18","23","4 November 2018"," Human Drama, Grand Spectacle, Moving Divinity
","This film is so much more than the chariot race. Undoubtedly, that is the most famous sequence and for good reason. It is stunning, electric, tense and the so very exciting. There is nothing like simply seeing a chariot race unfold by actually filming a group a chariots. But the sequence is filled with meaning because the film spends so much time building up the personal relationship between Judah and Messala; their hatred for each other displayed in the chariot race is alive and bitter. Because we have seen them expressing deep kinship and spiritual love.<br/><br/>There is a famous dispute between Wyler and Vidal about how much of the Judah-Messala relationship was intended to have a subtext of a gay jilted lovers. I think to dwell on that is to sort of miss the point. While it it is really easy to read an erotic love (especially on Messala's part) between the two it is clear that spiritual love is present in anycase. The erotic element is present if one cares to look but it is not needed. There is clearly an emotional intimacy between the two. This intimacy gets soured by politics. The story is richer, deeper and more personal as a result.<br/><br/>Richer is a good word for this movie. It is nearly 4 hours long but it is a fully fleshed out epic that engages the entire time. I rather enjoyed how the Christian themes are restrained-You never see Christ's face, you only hear what he says second hand etc.-it makes the film feel about Jesus of Nazareth and not necessarily Jesus Christ. I feel like it makes the film more accessible to nonChristians while Christians can infer what the wish. Biblical epics can often be very stuffy and overwrought. Wyler's use of deep focus really gives the film a feel of intimate epicness. The scope is grand; the focus personal,<br/><br/>Wyler was a very good filmmaker; this is something of a departure for him. Nonetheless this film is still the work of a master."

"ironhorse_iv","9","15","19","18 April 2017"," OMG! Ben-Hur is one of the best movies ever made. It's a sweet chariot. That's worth the ride.
","Winner of 11 Academy Awards in 1959, including Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, and Best Supporting Actor. 'Ben-Hur' remains one of the most inspirational, epic action spectacles ever made by a major Hollywood studio. It was a landmark achievement in grand peplum/biblical genre storytelling. Directed by William Wyler, the film tells the story of a kind, wealthy Jew, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) whose life is thrown upside down, when he is betrayed and falsely accused of crimes against the Roman Empire by his childhood friend, turn tribune Messala (Stephen Boyd). Spending three years as a galley slave, Judah must find, a way to restore himself to high standing and while, also seeking revenge on his enemies. Without spoiling the movie, too much, while everybody thinks that this movie was the original; it was in fact, the third movie, follow after 1907 & 1925 of the same name to be made from Lew Wallace's successful novel, 1880's 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of The Christ'. It can be argued that a talking picture made from the same story as an earlier silent film is not a true remake, since the storytelling techniques each employ are so radically different, but that's up to debate, but at least, it's more original than the later films that came after it, like the 2003's animation version & the 2016 remake. Anyways, like the book, the movie also has a sub-story running in parallel with Judah's main event narrative; which was the unfolding story of Jesus. While, Jesus does play a more important role in this story more than other films, his cameo presence is still somewhat tangential. It's jarring to see a violent revenge plot, mixed his story about love thy neighbor. Thank God, the film cut the sequences of Ben-Hur faking his death, and raising a Jewish army to overthrow the Romans, as it felt that Christ's message of forgiveness, could be lost. Still, 'Ben-Hur' is the only Hollywood film to make the Vatican approved film list in the category of religion, despite having scenes of him killing an innocent guard. However, the film does have other problems than the mixed messages, it was presenting. The book and the films have always been accuse of being too similar to the book, 'The Count of Monte Cristo"" by author Alexandre Dumas to the point that some critics have stated out that the film is 'The Count of Monte Cristo meets Quo Vadis'. While, me, personal, I don't see much of anything comparable; some critics says, the film is ripping off, that premise, way too much. Regardless, I did like the changes by the many screenwriters, did, to couther, being too similar to the novel, like having Messala's vindictiveness be motivated by a sexual and romantic rejection as much as a political one. I'm one of the few people that, kinda like the somewhat hidden homoerotic overtones between Judah and Messala. I also love how Heston didn't know about this; adding an interesting uncomfortable dynamic to the tense dialogue scenes between the two actors. It adds some spice and realism that was really needed for this period film. I also like how the film, add symbolism to the ocean scenes and also cut other things, like the character of Ira from the novel. I always felt that the scenes with her, was time-wasting. On top of that, the other changes like having Judah's sister being the one who dislodge the roof tile & how they treat Messala after the climatic chariot race were equally as important. However, the movie still have pacing issues. 212 minutes running time is way too long. While, I get why, the soul-stirring scenes of Christ's birth and crucifixion was needed, as it provide biblical bookends for MGM's action-packed epic. I think the outdated, theatrical overture & intermission sequence should had been delete in future releases. If anything, scenes like Judah declines the race at times, even after he learns that Messala will also compete, could had been delete as well, as the famous chariot race sequence did happen, later on the film, regardless of Judah wanting to do it or not. It felt like filler. Despite that, the climactic chariot race, which includes collisions, men dragged under chariots, bloody injuries, and intensely suspenseful competition, was so impressive in the stunt work & make up that it set new standards for action-filmmaking without modern cinematic razzle-dazzle. It was very surprising to hear that nobody got kill or seriously hurt. The colorful 1959 version was the most expensive film ever made up to its time, and the most expensive film of the 50s decade. Shot on the grand scale of $15 million, the film took six years to prepare, and over a half year in production, it was a tremendous make-or-break risk for MGM Studios. Luckily, for them, the project, ultimately saved the studio from bankruptcy as it became a box office hit, earning three times more than it took to make. Does it hold up? Yes, while it's slow at times, and some of the acting feels now, mannered, stiff, and awkward like Hugh Griffith in blackface. It still worth the praise and achievements, it got, when it first released. It still has great acting from all the cast, including more physically than emotionally compelling Heston, amazing color widescreen cinematography from Robert Surtees, beautiful music from composter Miklós Rózsa & wonderful costumes from Elizabeth Haffenden and her crew. However, this movie might be too intense to be rated G, even at the time. After all, this movie has a leper colony where two principles characters are shown with open, rotting sores and a few men drowning in the ocean battle. If anything, it could be rated PG or PG-13 now. Regardless of that, I have say, Ben-Hur is one of the ultimate epics movies of all time. A legendary movie that needs to be rewatch, time after time again. Highly recommended."
"galahad58","10","245","417","26 November 2005"," The pinnacle of film making
","I own over 2,000 movies on DVD or VHS. I have gone to many many more movies that have not been worthy of my collection, thus my exposure to film has been extensive. I mention this because through every film I have seen; I still come back to a film from 1959 as the greatest achievement in cinematic history. I have seen great films like: Return of the King, Saving Private Ryan, Braveheart and many more. While the modern films are wonderful and have a fantastic richness to them, they still are a ""small"" notch below Ben-Hur. Today's films use a lot of computer effects for their battles scenes, their backgrounds, and even computer images for the stunts of their actors. Yet, Ben-Hur did it all without computers. I am still fascinated by the chariot race. Never, in film history, has anything matched the depth and excitement of the chariot race. Remember folks, this is 1959, nothing is computer generated. Some may say the naval battle scenes look a bit cheesy, but again it was 1959 and the scenes still work today. What can you say about the acting? Every single actor is wonderful. Heston is in top form as Ben-Hur. Steven Boyd is incredible playing the merciless Messala. Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott--all fantastic in their roles. Each performing the role of a life time. The actors are fantastic, but William Wyler brings more out of each actor than any director ever could in this day and age. Wyler had no computer animation to rely on, he had no high tech special effects crew, he had no computer program to fill in extras. Wyler had to find thousands of extras for many scenes and maintain control. Did you ever see Steven Boyd better? Probably not. Did you ever see any of the actors (except Heston, who is an acting marvel) better in any other role? Wyler just pulled the greatest performance out of each actor. The story: fantastic from beginning to end. While the film is over 3 hours long, you do not feel that it is that long. Every scene is lovingly crafted: the reunion between Messala and Judah, the trek to the gallows, the rowing scene, the naval battle, the chariot race, the Messala death scene, the reunion with Judah and his family, etc. After seeing thousands and thousands of movies, I always come back to Ben-Hur. This is the mark of fantastic movie making. Today's film makers could learn a lot by watching this film and ""learning"" about acting, directing, and screen writing."

At the same time his meetings with Christ just add to the Wonderful drama that enfolds in this movie.It has a magnificent musical score which just adds to the drama,and I suspect the climax of the film would only leave the stone hearted unmoved.It has other great stars who make this a must see film ,particularly Jack Hawkins,Hugh Griffith and Stephen Boyd.<br/><br/>This is the sort of film Gladiator should have been but wasn't  (what a waste).

Now he is manning an oar in a ship's galley and his family is imprisoned. Years pass and now Heston is after the former childhood friend (Stephen Boyd), a Roman, that turned against him. The 17 minutes of footage for the chariot race is some of the best during the history of the cinema.

","Along with Haya Harareet, I think Claude Heater is one of the last of the surviving main cast members from Ben-Hur (1959). Quite symbolic in a way given Mr Heater's moving performance as Jesus Christ in the movie. When I saw Ben-Hur at a church gathering night a few years ago, the Pastor(who was quite conservative) told us that even though Ben-Hur is a ""Hollywood"" movie, it's the one that probably came closest to honoring and glorifying the Son of God. <br/><br/>In Ben-Hur you never see the face of Jesus Christ, and that was a deliberate choice by the director. But Claude Heater gives the emotional gravitas required for the role.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur is a movie that stands the test of time. No wonder we say ""It's bigger than Ben-Hur"" to describe something spectacular. Ben-Hur is an epic, it's spectacular, and it's moving."

","Wow, what can you say about a film that won 11 Academy Awards back in the days where the best films actually were honored, not the garbage they salute today.<br/><br/>In other words, this film lives up to its reputation and has to be ranked as one of the most memorable movies of all time. Nobody who ever saw this film ever forgot the chariot race, for instance, perhaps the greatest action scene filmed without special effects. <br/><br/>This can be a very sad film as well. I doubt if I've ever watched this without a few tears in my eyes at certain points. The scenes with hero's mother and sister suffering with leprosy are still some of the most heart-wrenching scenes I've ever witnessed on film. They can just tear you apart. <br/><br/>The combination of drama, action and romance, along with very involving storyline is aided by an incredible soundtrack, once again one of the best ever put on film. The more one hears this music, the more was is moved by it. <br/><br/>To fully appreciate the cinematography in this film I recommend you purchase the recently-released 4-disc DVD special edition which also includes the first rendition of this story, the silent movie ""Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ."" That was name of the book, by the way, the second part of the title being left off the 1959 movie as Hollywood slowly began deemphasizing Christianity in films. However, there is a reverence for Jesus Christ in this film, which should be there since it's a key element of the storyline, even though most folks forget that.<br/><br/>In summary, this is about as good an example as ever found of what is labeled an ""epic"" movie. It's an incredible story transferred memorably on screen."

","Ben Hur, a Tale of the Christ, was hugely popular as a novel, a play and two movies. It was written in a less vulgar time about a very spiritual event. Seen today by moviegoers addicted to constant action and low frequency effects, it will seem ponderous, slow and pretentious. Well, it is a little. You have to pay attention to the dialogue or you won't get it at all. Some of the intimate scenes aren't all that great. Anyone that really pays attention can tell the sea battle is done with miniatures. It's still worth watching. As everyone ought to know by now, the chariot race is one-of-a-kind; nothing else comes close to that real live race where the main actors actually raced  most of the time. I just watched this movie after lapse of about 10 years. I still enjoyed it. The sea battle is still fun even if you know the boats are about as big as a man. The few moments which have Christ on the screen are still moving. Just about all of the acting is good with only a few forgettable moments. Just be ready to spend about 4 hours in front of the screen listening to occasionally flowery dialog."

"filipemanuelneto","10","11","16","1 March 2017"," Wonderfully epic.
","Some movies are so good that they just haven't age. They are timeless, like any work of art. This is one of those movies, perhaps one of the best movies ever and surely one of the biggest and most epic biblical movies ever made. The story is based on a novel by Lew Wallace (which I have read and I have at home) and is so famous that it doesn't allow spoils: the injustice committed against Judah Ben-Hur and his path of revenge, deeply linked to the life and death of Jesus, a latent and ever palpable subplot, even when it does not arise. Epic in every detail, the film features scenarios and costumes carefully crafted in the style of Imperial Rome. Some sequences are truly anthological, as is the case with the chariot race. The representation of the Roman legionaries influenced for decades the conception that we have, individually, on how they were and fought. The visual and special effects used in the film were the best there was at the time and even today, more than half a century later, they're able to surprise by the realism. The color is vivid and intense, cinematography is truly imposing and accentuates the epic ambiance. As for the cast's work, it's definitely the movie of Charlton Heston's life. He not only became famous with it but made here the most remarkable character of his career. Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Haya Harareet, Martha Scott and Hugh Griffith also shone. It's a long movie, but the audience gets so caught up in it that they don't even feel the time go by. Wonderful!"
"agent_js03","Null","86","167","5 September 2004"," Breath-taking; possible THE perfect movie.
","I think I can safely say that in my opinion, this is the best movie ever made. Its dramatic value is fantastic, and I've never seen a better storyline. The costumes were also incredible. The actors portrayed the best purest form of both ancient Roman and old Judean culture. This film also had quite an emotional effect. The way that Christ's face is never visible nor his voice audible to the audience creates a feeling of reverence to the actual person of Jesus. Lew Wallace also did an amazing job portraying the innocence, kindness, and mercy of Jesus, and his effect on the main character, Judah Ben Hur. Hur's ending quote, ""I felt him take the sword out of my hand"" was a wonderful picture of his changing. I admit, I am a Christian, but even for those who are not this is still a great film. The message boards confirm that. I recognize that there are some people that require constant action to keep their attention. If this is your case, than this movie is not for you, as it has a lot of dialogue. But I recommend this movie 100%."

Almost all human sentiments are represented in the story: joy, sorrow, despair, pride, jealousy, hope, revenge, anger, forgiveness, compassion, redemption, love, hate, friendship, humour, etc, etc. During the three and a half hours it takes for the story to unfold, we see passing by our very eyes just about every example of what constitutes the human condition. What I find even more remarkable in this movie is the fact that Christ is present throughout the entire story, but we don't really see him in the flesh (at the exception of a few scenes, where the Lord is, in fact, in the background) and yet, his spirit and message is ever present through the words and actions of the various characters. It's not for nothing that the complete title of this great story is ""Ben-Hur, a Tale of the Christ"". The movie is well-acted (especially Heston, Griffith, Hawkins and, let's not forget, the wonderful Finley Currie, playing Balthazar), the dialogue is always concise, yet never short of meaning and substance (the way dialogues in movies should be), the decor and settings are just magnificent and the Miklos Rozsa score is simply superb. Besides Quo Vadis (the 1951 version, which, incidentally, I have recommended to those who have also enjoyed Ben-Hur), I cannot think of a better movie about the early days of Christianity than this one. There are others, of course, (The Robe, just to name one), but none has the grandeur and the spectacular dimension of Ben-Hur. It's the movie I would want to watch one last time on my death bed. I gladly and proudly give Ben-Hur a score of 10 out of 10!"

I've heard rumour that one of the charioteers, stunt double or whatever, was killed during the race filming. I don't know.  The movie is intense for people who like a story with depth and meaning and truth.

","It's hard to deny that William Wyler's lavish version of ""Ben-Hur"" is sometimes a bit overdone, but it nevertheless remains an entertaining and worthwhile classic. The material does justify the big-budget approach, since the story contains several interesting themes as well as plenty of action sequences. While some parts could have been stream-lined with little loss, in order to make the movie as a whole flow more smoothly, in general the film as it is keeps a good balance between action and substance. There are some very good dramatic moments in addition to the action highlights.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston is well-cast as Ben-Hur, a role that plays right to his strengths. The strained relations between Ben-Hur and Messala provide one set of themes for the story, as well as driving much of the action. Heston handles his end of it pretty well, although Stephen Boyd could have been a little less static in his portrayal of Messala. Jack Hawkins works very well as Quintus Arrius, and his scenes with Heston are used well in establishing some of the inner workings of Heston's character. Hugh Griffith also has a couple of good scenes as Sheik Ilderim.<br/><br/>The chariot race and other action sequences usually get most of the attention, but there are also some worthwhile ideas in the story (which are really the focus of the original novel) that are developed well enough. There is also a very good silent movie version of ""Ben-Hur"" from 1925, which at times takes a different approach from this version, and which is well worth seeing in itself for those who like the story."

Ben-Hur has all the parts that kept Gladiator from being an unforgettable film. <br/><br/>Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is the young and rich Jewish prince of Jerusalem. He leads a quiet life and enjoys all the luxuries of a 1st century prince. Judah establishes a relationship with Roman soldier Messala (Stephen Boyd) and are happy to meet again years later while Messala commands the new legion moving into Jerusalem. <br/><br/>But after a freak accident, Messala betrays Judah and the prince is sent to the galleys. But Judah never gives up hope and swears he will come back seeking revenge. Chalrton Heston is brilliant, he's a strong lead role, and delivers an unbelievable performance.<br/><br/>Along the path of the story, we are confronted with a variety of biblical characters including: Pontius Pilate, Jesus Christ, Mary, and Balthasar (one of the three wise men). The film is fun overall. It doesn't hold the feeling of a 50's flick but a modern movie. The dialog is pretty good, the acting is at top game, and the sets are amazing for the time.<br/><br/>Above all, the stadium where the chariot races are held and the sea battle are unbelievable. The film makes sense with a message of revenge and forgetting the past. The reason for the extra title 'A Tale of the Christ' pretty much has to do with message (Jesus' character is only in the film for about five minutes).

His old friend, who has spent a few years in Rome, has returned as a commander in Jerusalem. The two of them are happy to see each other again, but they both realized that they have different political opinions. Their political differences and the prince's wealth are causing dissension. A tile on an old roof at the prince's home has broken and nearly killed the new governor. The Roman commander is sure of the prince's innocence, but ....<br/><br/>A story about revenge, love, hate, violence and conflict was enriched with extremely strong emotions and heroic moments. Mr. Wyler has directed the interest on one character, his emotional and spiritual development, in the world of tyranny, hatred and injustice. Biblical elements have remained in the background of the story, but they have a very strong influence on the main melodrama. <br/><br/>Action sequences have offered plenty of excitement, primarily through a spectacular chariot race and an ancient sea battle. Set design is a little masterpiece. The soundtrack is top notch. However, a touching and tense human drama in a specific environment with historical and religious moments is the biggest advantage of this film. This movie is not boring, despite its period of nearly 225 minutes.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur is brisk, proud and upright character. He has acted in some scenes a little inhibited, but Mr. Heston has, in a credible way, presented all the tragedy of his character. Stephen Boyd as Messala was poisoned with an ideology.

Her character has brought a strong religious moment in a melodrama.

","Hollywood, in trying to distance itself from television, produced many epics, several of which were and still are highly acclaimed (ie: The Bridge on the River Kwai, Lawrence of Arabia, The Ten Commandments, etc.). Ben-Hur is the best of the epics, and everything about it seems to define the very genre itself. The sheer scale of the production is nearly unfathomable, but it is not big for the sake of being big, and it never gets lost in itself. Despite the magnificent scope, William Wyler's magnum opus is a remarkably personal tale of friendship, betrayal, revenge, and forgiveness.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, the cinematography is excellent, the pacing is excellent (it never drags throughout its more than three hour running time), Miklos Rozsa's score is a symphonic masterpiece, the religious aspects are treated with great tact and respect, and so much more about this picture reaches the pinnacle of anything Hollywood has ever produced. Perfection is what it takes to win eleven academy awards, and Ben-Hur delivers. If it sounds like I'm gushing unblemished praise on this movie, it's because I am and it deserves it. This film is an absolute must see."
"lasttimeisaw","8","2","2","30 November 2016"," the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era
","The newest iteration of BEN-HUR (2016) made by schlockmeister Timur Bekmambetov crashed and burned in the box-office front, which prompts my belated viewing of this grandiose historical epic under the supervision of William Wyler, the film won him a third Oscar for directing and swept with 11 wins out of its total 12 nominations (only Karl Tunberg lost BEST ADAPTED SCREENPLAY to Jack Clayton's ROOM AT THE TOP).<br/><br/>Adapted from Lew Wallace's 1880 novel, BEN-HUR: A TALE OF THE Christ, this Hollywood juggernaut opens with the birth of Jesus Christ, jand condones quite a chunk of time in padding out the Calvary crucification after the iconic chariot racing money shot (which partially explains its drawn-out length, running up to 212 minutes), vehemently gets its feet wet as a Christianity- moralizing tale by casting J.C. as the Messiah who literally saves our hero Judas Ben-Hur (Heston) from perishing during his trials and tribulations, and jumps the shark in its miraculous ending, gratifyingly throws humankind's fate under the omnipresence's whims, which gives a staid aftertaste. <br/><br/>The main plot is of course, about Judas, a wealthy Jewish prince in Jerusalem, AD 26, falls foul of his childhood friend, now a Roman tribune, Messala (Boyd), who swears allegiance to the Roman Empire, and fails to rope the freedom-advocating Judas into joining his side. Under Messala's cunning malfeasance out of a mere accident, Judas is sentenced to toil in the galleys whilst his mother Miriam (Scott) and sister Tirzah (O'Connell) are cooped up in prison. Revenge is the mainspring behind Judas' odyssey from a galley slave to an heir of the childless Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Hawkins), it is hatred that keeps his head above water against adversity, alert to a golden window to enact his exit strategy and he even magnanimously hatches a son-father rapport with the tyrannical Arrius. This is the thorny knot in the otherwise rather Manichaean racial feud depicted in the story, how far one can go to love your enemy? Which remains a quintessential challenge for those who endorse Christianity, and the film could have delved deeper into Judas' psyche on that issue, yet, Arrius wholly disappears from the narrative after the mid-stream, and he merely functions as a springboard to Judas' glorious homecoming with his rehabilitation, reunion and rediscovery. At the end of the day, justice belatedly prevails, but Judas still gets all shaken up in the aftermath, revenge might keep him alive but it is religion that gives him the ultimate peace.<br/><br/>For what it's worth, BEN-HUR's visual spectacle still holds water to an awe-inspiring amazement and thrill, it is a historic accomplishment not just because of its cutting-edge technicalities but also for the staggering manpower it strenuously deploys, the film itself is a panegyric of human's creativity, which is something no dissenter can take away. <br/><br/>Romans are played by a crop of top-notch British thespians, whilst Jews are mostly impersonated by Americans, although how come Hugh Griffith's ludicrously swarthy portrayal of the Arabic Sheik can walk off with that Oscar statute still eludes me, he is not even the top-pick among the supporting cast in the film, both Hawkins and Boyd can easily upstage him with their more engaging agent and emotive bravura, especially the latter, truly deserves at least an Oscar nomination which usurped by Griffith. That is not to say, Heston wins his Oscar all fair and square, but at least one can understand the logic, Heston has a dominating role whacked by an unimaginable baptism of fire, he is undeniably sympathetic and mostly affective with a very theatrical flair. An unsung heroine, is Israeli beauty Haya Harareet's divine presence as Esther, the daughter of Judah's former slave Simonides (Jaffe), and Judah's sweetheart, who livens up the scenes whenever poignancy comes into play, a classic godsend. <br/><br/>When all is said and done, BEN-HUR is the apotheosis of mainstream studio production in Hollywood's Golden Era, its phenomenal scale, its breathtaking grandeur and the imposingly plangent score by Miklós Rózsa can unnerve any redux project even tries to emulate its success, and furthermore, its ""revenge is never the cure"" message can earnestly transcend any religious persuasions and reach to a broader demography out of its faith-base home-turf."
"mmallon4","10","2","2","16 June 2016"," When In Rome...
","Metro Goldwyn Mayer hadn't created a production this big since Gone with The Wind some twenty years earlier. Ben-Hur was created with the intent of lifting the studio out of financial trouble, yet somehow along the way art managed to be created. With the gloriously pompous opening credits set to the backdrop of The Creation of Adam by Michelangelo and the booming horns of Miklos Rozsa's score, the stage is set. During the early scenes of Ben-Hur, I get the satisfaction of knowing that everything in front of the camera is real and had to be assembled, such as every single extra in those trails of Roman soldiers which go back as far as the eye can see. Ben-Hur was William Wyler's Cecil B. DeMille picture, well certainly thematically. Technologically Ben-Hur is an incredibly different film to those made by DeMille. The films of DeMille's where largely staged despite their epic scope which does work in its own way and while I'm not trying to dismiss The Ten Commandments (it is my favourite biblical epic) it can't be denied Wyler is a far superior craftsman and that comes through in Ben-Hur; his filling of the frame is more rich and vibrant with a great sense of depth of field. At nearly four hours long, Ben-Hur is the perfect example of how to pace a movie of long length; it feels shorter than it is.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur was only one of a handful of movies shot using the MGM Camera 65; an extremely wide aspect ratio. The wide lens is not just for grand sweeping shots, it helps make the intimate, close up moments more immense and make the actors more godlike. Any close up of only one actor in the middle of the frame with an out of focus background looks majestic. Ben-Hur seems to be a movie largely remembered for just its spectacle, which is a shame. It is also a movie of rich layered vibrancy, evoking the senses and full of emotion.<br/><br/>The story also includes that age-old idea of one's destiny being by a seemingly insignificant event. If that tile didn't fall off the roof during the Roman parade and killed the governor then things may have turned out very differently. I also love Jack Hawkins' words of ""You have the spirit to fight back, but a good sense to control it"", and ""(hate) That's good, hate keeps a man alive; it gives him strength""; two more additions to my book of life advice from movie quotes.<br/><br/>People will be quick to dismiss Charlton Heston as a ham actor. He's a classically trained actor, over the top and boisterous at times (in a good way) but so was Laurence Oliver yet everyone gives him a free pass; I guess when you're the star of mainstream, blockbuster films then you don't garner as much respect. The style of acting is not everyone's cup of tea, but I relish in it.<br/><br/>One of the reasons why the famous chariot race is so great is because the action is real; people were actually put in danger's way for the creation of art. There is no music during the race; just primarily the sound effects of the chariots and horses storming across the ground with the cheers from the immense crowd of spectators nor was any rear screen projections used; it's all the real deal. The filmmakers brought 2,000 years ago back to life; nine minutes of cinema history in which your eyes are truly glued to the screen; the chariot race is one of the reasons why the 1959 film version of Ben-Hur will always be the definitive version. If anyone thinks they can do a chariot race which is better then they are fooling themselves. Imagine if Hollywood remade Ben-Hur with a CGI chariot race, that would be really awful, wouldn't it? Oh wait, never mind. The ship battle sequence on the other hand, while superb I do feel the battle in the 1925 version of Ben-Hur is more effective in which lifeboats full of extras were used rather than the remake's use of miniatures and rear projection shots. Not to mention the 1925 sequence is more brutal, with people being tied to the front of ships and snakes are catapulted into enemy boats.<br/><br/>Even as someone who is not religious I can't deny the power of the film's religious moments such as the scene of Jesus giving Judah water and the Roman guard being unable to whip him, and even the birth of Jesus appears very dreamlike. Even the use of miracles as a device to resolve plot points doesn't hurt my enjoyment of the film such as the section of the movie at the Leper colony; a powerful and disturbing pair of sequences in which people segregated from the rest of society with a debilitating illness. Yet is it not an easy way out when the leprosy of Judah's mother and sister are cured instantly via a miracle? Regardless, such use of Deus Ex Machina does not hurt my enjoyment of Ben-Hur."

","General Lew Wallace, a somewhat controversial commander of the Union forces in the Civil War happened to be on a train with Robert Ingersoll, noted atheist in the 19th century. Wallace was a moderately religious man and attempted to debate Ingersoll. The story has it that Ingersoll whipped him to a frazzle and Wallace knew it. But he resolved to study the Bible and learn about his faith so that he would be better prepared.<br/><br/>He never got to debate Ingersoll again, but Wallace got so immersed in religion that he decided to put that knowledge to use. While he was Territorial Governor of New Mexico and while he wasn't dealing with the Lincoln County War and the hunting down of Billy the Kid, he spent his spare time creating what became the widest selling work of fiction in his century, Ben-Hur, A Tale of the Christ.<br/><br/>He did his research well. Judah Ben-Hur and his mother and sister are descended from a very ancient family of Hebrew nobility. The founder of this house was Hur who in the Bible was the husband of Miriam who was Moses's sister. Hur pops up as a peripheral character during the whole story of the Exodus. He invested the characters that Charlton Heston, Martha Scott, and Cathy O'Donnell play with a heroic lineage which makes their fall all the more tragic.<br/><br/>So on the consciousness of the public were the Hur family that one often thinks of them as real people. Case in point, many years ago a teacher of mine wanted to demonstrate how many true characters Charlton Heston played on the screen. I count 15 in his list of credits on IMDb, some he's played in more than one film or television show. Inevitably more than just one person named Ben-Hur as a real character. A tribute to the timelessness of the character and to Charlton Heston's abilities as actor.<br/><br/>The story is that Heston and his family greet an old friend newly arrived back in Judea province, Messala who is now a tribune. Messala played by Stephen Boyd, is one ambitious fellow and he wants Heston to rat out potential leaders of rebellion in this most unruly of Roman provinces. Heston refuses.<br/><br/>The next day Boyd frames an incident where a piece of old tile accidentally falls from the Hur family home while the new Judean governor is passing by into an assassination attempt. Scott and O'Donnell are thrown in prison and Heston is sentenced to the galleys. The story is then Ben-Hur's adventures in trying to get back to Judea and set things right.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur meets a whole host of people who aid him in his endeavor. Jack Hawkins as a commander of the galley fleet he's serving on, Finlay Currie as Balthazar one of the Three Wise Men now seeking the child whose birth he witnessed in the year Anno Domini, Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim whose horses Ben-Hur races.<br/><br/>It's not often mentioned, but among the Oscars collected for this most honored film, besides the ones that the film itself, Wyler, and Heston won, was Hugh Griffith's for Best Supporting Actor. His Arab sheik is a blustering, but very wise and compassionate fellow. The events of this film are taking place some six centuries before the Prophet Mohammed arrived on the scene. The Arab people at that time were involved in a hedonistic animist kind of religion, but it's left up in the air that they might turn Christian. Certainly some of them did and some are Christian to this day as the country of Lebanon attests.<br/><br/>Griffith had the wildest pair of eyes in film history next to Jack Elam's and he used them to great effect. Watch his expressions during the film, they're what got him the Oscar.<br/><br/>Stephen Boyd also got rave notices for the evil Messala. When he's not stepping on people to move up in Roman politics, Messala likes to race chariots. During his odyssey Ben-Hur becomes a charioteer and the climax of the film is the thrilling chariot race that turns into a race for survival. You'll see in the film, Messala doesn't exactly play by Marquis of Queensbury rules for charioteers. Boyd did some leads after Ben-Hur, but never really took as a hero. But he was one grand villain.<br/><br/>While Ben-Hur is a prisoner being led to the galleys the Roman prison convoy stops in a town called Nazareth and a carpenter faces down a Roman guard to give the thirsting Ben-Hur a drink of water. The two men go their separate ways, Ben-Hur's is described in the book by Lew Wallace, the carpenter's way in the first four books of the New Testament. Later on after Ben-Hur discovers his mother and sister and what's become of them, they hear about Jesus of Nazareth, a rabbi with a message of hope and reputation for miracles. <br/><br/>Of course when they seek Jesus it's when He's just been tried and condemned and on the way to the cross. It's now Ben-Hur's turn to offer the carpenter a drink of water on the way, to show his trust and faith. And as the sky darkens and Jesus breathes his last, the film depicts what the New Testament describes as the blackest day in Earth's history. But even at that point Heston's new found faith is rewarded, a miracle at the point of death. What was the miracle, for that you buy the DVD or wait until Ben-Hur is on television.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur should really be seen in a theater, even a letter box version doesn't do justice to the chariot race or the sea battle with pirates.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur is the story of two paths, one of vengeance and one of faith. Our protagonist tries his way and in the end realizes the path of faith is the more rewarding."

","The epic BEN-HUR characterizes the highest epochs of emotional expression while vividly and forcefully depicting most subtle human values, sentiments and the fighting spirit as displayed during times of turmoil and upheaval.<br/><br/>Besides the screenplay, cinematography and music match utopian standards of perfection. Miklos Rozsa has choreographed the traumatic flow of events with such a touching/revealing music score that enlivens the soul of all and sundry.<br/><br/>The spectacular chariot race is a memorable and perfect piece of action ever to be filmed. In all its grandeur, the good thing is that Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did most of their chariot racing by themselves except for a few dangerous stunts. The somersault of Ben Hur's chariot over the two fallen chariots is performed by (Chariot Action Director)Yakima Canutt's son Joe, who got slightly injured in his chin during the tossing over scene from the chariot's bogey. William Wyler has refuted any claims of a fatal casualty happening during the filming of this 11 minute spectacle.<br/><br/>The screen presence of the lead actors (Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins) playing the characters of Judah Ben-Hur, Messala and Quint Aries is so deeply imbued with the cinematic flow of tumultuous events and coupled with excellent music and cinematography that the audience are bound to be hypnotized with its magnetic appeal unless a viewer has a puerile or immature imagination.<br/><br/>BEN-HUR was filmed in 1958, released in 1959 and the story relates to a period, two thousand years back in time. However, the viewers will never loose its captivating and spellbinding appeal which circumvents mankind's quintessential values namely, hope and misery, faith and tyranny, humility and cruelty, forbearance and revenge, love and hatred and disease and death.<br/><br/>The immense scope and scale of BEN-HUR can never be under-rated, although, it requires a deep insight for a keen eye to explore a most intricate play of historical drama depicted in this biblical epic.<br/><br/>SOME WORDS ABOUT WILLIAM WYLER :<br/><br/>What I can best say about Wyler is that he was a complete film making institution in his own person. He had the keen imagination and skill to effectively craft and portray sublimely moving and sentimental scenes which resonate the latent emotions and evocative thoughts of the audience.<br/><br/>Moreover, he nurtured an excellent ability to translate symbolic emotional expression in an academic manner on the tinsel screen thereby at times, crafting spectacular melodramatic sequences that happen to be a valuable asset of the motion picture industry.<br/><br/>Unlike, Hitchcock, he did not concentrate on picturing sudden/unusual/paranoid and metaphysical events to form the bedrock of his cinematic genius. Instead, he always focused on the more real-to-life human values while eying the big picture and rendered a forceful moral bottom line to enthrall the audience. Last but not the least, Wyler was able to craft a historically spectacular movie, which could not be equaled in its excellence by any director/producer up till now, in spite of handy computer effects/graphics and the many breakthroughs in filming techniques."

","This spectacle stands alone. It has never been matched before or since its release. It emerged amid the corny, cheesy, overacted, holier than thou biblical epics of the fifties and doesn't resemble any of them. Its characters were contemporary; none of that vacant ""holy"" look that permeated the genre. Charlton Heston was never better; his propensity for overacting reigned in. Stephen Boyd was the epitome of the hateful villain in his role as Mesalla. His seething hatred and lack of personal character was conveyed perfectly.<br/><br/>The chariot race was the greatest cinematic achievement in history. It was flawless, from the cavernous arena where the race took place to the breathtaking spectacle of teams of four horses running flat out without a hint of background music. It was pure realism - white knuckle, riveting, terrifying realism. What an achievement in direction and editing to give the impression of a seamless sequence of jaw dropping action. The crashes, the brutality, the beauty of the horses; nothing compares.<br/><br/>The sea battle was better than anything attempted in the realm of pitched battle at sea. The galley slaves, chained to their positions as their ship is rammed, was unforgettable.<br/><br/>This beautiful cinematic masterpiece was perfectly cast,had a triumphant, inspiring score, had pageantry that captured the glory of Rome, and ultimately inspired Christians with its reverent portrayal of Christ from birth until crucifixion. Yet, it wouldn't have worked without Charlton Heston - perfectly cast and displaying a command of acting rarely seen on the screen - subtle, powerful, explosive; unbelievable. Ben Hur - in a class by itself."

","I have seen this piece of work many times over the years, and each time it seems, I have come away with something more. This is Heston at his best, and he brings out the best in the supporting cast. The scene where Ben Hur is offered a drink of water from Christ after coming out of the desert is as powerful as any I have watched in any movie, and using an angle that never show's the face of Christ seems to make it more remarkable. The movie is so well acted and crafted that the lack of special effects technology available at the time only makes this effort more amazing. What elevates this movie is the story told around the time of the Crucifixion, and interpreting that event into the storyline so as not to be preachy, yet the message is clear. Well worth the time to see it again."

","""Ben-Hur"" (1959) is a classic and undeniable epic from the golden years of Hollywood. If you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>Ben-Hur checks in at about three and a half hours. It is long. There is a lot of set-up and a lot of dialogue. However, more than just being simply excessive, Ben-Hur rarely feels unnecessary or tedious. Both scenes and people have a point, and they are enough nuanced and interesting for the movie to captivate and spellbind throughout the entire runtime. Make time for it, and give the movie the whole of the afternoon or evening that it needs. There is an intermission halfway through to take a breath.<br/><br/>The production value of Ben-Hur is matched by few other movies and is on level with the Lord of the Rings and Titanic. It is massive, epic, and it feels real (the few effects present are of a surprisingly high quality as well!). The stunts are stunning and the stages jaw-dropping, and locations are consistently on point. The sound is great as well. The more you can spoil these attributes with a great sound and screen, the more you will be favored in return.<br/><br/>The movie, nevertheless, features a strong, Christian vibe which certifies Jesus as the Savior and Son of God. Depending on one's attitude to religious elements, this can be either a great addition or a subtracting nuisance, especially since this element features a lot of the movie's resolution.<br/><br/>So, in all, Ben-Hur is a brilliant, awe-inspiring epic which however feature strong Christian elements in its extensive runtime. It is a lot, but if you can take a lot in, this is a thrill sure to leave an impression.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a magnificent 10/10.

At the time this was easily the most expensive film that had ever been made, and it shows.<br/><br/>Yes, movie-making is a different thing these days and the expectations of the audience are different too. Some folk will say this film is too long, but apparently the first cut of this film was about twice as long; I don't say this of many films but I would like to see that version too! I don't think there is a duffer in the cast, and the film (in restored form) with few exceptions looks and sounds really good even by modern standards. Obviously the chariot race is a standout moment.<br/><br/>I didn't notice at first but Stephen Boyd's eyes are naturally blue; he wore brown contacts to contrast with CH's eyes. Wyler only reluctantly accepted the job, probably for the wrong reasons, too. He wanted not to make the film in widescreen; I can't believe it would have turned out so well had he got his way.<br/><br/>Yes some of the points are hammered home with a blunt instrument, but this is truly an Epic Film, worthy of inclusion in anyone's top-ten-of-all-time list.

","William Wyler's Presentation of Ben-Hur (1959) is by far the purest form of entertainment that I have ever seen! The great sea-battle and chariot race is by far what makes this film so epic in both scope and scale. The Acting, Production, Directing, Screen writing, Cinematography, Editing and Art Direction/Set Decoration are incredible. It cleaned up the Awards for a good reason. What makes it even more powerful and unique are the scenes that show Christ, but not his face (and voice neither heard).<br/><br/>The movie is not only a Biblical Epic like Cecil B. DeMille's ""The Ten Commandments"", but it is perhaps the first time we as an audience, have to observe the film from an artistic perspective, rather than being exposed to the entire message. The film moved me on many levels when I first watched in 2014, with both my Mother and later my Grandmother. Wyler puts us in a position where the film's main concept functions in both ways, both by listening and watching. The relationship between Messala and Judah Ben-Hur is a familiar parallel to the Civil War battles between the North and South, Ben- Hur's slavery at the Galley of Rowers is also similar to that issue with the South back in the time.<br/><br/>The Film expresses its' meanings on many different levels, whether if it be on the topics of politics, faith, corruption, and friendship. For a 3 hr. Epic, This movie is worth the time. This is my all-time Number one Favorite Film!"

The basis of the story of the family of Hur, is of power, injustice, revenge and forgiveness; it mirrors the same 'four horseman' of the American Civil War.<br/><br/>The Karl Tunberg's screen adaptation of classic, follows Wallace's novel rather well (In case you haven't read it) and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer's spectacular investment in extras and scenery create an epic Hollywood masterpiece.<br/><br/>Ben Hur is Cinema 101.

","A perennial Xmas favourite on TV during my childhood, spectacular biblical epic Ben-Hur opens with the birth of Jesus: manger, star, wise men, shepherds... the whole nine yards. Those TV programmers knew what they were doing.<br/><br/>The film then scoots to XXVI A.D.-Jesus is now a grown man doing God's work; meanwhile, Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (played by distinctly non-Jewish blue-eyed hunk Charlton Heston) is reunited with his Roman childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who has just been appointed tribune of Judea. Messala, desperate to keep the Jews under control, asks Judah to help him quell any potential rebellion, but his friend refuses to betray his people. As a result, the pair part as enemies.<br/><br/>This animosity proves problematic for Judah when his sister accidentally knocks a roof tile onto the Roman governor as he arrives in town. Seizing an opportunity to make an example of the influential Hur family, Messala sends Judah's mother and sister to jail, and has Judah thrown into slavery as a rower on the Roman galleys. After several years of 'battle speed', 'attack speed', ramming speed' and 'warp speed', Judah earns his freedom by saving the life of a Roman consul during a sea battle. Returning home, Judah searches for his mother and sister, seeks revenge on Messala, and has a profound encounter with Jesus of Nazareth.<br/><br/>In the wrong hands, Ben-Hur could have been an epic bore, but director William Wyler proves himself more than worthy of the task, commanding great dramatic performances from his superb cast, and mounting some stunning action scenes, the highlight being the film's iconic chariot race, a breathtaking piece of cinema that still holds up as one of the most exciting sequences ever committed to film. Every last cent of the massive $15,900,000 budget is up there on the screen, with impressive sets, excellent production design and a cast of thousands. Miklós Rózsa's wonderful score complements the action perfectly, the deserved winner of one of the film's eleven Oscars.<br/><br/>Sadly, Ben-Hur no longer pops up on TV every Christmas, meaning that it's probably not found much of a new audience in recent years-a shame, because it really is worthy of any film fan's time-all three and a half hours of it!"

A much overrated actor who overacts at every opportunity and becomes quite tiresome.  Fortunately, there was so much more in Ben-Hur, that his overacting goes unnoticed.

"zetes","7","13","29","14 July 2002"," Weak with a couple of great set pieces and one great performance
","For a long while, I've described Ben-Hur as the biggest film that I had not yet seen. Now I have. This is one of those classics whose status has been fading with time, and it's no wonder once you've seen the film. Sure, there are a few scenes that are very memorable, and have become part of our common culture. Who can forget the scenes where Judah Ben-Hur is a slave in the galleys, rowing fiercely as the weaker slaves collapse around him? The music in this scene is what I find particularly memorable. And then there's the chariot race, which I think cements this film as one that is worth seeing more than any other. I also like how the story is constructed, as a side story to the life of Jesus. Christ pops up every once in a while. Early in the film, there is a memorable scene where Christ defies a Roman soldier and gives the parched Ben-Hur water. When the soldier tries to reprimand him, a quick look from Jesus silences him completely. Unfortunately, a whole hell of a lot of the film is very forgettable. Each scene seems to take 25% longer than it really needs to  not only are the scenes protracted far beyond their limitations, but the actors stumble slowly through their lines, as if each and every syllable was carrying the cross on its back. It gets old, and quick. The film has very little passion as it lumbers along. Most of the direction seems lackluster. Big, but mostly lacking heart. William Wyler directed one of the most emotionally touching films of all time, Mrs. Miniver, an utterly intimate affair that will stay with me forever. Ben-Hur often just sat there without trying to connect to the audience at all. The acting itself is generally weak. Charlton Heston's performance is certainly not among his best. I actually like him as an actor, but I don't think it's very good here. To be fair, his performance gets better as the film moves along. Ben-Hur's moral dilemma is intriguing, and as his desire for revenge and violence did ultimately touch me. Many of the other performances are just bad  the one that comes immediately to mind is Haya Harareet as Esther, the slave girl whom Ben-Hur loves and later marries. Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell, who play his mother and sister respectively, are too dull to really care too much what happens to them. And I'm disappointed in Sam Jaffe, whom I love as an actor in films such as The Scarlet Empress and Gunga Din. I didn't even recognize him, he has so little energy in this film. Hugh Griffith won an Oscar for playing a sheik, but his character is not memorable at all. The only actor who really hits a home run is Stephen Boyd as Messala, Ben-Hur's childhood friend, now his bitterest enemy. He really projects his inner turmoil. Overall, I say that I am glad that I saw this finally. It may have not worked very well, but I was generally entertained. Not moved at all, but it was nice to watch (and a lot more fun to criticize!). Only the chariot sequence and a couple of Messala's scenes did anything more than that for me. 6/10."
"hall895","6","17","41","29 July 2010"," Perhaps too epic for its own good
","We begin with the birth of Jesus. And then we leave Jesus behind as we spend three and a half hours following the story of Judah Ben-Hur. Subtitle notwithstanding this is not ""A Tale of the Christ"". Oh Jesus pops up now and again for a few brief moments. But this is a tale of Ben-Hur. So who is this Ben-Hur fellow? Well he's a man whose life's journey goes something along the lines of wealthy Jew in Jerusalem turned galley slave turned adopted son of Roman nobleman turned champion chariot racer. Well that certainly sounds like an exciting life. But the way the story is presented doesn't make for a particularly exciting movie. This movie is quite a slog. 212 long, long, long minutes. And the sad reality is it didn't have to be this way. The movie could have so easily been streamlined to great effect. So many scenes that go on so much longer than they have to. So much time utterly wasted. This movie could have clocked in at two and a half hours without losing anything important. Instead what we get is a potentially fascinating story which, in the way it is told, ends up being somewhat monotonous. There are good reasons nobody makes three-plus hour biblical epics anymore.<br/><br/>This is a movie which has its moments but there is a lot of tedium along the way. The most famous sequence is of course the undeniably exciting chariot race. But even that scene serves as an example of the ways in which the movie goes wrong. The race itself is a little long but we can forgive that as by this point in the story we're looking for all the excitement we can get. But the wait for the race to actually start is interminable. The buildup as we wait for the chariots to get to the starting line goes on forever and a day. Just the most obvious example of a sequence which serves no purpose other than to bring the film's momentum to an abrupt halt. Honestly, was director William Wyler being paid by the minute? This movie screams out for an editor with the freedom to slice and dice this thing down to size. But alas that was not to be.<br/><br/>I suppose one has to make allowances for the time in which a movie is made. Ben-Hur clearly is a film with a style which plays much better in 1959 than it does today. It's big and grand and epic. But in so many ways too big and grand and epic for its own good. It certainly looks spectacular, making it easy to see how awards for cinematography, costume design and set decoration were among the slew of Oscars which came this film's way. It's understandable that Charlton Heston would get an Oscar for his challenging task of carrying the film over it's endless running time. I'm still trying to figure out what Hugh Griffith did to get a supporting actor Oscar though. You can see how the pieces were there to make a potentially great film. And you can see why upon its initial release it was in fact lauded as a great film. But it's not 1959 anymore. Time has been less kind to this ""great film"" than others of its period. In the end the movie suffers because it refuses to end. On and on and on it goes. Brief moments of excitement, long stretches of boredom. Even after the great climax of the chariot race the movie just won't stop. We get a good old-fashioned leprosy storyline which is about as appealing and entertaining as you would imagine it to be. And finally, and I do mean finally, Jesus shows up again to bookend the proceedings. No prizes for guessing how the Jesus story turns out. As for the Ben-Hur story it's one which had the potential to entertain and inspire. But the story's impact is dulled by the way in which it was told.

","Ben Hur is interesting on a number of counts today, if you FF through the chariot race. <br/><br/>It's fun to watch the reunion between Messala and Ben Hur from the point of view that they were once lovers (as Stephen Boyd but NOT Charlton Heston was allegedly coached to perform it). <br/><br/>The religiosity is amusing: If you laughed at Life of Brian, you'll instantly recognise its roots in many scenes of Ben Hur (just don't expect them to sing during the crucifixion).  Jesus is always shown from behind and never speaks, but we know it's Him by the long blow-dried brown hair and the white robe. And anything symbolic, like the spear into the Crossed beams, or the Giving of Water, is always taken at a snail's pace so you won't miss it. The Magus Balthazar delivering distinctly KJV Pauline atonement theology during the crucifixion is also a hoot. You want to say, ""Wait up, He hasn't risen yet!""<br/><br/>The other interesting factor is the very 1959 political slant. We have Heston denouncing informers, a swing at McCarthy and the Hollywood people who Named Names. And of course we have Heston standing up for freedom and brave little Judea against big bad Rome. But what's this? When Messala defends Rome, he says things like ""Our culture spans the earth!"" and ""You are either for us or against us!""  He sounds a lot like You Know Who - but more articulate."

","Simply put this movie deserves each and every Oscar that it won, and more. One wonders whether, if it was put to the Oscars today whether it would have easily wiped the floor with Titanic, but that is beside the point, Ben Hur is one of the best movies that I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The subtitle of this movie is 'a story about the Christ' and as you watch this movie it becomes quite clear how this is so. To put it better, it is a movie about the Christ as seen through the eyes of Judah Ben Hur. Ben Hur (Charlton Heston) is a Jewish noble who is torn between his loyalties to his people and his duty to Rome. Every time he is faced with that choice, he chooses his people, and in doing so tends to make enemies of Rome. His first enemy is Masala, a Roman diplomat in Jerusalem, and when his sister accidentally knocks a roof tile onto a Roman dignitary, he is arrested and sold as a slave. While traveling through the desert on his way to Ceserea to be put onto a slave galley he meets a man in the wilderness who gives him water.<br/><br/>However, to cut a very long story short, he saves the captains life during a battle with pirates, and is made a freeman. He then returns to Jerusalem where he confronts Masala in the famous chariot race, and wins. However, he discovers that his family have been outcast as lepers and rages against Rome. But this rage is tempered through the teachings of Christ, and the movie concludes with him sitting at the foot of the cross watching Jesus die.<br/><br/>Water plays a significant role in this movie. Christ gives him water in the desert which enables him to survive. His life is again saved when he is on the water after the slave master frees him from his chains. When he watches Christ go to the cross, he attempts to return the favour by giving him water, and when Christ dies, rain falls from the heavens in a ferocious storm.<br/><br/>Ben Hur is about the rage that overwhelms us, and the freedom that Christ gives us from this rage. Ben Hur is torn by betrayal. He was betrayed by Masala when he was sold as a slave, and he was betrayed by Rome when his mother and sister where thrown into the leper colonies. He is further betrayed by Rome when he takes his mother and sister to see Christ only to find that he has been sentenced to death.<br/><br/>I wish to finish with a discussion on how Christ is portrayed in this movie. You never see his face and you never hear him speak. We always see him at a distance, or from behind. His words do not come directly from him, but are passed on by his faithful followers. However, it is the words about not seeking revenge that take the center stage in Ben Hur because it is Ben Hur's desire for revenge that is destroying him. He is a friend of Rome, but he is in danger of alienating them once again through his love for the family that he has lost."
"MartinHafer","10","7","14","28 December 2006"," If you're going to watch one Biblical epic, this is the one
","It's odd, but during the 1950s, Hollywood made a huge number of Biblical epics--most of which were pretty wretched films. SAMSON AND DELILAH and David AND BATHSHEBA quickly come to mind, but even the more respected TEN COMMANDMENTS was, despite all the hype, a pretty lousy film--with cardboard characters and silly writing. Even QUO VADIS was a pretty uninspired film, despite the violent nature of the film. So, in light of this, I am so happy to say that a Biblical epic CAN be exceptional and worth seeing! <br/><br/>What makes BEN-HUR so worth while? Well, of course the film does contain some of the very greatest (if not the greatest) action scenes of all-time. You just can't do better than the unbelievable chariot race sequence for excitement and spectacle. Even the naval battle scene is great despite it being filmed with large models--it's state of the art for the time it was made. In addition to the spectacle, it also handles the religious aspects of the film in a less heavy-handed manner than most of its contemporaries. You do see Jesus from behind throughout the film and you do not hear him speak--instead, the film focuses on Jesus' teachings on others. And, while they do not show the resurrection, you are not left with the impression that he stayed dead like the 1925 version--a definite No-No for a Biblical film! <br/><br/>Now as for the acting, it was generally exceptional--especially from Steven Boyd, Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith. I also liked Charlton Heston in the title role, but I could see how some might see this performance as a bit more wooden. Also, there are times (especially at the very beginning and end) where the pacing is just too slow. However, given the exceptional nature of the film on every other level, this can easily be forgiven and the film is a truly magnificent work--not to be missed by any true fan of film."
"hammond423","Null","7","14","30 August 2001"," Just the the Roman Empire: Ruined by Christianity
","When I first began to watch Ben-Hur I found myself expecting to see an epic tale of vengeance, but found myself surprised with the Christian themes that ran throughout the film. I felt that these themes did not work very well with the main idea of the movie. (Being Judah's quest for justice against Messala) This tale of vengeance is expertly told, as is Judah's exile and eventual rise to power. That is what makes this film simply one of the finest I had ever seen. The chariot race is one the greatest scenes ever filmed. I found myself utterly enthralled by the first 2 1/2, 3 hours of the film. However after the Chariot race, the film began to appeal less and less to me as its direction began to turn more and more Christian, and consequently more and more hokey. The film simply should not have had a happy ending! I just shook my head when Judah's mother and sister were cured of leprosy, and the final shot of the Sheppard with ""halleluiah!"" blasting, was hokey at best. The ending totally destroys Judah's image as a tragic hero, at least in the classical sense. I hated to see such an amazing movie, one truly ahead of its time to be ruined by these, frankly, cheesy Christian moments. Just like the Roman Empire: destroyed by Christianity."
"gazzo-2","Null","7","14","2 September 2002"," It's great. It holds up for the most part. Worthy of it's rep.
","I was quite impressed. You have all the typical Epic flick cliches there-3-4 hour length, guys like Jack Hawkins in supporting roles, big time historical battles(this time at sea), and of course some over-arching theme-Christ-running throughout. Quite good all in all.<br/><br/>Heston was Fine as Judah. Name me someone better from that time-Mitchum? Wayne? Hudson? Heck I saw a screen test of Cesare Danova (w/ LESLIE NIELSON!!) in the two lead roles tacked on at the end-it goes to show ya just how good and commanding a presence Heston had in '59. Those guys just didn't come close.<br/><br/>Sure some of this is dated-it's pacing does flag in the domestic moments, there is one too many trips to the leper colony, and just who was the silent bald guy, George the Animal Steele? He just kinda lurks around like 'Oddjob' in Goldfinger, darned if I know....<br/><br/>I was also surprised that the chariot race was Not the finale, instead you have Christ, the healings and etc at the end. But ya know what-that is Good. It follows the arc of the storyline-Christ gives Ben Hur water near the beginning, and when Christ needs it at the end, Ben Hur returns the favor. Somehow I found this if anything to be quite fitting indeed. Today's flix-ala Gladiator-woulda just finished with the Chariot Race. No bravery.<br/><br/>I saw this line in a prior review here-' Just like the Roman Empire: destroyed by Christianity'.  That is Kookoo in the extreme, both in terms of the movie AND history. This movie works Because there is more to it than just a chariot race and a revenge plot. And as far's Rome falling due to Christianity-that is bad history put out by Enlightenment historians ala Gibbons who had an axe to grind with Christianity and didn't mind monkeying with the facts. If Christianity caused the fall of Rome-then please explain why the Byzantine Empire-it's Eastern Half-was still a grade A superpower in the 1000's.

"bbhlthph","8","5","9","9 June 2006"," Buy the Collector's Series DVD and watch both versions!
","The re-mastered Collector's Series DVD of 'Ben Hur' released last year provides the reason I am adding to the many comments already posted for this film. It is still not widely appreciated that this DVD includes beautifully re-mastered copies of both the 1959 widescreen classic and the 1925 silent version for comparison - a wonderful acquisition for anyone interested in the history of film. This 1925 film was a crowning glory of the silent film era but for a long time was seldom screened, although it now appears on TCM occasionally. Comparing the two versions provides a fascinating insight into the development of the American film industry. <br/><br/>The ongoing efforts by Hollywood to produce biblical or religious epics seems difficult to understand. Started pre-WW1, it still continues. (The last was probably Mel Gibson's ""The Passion of the Christ"" in 2004, but films such as ""The DaVinci Code"" remain closely related.) These films involve great risks - little could be more quickly fatal to a Studio than a perception that it supports one particular theological viewpoint rather than another. Religious films have to appeal about equally to viewers who are orthodox,, catholic, protestant, agnostic or atheist in their personal beliefs. Today there will also be concerns about offending other religious beliefs. A Director has to be chosen, sensitive to these concerns, and able to produce a film that appeals to all groups. When satisfied that its production will not be repugnant to major groups of viewers, the Studio has to sign up a cast happy with the proposed script, and capable of working together without undue friction. This is true of every film, but religious beliefs are very fundamental. Asking an actor who hates the existence of firearms to take the part of a gunman, is significantly different to asking him to accept a role which conflicts with fundamental personal beliefs. After a film has been made, its success may be seriously prejudiced if a major religious group decides it would be harmful to the convictions of their adherents and should be boycotted. Equally trouble will ensue if a public perception develops that it is deliberately intended to support one religious group at the expense of another. Studio executives must mull over these concerns before any such film is given the green light, and very carefully weigh the expected commercial benefits against the associated risks. Although such films continue to appear, they were most common in the 1950's and 60's and 'Ben Hur' was released right in the middle of this period. It was commissioned when the MGM Studio was in serious financial difficulties and needed to produce a major financial and artistic success to retain its prominence in Hollywood. The Studio decided to re-create their 1925 silent film of Ben Hur with sound and entirely in colour. At this time colour TV was seriously affecting attendances at movie houses, so it decided (in my view unfortunately) to push the anthropomorphic lenses of the time to the limit by using the extreme aspect ratio of 2.76 to 1. They fortunately recognised that technological gimmicks alone would not generate market success, so both the Director and the cast had to be outstanding, and money had to be no object. Ultimately it was William Wyler's selection as Director which probably saved the studio - several other experienced directors could have produced a comparable epic, but Wyler had an almost unique ability both to draw exceptional performances out of all the actors in his cast, and to create exceptionally well rounded characters. The cultural differences between Roman and Hebrew characters was brought out in a subtle way by using British actors for the latter and American actors for the former. Only in retrospect, after watching the film, did I recognise how much this contributed to the viewing experience. The overall high quality of all the acting is a tribute to the Director as much as to the cast, but commentators on this film frequently mention great performances by not only Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd as the two leads, but also Jack Hawkins, Findlay Currie, Haya Hayareet, Martha Scott, Hugh Griffiths, and others. Although over 3.5 hours long, the film is episodic and features realistic dialogue which ensures that it never seems overlong. The setting, mainly in Judaea, helped avoid any need for Roman Circus sequences which would have been out of place. Films generally accepted as great all feature four well balanced attributes, an excellent script, superb direction, an exceptional cast and masterly camera-work. Other near great films often feature three of these, falling slightly short in one of them. Many critics feel that Ben Hur is exceptional not only because it is strong in all four areas, but because these were kept in balance unusually well throughout the whole production.<br/><br/>The silent version 'Ben Hur - A Tale of the Christ' also featured exceptional direction and acting, superlative photography (mostly B&W but with a few Technicolor sequences for dramatic effect) and remarkable special effects. Do not under-rate these - the chariot race for which the re-make is justly famous is not greatly inferior here; and the sea battle is probably better. The acting may appear a little overplayed but this is to be expected in a silent film. The main difference lies in its better aspect ratio. In a large auditorium the 2.76 - 1 ratio screen can be compared to looking at a mural. But few artists achieve fame for painting murals. Go to an art gallery and count how many of even the largest paintings have such an aspect ratio. On the small screen a letter box format is ridiculous, and is tiring to continue watching during any long film. Buy this DVD and watch both versions to see how much better this 1959 film could have been if created with a more modest aspect ratio!"

Being the one Rome-like superpower, it's the United States' turn to impose an empire's glory upon the world whether those countries with unhealthy climates want it or not.

","Wow. That's what I thought as I watched this melodramatic piece of shmaltz. I was amazed that anyone could consider this a serious film and not find it dated. I was amazed that anyone who saw this could consider Charlton Heston a serious and competent actor. I was dazzled at the fact that this wasn't laughed out of the theatres when it was released. Between bad acting, bad writing, melodramatic directing and a slew of other critical problems this heavily dated film is a joke today. Watching this you begin to see what the A.M.P.A.S really looks for in films. Lots of money, lots of spectacle, wooden acting and a movie that isn't as smart as it thinks it is. This is what Titanic will look like in 30 years. A piece of unintelligent garbage that hype has blown out of proportion."
"Quinoa1984","10","6","12","11 April 2008"," still a gigantic achievement in epic film-making
","What distinguishes Ben-Hur as a powerful film in epic scope is not simply that it is shot and stylized and acted and executed in action sequences to iconic effect (though there is that to a degree), but that it's human dimensions stay intimate in scope. I was expecting what I had heard about with Ben-Hur, and got that- the vengeance plot, the chariot race, a story of redemption with Christ as a background figure and major presence- but I wasn't expecting such things revealed like the devastation left on a family by leprosy, and the disintegration of one's morality by the cloud of vengeance on one's mind. Even if you're not much of a Christian (and even as a non-practicing Jew as I am), there are some deep chords that are struck with the material for an audience that is going in not expecting a lot of sermonizing. Only in the final reels, as we see first-hand the 'Christ' as he is sent to die on the cross, does the film get overbearing with the symbolism and heavy weight of the circumstance of this being a ""tale of the Christ.""<br/><br/>This isn't to say also that with Judah Ben-Hur having the strife in coming to terms with his family being at first, he thinks, dead, and then later as made deformed thanks to the Roman's imprisonment, that this is all the film is. It's also grand spectacle, a film that takes you along on its epic ride with imagery that pierced the public consciousness so strongly that you've seen the scenes as parodies or referenced before you've even seen the film. Surely we have the chariot race to contend with, which has been so influential on modern action sequences and chases that Lucas copied most of the choreography for the pod race in Phantom Menace. And to give credit where it's due, you could show that same sequence in any theater today and it would unquestionably bring down the house, not just for its technical achievement but for the visceral impact (i.e. the downfall of Ben-Hur's rival by his own undoing).<br/><br/>But there's also other great images; possibly my favorite are the scenes with Judah Ben-Hur as #41 among the rowing slaves, all moving at the whim of the drum beat. That in and of itself would make Ben-Hur a must-see. But then there are more emotionally impactive places and settings, like the valley of the lepers, Judah's struggle across the desert (and the tastefully done angle of Jesus' back only), many others that would take too long to mention. It's all so massive a production that it's almost TOO big (according to Charlton Heston the budget, at 14 million then as the most expensive film ever made, would today cost something like 250 million), and it's a credit to William Wyler that he never makes it too dull, even as supporting characters may verge on leaning to overacting. With only calling attention to it at certain moments (and sometimes not at all with a more subtle effect), Wyler is a virtuoso here in corralling all aspects of the production under his firm handle.<br/><br/>And then there's Heston, who gives one of the very best of his (now late) career. He's full of bravura and gusto, and seems like a guy- for those guys who crave action film stars- who can get things done in the right mindset. But he's also excellent at conveying the tragedy of this character, a very good man with high ideals who becomes corrupted by his need to get his respite. Underneath all of that machismo and the swagger that eventually became old hat for Heston, is a strong presence at the helm of Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd, too, is also very good as the boyhood friend turned rival. In fact, most of the actors here are very good, from Hawkins to Hazareet to Jaffe to O'Donnel and so on, as they all contribute to the epic scope. It's massive and directly concerning the efforts of then Rabbi from Nazareth to bring peace and love to humanity. Despite it being not-too-thinly veiled religious fable (and not without a couple of things noticeable as parody in Life of Brian), Ben-Hur is a great success for its time, surviving today in good, not-too-dated tact."

","What's not to love about BEN-HUR? It's a film that tells an epic story in an epic way, filling every shot with artistry and colour until the screen overflows with splendour. Despite a lengthy running time, the pacing never flags. The episodic structure of the storyline works in the film's favour, ably chronicling the adventures of the titular character as he undergoes a thrilling journey to hell and back.<br/><br/>It has Charlton Heston playing his most famous role and being incredibly manly and heroic in it. It has a cast of seasoned performers in support, not least Jack Hawkins as the sympathetic Roman. It has Stephen Boyd as a truly nasty piece of work villain. It has the most spectacular and complex action sequence ever put on film in the shape of the chariot race, which is just as thrilling and breathtaking as it was when it was first released in cinemas back in the day.<br/><br/>And, finally, it's a film engages the senses and the emotions. It never forgets, amid all the glory and the epic wonder of the scenery and action, that this is a human story about real people struggling with their lives. There's a message there for any viewer, Christian or otherwise, and that's the reason why BEN-HUR hasn't dated a day since it was first released. It's a true classic for a reason."

Not that Gladiator was bad, mind you, but rather that its simple storyline and characters seemed too, well, proletarian, for Oscar. ""Oscar"", those people would say, ""used to be for innovative, good movies."" The example of Ben Hur should prove to such people that Oscar has always had tendencies towards being the NASCAR championship of film awards. Again, it's not a bad movie. However, it relies almost entirely on three tricks to convince the Harrah's Atlantic City Bus-riding set that this is high art.<br/><br/>First, there was a giant budget to persuade that the film was somehow technically innovative. Throw enough money at anything and some innovation will occur, but Ben Hur was hardly groundbreaking in any significant way.<br/><br/>Second, you need to have plenty of throw-away lines of pseudo-philosophy. Ben Hur simply crawls with them.<br/><br/>Finally, to guarantee that the film would warrant being purchased in the Classy Velour-bound Boxed Set edition, it needs to have a religious element.

With a few exceptions, the film looks very natural, unlike the increasingly tired animated ""look"" used for big productions some decades later. The film's lighting, scenes, and direction are very aesthetically appealing. The supporting characterizations are better than those in the older version. Christianity remains respectfully restrained; arguably, the amount of Christian faith demonstrated by Heston is unnecessarily subdued.<br/><br/>Heston takes some getting used to, as the young Jewish hero; in fact, he looks more convincing as a Roman, especially after his ""adoption"" by Jack Hawkins (as Quintus Arrius). An interesting, but unacceptable-at-the-time, idea might have been for Heston and Boyd to switch roles; Boyd appears capable of handling either ""Judah"" or ""Messala"". Still, Heston wins you over; his scenes in the ""slave boat"", and the reunification with his leper mother are outstandingly played.<br/><br/>Boyd's characterization is extraordinary; watching the way his eyes dart over Heston, in their first scenes together, lends credence to co-writer Gore Vidal assertion there was a homosexual subtext planned for the characters. Realistically, homosexual relations were not all that uncommon among the ancient Romans. Although, this was not likely to be found in the Lew Wallace novel, it does help explain the otherwise inexplicable love/hate relationship between the ""Judah"" and ""Messala"" characters.<br/><br/>The entire supporting cast does very well, it must have been difficult for award nominators to single anyone out. But, in addition to those mentioned above, Haya Harareet's ""Esther"" and Hugh Griffith's ""Sheik Ilderim"" most definitely make an impression.

"dragonshield","9","5","10","28 August 2007"," 48 years after - It's still excellent
","I bought ""Ben-Hur"" on DVD more than one month ago. I had never seen the film, but as hearing so much good things about it and my brother literally praising it, it couldn't be that bad, now could it? I decided to watch it when I really had the time for it, the movie lasts for more than 3 and a half hours after all and it is said to be one of the finest movies in the whole history of motion pictures. That is something that really grows up the pressure of the viewer; You just can't start watching it whenever you want to and without having any expectations on it, it's just that simple. Well anyways, I finally looked up a free spot on my calendar and decided the day when I'd watch it. So, I took my time and watched it like a week or two ago and to be honest I was in a pretty good mood too so nothing could go wrong. Well, I am glad to say that even after 48 years, still to this day, ""Ben-Hur"" is an entertaining, fine diamond and an excellent motion picture. You really have to relate to the time when it was made, but even without relating it's surprisingly good. Considering its age some of the things occurring in the movie are just mind blowing.<br/><br/>The story in its wholeness is outstanding, it has everything an epic movie needs; Adventure, thrill, drama, romance, tragedy, just everything. And this is, indeed, an epic movie among the best. The story itself isn't just what described in the plot outlines; It has so many more levels of incomprehensible depth, so much power which takes it to an unexpected direction and based on what I saw I'd say it's undeniably one of the best epic stories ever seen or told on the big screen. Based on the novel by Lew Wallace, translated to a screenplay by Karl Tunberg it's quality writing and storytelling in an incredible level, from the beginning till the end. The film does get a bit heavy after the 2 and a half hours, which is really disappointing, as until that point it has a very good flow and the viewer doesn't get bored, but after that point it's slightly long-winded. Despite that the movie manages to be highly entertaining, so for the final rating and your overall opinion the heaviness isn't exactly as crucial as you may think. The music composed by Miklós Rózsa creates tension and comprehension while we progress throughout the movie and though it is as much as any other music in the movies made in the late 50's or early 60's it's still pretty awesome and it can not be ignored.<br/><br/>The one significant thing above everything else is how well the whole movie is made, especially when considering its age. It's simply phenomenal how much time and effort has been put to this movie and it can definitely be seen from every single scene streaming across the screen, one after another. The props, the dressing, basically everything is an achievement like no other and the numbers just speak for themselves; 100 000 costumes, 8000 assistants, 300 props and the biggest budget at its era. This all, and more, brought the movie 11 Oscars and it was the first movie to win such many of them. No other than two movies have achieved that to this day; ""Titanic"" (1997) and ""The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King"" (2003). You have to bear in mind that back in 1959 there wasn't any kind of possibility for a such thing as CGI so basically everything you see on the screen has really happened and has been shot, so even that alone is a huge achievement which really deserves all the attention this movie has. There was this one particular scene that I will most certainly remember forever and that was the scene which probably awoke contradictory opinions and views back then because of its bloody yet realistic violence - The horse race scene. That is a scene I think everyone has heard of and I am one of those people who were left mouth open, as it is indeed fantastic. Honestly, I stood up from the sofa and gave a little applause after the scene ended.<br/><br/>Judah Ben-Hur and Messala, played by Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, are very memorable characters and the chemistry between those two legendary actors is unspeakably overwhelming, as if the opposite personalities of the characters would compensate each other, which then forms that chemistry. Stephen Boyd is excellent as Messala, but Charlton Heston is even better as Ben-Hur and the role even brought him an Academy Award for the best actor in a leading role. It is no wonder. Like I've said before when I've reviewed older movies; The acting is totally different from the acting these days. It's a totally different art form of it's own and it just can not be compared to the acting this day. There is that certain extravagance if I may say it, it requires that relating to the age again, but it's still a real treat for your eyes and ears, giving you something different. It's like a fresh summer breeze.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"" is definitely a movie worth watching, when first making sure you have the time for it, a movie which you can not stop and continue the next day. Though it does get a bit heavy like mentioned, it's still worth it in the end. The heaviness is the only reason why I'm not going to give this motion picture a perfect score. The film includes brilliant role performances, fantastic story and superior art direction, set decoration and costume design. If a movie like this was made now it would still work as butter on a bread, and that's really something, isn't it?"
"Doylenf","9","5","10","5 May 2001"," New DVD version is a full restoration of sight and sound...brilliant achievement!
","'Ben-Hur' is such a great film, it's a pleasure to report that the newly restored Wide Screen 4-Disc DVD version (which includes the 1925 silent screen film with Ramon Novarro) is right on the mark. The color has been restored to its original brilliance with every scene clearly in focus and the soundtrack gives full range to Miklos Rozsa's impressive score. More than ever, Rozsa's score seems to have an energy and force of its own, underlining all the drama inherent in a story of this kind. And Charlton Heston's work in the title role is sheer perfection. He captures the character so completely that he IS Ben-Hur.<br/><br/>Not often does such an epic have human characters that are not dwarfed by all the spectacle. The characters are all fully-dimensional human beings--particularly the two antagonists (Judah Ben-Hur and Messala), once great friends but now divided by political loyalties. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd are outstanding in the leads (Boyd should definitely have won an Oscar as Messala for his chilling death scene alone!). <br/><br/>All the other important roles are flawlessly cast. The chariot race is the most explosive and breathtaking seventeen minutes ever given to such a spectacular event--and all of the stunts look perfectly real. It's hard to believe that none of the stunts ended with more than minor injuries.<br/><br/>The final scene, which follows soon after the chariot race, with Ben-Hur returning home and slowly climbing the steps to find that his mother and sister have been cured, still gives me goose bumps when I see it. As does the poignant scene in the leper colony where he insists on seeing their cave dwelling. Both scenes are strongly bolstered by Miklos Rozsa's brilliant score.<br/><br/>Fully deserved all the awards it won. Should be released theatrically to show folks that even in 1959, Hollywood had all the technical skill to bring something like this off--with spectacular results! But in the meantime, this newly restored DVD is a keeper."
"lee_eisenberg","5","15","41","14 April 2006"," Do we remember anything except the chariot race?
","Everyone remembers the blades on the bad guy's chariot, and how he whips the title character (Charlton Heston). But overall, ""Ben-Hur"" is basically a soap opera (well, how could a biblical epic not be?). And of course, there's a few things nowadays that change how we view the movie. Given how Charlton Heston's character wants revenge, wouldn't it make more sense for him to just get a gun? I mean, we're talking about the NRA president here! Also, there's that one character who it turns out was supposed to be gay (Heston thought that they were just friends).<br/><br/>All in all, considering that 1959 produced movies like ""Some Like It Hot"", ""The 400 Blows"" and ""Anatomy of a Murder"", was this really the one to give Best Picture? Not in my opinion. It's a classic mainly because of the chariot race.<br/><br/>I remember a comic strip where Hollywood decides to do dumb remakes of classic epics, resulting in ""Gone with the Wit"" and ""Ben-Huh?"". Also, Roberto Benigni said in an interview that this was the first movie that he ever saw in the theater, but his family didn't have enough money for a ticket, so they watched it from behind the screen. So, the first movie that he ever saw in the theaters was ""Ruh-Neb""!"
"puttputtk","8","6","13","22 September 2010"," great film. don't be scared away by the religious parts.
","Ben-Hur (1959)<br/><br/>Often cited as one of the greatest films ever made, and truly it is. Although its not one of my top favorites I do really enjoy it and agree with it being one of the best. <br/><br/>It's a film that I think couldn't be as big now days, or at least not as good. They would ruin it with CGI and it wouldn't look as cool. Hollywood wouldn't allow so many extras these days in my opinion. Along with this the a lot of the stunts would be faked. <br/><br/>Besides all of the big scenes, like the chariot race, the film is still great. Though the action scenes are probably the most remembered, the drama is what keeps the film together and makes it a classic. Perfectly directed and performed, it will continue to be viewed for years.<br/><br/>Not being a religious person at all, I was worried that the biblical aspects of the film were gonna ruin the film, make it too cheesy and what not. However that doesn't happen. The bible, in my opinion, has great stories (if you just take them as stories not truth) so all the parts with Jesus are actually pretty cool, because it gives him that superhero like feel. Ben-Hur is called a story of Christ, which is weird, because it is about Jesus but at the same time it's not about him at all. More of a look at someone who was affected by him. Very interesting. <br/><br/>On of Charlton Heston's best performances, and one of William Wyler's best films, it really deserved the Oscar sweep that it did. Winning best picture, actor, supporting actor, cinematography, costume design, art direction, effects, editing, directing, music, sound and of course best picture. I cant see any of these wins going to any other film. Though I personally like Some Like it Hot and Anatomy of a Murder more than Ben- Hur, I feel Ben Hur still deserved the wins. <br/><br/>This film should be watched by everyone. I'm assuming a lot of the younger crowds might get bored by it, but anyone that's able to sit through a 3 hour film, mostly dialog driven, then please do yourself a favor and watch it. It's a classic epic for a reason, and will be on the top of most movie lists for a long time. <br/><br/>8/10"
"silverscreen888","8","6","13","21 June 2005"," Apart From its Climax, This is a Great Piece of Film-making and Drama
","Civil War General Lew Wallace's unpretentious novel has had a history of being liked for many reasons other than for its questionable Roman history its and unpretentious religious themes. In fact, it is simply a very long story about why honor is important and why revenge is less desirable than is forgiveness. The religious aspect--miraculous intervention by a dying Christ toward the man who tries to offer him water, a man he had once saved--impacts only the second idea, which otherwise would be untenable. So, much of this nearly four-hour-long epic masterpiece of film-making is a rousing drama with elements of adventure, historical bigotries, a surprising love story, a powerfully-filmed chariot race, strong dialogue scenes, a beautiful sea-battle and much, much more. William Wyler was the mastermind who managed to keep this sprawling project together; The performances he elicited set a standard not yet equaled for the historical genre; note that, brilliantly, Brits play the Romans and classically-trained US performers the Jews. British Empire types play the other Middle Eastern races. The story of Ben-Hur need not be retold in any great detail. Messala, now a tribune of the Empire, and Judan Ben-Hur, a rich Jew, had been boyhood friends. When Messala returns as 2nd to the new governor, an accident with falling roof tiles causes the already estranged Messala, who has already tried to get Judah to betray opponents of Rome to him to further his career, to be enabled to send Judah to the galleys. Saving Quintus Arius his commander after a battle, Judah is adopted by the man in place of his lost son, becomes a champion of the chariot races at Rome, but returns home. He finds his mother and sister reported dead, his fortunes wrecked, and the woman he loves waiting for him. It's not enough for him. He declares war on Messala before he discovers his mother and sister have become lepers, defeating and killing Messala in a great chariot race; and then he finds the two restored by a miracle performed by a dying Jesus, who recognizes him as a man whom he once saved by offering him water when he was in a slave column in the desert. The real star of the film other than Wyler's impeccable direction and the spectacular recreations of Jerusalem and Rome are the actors. Splendid work by Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd as Messala, Hugh Griffith, Frank Thring, Jack Hawkins, Finlay Currie, Martha Scott and others are the norm in this film. And virtually every technical and creative aspect from the costumes to Miklos' Rozsa's magnificent music to the Karl Tunberg dialogue is a memorable and praiseworthy achievement. Among the finest things about ""Ben-Gur"" are seeing Christ only through Ben-Hur's eyes, the Yakima Canutt-directed chariot race, the galley sequences which updated Michael Curtiz' rowers in ""The Sea Hawk"", the party and farewell when Judan leaves Rome and the entire early portion set in Jerusalem. One may quarrel as many have done with the ""messy death of messala"" or the deus-ex- machina miracle that is used as the film's climax, to the detriment of secular justice as a human concern. Bwhat must not be forgotten is how great a movie this is, developed from a slender source. I suggest it is a film worth studying and seeing many times over."

"oOoBarracuda","10","3","5","11 April 2016"," ""How do you fight an idea, especially a new idea""
","It was finally time to see what all 11 of those Oscar's were for in 1959, 11 Oscars for a single film is certainly a feat; and I was excited to see what film earned so many statuettes. I could not have been any more pleased with Ben-Hur. It was a wonderful visual spectacle that still amazes nearly 60 years after its debut. William Wyler's epic starring Charleton Heston in the title role is a true treat for the audience that won't even mind the 3.5-hour commitment it will take to finish this classic. Strap into your chariot, Ben- Hur is a film that any true fan of cinema should see at least once. <br/><br/>Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a wealthy Jewish prince living in Jerusalem. His old friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who once saved his life, has just been named Commanding Officer of the Roman legion. Despite their religious and political differences, Judah and Messala have remained friends through their life. However, after Judah realizes his friend has become power hungry and arrogant, he seeks distance between them. Then, at the welcome parade for the Romans, Judah and his sister watch from the roof of the house of Hur. When a loose roof tile falls and injures the Governor, Judah is blamed for the incident. He tries to explain the misunderstanding, but it falls on deaf ears and Messala, even knowing that Judah and his family are innocent, sends Judah to the galleys as a slave and throws his mother and sister in prison. Through many instances of good fortune, Judah survives the galleys, holding onto his Jewish faith and the wish to reunite with his mother and sister. After managing to return to Jerusalem, Judah goes on a quest to find his family. Along the way, Judah decides to exact revenge on his one-time friend.<br/><br/>The colors, Duke, the colors! Maybe I'm the only one left that remembers that commercial; nonetheless, the colors in Ben-Hur were the most stand-out part of the film. The sets were remarkable, as well, especially given their grand scale. The screenplay and the storytelling was simply perfect. The story was paced so well, at the movie's credits you will hardly believe you sat through a nearly 4- hour spectacle. The costuming was phenomenal; true to life without being over the top. William Wyler made an excellent decision in the way he filmed scenes depicting Jesus. He never showed Jesus' face, which fit perfectly in the movie, as it was not about Jesus, but rather the plight of the Jews and the politics of the time. Wyler's decision was also a very reverent way to handle depicting a religious figure. The score and sound effects were exquisite and worked wonders to progress the film along. The special effects were divine, especially considering the film was made in 1959. What review of Ben-Hur could exist without mentioning that chariot scene? This scene alone cost $4 million dollars and lasted for 11 minutes. It was an incredible and well worth it scene for the movie. ""The chariot race"" is not only the scene most remembered from Ben- Hur, but it is a scene that has gone down in cinema history. Once you finish Ben-Hur, you will not wonder why it took home 11 Oscars, it's more than evident and wildly deserving of every statuette it took home. <br/><br/>An instant favorite, Ben-Hur is a visually pleasing work of art classic piece of cinema. Everything in this film comes together beautifully and will leave no one who invests their time in the picture disappointed. Even if you are not a fan of Charlton Heston's infamous overacting, give Ben-Hur a viewing and see for yourself how easy it is to overlook that one piece of this movie. It's easy to see why Ben-Hur has a place carved out in history that it will never be removed from."
"fadedGlory","2","21","65","26 January 2005"," More impressive the first time around
","The first time I saw this film was when it originally came out. God knows why on earth my parents dragged a five of six year old boy to a thing like this, but I can tell you, in between boring me stiff it scared me absolutely sh*tless. I didn't understand the first thing about it, of course, but the Messala death scene and that stuff about the lepers caused me nightmares for years afterwards! So now I saw it again, on DVD, for the second time in my life. And boy, what an experience it was. This time it didn't scare me, no, it didn't, but it still bored me alright. Made me laugh, too, with the cheesy Jesus cameo's, the over the top music, the ridiculous acting, the whole pretentiousness of it all. Just the beginning alone with the cheap Christmas card effects is hilarious. How can anyone take stuff like this seriously?? <br/><br/>Of course the chariot race is cool, nothing wrong there. Messalas death scene the second time round isn't so much scary as it is annoying, I was trying to see if the doctor is indeed John le Mesurier or not but I couldn't get a clear shot of him. On the other hand, the sea battle was obviously filmed in Wyler's bath tub and should be cut from the movie for sheer embarrassment. The guy on the drums has trouble keeping the beat as well, and Jack Hawkins is simply very confusing indeed.<br/><br/>The lepers scenes go on and on until it all becomes a blur, and the effects are nothing to write home about. Having seen my share of gory movies in the meantime, not to mention The Elephant Man, may I be excused for being underwhelmed by a few blisters and sores?<br/><br/>And then there is goold ole' Charlton Heston. What to make of him? Well, I've got to give it to him that he's a better actor than John Wayne (now there's a compliment!) but after 4 hours of him I just wish he would stop showing his teeth for a change. <br/><br/>So what did I like? I liked the little old guy playing Emperor Tiberius, you can see he enjoyed himself. I love the horses, of course, truly magnificent. And I definitely loved the ending, not particularly for its undiluted overdose of 'edelkitsch', but because the job was finally, finally done. <br/><br/>Ben Hur, an all time hit in the Lourdes municipal theatre, undoubtedly. But a masterpiece? <br/><br/>As the Christ said, forgive them, Lord, for they don't know what they are doing."
"ajvenigalla","10","4","8","13 October 2013"," One of the great epics of all time and one of the great cinematic achievements of all time
","Ben-Hur is widely hailed as a classic film and a great epic masterpiece among movie buffs and critics.<br/><br/>Why is it so? Because it has character, drama, action, violence, redemption, hope, color, and intelligence in it; it is one of the best (and maybe THE best) of the biblical epics of Hollywood's Golden Age.<br/><br/>The story goes like this: In first century (A.D., that is) Judea, the Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) meets his former friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who has now become a Roman tribute. At first, it seems that they will be friends again. However, when Messala demands that Judah reveal the names of militants who oppose the Roman Empire, Judah breaks with Messala, and vice versa. This event spills over when Judah is falsely accused of attempting to assassinate the Roman governor after a tile accidentally falls from the palace balcony, and he and his family are captured. Judah begs Messala to vindicate him and his family, but the hardened Roman refuses. Judah is condemned to the galleys, but not before he promises vengeance on Messala when he returns. At the galleys, he saves the life of the general Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and is rewarded by being named Arrius's son. However, Judah feels haunted by the memory of Judea, and returns, only to meet Sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith) and Balthasar (Finlay Currie), who happened to be one of the three wise men who saw the baby Jesus, and to enter into a chariot race in which he will compete with Messala in the arena. The ensuing events will make for an exciting, grand piece of cinema.<br/><br/>Did the movie deserve the glowing reputation it has received among esteemed film critics and movie buffs? Or is it just an average epic that is dated and insignificant? Or is it a really awful, bloated and overrated piece of fluff? I agree with the first opinion. It is an intelligent piece of filmmaking that keeps you in your seat for more than three and a half hours, even with the occasional flaws that may exist in the movie.<br/><br/>William Wyler does a wonderful job in directing the film, and the movie is guided by his skilled hand. Epic film producer Sam Zimbalist (King Solomon's Mines, Quo Vadis) did a great job in his production; however, he died in 1958 before it could be completed, making him the only posthumous person to win a Best Picture Oscar. Karl Tunberg's excellent script is helped with uncredited contributions from British playwright Christopher Fry, American playwrights Maxwell Anderson and S. N. Behrman, and the late great author Gore Vidal, who also happened to write Broadway plays. The fact that the uncredited contributions come from playwrights clears things up a bit as to why this film is so grand, epic, and magnificent. The script should be studied by film buffs and aspiring filmmakers as an excellent example of epic filmmaking. And not only that, Lew Wallace's classic, on which the film is based, should be read also in conjunction with the film script. Miklos Rozsa's music, Robert Surtees's cinematography and Yakima Canutt's stunts all have their share in elevating this already wonderful film.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston plays his role as the Jewish prince with dignity, awesomeness, and humanity, even though he may have his occasions of stiltedness and woodenness. However, there is a difference from the book and the movie; whereas in the book Ben-Hur is shown to be joining a guerrilla force with the Galileans against the Roman government, and he even kills a Roman soldier in a duel, while the movie shows none of this. It does deal with Ben-Hur's hatred of the Roman government, though, and how it nearly blinds him to the need to love his enemies. Another difference is that in the book Ben-Hur is depicted to be much younger in the beginning, whereas in the movie he is a grown man. Stephen Boyd brilliantly portrays the villainous Messala, who is desirous of power, glory, and pomp. However, unlike the novel's character, Messala is not very cynical, though he is laden with hubris. The Israeli actress Haya Harareet fits well into the role of the beautiful Esther, and Hugh Griffith's portrayal as Sheik Ilderim provides us some comic relief throughout the epic tale. And Jack Hawkins's role as Arrius is compelling as well.<br/><br/>And let us not forget the brilliant and electric chariot race. The race is constructed entirely without CGi and without any phony trickery; it is all real. The sets are huge, magnificent and epic. And it entirely relies on the suspense of the event rather than Miklos Rozsa's music (which is wonderful in its own right). It not only focuses on epic scale but rather the conflict between Ben-Hur and Messala, and in this way it contributes to the story and doesn't detract from it.<br/><br/>The most important part of the epic, however, is the story of Christ, as the subtitle of the original book (and the movie) says it is ""A Tale of the Christ."" Claude Heater plays the role here. In the film, Christ's face is not shown, and yet His power infuses the whole movie both indirectly and directly, particularly in the famous scene where Jesus gives water to a thirsty Judah Ben-Hur, who is on his way to the galleys. When He faces a Roman soldier who commands that no water be given to Judah, Jesus' look has such strength that the soldier stops himself from whipping Jesus. The Christian core is shown throughout the film by contrasting the power of true love as exemplified by Christ Jesus and the hatred that Messala shows and that Judah succumbs to before his salvation. <br/><br/>Recommended to all film buffs, epic film fans, and Christians of all backgrounds. This film is epic, human, and wonderful. I give it five out of five stars."
"sme_no_densetsu","8","4","8","22 January 2013"," An iconic film from the golden age of Hollywood
","The name Ben-Hur is synonymous with epic historical drama. The original novel by General Lew Wallace was for many years the best-selling American novel of all time. The 1925 silent film was the most expensive motion picture of its time and the 1959 version was the most expensive of its time. The vast amounts of money poured into these adaptations resulted in some of the most impressive productions in movie history.<br/><br/>The film, which is subtitled 'A Tale of the Christ', revolves around Jewish prince Judah Ben-Hur during the time of Christ. Betrayed by his boyhood friend, Messala, he is condemned to life as a galley slave. Despite the hopelessness of his situation, he vows to return and exact vengeance on his erstwhile friend. The story of Christ forms a backdrop that recurs from time to time and ties in with Ben-Hur's experiences.<br/><br/>The film was nominated for a dozen Oscars and ended up winning 11 of them. These included several wins in technical categories such as costume design, art direction, sound and special effects. Basically, no expense was spared and the results showed on the screen. The film still impresses today as an example of sheer cinematic spectacle.<br/><br/>The acting was also honoured, with Charlton Heston taking home a statuette for his performance in the title role and Hugh Griffith nabbing an Oscar in his supporting role as the lusty Sheik Ilderim. Both individuals were deserving of this recognition and they also received admirable support from Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins & Haya Harareet. In general, the performances of the large cast leave little cause for complaint.<br/><br/>In the director's chair, the great William Wyler steered the film from set-piece to set-piece without overwhelming the intimacy of the story at the film's core. He was rewarded with an Oscar for his efforts, as was Robert Surtees, whose cinematography contributed greatly to the film's visual appeal. Also worth mentioning is Miklós Rózsa, whose Oscar-winning score has since been recognized as one of the best in American cinema.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, some may have reservations about the film's religious slant, even though it's (purposely) not as overt as in the 1925 version. That being said, the story of Ben-Hur, while highly compelling on its own, is undoubtedly enhanced by incorporating elements of the story of Christ. All in all, in my opinion ""Ben-Hur"" still stands as one of the greatest epics ever to come out of Hollywood."

","The truth is, is that Ben-Hur deserved every award that was showered upon it. It's a titanic film both in structure and scope. It doesn't need me to go over old ground about how much the film cost to make, the number of extras, the number of sets and etc, it's now folklore that this film could have bankrupted MGM such was the investment, but they needn't have worried since the film went on to make 40 million and still counting.<br/><br/>Every cent spent was worth it because it's a magnificent film, the kind that you can get swept away with, the minute the overture starts you feel little tingles as the hairs on your arms stand up on end, you are aware that for over three hours director William Wyler and lead actor Charlton Heston are going to own you.<br/><br/>The story centres around Judah Ben-Hur (Heston) who through his staunch loyalty to the Jewish race falls out with his dear Roman friend Messala (Stephen Boyd). He is dispatched to be a slave in the galleys and swears revenge on Messala. After pirates attack the ship he is slaved on, he manages to escape and in the process he saves Roman Admiral Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and this sets Juda on his destiny to enact revenge on his old friend as Quintus makes him a citizen of Rome.<br/><br/>It sounds so simple yet it's a story of the highest order because crucial to the film's core strength is Judah's encounters with Christ, and it's only during the harsh and upsetting final reel that we realise the whole point of the film. There's also strong themes involving family love and loyalty, friendships formed or broken under race and creed banners, and of course religious beliefs and all that comes with that kettle of fish... <br/><br/>It's epic, it's simply beautiful, it's actually essential viewing for any serious cinema fan, the film's set pieces are still wondrous even today. You will marvel at the chariot race (a stunning 20 minutes long), you will hoist the flag during the pirate attack, and if you have the emotion in you? You will be hit with sombre silence as Christ is crucified.

True, the distant shots of the ships don't exactly meet today's criteria, but the sea battle is superb, and the chariot race surpasses a lot of action in our epic movies today. This is one of those movies where all the elements come together...the script, acting, cinematography, and best of all, the music score, composed by Miklos Rozsa! I still on occasion hear high-school bands perform the ""Parade of the Charioteers"" musical section from the movie. If you enjoyed ""Gladiator,"" you'll love Ben-Hur.

","Though it was less than half a year ago I first saw this masterpiece, it has become one of my favorite movies of all time. And usually it takes a while for me to really accept movies and it takes a while before I really take them to me, this has been the case of almost every film I've ever seen.<br/><br/>As for Ben-Hur, this is not the case. I am not at all amazed (or even impressed) by the many Academy Awards it received. As far as I'm concerned, if a film that wins eleven Oscars, then the only thing to be sure of is that it appeals to Americans and a great American crowd. And that's not always a good thing.<br/><br/>Awards, nominations, hype and everything that has to do with frenzy put aside, this still is an enormous production. So very mighty and so very grand in scale, so very entertaining and so very well-made. We may never see the liking, the most of us have realized that we didn't see an equal in Titanic.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston gives the character of Judah Ben-Hur all the magnitude it needs and he brings a strong impact. Many people are fond of Hugh Griffith<br/><br/>in the role of Sheik Ilderiim for which he won an Oscar. I am too, but the most impressive actor of them all in my opinion is, Stephen Boyd as Messala. The scene where Ben-Hur and Messala speak to each other for the last time (the scene right after the chariot race) surely could have appealed enough to the American crowd to bring Boyd an Oscar. For a newcomer, he was an excellent and promising one.<br/><br/>The movie itself in its full glory may be dated, but not enough for it to be ridiculous at any standard at all. It still stands up among newcomers and will continue to do so for ages to come.<br/><br/>Truly nothing beats a classic."

It may have looked great back in 1959, and I must admit that the chariot race still looks pretty impressive, but it's just a single bright spot in the otherwise unmemorable film. The story itself is quite majestic and epic, but unfortunately brought down by the laughably dated visuals, sluggish pace and terrible acting. Charlton Heston, in particular, gives one of the most wooden performances I've ever seen, to the point where his ""menacing"" stares and bared teeth brought unintentional giggles on my part.

","To start Charlton Heston isn't that great of an actor. He is just like the Arnold of his time without one liners. His acting is just not convincing he feels and looks insincere the whole time. The only movie where i felt anything from him was 'a touch of evil'. For the other actors well, few others are featured enough to make much of a difference and the script's shallowness except for a few lines leave the whole experience really empty of empathy from the audience. Now in terms of the actual movie it has aged terribly where other films from the era have shined. The shots are bland and require the background to hold the audience's attention. There was no directorial imagination in the picture. One of the biggest problems with this movie is that it just wasn't edited. Nearly all the scenes drag and drag which is probably one reason that the acting feels forced because people are holding this faces forever. Even the famous chariot race takes forever to get to and it even drags. Another area where it has aged is the costumes which look tacky and fake along with indoor sets that look like sets. really the only real great scene is the chariot race which deserves the title epic while the rest deserves the title biography. and one of the few interesting this is the way Jesus is portrayed, but it was so back grounded and unfocused from the central story that it was almost no worth putting in. The entire Christ bit even felt tacked on and wasn't at all backed up by Heston."

Maybe it's just the fact that Ben-Hur won eleven Oscars, but to me, that just goes to show how weak the seperation of Church and State was in Hollywood during 1959. The one thing I had to say when Ben-Hur was finally over was that I watch films for entertainment - when I want a sermon, I'll turn on my television at about four in the morning and laugh my butt off at Kenneth Copeland et al. By staying up to that time, I will probably be in the same dazed, apathetic stupor that this film put me in, anyway.<br/><br/>I also would have thought that a 2.55:1 film would have some interesting photography in it, but there is absolutely nothing here that hasn't been done better in other widescreen films such as Lawrence Of Arabia or even Mad Max. The shots are just simply uninteresting and uninvolving, with maybe the sole exception of the chariot race. The chariot race was the one point in the film where I wasn't checking the Time Remaining display on my DVD player at least once a second, but I have still seen this type of scene done much better in films that had similar practical limitations, such as Grease or Mad Max 2.<br/><br/>I won't bore you any further with why this film bored me and almost had me wanting to destroy the DVD it was contained on. Suffice to say that I am glad films aren't make like this anymore. If the fundies in America who want to force all films to be made like this had their way, I'd probably shoot myself because I wouldn't have any other idea what to do with myself. I would rather die than be forced to watch this piece of Christian propaganda masquerading as a classic film ever again."

I have seen far better films about Christ, take for instance the Scorsese film, ""The Last Temptation of Christ"" with Willem Dafoe and Barbara Hershey OR the great and overlooked Canadian masterpiece, ""Jesus de Montreal"" with Lothaire Bluteau which leaves an everlasting impression on your mind. <br/><br/>Given that, I must admit that the horse race scene is great and very exciting - it of course features the 4 real stars of the film,  Antares, Altair, Rigel and Aldebaran, those 4 MAGNIFICENT Arabian (?) stallions as well as their master, the Sheikh Ilderim, played by the late Hugh Griffith with just the right amount of self irony.

","Uh. Sorry, folks.<br/><br/>I know that Ben-Hur is considered by many to be an all-time classic, and everything, but, hey, aside from the chariot race (which was magnificently done), this dry-as-dust picture pushed the boundaries of monotony just a little too far for this reviewer with its 3.5 hour running time.... Yeah. It sure did.<br/><br/>And, believe it or not, I actually sat through Ben-Hur's 3.5 hours of one over-long, dragged out scene after another and waited, and waited, and waited (ho-hum!) for something, anything worthwhile to take place, but it just didn't happen.... Nope. It didn't. (except, of course, for the chariot race) <br/><br/>Ben-Hur was a literal biblical soap opera of epic proportions that seriously cried out for some major editing. At least a good hour could have easily been cut out of its story and I'm sure that no one would have ever noticed the diff, one way or the other.<br/><br/>Maybe back in 1959 this film's fabricated magic might have worked on its audience like a mesmerizing spell, but that isn't the case today. No way.<br/><br/>Considering that this film's tag-line is ""A Tale of the Christ"", Ben-Hur has got to be one of the most hollow and cheesy biblical stories ever captured on film. About the only memorable scene that the Christ character happened to appear in was when he was carrying his cross (or trying to) on his way to his own crucifixion - And he kept falling down - So someone had to give him a hand with carrying the thing. ( No. Not very impressive, if you ask me) <br/><br/>Personally, I think that Ben-Hur was completely unworthy of winning a total of 11 Oscars. Particularly for its win for ""Best Picture"" (it was up against Anatomy For A Murder and The Diary Of Anne Frank) - And, especially, for ""Best Actor"", which went to that big phony-baloney with the whitest teeth, and brightest smile, Charlton Heston (who was up against James Stewart and Jack Lemmon).<br/><br/>Yep. It was quite plain to see that everything about Ben-Hur said ""expensive"" (its budget was $16 million), but nothing about it was in the least bit inspirational.<br/><br/>In spite of its big-name cast, and hordes-upon-hordes of extras, and all of its eye-popping sets and big-dollar production values, Ben-Hur was a small and petty and frivolous motion picture in so many, many ways."
"triplestrikekid","4","7","21","26 March 2009"," Ugh
","I don't even know what to say about this movie. I'll try to capture my thoughts about it and put it down on this comment. First of all, this has to be one of the cheesiest movies ever made. I mean, seriously. It's about a guy who wants to kill his friend, but can't, because he's Charles Heston and that grin can convince anyone he wouldn't hurt a fly. Then, he gets sold to a slave, and is offered a job by a man, which he angrily turns away. Then, in the midst of battle, he realizes he should help this man instead of his shipmates, which are dying around him. And then at the end of the movie, his sick mother and sister are healed by the blood of Jesus Christ. What.The.Hell. Secondly, the acting is terrible. Charles Heston and Jack Hawkins look extremely out of place during all their scenes together. Charles Heston looks like the frickin guy from the Orbit commercials, and Jack Hawkins looks like the frickin guy from the Gatorade commercials. They are terribly directed, and we have to trust in the screenplay (which is, by the way, horrible) that they are (were) best friends! The whole movie is just Charles Heston going around, flashing his smiles here and there, growing a beard, and trying to act but looking more like the guy who provides comic-relief in any movie about making a play. You know, how they always throw in the guy who can't act, but looks really handsome and picks up all the babes. I think this movie is grossly overrated. And cheesy. And horribly directed. And horribly written. And horribly acted. Sorry."

"zumbertinho","6","4","10","12 March 2013"," Epic and pretty movie, but inferior to many of its contemporary classics
","This is one of what I call the ""untouchable"" movies and, along with other pieces, this is very hard to rate and review, so I usually avoid that (specially because of the usual aggression that comes from people who think high of those movies). In this case there is one particular aggravation: the quantity of Academy Awards this movie got. As we all know, this is, for many people, a measure of how good a movie is or isn't. Not seeing how much the Academy Awards is biased is, at least for me, a matter of choice (and also a lack of any sense). Being biased or not in this case, and as much as I don't want to, I feel like I should say something about this movie, so here it goes.<br/><br/>This movie is as shallow as the ideals of those it tries to please, filled with the standard hypocrisy and bigotry you'll find in most of their minds. It's so pretensions and the acting is so hideous and corny that it's hard to believe that all of the hype around it can still exist, as you think that as time passes people would be more intelligent and critical, and would reject an abomination like this. Charlton Heston is nothing special, but he is particularly bad in this movie. This is a movie that was made to be BIG, and this is where everything revolves for it. It's an epic movie, with an epic number of extras, an epic spending on costumes and setting and equipment and an epic (debatable) soundtrack, which was specifically designed to snatch Oscars. However, from the story to the character development, this is incredibly inferior to many other epics of that time that are much more historically accurate than Ben-Hur and much better executed, with better acting and with more solid plots.<br/><br/>The film considers itself to be not only an epic ""historical"" account, but also thinks it has a deeper meaning. It relies heavily on an appeal to some values, while it tries to develop in the background a story of love, friendship and revenge. It fails miserably in all of those aspects.<br/><br/>It fails to convey a meaningful message because its values are devoid of any deepness and usually end up in contradictions. Thus, all of the actions that happen in the movie that are supposed to be linked with these values become meaningless: the conflict of the urge for revenge, etc. The childish notions of love and goodness that it conveys end up spoiling the movie, because this was clearly made for (and to impress.. and sorry for the bluntness).... Christians. It ends up being like a big Sunday school, with artsy cameos by JC himself (in the distance, or off screen, and never showing his face because, you know, it's more artsy that way, and it's also deep, like the ""message"" of this movie). Some religiosity in movies won't bother you that much, but this one just overdo it, and shows that this was clearly devised for Christian audiences.<br/><br/>However, it also fails in the underlining story of Ben-Hur. His love and friendship relationships do not convince, maybe because of Academy Award winner Charlton Heston's (his performance in SOYLENT GREEN is better than this one, seriously) performance, but probably because of the poor development of the characters, which the movie clearly sacrifices to try and push its values to the audience. <br/><br/>The costumes, the editing, everything is incredible (except the acting and the plot), and also the infamous chariot race is very well executed, so even if this movie is very slow paced it's still watchable. However, it's dull, with an acting that is hard on the eyes, and very pretentious for a movie with values so shallow and devoid of meaning. <br/><br/>Rating: 6,5/10 (I round ratings down)"

Put on a Roman galley to die by his boyhood friend, only his hate keeps him alive.<br/><br/>When they meet for the last time at the end of the chariot race, Judah, having been touched twice by the healing hand of the carpenter, Jesus (whose face you never see), can already sense no feeling of accomplishment by the victory over a dying Messalah (he should have won an Oscar for the death scene alone).<br/><br/>The culmination of the physical healing of his once leprous mother and sister (emblematic in the flow of blood from the cross into a stream of water) is one of the most moving in cinematic history.

","Every five (5) years or so I sit down with my spouse of 33 years, and we write down our top 50 movies of all time. For the last 4 of these reviews this movie was and is now at the top of my list. It such a complete movie. Much hullabaloo is made about the chariot race, and I agree, it is grand. However, William Wyler's ability to draw a full range of emotions from each of his character is what appeals to me most. I am not a Charlton Heston fan. Outside this movie, and I would agree he fit the part of Moses for the Ten Commandments, but that's it. No offense to Heston, but it seems an over awareness of self comes through in his pictures, but early on we see a different Heston here especially after Esther reminds Judah that this custom of taking a slave ""unto himself"" was a custom of ""...long ago"". You can bet I was cheering from the rafters after that one.<br/><br/>First, the music is the best I have ever heard for a movie. I had no problem sitting through the intermission (I have seen this movie over 20 times)just so I could relax and then follow the crescendo out of the interlude and into the act of the last half. Miklos Rozsa's use of instruments to depict light hearted scenes was interesting, almost a ""happy western feeling"" to it, which fit especially well to the many scenes in the desert.<br/><br/>Some of the visuals, some just scenery, some by persona are scenes we carry with us all our lives. The shot of the leaves blowing across the courtyard before and just after the intermission. The shot of the Roman Soldier telling Jesus not to give water to the prisoner, Judah Ben-Hur, ""No water for him!"" The shot of Jesus starting to preach on the hillside, Esther leaves Judah to listen and the back shot of Jesus as you follow Jesus'head watching Judah walk away from afar...wow! The galley drummer going to ""ramming speed"" (a phrase repeated by children and adults to this day). The shot of Miriam and Therza (not sure of spelling) seeking shelter from the storm in the cave after the cruxifiction of Jesus, and coming clean from the leprosy. The shot of Messala and Heston(Stephen Boyd---what a role)taunting Judah on his death bed, ""It goes on Judah...it goes on.""(Notice Wyler had made Judah look especially spent (more so than he appeared to be right after the race)) There are many movies who have a cast of characters as great if not greater than Ben-Hur, but I can't remember a movie when so many great actors and actress had their best performance in one movie. Who can forget Sam Jaffe as Simonides, ""Judah, Ben-Hur...she always said you'd come back."" <br/><br/>I don't need to repeat the story of the Arabians, and the real life training of those magnificent horses, but if you are not familiar with the story, I encourage you to pick up the DVD set of the movie and watch the making of the movie.<br/><br/>This is a movie every parent no matter their religion should take his children to see just to learn about what makes a great movie."

","Everyone knows about ""Ben-Hur"".  Five-year-old girls in Afghanistan know about `Ben-Hur'.  `Ben-Hur' is the first thing a baby finds out about after it's born.  I've known about `Ben-Hur' since before I can remember. Finally, I've seen it.<br/><br/>Overrated.  Maybe I was expecting too much.  A true epic.  The greatest movie ever made, even.  In truth `Ben-Hur' is a two-hour movie trapped inside a four-hour marathon.  And man, is it tiring.<br/><br/>The plot focuses on Judah Ben-Hur (Oscar winner Charlton Heston), a rich Jew with an American accent and a face like a cowboy, being framed by his Roman `friend' Messala (Stephen Boyd) for the accidental killing of a Roman official.  Messala's reason is to set an example to the rest of the Jews; get the message across that Rome is in charge.  He also sends Judah's sister and mother to jail, for reasons unexplained.<br/><br/>We follow Judah as a slave, working in the gallows of a war ship under the control of Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), a Roman warrior who sounds strangely British.  Quintus works Ben-Hur to death, then takes a liking to him, and makes sure that he's not chained to the bottom of the boat while engaging in warfare with another ship.  For saving his life, Ben-Hur returns the favor when the enemy overcomes the ship.  Quintus takes Ben-Hur back to Rome and frees him of his slavery  supposedly redeeming the character, but I guess we're supposed to forget all the other slaves that died on the ship.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur leaves Quintus  which is unfortunate because he was probably the most interesting character of the movie  and travels to his city to take vengeance on Messala.  He teams up with Esther (Hara Harareet, whose lazy eye is more interesting than her performance), the woman who he had a crush on before he became a slave, and gets help from a gaudy Arabic horse-trader, Sheik Ilderim (Oscar winner Hugh Griffith).  Tensions rise when Ben-Hur and Messala engage in a white-knuckle chariot race, where only one can come out alive.<br/><br/>Tensions plummet when I check my VCR and realize there's still an hour left. That hour is like the falling action of the film, and Jesus is thrown in to make it more interesting, I guess.  But it isn't interesting, at all, and it just makes you think, `Where the hell did this come from?' and, `When the hell is it gonna end?'  Honestly, the last hour is completely different from the first three, and in a bad way.  And don't get me wrong, I'm all for Jesus  I'm a Christian  but a film about hardcore vengeance is not to be ended with the crucifixion.<br/><br/>There are three times that `Ben-Hur' does achieve that excellent, epic feel though.  The first is when Judah is arrested and he traps himself inside a room with Messala, threatening him with a spear.  The scene is exciting and tense, and contains the movie's best acting (from Heston).  The second is the battle between the two boats, the crash especially, it is quite impressive for 1959.  The third is, of course, the chariot race.  Though it's a tad too long it'll still go down (or further down) in history as one of the greatest, most epic action scenes ever filmed, a title well deserved.<br/><br/>`Ben-Hur' set the eleven Oscar win record, which has yet to be beaten (only tied).  It should have won ten.  Which win is it that was undeserved?  Hugh Griffith's Supporting Actor Oscar.  Why, why, why did he win?  This has got to be one of the most perplexing wins in Oscar history.  It isn't a bad performance  it's good  but it's just terribly un-special, and ultimately, forgettable.  Off the top of my head I can already think of a better supporting performance from 1959: Dean Martin's from Rio Bravo.  As for the other ten, well, they were deserved, even Heston's.<br/><br/>The other four-hour epic that comes to mind is `Lawrence of Arabia', and, well, `Ben-Hur' is to `Lawrence of Arabia' what Michael Bay is to Akira Kurosawa.  The editors should've cut more.  Much more. 7.5/10."

","Gorgeously junky' I believe is how uncredited screenwriter Gore Vidal described this pseudo-Bible epic, and no truer word could possibly be said. Everything about the expansive screen version of Gen. Lew Wallace's novel is as loud as it can be-no expense was spared anywhere (I'm sure even the water that flowed over the falls in the picture garden was imported from a spring in Switzerland). What you get when you watch it now is an impressive but weighty and tiring story that really only needs about an hour and a half to tell it fully. Charlton Heston plays the title character, a mistreated Jewish nobleman who goes to prison for something he didn't do, but finds redemption in the end at the crucifixion of Jesus Christ. Lots of jolly performances all around, but the first half's high adventure spirit seems at odds with the second half's higher concentration on preaching. The most fun to be had is in watching Stephen Boyd as Massala overplay Vidal's added subtheme of Ben-Hur and Massala having been lovers in their youth, plus the totally thrilling chariot race which is everything you've heard about it and more (not to mention a masterpiece of editing). Haya Harareet is above average as the love interest, but give me Elizabeth Taylor and her eyeliner in Cleopatra any day; even though that clunky epic feels like it goes one for seven days non-stop, it's somehow more enjoyable because unlike Ben-Hur it seems to be aware of how ridiculous it is."

These are stories, though told on canvases far vaster than the CinemaScope- or Panavision-sized movie screens they were meant for, succeed because, in their best moments, they focus on the interaction between and history of as few as two characters.<br/><br/>What begins as a childhood friendship between a Roman boy and a Jewish boy in Roman-occupied Palestine, becomes, briefly, a politically-charged rivalry, and ultimately, a search for revenge by one upon the other.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston(The Ten Commandments) and Stephen Boyd(A Hill in Korea) deliver the performances of their careers, and get to chew up scenery and sets of such grandeur that Hollywood could never afford their like again.<br/><br/>This film, the greatest epic film ever made, deserves every accolade heaped upon it. The modern viewer may have to apply some patience, but at the end of the nearly four hour running time will find themselves to be vastly rewarded for it. You will find your life changed by both the scale of the film and the intimate message of friendship, betrayal, revenge--and the power of forgiveness 9/10"

","When I saw this film at the age of fifteen it flew over my head. It was just a little to much to take in. When people would ask me about it I would simply tell them it was one of the classics. Now that my mind can digest the majesty of this film I'm here to tell you that it is a tremendous achievement in film regardless of its age. The movie starts out with the accomplished Roman military leader Messallah returning to Judeah to stamp down Roman law upon the land. We find out soon that he lived in Judeah as a child and was friends with one Judah Ben-Hur who is an aristocrat that has great hope and pride in the future of his people. When the two reunite they see the difference in their views and things quickly fall to pieces. Thats all i will give for the plot. It is a complex and lengthy journey that is both thought provoking and magnificent to behold. Keep in mind when you watch the chariot race that all the footage was shot on the set. This was before visual effects could be effectively applied to add to the realism of big action scenes like this. The score is perhaps the best facet of the film still standing as one of the most celebrated scores of all time. In my top five this is at the top of the list. Don't let the length scare you away. Breath it in and you won't be disappointed."

","For its time, ""Ben-Hur"" was as big as they got-- colossal budget, gigantic sets, enormous cast, and even a pretty long running time (which, all things considered, isn't really as big as they got; ""Lawrence of Arabia"" was longer). Despite its enduring popularity, a lot of people claim that its size made it something of an empty spectacle-- all show and no substance.<br/><br/>Wrong!<br/><br/>If nothing else, the music of ""Ben-Hur"" proves that this is a movie that will actually make you ride its whole emotional tide. The Oscar-winning score is about as evocative as can be. But it's not the only thing about this movie. That huge cast is just perfect (especially Stephen Boyd, rendered utterly sinister and emotionally captivating by brown contact lenses and a fantastic acting instructor), and each scene has plenty of impressive dialogue and genuine movement to keep even this seat-tester consistently interesting.<br/><br/>Plus, on any size screen, ""Ben-Hur"" looks fantastic. There's no way around it-- no one knows how to frame a shot like the cinematographer of ""Oklahoma!"" Charlton Heston is always a captivating hero, from his wonderfully starry-eyed Moses to the gun-slinging Taylor (""Planet of the Apes,"" all you non-sci fi people). Put him at the center of a movie this incredible and the deal is sealed.<br/><br/>BEN-HUR-- *the* epic."

","The 1950s and early 1960s saw a proliferation of Biblical Epics. Two of the greatest were ""King of Kings"" and ""Ben Hur."" With an outstanding cast, magnificent sets and breathtaking cinematography, not to mention the inspirational sound score by Miklos Roza this film well earned it's 11 academy awards. It took almost a half century for another film to equal that number, which gives you some idea of the impact of this story written by an ex-civil war General and Territorial Governor of New Mexico. <br/><br/>It is a story of injustice and revenge, and yet also a story of redemption and faith. I first saw it when it was first released in 1959 and every showing of the film, incredibly long for it's day, was totally sold out. This was the role that Charlton Heston was born to play, much more so than Moses in ""The Ten Commandments."" If you have not seen this film, it should be on your must see list.

","""Ben-Hur"" is the kind of film which Hollywood will never produce again.  For one thing, in today's spectacles, so much of the scenery and even crowd scenes would be CGI and not real sets or people.  <br/><br/>Compare the pod race from ""The Phantom Menace"" with the chariot race in this film.  The first one looked like a videogame, no real suspense or drama. But Ben-Hur vs. Messala for all the marbles was one of the greatest scenes in movie history.<br/><br/>I remember that for the 2000 Oscars, most of the pre-ceremony commentators were talking about how ""Gladiator"" might match ""the record of 'Ben-Hur' with 11 Oscars."" Well, it didn't.  ""Gladiator"" was good, but ""Ben-Hur"" is one of the greatest films of all time.<br/><br/>Funny though that no one mentioned that the record was no longer really held by ""Ben-Hur"" alone, but was JOINTLY HELD by 1997's ""Titanic"" and the 1959 classic.  It meant obviously that, while Hollywood people still thought so highly of Ben-Hur 40 years later so as to proudly state that it ""held"" the record for most Oscars, it seemed that by 2001, lots of folks were already cringing over how ""Titanic"" had actually been accorded so many awards as well in 1997.  <br/><br/>The drama and the power of the storytelling will enthrall you even as the film runs 3 and a half hours.    A great movie experience, one which should really be felt on the big screen or at least on widescreen TV."

"Marokl","10","2","4","15 September 2003"," Current Formats Diminish The Film's Original Majestic Impact
","In their determination to make the most spectacular movie ever made, and the blockbuster to top all previous blockbusters, MGM and company unintentionally created a work of popular art that could only be fully appreciated in its original, pristine print, 70mm, super widescreen glory. These are the screenings moviegoers who love this film remember. The astonishing depth of field. The saturated richness of the color. The almost demented attention to detail. The overpowering use of sound and motion, especially in the chariot race. Viewed in its original format, ""Ben-Hur"" was rightly hailed a masterpiece. The vast majority of moviegoers left theatres spellbound and drained. Unfortunately, all this shock and awe is diminished when experienced via faded prints in revival theatres or the miniaturizing trivialization of video or DVD. On TV, we might as well be watching ants; hence, in all but the most extreme closeups, the emotional connection with the actors is lost.<br/><br/> Furthermore, contemporary audiences tend to find the quasi-Shakespearean acting stodgy and old-fashioned. Charlton Heston, the lead, has been especially lambasted of late for either woodenness or overacting (though how he can exemplify both is beyond be). Younger viewers should remember that he and the rest of the cast have stage backgrounds, where deep, resonant voices, trick accents, and clear diction are the standard. Considered in this light, the acting's great.<br/><br/> Finally, the late '50s was not a time for Slouching-Towards-Gomorrah hipness. Still, the 1959 ""Ben-Hur"" was as contemporary a treatment of the antique novel as one could hope for. It carefully negotiates potentially explosive theological minefields with greater respect and aplomb than Mel Gibson's recent and controversial ""The Passion."" And its literate script is astonishingly timeless in delineating the power struggles of Middle Eastern identity politics--""These people are drunk with religion."" ""How do you fight an idea?"" ""With another idea."" Sounds like CNN or Fox News to me.<br/><br/> There continues to be much to appreciate in this venerable classic, if people will give it a (four-hour) chance, and allow their mind's eye to imagine it as it once was, in 1959, on the big screen."

","And then there was Ben Hur... Everybody must have seen the film tons of times (every Easter telly shows it) and there are some things I don't understand.... Overwhelmed with Oscars, being one of the most expensive productions ever (if it wasn't a success it would have meant the bankrupcy of MGM!) but is it so much different from all those other long big movies...? Is it so much better than Cleopatra, does it differ so much from The Ten Commandments or is it so much more original than Quo Vadis? You know it isn't... The sole thing that made this movie so outstanding is the use of a wide screen and the money that was set free to build up such an unique set. The chariots-scene is of course a classic but I am convinced that it has more to do with the developped technology rather than William Wyler's talent cos after all he was a frequent director but all of them are nothing but nice pictures. The acting isn't great either... Charlton Heston plays his role in a classic way, you can even say nothing bad about it but come on, it's not outstanding, not? The scenes with Jesus...well, we saw them all in those other Biblefilms and also the story of Ben Hur lasts 3 hours and a half but can be told in a few lines, not? But as said this movie is so classic, so important that everyone must have seen it and I even dare to give it an 8 (most of the movies I watch get a 7, mind you) but 42 years later it absolutely doesn't deserve to be titled as best movie ever as so many do."

","I enjoy it whenever I look at this film.  However, this film is not the classic that everyone makes it out to be.  It is a good story but I feel that it is somewhat undermined by some poor acting.  I don't see how Charlton Heston could have beaten out James Stewart and Jack Lemmon for the Best Actor Oscar that year.  I also don't see how the film itself could have beaten out some truly worthy films such as Anatomy of a Murder and The Diary of Anne Frank.  This is a very good film but for it to be called great is somewhat of an overstatement."

What we see after this movie picture is a show of great actors playing their roles beautifully and making ""Ben-Hur"" one of the best films ever made. <br/><br/>It wasn't easy to make such epic in the late 50's. Technology was poor and shooting outside was a big problem. However, William Wyler directed this movie in a master way and made it as well as it could be. There aren't many directors who could make another ""Ben-Hur"" even with the knowledge and equipment we have today. <br/><br/>My rate 10/10"

","It wasn't until I saw this movie for perhaps the fourth or fifth time that it finally dawned on me what the point of it all was. The sub title of the novel gives us a clue ""A tale of the Christ"".  And until I became a Christian myself, the sheer magnitude and grandiosity of the production overshadowed this most important aspect: healing and forgiveness (which only Christ can give) in a time of paganism and worldliness embodied by the Roman overlords.<br/><br/>Judah Ben-Hur goes on a tortuous, harrowing, life draining, gut wrenching journey of Roman barbarism thirsting for revenge.  Put on a Roman galley to die by his boyhood friend, only his hate keeps him alive.<br/><br/>When they meet for the last time at the end of the chariot race, Judah, having been touched twice by the healing hand of the carpenter, Jesus (whose face you never see), can already sense no feeling of accomplishment by the victory over a dying Messalah (he should have won an Oscar for the death scene alone).<br/><br/>The culmination of the physical healing of his once leprous mother and sister (emblematic in the flow of blood from the cross into a stream of water) is one of the most moving in cinematic history.  Their faith has made them whole and Judah's new-found faith has liberated him from the hate that had kept him captive."

","The first movie I ever saw in the theater was the immortal BEN HUR. I was taken downtown to the Egyptian Theater in Ogden, Utah by my movie-loving parents, and the experience blew my five-year-old brains out. For years afterward, I wondered why The Egyptian didn't take down the decorations they had installed for Ben Hur. I also felt a compulsion to see any movie with a poster that looked like the one for Ben Hur. Ghenghis Khan. El Cid. Anything with giant letters crawling with historical figures drew my intense interest.<br/><br/>It's not really perfect, but I remember it that way. This movie has some pretty significant flaws--but they can be deliberately overlooked. Still, it takes some major overlooking not to notice that the horrible disfigurement of Ben Hur's mother and sister isn't... really... so... horrible. In fact you can barely see it. The way they act, you'd think they were dying of leprosy or something! Sheesh.<br/><br/>Then comes the miraculous healing. What is that, exactly? If you have the Blue Ray you'll just barely be able to see Christ's blood pouring into the cave. Otherwise, you just have to imagine it.<br/><br/>So, what does it mean when the emotional climax of a true Hollywood blockbuster is blunted by the fact that they WEREN'T that sick-looking, and the source of the healing seems to be some rain??<br/><br/>Uhhh... it means that the director should have hit this nail a little more squarely and a little harder. He needed some Hammer Horror makeup to show the lepers dragged from the dungeon, with flesh dripping off, etc. And he needed that blood to drip off a toe and then down the hill into the cave, and maybe a little more Hammer Horror technicolor blood to Hammer that point home again. Otherwise, dumb little kids like me would have to wait for years to figure it all out. I mean, come on. Give a little kid a break!<br/><br/>Other than that. TEN out of TEN.

A Legendary Epic tale above Cinematic Boundaries. Take a Bow William Wyler 🙌 How on earth he made such a visually spectacular film without CGI. Hands down to the Greatest Cinematic achievement of William Wyler. Ben Hur won 11 Oscars out of 12 Nominations, the record which is unbroken till date and don't wonder why. I don't even think anyone will challenge this record unless categories of Nominations increase yet Ben Hur to hold highest percentage of winning out of number of nominations. Ben Hur is a that rare cinema which perfectly mixtures Commercial and Critical value and such films never get old, no matter how many films are being made today with advanced technology. There is lot to learn from Ben Hur to every film maker who wish to make a grand film keeping strong content in hand. Whether it is acting, cinematography, production value, execution, writing, screenplay, climax, message for humanity or grandeur, Ben Hur just does every freaking thing so accurate. Probably, the Greatest Film of 50s Decade and arguably the Best Magnus Opus Ever. I am happy that it was Biggest Grosser of the decade but i wish it should have became a Record Grosser. Not to mention those 3 Epic scenes which left me spellbounded even after watching the film 61 years post it's original release. The sea battle, the chariot race and the climax. That grandeur, scene making, visuals, those big sets are Magnificent. The efforts of entire crew and the Vision of Director for this Film is damn too high, i just can't think enough finding adjectives. I am happy to announce that i found a 10/10 film after a long time. I just didn't enjoy the Cinematic majesty but also i loved the content. Hats off to the Entire Team of Ben Hur 🙏

","Don't allow the long running time scare you off and prevent you from watching this glorious epic. It is as sensational now as it was over 60 years ago, and completely stands the test of time. This glorious heart felt story will grip you from the very beginning and keep you going through the profound ending that involves the greatest man who ever walked the face of our Earth. Subtitled as ""A Tale of the Christ"", this is the saga of Hebrew royal Judah Ben Hur who suffers much in order to find his way back to God, and indeed, he encounters the man known as Christ. Judah finds betrayal from his childhood best friend (Stephen Boyd), ends up a galley slave on a ship that burns up when suddenly attacked, is set free by the captain (Jack Hawkins) he saves, and finds himself facing a violent death when he ends up in a chariot race with Boyd, set on killing him. Tragedy involving his mother (Martha Scott) and sister (Cathy O'Donnell) adds more stress, but one last encounter with the stranger Jesus opens up the possibility for his true salvation.<br/><br/>There are more than just a few coincidences between this and Heston's previous biblical epic, ""The Ten Commandments"". both more powerful remakes of silent films, and both featured Martha Scott as Heston's mother. They both feature Heston being betrayed by someone he's known all his life and banished, returning to settle the score in a way that isn't filled with vengeance. Heston does have a grudge to hold against Boyd, and he plays out the transition of Heston's goals as the plot changes angles in making Heston 100% whole. Like the later ""Greatest Story Ever Told"", Heston encounters Jesus, but unlike his over-the-top performance as John the Baptist, Judah Ben Hur is played with subtlety, sincerity and grace, and there's a sense of humbleness that was missing in later Heston performances.<br/><br/>Jesus isn't the only historical figure to appear, as there are also spots briefly for Pontius Pilate and Tiberius Caesar as well. The Oscar Winning role played by Hugh Griffith (the Arab man who provides Heston with four gorgeous white horses for the chariot race) is flamboyant and filled with earthy humor, making him steal every scene that he is in. Palestine born actress Haya Harareet .makes a nice impression as Heston's love interest, determined to protect him by keeping the secret kept by Scott and O'Donnell from him. The sequences involving this subplot are truly heartbreaking.<br/><br/>Every detail in this film is excellent, from the widescreen photography to the editing and glorious musical score and the sets. you will not want to take your eyes off the screen for one moment during The Chariot race, and to put it bluntly, you may not even want to take your eyes off the screen while this film is on. Like other films that show Christ's crucifixion, that element is very disturbing, but is truly moving because it gives its hero the motivation to go on and be a better person. Films like this can often come off as preachy or sanctimonious, but after multiple viewings, it still gave me chills as it reached its heart-wrenching conclusion. There is a sincerity in the screenplay and the direction and the structure that prevents it from seeming to obviously proud of itself. It succeeds in every mission that it set out to strive for."

","Happy Easter, everyone! To celebrate, I watched Ben-Hur AND The Greatest Story Ever Told on TCM. I have seen Ben-Hur 5 times in my life, and it never ceases to amaze me. Watching it on Easter Sunday only broadened the experience it gives.<br/><br/>The movie follows Ben-Hur, a Judean prince betrayed by his Roman friend and enslaved as a result. Years pass, and he seeks revenge. While he succeeds, he still has a hole in his heart, only to be fulfilled by a kind stranger who is later crucified. (Can you guess who He is?)<br/><br/>Ben-Hur was a huge hit when it came out. While it cost $15 million to make, it made roughly 9 times that in the box office! And mind you-this is in 1959!<br/><br/>Not only that, but it won 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture. Bible movies like The Robe and The Ten Commandments were nominated for the honor but lost to From Here To Eternity and Around The World In 80 Days, respectively. Ben-Hur, however, did win, and it's the only religious film to ever do so, unless you count Chariots of Fire.<br/><br/>Back to the 11 awards, this has been equaled twice by Titanic in 1997 and Lord of the Rings: Return of the King in 2003, but it has never been topped. That alone is quite astonishing.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur deserves all of the praise it gets and it highly succeeds as an epic. Ask anyone what some of the best epics ever made are, and you'll get Ben-Hur any second. They would foolish to not do so, even if they have never seen it. Unless they have never even heard of the movie, to which you may want to make sure they are part of the human race. Ben-Hur is a flawless model of a grand epic, for countless reasons.<br/><br/>Allow me to start with the look of the movie. The costumes are glorious to look it, whether it be a Jew's robe or a centurion's glimmering suit. The cinematography is also still beautiful to look at 61 years later, and it hasn't aged all that much.<br/><br/>In fact, everything visual that Ben-Hur has to offer shines to the highest extent. It's no wonder that the cinematography, costume design, and other similar film-making aspects were awarded at the Oscars.<br/><br/>Then of course, there's the Christian elements of Ben-Hur. I have asked atheists before what their favorite religious films are, and quite a few people have cited Ben-Hur among them. This shows that a lack of belief in Jesus does not diminish the power of this grand epic.<br/><br/>Many modern Christian movies are disliked, and one reason is because the religious message is put before the story. In other words, the message is hammered in, and the story is put last. Those who feel this way should put Ben-Hur on their must watch list.<br/><br/>Jesus is the center of the message, but He is barely shown. In fact, we never hear His voice or see His face. We hear others repeat His words, but Christ Himself is mute whenever He appears. This makes for a unique depiction of Him, and His message actually speak louder than words, to use a common phrase.<br/><br/>While the common Christian message that Jesus died for mankind is shown, another one shines more-Christ-like love. When Ben-Hur sees that God loves him so much that He became man to die for him, he finds the strength to forgive his Roman friend-turned-enemy.<br/><br/>If Christ can forgive all the sins of all mankind, how could he not forgive the one sin of his betrayer? I struggle with this myself, but it's still inspiring.<br/><br/>Oh, and who can forget to mention the most iconic scene, and rightfully so? The chariot race. Ben-Hur challenges his enemy to a chariot race as his revenge, and it's gripping to watch. Words would fail me to describe it, it must be seen to be believed and agreed on that it's so great.<br/><br/>No matter your religious beliefs, or lack thereof, you owe it to yourself to see Ben-Hur. It's a masterpiece that works on many levels-visually, thematically, and spiritually, among others.<br/><br/>As I watched it, I realized a Biblical epic of this level and quality has not been made since The Passion of the Christ, which released 45 years later. That's disappointing. I wish more Biblical epics could be made on this level. But for now, I'll be eternally grateful for the powerful epic that is Ben-Hur.<br/><br/>Note: I wrote this review on Easter Sunday but due to the late hour it will say that it posted the day after.<br/><br/>Warning: I should mention that the movie runs for 212 minutes, or 3 hours and 32 minutes. I personally feel that the time goes by quite decently, but be prepared for that before you watch it. Prepare and plan accordingly."

William Wyler's Ben-Hur is one of the greatest epics in cinematic history. The film changed the medium forever and is a stunning accomplishment in film. Ben-Hur is a masterful piece of cinema that combines action and drama. The performances delivered by the actors are flawless and the film is powerful, exciting and of course epic in scope. Ben-Hur has some of the most iconic scenes ever put on film. Most notably the chariot race, which is a behemoth of excitement and superbly well staged, and is one of the most iconic scenes in Ben-Hur, not to mention in cinematic history. Ben-Hur is a film that is grand, epic and too big for words. This is an exciting, well acted film. Though Ben-Hur has some religious overtones, it doesn't overdo it, and it manages to be fairly limited in its content. The film is a standout piece of cinema that blends drama and action beautifully and will satisfy people who enjoy grand cinematic epics. Ben-Hur remains the film of which all grand sword and sandal epics are judged upon. With a great cast, a majestic score, stellar action and dramatic sequences, Ben-Hur's place in the cinematic medium is assured. Ben-Hur still ranks among Hollywood's finest examples of pure entertainment. Ben-Hur still ranks among Hollywood's finest examples of pure entertainment."

","And take heed, as Pee-wee Herman pointed out, ""Everyone I know has a big but."" (Everybody in Hollywood knows that, if Pee-wee Herman says so, or Harvey Weinstein, Einstein or Frankenstein, it's got to be true!)<br/><br/>The 1959 movie Ben-Hur? It's an epic at near the top of the list, among those big budget, gargantuan efforts that were well pulled-off, like Gone with the Wind, or The Bridge on the River Kwai. Neither Ben-Hur or Gone with the Wind need another review: it's pretty common as dirt these movies are lauded as historic achievements, that about everybody knows about them. To rate either of those films lowly, or even lukewarm, would have to be somebody disappointed there were no slasher scenes or views of private parts of Hollywood A-list actors. Nobody needs this review. Alright then, nobody needs any of my reviews, but please keep that to yourself. Then again, you never know: you may need this one, as I'm going to rebel, starting now, encroach upon movie database territory. But, rest assured, it is for your own good and edification.<br/><br/>As great a movie as the 1959 Ben-Hur is, I'm here to tell you that it's chopped liver, yes, just so, compared to the novel, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, by General Lew Wallace. In fact, the movie does not capture the Ben-Hur of the novel, more human, more conflicted, more flawed and vulnerable. The Ben-Hur of the novel is not quite Charlton Heston, that is, Moses moonlighting. The movie omits important plot elements, the story even altered, this surely to conserve run time, but the movie is not the story of the novel, in some important ways, lacking entire, major subplots. And while the ending of the movie is wonderful, would never fault it, it's not the ending of the novel, does not provide what happened next.<br/><br/>I believe, like most very rich, classic novels, one can't properly tell them, except by a mini-series of many hours, however long that must be. Nor would it be fair, practical, to expect that producers pour that sort of money into projects, or expect viewers to sit through, say, a dozen hours, at least in a theater. So, this is not to whine, but to simply tell you that you must read the novel, Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ, because, as great as the movie is, it's simply a trailer, to the book. The book is that good, and it is also a book that could change your life."

","I had been meaning to watch this for a long time but had been put off due to the runtime. I finally decided to sit down and watch it as it was recently covered on the ""Unspooled"" podcast (which is fantastic) and im so glad I did as it was fantastic. <br/><br/>The runtime went much faster than I expected and there were very few times I felt it dragged. The acting was absolutely superb and the character development was very moving and memorable throughout. <br/><br/>Without a doubt the best part of the movie was the set designs, environment and authenticity of the time. Most classic movies age poorly and it's clear that special effects would help improve these, but I actually think the lack of special effects is what makes this movie what it is. <br/><br/>The horse racing scene is one of the most memorable scenes I've ever scene watching films. The grand scale of the stadium, the crowd and the filming of the actual race is unbelievable. It is beautiful to watch but also brutal and scary. The destruction and injury that occurs is so natural that it makes it hard to watch in the best if ways. <br/><br/>There was much more religious tones to the movie than I expected and to be honest I think it was a little bit of overkill in that area, particularly the second half of the film. <br/><br/>While many will be put off by the runtime, this is a must see movie that will stick with you forever and I do think it's the single most well shot and set epic I've ever seen. The scenery, sets, crowds and authenticity really is something to behold and this strongly deserves to be known as one of the best movies of all time. <br/><br/>Have given it an 8 rather than a 10 due to the length (could have been about 30 mins shorter), the amount of religious tones that come into it which becomes a bit too much in my opinion, and lack of rewatchability as I don't know if I ever will rewatch it. Despite that though it's a classic everyone should see once."

"ancientliteraturehistory","10","0","0","12 September 2016"," Fifty Seven Years Later, The 1959 Epic Still Reigns Supreme. Alongside The 1925 Silent Classic, This Photoplay Is Verily A Tale Of The Christ.
","William Wyler's epic remake of the 1925 silent classic Ben-Hur: A Tale Of The Christ is magnificent in every way. The acting, the screenplay, the music, the directing; all of it is pure perfection, and it was made for $85 million less than the spectacular chariot crash that is the 2016 version, and it earned nigh thrice the amount it cost to make. Every dollar spent on this production is seen on the screen, and it is a spectacle to behold on the silver screen, should Metro Goldwyn Mayer ever choose to re-release this epic photo-play in cinemas. For now, though, the best way to view it is in the comfort of your own home, whether via Blu-Ray, DVD, On Demand, or whenever Turner Classic Movies airs the film, which is usually during Christmas (along with the 1925 silent classic) and Easter.<br/><br/>Yes, this photo-play takes liberties with General Lew Wallace's masterful tome, but the central elements of the novel are all on display here, including the message of Jesus, which is the crux of the novel. If a screenplay were to be written that was painstakingly faithful to the novel, it would make an excellent miniseries. However, this masterpiece is so well regarded that I do not think anyone would dare attempt it, especially in the political and social climate that is prevailing now. Sadly, this is no longer 1959, where family values and respect and reverence for God Almighty were virtues to aspire to, not sneer at, and where content in cinematic photo-plays was strictly regulated by the Hays Production Code enacted in 1932, which is why any attempt to create a respectful photo-play of Lew Wallace's beautiful novel with Christ's message intact, in addition to the subplots and the Epilogue, would not be well received, let alone picked up by any major studio.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is so well known I shall not recount it. All I will say is that you would do very well to read the novel which has spawned (so far) four photo-plays, one television series and one animated direct-to-DVD version. Then, see the 1907 short film, the 1925 epic, the 1959 epic, the 2003 animated version, the dreadful 2010 miniseries, and the 2016 version, and decide which one you like best. Of the six aforementioned photo-plays, five of them will not interest children, so I recommend showing them the 2003 animated version, which I think is faithful to the novel, incorporating some dialogue from the book into the screenplay and of course stars Charlton Heston in his final film role before his retirement from acting due to Alzheimer's Disease as Ben-Hur. You may cringe at a certain change regarding a central character (as the fate of said character differs from the novel and the five aforementioned photo-plays), but this was done to make it suitable for young children, and it was a wise idea; however, Jesus is still a major part of the film, hence the animated version bears the novel's subtitle A Tale Of The Christ, which two of the aforementioned ones retain, whilst the miniseries and new cinematic version eschew it.<br/><br/>The 1925 and 1959 versions are so good you will not notice the passing of time. Yes, the silent version may bore you if you are not inured to the acting of the silent era, but you will be missing out on a classic. Charlton Heston, in my opinion, does not overact, neither do any of the actors in both versions. The latter version earned every Academy Award it won in 1960. <br/><br/>Mild spoilers for the 2003, 2010 and 2016 photo-plays.<br/><br/>The 1907 short film is available for viewing online. The 1925 silent version is Not Rated, but contains three brief scenes of nudity, which are fleeting and not exploitative. The 1959 version was initially Not Rated, but has since been rated G. The 2003 direct-to-DVD version is Not Rated, and is suitable for children. The 2010 miniseries is Not Rated, but be warned: the DVD version contains three scenes of nudity including one graphic sex scene to which there is no lead-in, and one moderate sex scene with nudity. The edited-for-television version of the miniseries contains just a shot of Ben-Hur nude from the rear. The 2016 version is rated PG-13 for sequences of violence and disturbing images; the violence in this version is more intense than it is in the aforementioned versions, and there is a mild shot of Ben-Hur and Esther post coitus seen from the shoulders up."

","This movie picture, awarded with eleven Oscar, is not worth much. It is a low example of Roman pictures at Hollywood worse way. It means that they spend a lot of money but there are not talent at all inside the product. The responsible was a man like once solid and talented William Wyler, an film-maker with a long and proven experience. American cinema must be grateful to him (The Westerner, Mrs. Miniver, The Best Years of Our Lives, The Collector), but not for this picture. This Ben-Hur is a very long subject index of Roman cinema common places (sometimes even becomes involuntarily hilarious and childish). The best sequence -the chariots race- could be made by any craftsman less prestigious than Wyler. Of course I do prefer Quo Vadis (1951) or Italian Roman movies like Teodora Slave Empress (1953). Less money, more interesting result. Everything is colossal at this Ben-Hur (there are another one dumb) including the story written by Gore Vidal and some more people. A conscious Vidal prefer stay uncredited."

","Well, 11 Oscras is not a mere trifle to forget about, but then, there are films that do not age well. Ben-Hur is of that caste, no matter what aficionados would say in anger. I watched it again and again very carefully to get the mood and see how well it speaks to us now. What do we have? The sub-title for the movie stated The Life Of The Christ - yes, Heis there, but this movie is not about Him and is not a Chrisitan movie. Wyler made a very typical grand scheme Hollywood blockbuster that impresses to some degree. Yes, but then, the glaring minuses speak up - 1. The film is tediously overlong, the absolutely unnecessary Prologue and Entr'Acte only kill time. 2. The blatantly obvious poorly painted backstage serving as a city or a valley look laughingly now, and obviously too cheap. 3. The play of main actors is not so deep, too. Overwrought and overblown emotions fit a theater stage more, here they look a bit funny, where it was not to be so. 4. Two most famous scenes - ship battle and horse ride are very long, too, and lack tension. They are well done, yes, but now they pale into banality. 5. The overall sentimental element is too much, too present, too loud that the whole epic dives into a syrupy melodrama.<br/><br/>Well, this is a fine time-piece but that is all"
"secondtake","8","3","8","23 December 2012"," The best of it is unsurpassed epic movie-making, but it's a message heavy movie
","Ben-Hur (1959)<br/><br/>Long. Epic. Beautiful.<br/><br/>Is it also ponderous? Maybe--especially if you have seen other Biblical era epics (""Greatest Story"" or ""Spartacus"") or if you don't quite click with the material. Is it what you would call a good movie, or a great one? It has the credentials, including Best Picture. But it also is filled with secondary actors to support the dubious leading man, Charlton Heston (who gives one of the performances of his life, for sure, and has openly credited the director for that).<br/><br/>The director is none other than the consummate professional, the ever-versatile and polished William Wyler. And he takes a huge story with grandiose necessities and makes it really watchable. And epic. And with cinematographer Robert Surtees (look at that man's film list!) it's certainly an exquisitely beautiful movie, and very very widescreen, shot with double sized 65mm film, the IMAX of its day.<br/><br/>The story is of a Jewish man named Ben Hur who survives persecution from the Romans, including his boyhood friend, and becomes a master chariot driver and a believer in the peaceful ways of his contemporary, and upstart Jesus of Nazareth. Yes, the movie is supposedly about Prince Hur but in fact it's all aimed at illuminated Christ, always indirectly, but in the end with surprising power. We only see Jesus from behind, or from a distance, or in small part (his hand is shown nailed to the cross, for example), yet we feel his aura in the few scenes where his is present. His affect on Hur in their brief encounter is touching and pointed.<br/><br/>We need to see that Hur himself is a kind of Christ figure, but a flawed one, a secondary man by comparison (which elevated the primary one further). Hur says early on that he rejects violence, which was not an especially contemporary attitude, especially as the Romans are occupying his home town. He then goes on to show mercy to the very people who want to abuse and kill him (that is, he turns the other cheek). He wins in the end not by killing, but by setting a good example, by being deeply good in the face of unfair hardship. It isn't clear he is a believer in particular, other than his deep rooted faith in his people, the Jews.<br/><br/>Context matters here, just a decade or so after the defeat of the Nazis. The Romans are presented as the evil colonizing empire, greeting each other by raising their arms in what I grew up calling the ""Nazi salute."" Their colors and even their symbolism (a big eagle) are Nazi echoes. And the victims of the Nazis and the Romans equally are the Jews. Take this an important step further, and we see that there is a not-so-subtle subtext that the contemporary inhabitants of this area, recently named Israel, belong there. Hur even reminds his Roman friend to remember that the Jews lived there before the Romans ever came along.<br/><br/>The movie works best as a story of power, of virtue, of Christian morality, of individual triumph. It also works as a visual and visceral epic. Scene after scene is stunning to just look at, and I'm sure in a big theater (remember going to movies in a full sized theater?) it was a true spectacle movie. We forget how important the venue is in ""getting"" the movie in spatial, visual terms (that's one reason Westerns survived so well into the 1950s and are not thriving now).<br/><br/>The themes of love, romantic as well as family love, are important here but are thin, filled with empty clichés and total lack of chemistry (perhaps on purpose for a movie with religious intentions). The writing is solid but lacks magic. The editing might be faulted for being a bit indulgent at times, letting scenes roll for their pageantry when we might rather get moving. And ultimately the acting is often more functional than inspired. In a way I respect Heston for pulling off a role burdened with stiff archetypes of the wise hero. Many of the actors are doing their level best with a script that has a message, and you can't quite get the drama directly when the message is itching to be heard, too. Some of the acting is actually a hair lame (Cathy O'Donnell, who I adore in other movies like ""They Live by Night,"" is really awful once you notice her, which is really a casting problem more than anything).<br/><br/>So I resort to nitpicking because somehow as wonderful and impressive as it all was and is, I wasn't swept away. It's not a completely gripping and moving film.<br/><br/>Yes, there are ways of approaching this weighty classic other than saying its a dated religious picture or that it's a profound late-Golden Age masterpiece. It's neither, and both. And it's definitely worth seeing if you have a long long evening for it."

","If you don't get the summary joke or hate me because of it, I can't change that. Why I chose it though? I'll come back to that in a second, but let's start: <br/><br/>For the sheer scope of the movie you have to love it. By scope I mean the photography (beautiful pictures) and the sound (a fantastic sound design, that could be used to teach students about film music). All this though has to work as a whole. And it does work. It's a good movie and because of it's length and the quality of it's production it's regarded as one of the classic movies of all times.<br/><br/>Call it sacrilege though, but I do have some objections to that. Yes it is a fine movie (after all I gave it a 7/10, which is pretty good in my book, although far away from great), but it is just too darn long! And that is where my summary line/reference comes into play. And although we're following Ben Hur, there's a very big side story (the title of the movie was originally named after ""that side story"" too). And although the similarities in both the sub- and main plot are evident it just makes the whole thing longer ... Epic movie it is then, in all the meanings that there are. An essential movie to watch, but afterwards don't be afraid to say that you thought it was too long!"

","This is excellent for what it is, but what is it? <br/><br/>Some will say it is an exciting blockbuster, others a Greek tragedy or heroic epic, or even cinematic opera with its focus on riveting but stagy drama and lush, harmonious cinemascope. It is of course all those things woven in one. The story is the same archetypal journey since Ulysses and Mahabharata—the hero is torn in the waking world of logical opposites, good and evil, duty to country against friendship and ambition, defeated with the divine trickery of a loose tile, thrust into hell to suffer oaring for some time, from where he emerges as a 'son' in splendid white clothes, and revitalized returns home to claim victory and love.<br/><br/>That is the standard reading anyway such as you'd see in those screen writing guidebooks, not much interesting.<br/><br/>It is at the same time a 'tale of the Christ', and this is a bit more fruitful in its spiritual dimension; the film does not end with material victory over the hated opponent, there is no peace to be found there. The idea is that the hero is properly a man when he learns to let go, forgive and accept transience. In this context, the journey is one of self realization not world redemption.<br/><br/>You will see this with some clarity when Ben-Hur symbolically visits his mother and sister in some horrible underworld, but he realizes he cannot see them and only listens as they wish him well. Parting from there, he chances upon the Sermon on the Mount—one of the three Magi of Bethlehem is there, a mentor who reveals that 'the child is now a man' (he is talking about Jesus) and we know this also applies on a second level to the protagonist.<br/><br/>But he won't listen, being perhaps too proud or harried to sit and reflect, which only prolongs his torment for a while more, that is until he realizes who the rabbi is and follows the passions from up close.<br/><br/>Oh the presentation is archaic and sermonizing, which is to say from the outside, symbolically presenting reflection but not making it the fabric so that you reflect.<br/><br/>What is of more interest to me is noting this bit on the cinematic dimension: the contrast between a placid theatricality in the Jesus portions, with some exciting perspectives in the ship and chariot race segments which captivate the eye. <br/><br/>The first is impersonal and removed from experience, imparting the awe of spectacle but not the spiritual essence, you will see for instance Calvary Hill as a stage in the distance. The latter exhibit a dynamism and placement of the eye inside the swirl of life, for instance the subjective shots of rowers looking out at the battle from ports in the hull of the galley or the powerful shots of dashing chariots as they hurl through the racetrack. There's cinematic energy here that sweeps you into what it is, instead of making you a spectator of opera.<br/><br/>What is interesting is that the filmmaker, the very talented Wyler, had the immersive means but rested his hand outside the action."

","Ben-Hur is an epic historical drama film set in ancient Rome starring Charlton Heston in the title role of a rebellious Israelite Jew who takes on the Roman Empire during the time of Christ.Included in the cast are Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith and Haya Harareet.It was directed by William Wyler.<br/><br/>In AD 26, Judah Ben-Hur is a wealthy prince and merchant in Jerusalem. His childhood friend, the Roman citizen Messala, is now a tribune. After several years away from Jerusalem, Messala returns as the new commander of the Roman garrison. Messala believes in the glory of Rome and its imperial power, while Ben-Hur is devoted to his faith and the freedom of the Jewish people. Messala asks Ben-Hur for the names of Jews who criticize the Romans. Ben-Hur refuses.Ben-Hur lives with his mother, Miriam, and sister, Tirzah. Their loyal slave Simonides is preparing for an arranged marriage for his daughter, Esther. Ben-Hur gives Esther her freedom as a wedding present, and the audience is shown that Ben-Hur and Esther are in love even though her marriage to another man is imminent. During the parade for the new governor of Judea, Valerius Gratus, a tile falls from the roof of Ben-Hur's house. Gratus is thrown from his horse and nearly killed. Although Messala knows this was an accident, he condemns Ben-Hur to the galleys and imprisons Miriam and Tirzah. By punishing a known friend and prominent citizen, he hopes to intimidate the Jewish populace. Ben-Hur swears to take revenge. Dying of thirst when his slave gang arrives at Nazareth, Ben-Hur collapses. But a local carpenter (whom the audience realizes is Jesus) gives him water.<br/><br/>After three years as a galley slave, Ben-Hur is assigned to the flagship of the Roman Consul Quintus Arrius, who has been charged with destroying a fleet of Macedonian pirates. Arrius admires Ben-Hur's self-discipline and offers to train him as a gladiator or charioteer. Ben-Hur declines the offer, declaring that God will aid him in his quest for vengeance. The Roman fleet encounters the Macedonians. Arrius orders all the rowers except Ben-Hur to be chained to their benches. Arrius' galley is rammed and sunk, but Ben-Hur unchains the other rowers, and saves Arrius' life. Arrius believes the battle ended in defeat, but Ben-Hur prevents him from committing suicide. Ben-Hur and Arrius are rescued, and Arrius is credited with the Roman fleet's victory. The consul successfully petitions Emperor Tiberius to free Ben-Hur, and adopts him as his son. Several years pass off-screen. Now wealthy, Ben-Hur learns Roman ways and becomes a champion charioteer, but longs for his family and homeland.Ben-Hur returns to Judea. Along the way, he meets Balthasar and an Arab sheik, Ilderim . The sheik has heard of Ben-Hur's prowess as a charioteer, and asks him to drive his quadriga in a race before the new Judean governor Pontius Pilate. Ben-Hur declines, even after he learns that champion charioteer Messala will also compete.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur returns to his home in Jerusalem. He meets Esther, and learns her arranged marriage did not occur and that she is still in love with him. He visits Messala and demands his mother and sister's freedom. The Romans discover that Miriam and Tirzah contracted leprosy in prison, and expel them from the city. The women beg Esther to conceal their condition from Ben-Hur, so she tells him that his mother and sister died. It is then that he changes his mind and decides to seek vengeance on Messala by competing against him in the chariot race. During the chariot race, Messala drives a chariot with blades on the hubs to tear apart competing vehicles. In the violent and grueling race, Messala attempts to destroy Ben-Hur's chariot but destroys his own instead. Messala is mortally injured, while Ben-Hur wins the race. Before dying, Messala tells Ben-Hur that ""the race is not over"" and that he can find his family ""in the Valley of the Lepers, if you can recognize them."" Ben-Hur visits the nearby leper colony, where (hidden from their view) he sees his mother and sister.<br/><br/>Esther hears Jesus preach the Sermon on the Mount, and tells Ben-Hur about the message of peace and forgiveness she heard. Blaming Roman rule for his family's fate, Ben-Hur rejects his patrimony and Roman citizenship. Learning that Tirzah is dying, Ben-Hur and Esther take her and Miriam to see Jesus, but the trial of Jesus before Pontius Pilate has begun. Jesus begins his march to Calvary and stumbles before Ben- Hur. Recognizing Jesus from their earlier meeting, Ben-Hur attempts to give him water but guards separate them.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur witnesses the crucifixion of Jesus. Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed. Ben-Hur tells Esther that he heard Jesus talk of forgiveness while on the cross, and says ""I felt His voice take the sword out of my hand.""<br/><br/>This is a masterpiece of epic film-making, a profound religious experience and one of the greatest films ever made.It won a record 11 Academy Awards, including Best Picture, an accomplishment that was not equaled until many years later by Titanic in 1997 and The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King in 2003.In the lead, Heston is stiff, and the writing is uneven, but overall, it's a rousing epic done on a massive scale with hundreds of sets and extras, and a priceless race scene that could still be appreciated at present.Finally,it is one of the most powerful and successful biblical epics ever to come out of Hollywood."

","I've rarely seen this film, but when I have, I've always enjoyed it. Not as a religious parable, as I am not religious whatsoever, but more of a story of triumph through strength, resilience, and perseverance. ""Cleopatra"" had none of those elements going for it; just a couple of spoiled rich kids frolicking on the screen at the expense of broken hearts and egos of those involved. I truly do like this film better than ""Cleopatra"", but then again I like ""Spartacus"" better than either of these films.<br/><br/>""Ben Hur"" tells the tail of a rich noble from outside the Roman social elite who is fallen victim to his friend's own stalworthiness to the adherence of Roman law. The initial tale was a novel with religious overtones, upon which Hollywood picked up on (specifically Warner Brothers, and I think RKO before that for the silent version ... someone correct me there), produced and marketed to the movie going audience. It was a hit.<br/><br/>A bigger hit, and continues to be a classic today (again, moreso than the Burton-Taylor escapade) for the reason that we witness a man fall from grace to rebuild himself once more. And, once there, to triumph like never before.<br/><br/>Older viewers will like this film for its placation to ancient and modern mythologies. Regular film aficionados will like it for its scope, production values, and place in cinema history. That, and simply put, even though Cleopatra had the marvel of spectacle going for it (the sail barge, the magnificent entourage as Taylor first entered Rome, and so forth), Ben Hur is a better film for it reliance on basic cinematic principles. There is no less spectacle here to be sure, but the presentation of characters and setting are far more grounded and connect with the audience than ever could be done in ""Cleopatra"".<br/><br/>The shortcoming, regrettably, are again the special effects, and specifically the naval miniatures. I mean, it is 1959 after all, but still, surely something could have been done, particularly given that the silent film spare no expense in building a Roman fleet to clash with pirates of the Mediterranean. Other than that, even the dark interior scenes, are superbly lit for the time.<br/><br/>There's lots to say about ""Ben Hur"", but, simply put, other than ""Spartacus"", it is the superior sword-and-sandal epic.<br/><br/>Younger viewers will get impatient with its pacing, but older viewers will like it all the same.<br/><br/>Definitely give it a whirl on the DVD player.<br/><br/>p.s. regarding the Krishna (Christian) mythology; the story works without it, but it's there regardless. You religious types will pour over it, but it really is unnecessary, and again, it's a bastardization of imported Indian philosophy to the Roman Empire."
"aernest","10","2","5","25 November 2009"," Pick one movie...
","If I were forced at gunpoint to pick one favorite movie, it would probably be Ben Hur. Sure, it's an epic spectacle, and I love that aspect of it, but it also has some surprisingly intimate moments as well. What can I say that hasn't already been said about this movie? It looks great, it sounds great, the acting is superb on all counts, and the screenplay is genius. I saw one reviewer complain about the ""flowery dialog,"" but that was by design. Christopher Fry was brought in to prettify the screenplay after Gore Vidal had his way with it, and I think Fry added just the right amount of archaisms to set the mood. Miklos Rosza's score is perfect - the best one he ever did, I think, and that's saying quite a bit! This movie has a beauty that CGI will never attain, though I know there are quite a few practical effects in it. And the actors - I really can't think of a weak performance in the movie. Haya Harareet is just luminous, and I never saw her in anything else. Charlton Heston never looked, acted, or sounded better. I can't imagine anyone else's having the heroic stature to carry this role. They don't make 'em like Chuck anymore. This movie is a cultural icon - if you haven't seen it, do so immediately."
"jzappa","9","2","5","4 September 2008"," A Truly Breathtaking and Perhaps Profound Classic Blockbuster
","William Wyler's powerful giant of a film is not only the most appealing and most bearable of Hollywood's classic biblical epics but also the most well made that I have seen. It does not rise above its kind, keeping in the genre and period tradition of grandiose exhibition and theatrical histrionics, nevertheless this glorious entertainment utilizes these characteristics as well as they could possibly be done within the boundaries of genre, formula and audience. Unlike a Cecil B. DeMille film like The Ten Commandments, exhibition is not exhibitionism but a depiction of its story's large and adventurous scale. Moreover, Wyler does not sacrifice his masterful deep-focus cinematography and gracefully dramatic cuts for the sake of blindsiding the audience with spectacle.<br/><br/>The pure degree of this movie, this event, in the days before digitally produced crowds and computer-generated process shots, is almost beyond belief. The film's vivid color, for instance, is insatiable. The chief action sequence, the truly timeless chariot race, remains breathtaking after half a century of visual effects progression, no matter what the cost, even an actor's life. After all, he died for art!<br/><br/>As one can see as a definite pattern in Wyler's filmography, Ben-Hur is a memorable revenge tale, one that skillfully avoids two-facedness alongside its religious message of forgiveness. A less than savory person but an undeniably fine actor, Charlton Heston stars as the title character, a Jewish prince whose childhood friendship, and suggested hues of homoerotic attraction, with Messala, played by Stephen Boyd, turns to hate when Messala becomes a Roman officer who willfully betrays him and his family in spite of their loving history together.<br/><br/>There is dense substance that I took from the film. Not belonging to any Christian denomination or any religion at all, I found myself to be very enlightened by the film's portrayal of Christ's crucifixion from the perspective of characters not involved in the Bible's stories at all. Although the life of Christ is sketched from his birth to his veiled life to his communal sermonizing to his passion and death, we clearly see or hear him. By the end, I found myself understanding more clearly than ever of what the exchange really consisted when Jesus ""died for our sins."" It is portrayed exceptionally and naturally, just like the film's striking image of the redemptive crucifixion. At the same time, it is done so reverently that it even made the Vatican film list. I wonder if they knew the director was a Jew."
"gcd70","8","2","5","29 August 2008"," Epic of epics
","The epic of epics, ""Ben-Hur"" is quite a treat at the cinema (especially the Astor with its new super-screen and Dolby Digital Sound). In three hours ""Ben-Hur"" only lapses a couple of times into rather wishy-washy melodrama. Otherwise director William Wyler has presented a forceful, strikingly visual film about a Jewish man's quest for vengeance, and the way in which he gains that recompense.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"" opens by telling us it is a ""tale of the Christ"". Misleading really, considering only a handful of references are made to Jesus. Why the story of our Lord was tied in is a mystery, and seemingly not necessary. Perhaps Karl Turnberg (screenwriter) was trying hard to be true to the original novel. Certainly the focus is not on forgiveness, though love having the power to set you free and love being stronger than hate are central themes.<br/><br/>As I have said, the film looks awesome. The enormous sets are lavish, contributing to an overall production design that is second to none. Cinematography goes one better, with several knockout scenes culminating in the legendary chariot race, which lives up to its billing as the most spectacular chase of all time.<br/><br/>The cast are strong too, with the forceful presence of Charlton Heston a big factor. Support from Stephen Boyd (as Messala) and Jack Hawkins (as adoptive father Quitus Arrius) is good too. An excitable turn from an Arabian horse owner is a special highlight.<br/><br/>Definitely the stuff of which legends are made. Eleven academy awards speak for themselves (a record only equalled thirty-eight years later by ""Titanic"").<br/><br/>Sunday, May 3, 1998 - Astor Theatre<br/><br/>Bigger than big, ""Ben Hur"" is the sort of film one must see on the big screen (Melbourne's Astor Theatre comes highly recommended). Viewing this epic on video means losing out on the grand scale of the production. The enormous sets, the costumes, the larger than life characters, and that chariot race. ""Ben Hur"" may be the greatest film of all time (open to debate), but whatever the case may be, it must be seen at the movies.<br/><br/>Thursday, April 29, 1999 - Video"
"smatysia","8","2","5","20 July 2008"," Must be judged in the context of its time and subject
","A truly epic film. As is well known, an awful lot of effort and money were spent in making it. Charlton Heston was, well, Charlton Heston. If his acting seems wooden to modern audiences, well, I'm sure that he was giving the director exactly what he asked for. As a previous commentator has mentioned, people in ancient times, at least the aristocrats, spoke, wrote, and behaved much more formally and floridly than people do now. Kudos to the Israeli actress who portrayed Esther. Such raven-haired beauty. There was a great deal of historical inaccuracy, but audiences were not such sticklers for realism in those days. And, oh my God, that chariot race scene! Amazing for its time. It stands up to any modern action scene.<br/><br/>I was surprised to realize that I had never actually seen this film until now. I expect that I had seen parts on TV as a child, but never sat through the whole thing. It does drag at times, and the treatment of the religious material is reasonably subject to debate, but it is definitely worth taking the time."

If ever an actor deserved the accolade ""superstar,"" it was Charlton Heston. He was a no-nonsense type of leading man who always seemed to tower above the merely mortal, on screen as well as off. It was Charlton Heston who opened my eyes (and mind) to the larger world Out There. But it was his presence Up There that got me hooked, that made me love going to the movies.

","What a powerful and engaging film is Ben Hur. No film has bettered this epic tale of Judah Ben Hur's encounter with Jesus Christ. Charlton Heston displays nothing but sheer brilliance, and it was only a matter of time when and not if he should win the Best Actor Oscar. Without a doubt, Ben Hur is simply the greatest Biblical-era epic ever made. It may be three-and-a-half hours long, but you cannot fail to be drawn into the magnificent visuals and wonderfully taut direction from William Wyler, which should no doubt capture the heart and soul of the very unlucky people not to have witnessed this ground-breaking tale of power and devotion.<br/><br/>Ben Hur wouldn't be Ben Hur with mentioning that now legendary Chariot race: what a superb piece of cinematic film history! It really could not be improved even 48 years later! Stunning, cunning, nail biting; just terrific! The winner of 11 Academy awards, including director Wyler's third Best Director trophy, Ben Hur was unequalled until the lame 1997 movie Titanic 'set sail'. A shame this 1959 classic still doesn't hold that record, but it is still one of the most ground-breaking and expertly made movies ever in the history of film, and will in no doubt carry on in that respect. 11 out of 10!"

"DKosty123","10","2","5","17 October 2006"," Long Ago & Not So Far Away, An Empire Started Here
","Quite long ago, on a planet that we are on, a 16 year old saw this movie & then with a vivid imagination, developed in his mind a science fiction saga which borrowed many elements from this film. When the scene of the stars in the sky form over Bethlehem & that special star forms, that image makes one wonder in awe about our universe. Wyler's awe inspiring sequence has definitely been extended. The magic star here marks where Christ is born, & it is that magic which would ironically become a death star in the teenagers mind. The universe that the star is located in, even more magical.<br/><br/>That teenager was George Lucas. This film has an evil Empire (Rome). It has an all powerful force (Christ) which unites Arab & Jew to overcome & defeat Rome. In fact, the Empire actually helps create its own defeat like Anakin Skywalker does by crossing into the dark side. Masala betrays his childhood & past by embracing the evil Roman Empire. Most folks don't realize, the novel this is based upon is a great work of Fiction, from the 19th Century. <br/><br/>Many people have realized the small parallel (pod races) between this movies chariot race & George Lucas saga. What most don't realize is the overall theme parallel between them as well. When a 16 year old Lucas saw this film, he built upon it's fictional plot to build an entire Science Fiction Empire. Even the slave theme,the betting sequence & the virgin birth are all borrowed in Episode 1.<br/><br/>Stephen Boyd in his greatest screen role as Masala is in the races here. The crime is that Boyd never got more roles like this as his talent here is great as basically a co-star. 4 horse chariots, & magnificent looking horses. Instead of Darth Vadar, we have the Emperior of Rome, his designate is Pontius Pilate whose role in Biblical History is more notable than Jabba the Hut's in Star Wars saga is.<br/><br/>This is the role Charlton Heston will be most remembered for. Granted, he played Moses & Taylor in the original Planet of the Apes film, but this film is his, all the way. The film story is centrally located on Judah Ben Hur. It has some diversions such as his relationship with Mesala,his encounters with Jesus Christ, his family, the Roman master from the slave ship, & the Arab Prince whose white horses he races in the great chariot race. All the supporting folks are excellent in their roles.<br/><br/>Heston compliments the British supporting cast acting particularly in making the film stronger. <br/><br/>The original novel by (Gen) Lew Wallace was actually written in the 1800's. It's theme is something which doesn't even work in the modern world, the alliance of an Arab with a Jew. This screenplay credit for this version is deceptive in that Gore Vidal and another writer rewrote the script as shooting was going on. Their work is amazing considering they were often one day ahead of shooting their rewrites. In the novel, & earlier 1925 version and the Broadway shows which preceded it, Judah Ben Hur is converted by his encounters with Christ to being a Christian. This was changed in the 1959 version to appeal to a wider audience.<br/><br/>Things to look for- the opening depiction of the birth of Christ by Wyler, the depiction of Christ teaching crowds of people, the stunning portrayal of the crucifixion without all the violence Mel Gibson found necessary later in the PASSION Of The Christ where he was trying to present graphic details rather than the existential ones which are done effectively here. The Carpenter shop & tie ins of Christ with Judah Ben Hur. The Roman galley ship battle sequences are well done too.<br/><br/>There is a silent version of this which is interesting made in 1925. The stories are roughly the same with a few differences including the ending. Full sized Roman Galleys were built for the 1925 film and one was accidentally torched & burned during filming with the actual fire being used in the final film. Both films were MGM's most expensive projects when they were made. Both included filming in Italy, though the 1925 version got so messed up in Italy that it had to be finished in the United States.<br/><br/>Heston spent a month prior to filming learning & practicing how to race the actual chariots. The white horses are named after stars whose names are later used in Science fiction works."
"rcj5365","Null","2","5","2 August 2006"," William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur""-A Cinematic Standard
","Had ""Ben-Hur"" never been made, Mel Gibson's ""Braveheart"" wouldn't have been nearly as brave,and Peter Jackson's ""The Lord Of The Rings"" trilogy wouldn't have been half as lordly. Both cinematic spectacles drew heavily from ""Ben-Hur"",a story of catastrophic defeat,steadfast inspiration,tremendous action and overwhelming faith. The epic that all but invented and continues to define the swords-and-sandals genre,""Ben-Hur"" is a tale of scummy politics,atrophied friendship and brutal,unjustified punishment. Ultimately,as nearly all great films are, ""Ben-Hur"" is a story of love. The film moves with an assurance and majesty that is hardly seen in modern movies. It's certainly in no hurry to get started,content to roll out with a deliberate,operatic sweep. The film begins with a 6-minute,30-second orchestral overture(composed by Miklos Rosza)focusing on the Sistine Chapel image of man's hand outstretched toward the touch of God. The introduction works to calm you and allow you to settle in for a grand scale of an epic.<br/><br/>At the focus of the story is the rivalry between Hebrew prince Judah Ben-Hur(Charlton Heston)and his childhood friend,Roman politician Messala(Stephen Boyd),drunk with newfound power.Judah refuses to go along with Messala's request to help quell rebellions,and the twisted Messala takes revenge by falsely accusing Judah,his mother and sister of treason and attempted assassination. Judah is stripped of his wealth and prominence,ripped away from the woman he loves-from his servant's daughter,who is promised to another man-and condemned to slavery. The one thing that keeps Judah alive through years of punishment is sheer hatred of Messala. Judah's rise to freedom and renewed power is an inspiring as it is frightening. It becomes clear as the story proceeds that Judah is gradually becoming just like Messala,with whom the conflict reaches fever pitch in a 11-minute chariot race,one of the most brilliant action scenes ever filmed in cinematic history. Director William Wyler carried a flourish-free,straightforward approach throughout a career that began in the silent era and spanned through the 1960's. He was nominated 12 times for the best-director Oscar and won three times for ""Ben-Hur"",""Mrs. Miniver"" and the after World War II epic,""The Best Years Of Our Lives"". For those who made have never heard of Wyler,that's probably because his unique style didn't stand out in the manner of such Hollywood directors as John Ford,Alfred Hitchcock or David Lean. Instead of forcing a signature the material,Wyler has a way of doing things his way. While the luminaries of his period tended to bend scripts toward their own visions,Wyler bought into the story wholeheartedly adapting his own techniques to best serve the film. Wyler plunges through ""Ben-Hur"" with a fortuitous assuredness. His most masterful choice is his depiction of Christ,whose story unfolds silently behind the scenes,sometimes intersecting with the trials of Judah. Wyler never shows us his face,but implies the effect Jesus has on others through his interaction with others. We see Christ reflected in reverent reaction shots. Christ comes forth poetically as a character of inspiration and charisma.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"",was MGM's bold desperate move to avoid bankruptcy,and the idea to make the film was seen as audacious at the time since it was a remake of the 1925 silent adaption of the Lew Wallace novel. Several actors passed on the lead role,including Rock Hudson and Burt Lancaster. Wyler,who started his career as an assistant director on the 1925 version was a natural choice to helm the $15 million production,colossal for its day. Filmed in ""MGM Camera 65""(Super Panavision 70),and magnificent Technicolor. Filming ""Ben-Hur"",with lavish sets,sprawling cast and excruciatingly difficult special effects must have taken a dogged resolved that matched that of Judah. The results became one of the highest grossing pictures of that year,when it was released in 1959. The risk paid off well in a total of 11 Oscars,including Best Picture,director,actor(Charlton Heston),and supporting actor(Hugh Griffith),as well as the windfall of a $70 million domestic box office return. The motion picture ""Ben-Hur"" is tied with James Cameron's 1997 epic ""Titanic"",which won 11 including Best Picture,and the final installment of Peter Jackson's Lord Of The Rings Trilogy ""Return Of The King"",also got 11 Oscars including Best Picture of 2003. Both movies had match ""Ben-Hur's astounding record with the number of Oscars. It was re-released in theatres numerous times by the studio and became one of the biggest roadshow spectacles attractions of all time. The take,however,is minuscule when compared to what it gave back to filmdom and Hollywood as a whole."
"teh_mode","10","2","5","27 May 2006"," Epic epic of epic proportions
","The rise of the telly box in the 1950s gave way to a new kind of Hollywood epic, one that producers thought would offer a completely different niche to the television experience. It was a kind of film that would see everything overblown to the max, making the most of the cinematic experience - sometimes too much. Ben Hur is the epitome of this new wave, featuring a near 4 hour running time, huge sweeping cinematography, epic battles, triumphs and a little bit here or there about a certain Jesus Christ. At it's best Ben Hur is a searing, fantastically realised epic, that with sheer ambition alone, will leave the viewer overwhelmed. At it's worst it is an overblown, over-ambitious epic that will leave the viewer overwhelmed. You get the point. Feauring a fittingly grandiose central performance from Charlton Heston, wonderful cinematography and a chariot race every bit as thrilling now as it was in 1959.<br/><br/>Taglined as ""A tale of Christ"" our film is set in 1st century Jerusalem. Our protagonist, Judah Ben Hur, is a rich, noble Jewish Prince. His childhood friend is now a commander in the Roman legions, but has come to visit his long-time friend. They reminisce, at first, seeming like the old friends they always were. Yet Messala's true ambition is one that angers the righteously stubborn Ben Hur, after he learns of Messala's want of Judah to be an informant of the Romans. ""You are either with us, or against us"" Messala tempestuously informs his old friend. As the friendship quickly turns to nemesis, the film then follows our protagonist as he goes from Prince, to slave, to Roman, back to Prince again in truly sweeping style. His encounters Jesus Christ evoke Christian imagery and feeling to the story, as our Jewish friend is saved by him.<br/><br/>Ben Hur had Oscar written all over it, both before that year's nominations and during it. The sheer weight of its story is enough to garner acclaim for years to come. At a three and a half hour running time it may drag on for a lot of people, yet just as your bum is about to go, the chariot race will have you screaming for more. At times it is ponderous, and even overambitious. But as far as spectacle goes, this is the grand daddy of them all. A classic in its own right, and a film that saved MGM from bankruptcy."

What's more, the movie has a perfect balance of drama and action; moving fluently between the two. In addition, the scenes with actors displaying their emotions are superbly crafted...Wyler was a master at directing emotional sequences. Lastly, the message the movie sends transcends time.

Charleton Heston plays the lead here, and he's quite fine as the tortured Jew (literally and figuratively) Being a man in such a position like Ben-Hur would take an actor of a large stature, and Heston is the guy to pull it off.

A twenty minute intermission in-between 2 hour acts just doesn't get it! And, in Ben Hur, if it isn't one thing it's another. Poor Ben with his mishaps in life goes from Prince to Pauper to Prince and ends up winner of a race that was Rome's version of the Indiana 500! But through all the madness and miracles, no one seems to see the greatest miracle of all in the film. Here's Ben's mother and sister in that prison all those years! They know they're there; after all; the food disappears! And, how and where did they go to the bathroom all those years if that door was so small to get in and out of? Don't get me wrong! Sure, this is epic-movie making at its finest, but again, it's just too damn long, and I'm sure the whole thing could have been wound up in about two and a half hours without any trouble! Now, when compared with the silent version; sure you can see a little bit of copying from the silent version to the William Wyler version. That's very obvious if you really observe what's going on on the screen, but there is something about the silent version that makes it a much better version.

","I consider ""Ben Hur"" an inspirational picture. Many of us are like Judah, in that we are so burned up with hate because of the injustice of the world. We feel lost and cry out to God during personal unfortunate events, and feel Him with us. The best scene in the film is when marched to the galleys, Judah cries out, ""God, help me!"", and our Lord gives him water. That does it for me! I have this movie on DVD, along with ""King Of Kings"", ""The Robe"" and ""Jesus Christ Superstar"", all of which I consider among the best Biblical movies ever made! The movie itself is basically historically and Biblically correct (even though it is a piece of fiction). However, there are a few inaccuracies here and there, which by no means take away from the grandeur of the film. First of all, the Romans had no concept of ""emperor"" as the word is understood today. The Roman ""emperors"" were imperial dictators with a variety of powers (based upon Latin words), which were bestowed upon them by the Senate. They have been labeled ""emperors"" because one of the titles the Senate gave was ""imperator"", which in Latin means, ""commander-in-chief"". The other inaccuracy is the very nature of Tiberius. He was far from the benevolent figure portrayed in this movie, or in ""The Robe"". Tiberius was a paranoid tyrant, who had members of his family murdered on suspicion of treason. As this film wrongly portrays, he was also never in Rome, but had a private villa on the island of Capri, and left most of the affairs of state to his Praetorian Prefect, Sejanus. Always suspicious, Tiberius opened what he called ""treason trials"" where rumored enemies of the state were tried, convicted and murdered in cruel and unusual manners.<br/><br/>That aside, this film deserves 4 out of 5 stars in my book!"

It has also won an unprecedented (until recently tied) 11 Academy awards in its time too.<br/><br/>Also subtitled as a Tale of the Christ, the story of Jesus bookends this long movie, with the birth at the manger in Bethlehem, to his crucifixion in Jerusalem. In between, there are moments in which Judah Ben-Hur meets Jesus, though we never see the face of the Christ. There are other biblical characters mentioned / seen too, like Pontius Pilate, John the Baptist, and Jesus' parents Joseph and Mary.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston plays the title character Judah Ben Hur, an Jew aristocrat in Rome conquered Judea, whose childhood best friend, a Roman called Messala, is now second in command to the Roman governor. Unwilling to become an informer to Messala to name Jews involved in upcoming rebellions, Messala has Judah banished to slavery and his family imprisoned.<br/><br/>Swearing revenge, we see how Judah overcome various odds, and incredible luck which sees him through his slavery, his rescue of a Roman general, becoming his adopted son, and returning to Judea to exact vengeance on Messala, hence the grand chariot race.<br/><br/>Though I must admit it does get a little draggy, and the dialogue a bit stilted and colourful, but there are enough moments in this plot to keep you riveted in your seat. So if you're game for some serious good old styled story-telling, watch this classic.<br/><br/>This Code 1 DVD contains a full length audio commentary by Charlton Heston, and a behind the scenes documentary called Ben-Hur: The Making of an Epic."

","This Oscar winning best film of 1959 is outstanding.<br/><br/>It details the beginnings of the Christian religion through the eyes of Judah Ben-Hur, Charlton Heston, and his family.<br/><br/>While the Romans occupied Judea, Heston has built a strong friendship with Roman centurion, Massala, played in a memorable vicious performance by the late Stephen Boyd.<br/><br/>When a loose rock from Ben-Hur's house accidentally falls on a Roman, Massala condemns the family. He had begged Judah to throw his lot in with the Romans. Condemning his friend will throw fear into everyone since if he could do this to his best friend, anything is possible.<br/><br/>While his mother and sister are sent to the dungeons and ultimately develop leprosy, Judah becomes a slave on a ship. Ultimately, saving the Roman head (Jack Hawkins), Judah returns from Rome and seeks revenge on Massala.<br/><br/>The chariot race is the ultimate event. It is staged with an excellence beyond belief. Massala is ultimately killed and Judah will find his mother and sister in the leper colony. Their ultimate cure at the time of the crucifixion of Christ is memorable.<br/><br/>The silent film ""Ben-Hur,"" ended with Ben-Hur's conversion to Christianity from Judaism. Director William Wyler wisely chose not to do this.<br/><br/>The supporting cast members of Haya Harareet and Sam Jaffe are terrific. As the sheik, Hugh Griffith was named best supporting actor.

","During the holidays, I get all Biblical, God fearing, and powerfully emotional. There is a lot of Sinclair Lewis' ""Elmer Gantry"" in my soul. It is my upbringing I guess. The agnostic once attested that his religion is the religion of his parents and no matter what other experiences he has, he must hedge his bets. I was raised as a Christian and so . . <br/><br/>Nevertheless, I enjoy the Biblical movies of Hollywood, and Ben-Hur is the greatest religious Hollywood spectacle of them all. Ben-Hur also titled ""A Tale of the Christ"" penned by Civil War General Lew Wallace, and you are copy-write free to read on the internet, was perhaps the most popular novel of the 19th century that has several times been put on film in the 20th century.<br/><br/>But nothing quite like the 1959 film, winner of 11 Oscars, has ever quite existed before or ever will. Star Wars only pretends at such spectacle. Directed by William Wyler, this movie is the last great and fantastic non CGI or special fake effect, it is all real action, and amazing cinema. Seeing this print, digitized from the original 65mm film into a 16x9 anamorphic that is really lost on my little 20 inch Toshiba TV screen is still incredible. I need a bigger TV. But even then in witnessing, I can't imagine any attempt to pan and scan this masterpiece of epic movie making.<br/><br/>I will admit this film's plot plods many times but if you cut to the action it never disappoints. Regarding this action there are three scenes that satisfy.<br/><br/>The battle of the Roman and Macedonian Trimarine ships in the Mediterranean is mind boggling. Then the resultant triumphant parade in Rome is breathtaking and telling-- the Emperor Augustus Caesar, pay attention to his gestures. Finally the climactic chariot race between Ben-Hur and Masalla, his horses are white, and the bad guy's black, is an absolute high achievement of movie making that tops even the destruction of the Death Star in ""Star Wars IV.""<br/><br/>A thread through this film is Christ's influence on Judah Ben-Hur, although he really never get's it. Effective in this treatment is that Christ's face is never seen by the audience, only by the awe struck actors. I found this taking license with the audience's emotions. I think if I ever looked at Christ's face I would not be awe-struck but instead comforted by His love.<br/><br/>Anyway, this awesome cinema spectacle, recently released on DVD with many many extras is recommended. I love this movie and will cherish watching it over and over again.<br/><br/>And yes Charlton Heston still looks great in a loin cloth."

","Ben Hur is a timeless classic set in Biblical times. Beautifully shot, performed, and written, this film has many memorable scenes and moments. The chariot race is one of those memorable, gripping scenes. Another touching scene is where Hur is offered water by the Jesus character - a scene that is referenced later in the film. In short, Ben Hur is a story about suffering and loss, and it is a story of love, hope, and miracles. It features love and betrayal, revenge and forgiveness. In fact, it has all of the elements which make a good film. The only problem that I had with this film is that it feels like it is two stories in one. While the majority of the film seems to focus around Hur's misfortune and finding a way to get back home, another story evolves upon his return home. Direction seems to be lost here, after Ben Hur comes back home and then decides to locate his missing mother and sister. This second story is more spiritual and turns the misfortunes of the Hur family around, so we get a pretty happy ending. In conclusion, Ben Hur is definitely one of those films that have to be seen at least once. Chances are, you will enjoy it as most people tend to rate this film highly."

","The film Ben Hur is set in the time of Christ, circa 33 BC. This is the story of two boys, one Roman, one Jewish. It seems from the time the two were children, they were close enough to be brothers. So close in fact an observer might even infer, a closeness of another kind. Still, the story is reminiscence of their childhood when the two boys meet after an absence of some ten years. One portion of the film purports to remind the audience of the heroic actions of the Roman Boy (Stephen Boyd) as Messala and how after a decade, expects that by saving his friend's life, the Jewish boy will feel the importance of honor and friendship for the new position of responsibility of the Roman Tribune. Instead, the Jewish boy (Charlton Heston) as Judah Ben-Hur, who also has grown up, feels the weight of the empire and hopes his friend is there to loosen the Roman grip on the land of Judea. This meeting, begins friendly enough, but soon explodes into bitterness and feeling of betrayal. The Roman boy, feeling Judah owes him his life and loyalty, is rebuffed, by the sense of patriotism felt by the newly acquired faith of the people of Judea. What follows then is a series of tragedies. Judah chooses his self-importance and his people over his friend and allows disaster to place him at his friend's mercy. Having chosen faith instead of friendship, Messala allows his former friend to suffer the punishment of his own folly. Judah cannot understand his friend and sets out on the long road of revenge, killing three men in the process and eventually doing the same to his friend. In all, it's Judah who betrays the man who gave him life and allows him to die in the arena. The story of revenge is complete. Lesson learned. Save your friend and you may live to regret it. The film is spectacular in both breath and scope. Having garnered eleven awards, little more needs to be said. ****"

","What do you say about a film that has everything? In my opinion it is THE finest Biblical epic ever made. Charleton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur is one of the greatest performances ever filmed. He WAS Judah - and all of his co-stars (Stephen Boyd, Jack Hawkins, Martha Scott, etc...) they WERE who they portrayed. The musical score was absolutely Miklos Rosza's finest. Never before in any film I have seen was so much feeling conveyed with the music. It was fabulous the way the Jesus' life was intertwined with Judah's. This film gives everything that should be given; If you are a religious person, it fulfills and affirms everything that you believe. If you are not, it still gives you a glimpse of Jesus's life, his teachings and how hate can turn into love by faith and example. I have seen this film at least 30 times and it still never fails to move me keep my attention. So, what really is the greatest film of all time? Gone With The Wind? Citizen Kane?

In fact the movie toned down that aspect quite a bit compared to the original story. The movie was intstrumental in leading me to Christianity 25 years ago, and has the same effect to this day. And I don't understand why so many reviewers are reading a homosexual relationship between Judah and Massala. It's nowhere in the orginal story and its quite possible for men to be affectionate and love one another without it being sexual...in fact its healthy. One of the greatest stories ever told (and quite historically possible according to all my history teachers) is right there on the screen to inspire and entertain.

When I see ""BEN HUR"" again - have already seen it more than once, I hope to write down the various reasons why I consider it such a MAGNIFICENT movie.  Some of the reasons are: the TREMENDOUS ACTING; the INCREDIBLE CHARIOT RACE, especially for that time (1959); the BEAUTIFUL COLOR; the movie leaving me FEELING TERRIFIC, not sad, not depressed; the FANTASTIC STORY! My being a Christian makes this movie so very meaningful to me.  For me, two of the GREATEST SCENES (among so very many) are where Jesus gives Ben Hur a drink of water, and the other - ABSOLUTELY THRILLING - is where Ben Hur gives Jesus a drink of water (someone commented on this web site about that scene causing them to have goose bumps)!!!

It seems a futile effort in any case given the age of some of the truely great films. In the book, 'Movies in America' 1929-1969, (currently out of print as the names of the authors escapes me.) the authors' remarks reflected the changing esthetics of the time referring to MGM's color remake as an ""above average quasi-Biblical  spectacle with a fine piece de resistance""-the chariot race.  Over lauded with accolades for every season: Winner of 11 Academy Awards (losing best adapted screenplay to 'Room at the Top'.) Best picture winner: The NY Film Critics Circle Award. Best picture winner: The British Film Academy.  Best picture winner: Golden Globe Award. Sam Zimbalist received the Producers Guild Award and Wyler the Directors Guild Award. Among the great and powerful men of letters, film critic for the NY Times, Bosley Crowther-champion of religion in modern cinema-rendered a glowing review. Whereas Dwight MacDonald-reviewer for Cosmopolitan- panned it vociferously likening the whole viewing experience to watching 'a lumbering freight train as it passes' However, it's a fair assessment of this film's endurance when one considers the ratings poll  and how it ranks a point or two above Ridley Scott's 'Gladiator' as a film still very  much in high demand in sales and rentals. So is it great? Well, I believe that's subject to individual tastes. Is it a masterpiece? That could be safely said of any film that does well both critically and commercially. Is it a keeper?

Now, If I have to pick some of the best Directors in North America-it had to be Wyler, Wise, Coppola, Scorsese, because of the sheer pre-production homework and the meticulous details, that the above directors put in. General Lew Wallace, spent 7 years under a beach tree, in Crawfordsville Indiana, in 1880, writing the book and it was triggered by a conversation on a train with an Aesthist. The role of Ben-Hur was offered to Burt Lancaster, who declined it, on moral grounds and Paul Newman declined it, since he had skinny legs to wear a Roman tunic!.The Chariot scene took five weeks to film, used 15,000 extras and filmed on 18 acres of land at Cinecitta Studio in Italy. This scene was a production unit, headed by the famous Stunt-King Yakima Canut and his son Joe Canutt who doubled for Charlston Heston. I have read about two panavision cameras placed along the path of the chariots and one was damaged but there were no fatalities in this incredible and awesome piece of action sequence. This is one movie I will never buy DVD since this should be watched in all it's regal splendor in a THX Theatre. I think every scene was memorable. It's difficult and almost cruel to pick one acting over other since this was the finest cast of acting talent put together for a movie. This is not a movie but a monumental spectacle to the collective talent and dedication to the craft that was prevalent in the 6o's, and the larger than life canvas envisioned and executed by a director-the caliber of Willima Wyler.

","'Ben Hur' stands out as a towering classic which has withstood the test of time. The film's finale, particularly the chariot race would ever remain etched in my memory. The director has spared no effort in making the race look truly realistic and magnificent. The photography and the camera angles are brilliantly handled by William Wyler in this epic sequence. Note the instances in the race when charoiteer after charioteer collides with the track edges and crashingly falls to the ground.<br/><br/>The story narrates the experiences of Judah, a nobleman who unknowingly gets entangled in a feud with the governor of the land. He pays the price when his family is wrecked upon by the governor. At last, in the end he has his revenge by defeating the governor in the chariot race.<br/><br/>In addition to the main plot, a sub plot is also narrated in the film wherein the life of Jesus Christ is showcased. As the movie ends, you realize that you did witness the full life of Christ on the silver screen. This too, without seeing the face of Christ even once! This cinematic effect is used to perfection by the director and believe me it has come beautifully on the screen. <br/><br/>Charlton Heston seems tailor made for the role of Judah Ben Hur. He has that Roman built and looks in his eyes. Stephen Boyd as Messala, the governor, is menacing at times. <br/><br/>The original score of the film is haunting. It is in tune with the mood of the film, grand, reverbrating and spectacular. Particularly notice the score which comes in the background to scene where Christ is being born.<br/><br/>Some scenes from the film tend to stick with you long after you have seen the movie. For instance, the scene where Judah first meets Christ and the latter offers him water. And the scene where Christ is being taken for crucification through a sea of onlookers.<br/><br/>I agree that most critics pan the movie regarding its length.

","During this expansive (in time and space) story,in view of the title aka ""A tale of he Christ""one might ask oneself whether Judah Ben Hur's is a token of Christ's life on earth. Thus: he rejects the benefits offered by Messala for compliance with Rome; a type of the Last Temptation on the Mount:""all this will I give thee, if thou wilt fall down and worship me"". He endures humiliation,flogging and other punishments unjustly. He acts as an human savior in rescuing other galley slaves as well as a harsh overseer. He is given drink by the Christ while on a killing trek from prison to the galleys. At risk to himself he pursues and embraces his long lost(during his 3 years as a galley slave)family now wracked with leprosy resulting from incarceration. Twice again he refuses acknowledgement of Rome to his stepfather and to Pontius Pilate. There is a contest with Messala, who  realistically represents Satan,and overcomes him,witnesses the Via Dolorosa and the Crucifixion,the following storm and earthquake,when his two sisters are miraculously healed.<br/><br/>        In this film we see Imperial Rome as civilized barbarians in all its brutal splendor.The background for the chariot race are quite out of place for Jerusalem,as is much of the scenery,where with the crowd and Pilate it would be appropriate for the Circus Maximus in Rome.<br/><br/>         All the same this is without doubt an extremely thought-provoking and inspiring film,and it deserved all the honors and Oscars bestowed upon it."

","Benhur is a story about betrayal,revenge,forgiveness and faith.Masterfully brought to the screen by William Wyler from the book Benhur-A tale of Christ by Lew Wallace, Benhur is a moving epic which inspires, enthralls and questions our views about revenge, forgiveness and faith.The movie has excellent production values,an excellent script,an excellent caste and a very inspired score by Miklos Rosza who combines smooth,soothing scores in the scenes of christ to rousing battle scores to  evoke the right emotional response from the audience.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston is Judea Benhur,a wealthy merchant,who is betrayed by his close friend Messala, an officer in the Roman legions played by Stephen Boyd, for all suitable reasons, believing in the message of the messiah and failing to recognize Caeser as the supreme ruler. On a trumped up charge of attempting to assassinate the Roman Governor,Benhur is separated from his family, stripped of all wealth and sent to work as a galley slave.<br/><br/>It is revenge that Benhur swears and it is for revenge that benhur lives every second of his life, to live for the day, the hour when he can meet Messala and avenge his family and himself.It is revenge and a desire to live and fight Messala that makes Benhur survive a shipwreck during a sea battle and by a stroke of luck manages to save the Roman consul Quintus Arrius(Jack Hawkins). Benhur finds himself adopted by Arrius and practices his charioteering , becomes a famous charioteer and finds his chance to contest Messala in a chariot race.<br/><br/>It is for this chariot race that the film is spoken of often and as a movie spectacle, it is simply magnificent.The race is taut, tense and extremely riveting.It took a reported 3 months in shooting and was shot by an assistant director and not by Wyler himself.The graceful white stallions driven by Benhur make a startling contrast to the magnificent black stallions driven by Messala.To see these splendid animals race themselves is an awesome, spellbinding display of strength, agility and power. The race turns out to be tragic for Messala who in spite of his false tactics is driven over, dies a few hours later,bitter and unrelenting.<br/><br/>Benhur finds not satisfaction but only a void and an emptiness from his victory. He finds his family living as lepers in a leper colony. It is now that he witnesses the crucification and finds his family cured. Parallels are drawn here between revenge and forgiveness. The scenes of Christ are extremely moving and will evoke an emotional response from all but the most cold hearted.<br/><br/>Although the movie is a bit long at 3 1/2 hours and slows down towards the end, Good acting, excellent sets, steady direction, a moving music score makes this one of the most memorable movies of this century."
"FilmFlaneur","Null","2","5","1 February 2002"," Classic Epic still holds up as the best
","One of the landmarks of epic and, arguably world cinema, Wyler's 'Ben-Hur' holds up well today. It was conceived by MGM as an eventual follow up to the success of Quo Vadis? (1951). Almost four hours in length, including substantial overture and entr'acte music by the redoubtable Miklos Rozsa, the film garnered 11 Oscars in its year - a feat echoed recently by Scott's 'Gladiator', to which unsurprisingly it bears some resemblances. (The return of the wronged, or the cathartic role of the arena for instance.) But there are vital differences, principal of which is the fact that, while Scott's epic is a pagan film predicated around the expectation of glorious death, Wyler's work is deeply Christian: ""a Tale of the Christ"" as the titles announce, hinging on the acceptance of eternal life.<br/><br/>'Ben-Hur' has a very considered structure, following Juden Ben-Hur's life and reconstruction, interposed with scenes from the life of Christ. In the first half we see Ben-Hur's fall from wealth and influence as a merchant, onto his fortunes as galley slave, rescuer and friend of a roman consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), then successful charioteer before returning to Judea to claim his vengeance. The second half includes the climactic chariot race between him and his enemy Masala, his confrontation with his mother and sister's leprous condition and, finally, Ben-Hur's witnessing of the crucifixion. Thanks to spectacular scenes such as the galley battle, the entry into Rome and, not least, the 20-minute chariot race (which took three months to film), attention in this mammoth epic rarely flags. Having said that, the first half of 'Ben-Hur' has more energy than the second, an issue primarily springing from the source novel. Wallace, its author, had planned his story so Ben-Hur's bitterness peaked just before the great race. Once the competition set piece is over and Massala dispatched, longer contemplative scenes inevitably follow as Ben-Hur broods on injustices. Like the leprosy of his relatives, he has a sickness albeit not physical, which must be cured, whilst in terms of action his rage has effectively exhausted itself.<br/><br/>
As the principal male hero, Ben-Hur is one half of three strong male relationships in turn (Ben-Hur/Masala, Ben-Hur/Arrius and Ben-Hur/Sheik Ilderim). Although the relationships are fraternal, Ben-Hur's unmarried status, as well as the closeness of these associations with other single males (Arrius's wife is dead and Ilderim's several remain curiously unavailable) are enough to raise a vague question mark, at least in the minds of modern audiences. Kubrick would explore the homosexual elements prominent in ancient cultures more explicitly in 'Spartacus' a year later). In the more conservative 'Ben-Hur' the closest we get to the homoerotic torsos - a characteristic of the peplum cycle from Italy born on the back of such successful films as this - is the sight of an oiled and pampered Massala accepting Ilderim's bet with his fellow athletes and colleagues. By remaining unmarried, enslaved, and lost to his country, in the first third of the film Ben-Hur remains a curiously emasculated figure.<br/><br/>
There are other awkward moments in the film centred on Ben-Hur's character. It is hard, for instance, after seeing him as the mature and successful head of a large household in the film's opening scenes, to find him then reborn as Arrius' 'son' three years down the line. At the same time, Ben-Hur's sudden (and un-illustrated) rise to prominence as a charioteer in Rome feels like a lame device to further the plot, clumsily preparing us for his necessary skill in the big race later.<br/><br/>Lew Wallace conceived 'Ben-Hur' as a didactic work as much as one of historical adventure, key moments in the life of Christ to be viewed in connection with those of an aggrieved man of action. Understandably, the film makes more of the possibilities of action, and less of the religious message. One result of this is that it is noticeably successful in communicating reverence without boredom, a fault of several other 1950s epics. Always difficult to portray, Christ is never heard speaking directly, his face never seen. Instead we witness the impact he has on people's lives. Instead of Christ the man, we have the events he occasions: the Passion is treated as an event of political significance to Judah and his family. The *socialising* of the Christian message is in evidence, rather than any crude proselytising. But once Massala is gone, Christ's continuing 'unavailability' to the viewer reveals a dramatic lack: we miss a necessary balance to Ben-Hur's strengths and convictions, where another rounded character might have stood. Ben-Hur's conscience fights on, but in a campaign vacuum as it were, and because of it he becomes weaker.<br/><br/>
Interestingly, although Rome as an invading force is decried by Ben-Hur, apart from the harsh life of slaves and some enforced tax collecting there is very little to criticise in the Imperial occupation of Judea. Messala's twisted sense of justice is clearly a personal aberration, springing from his ambition. Both Tiberius and Pontius Pilate (who offers the Judean his citizenship) appear as reasonable men. Christ's trial is presented very briefly and then seen only at conclusion. One Roman even admits that Christian dogma is ""quite profound really."" Ben-Hur perhaps implicitly grants the value of Rome as much, accepting the role of Arrius' son, even appearing before Massala in a toga. If not quite a tacit acceptance of 'what the Romans have done for us', Ben-Hur could be far more condemnatory towards those fighting the fledgling religion of the Jews. Truly the film takes Christ's words ""they know not what they do"" as understood.<br/><br/>
'Ben-Hur' then, is that rare creature, the restrained epic. Perhaps because the source is a novel than taken direct from the Bible, it manages to balance the sublime and ridiculous into a still-satisfying whole, balancing great spectacle on the one hand with subtle veneration on the other. Together with Wyler's direction, Heston's tailor-made presence, Rozsa's grand score and a unleaden cliché-free script it still makes 'Ben-Hur' first."
"khatcher-2","9","2","5","24 October 2001"," A Colossal Monument
","Ben Hur has entered into the mythology of film-making. More than forty years on it still remains a magnificent achievement, overshadowing all other epics to date. Without the technology of today, without all those special effects cooked up on computers, William Wyler's great classic is unstoppable. Barely 16 when I first saw it, and just turning fifty when I last saw it: my reaction has not changed one little bit. It goes on being captivating, astounding, brilliant story-telling, fabulously filmed, artistically directed and acted, an enthralling colossal monument.<br/><br/>And as for the famous chariot race there is nothing new I can add. Even today it is probably the most brilliant piece of filming ever carried out anywhere. It just does not last long enough! It still today ties my heart up in a tight fist and I stop breathing. Nothing is comparable.<br/><br/>I have never given a ten out of ten to any film, but surely this is one that gets very very near. Oh, by the way - the book is pretty good, too."
"FlickJunkie-2","10","2","5","20 April 2001"," The Quintessential Epic
","In the late 1950's MGM was in trouble financially.  They desperately needed a hit that would put the studio back in the black and re-establish it as a major player.  They decided to bet the ranch on Ben-Hur.  They brought in William Wyler (`Wuthering Heights', `The Best Years of Our Lives', `Roman Holiday') to direct and gave him carte blanche to spend whatever it took to make the film successful.  The result was the most expensive film made to that date at $50 Million (equivalent to $300 Million in today's dollars). Many of the sets took over a year to build.  <br/><br/>It was lucky the film ever was finished at all.  After six months in production, they still didn't have a cast and the script by Karl Tunberg was deemed unacceptable by Wyler.  Wyler brought in Gore Vidal and Maxwell Anderson (`All Quiet on the Western Front', `Death Takes a Holiday', `Key Largo') to rewrite the screenplay and they frequently were doing desperate rewrites the night before shooting.  Producer Sam Zimbalist died during production.  The roman ships they built for the naval battle were top heavy and capsized, so they had to build a special tank where the ships were guided by wires and held upright.  An expensive 65mm camera was destroyed in a collision with a chariot. <br/><br/>Numerous leading men were reported to have turned down the part of Ben-Hur, most notably Paul Newman, who said he didn't have the legs to appear in a tunic.  Others who were considered were Rock Hudson, Burt Lancaster, and Kirk Douglas.  Wyler couldn't find the right actor for the lead, so he turned to Charlton Heston, with whom he had done the film `The Big Country', the year before.  Heston accepted the part and the rest is history.<br/><br/>Despite all its production problems, the film is brilliantly done and stands as an archetype of film epics.  The sets and costumes are glorious, the direction superb and the acting compelling.  The chariot race is an outstanding orchestration of set construction, stunt work and filming that is superlative even by today's standards.  Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd did almost all their own chariot driving, using stuntmen for only the most dangerous stunts.  This lent greater realism to the scenes, allowing more close-ups during the intense action.  <br/><br/>Somehow, despite all the rewrites using three different writers, the story flowed smoothly to its final resolution.  The bitter rivalry between Judah and Messala, boyhood friends turned enemies by Messala's ambition, is well conceived and creates a sense of purpose that makes the ultimate confrontation as powerful as it is inevitable.<br/><br/>The entire cast is terrific.  Charlton Heston gives a career performance as Judah Ben-Hur.  His combination of strength, courage, compassion and perseverance creates an attractive and heroic character that few in film history have been able to equal.  Stephen Boyd is also fantastic as Messala, with a ruthless ambition and a cold heart that stamps out lifelong friendships for personal gain.  Jack Hawkins and Hugh Griffith lead a wonderful supporting cast.<br/><br/>This film is one of the most honored epics ever made.  It was nominated for 12 Academy Awards and won 11 including Best Picture, Best Actor (Charlton Heston), Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Best Director (William Wyler), and Best Music.  It is number 72 on AFI's top 100 of the century. The chariot race is one of the most exciting sequences ever filmed.  I rated it a 10/10.  They don't come much better than this."
"bat-5","10","2","5","5 April 2001"," One of the best big screen epics.
","I recently had the opportunity to see Ben-Hur on a 70ft screen and I have to say, if you have the chance, see it this way!  The super wide vistas that is captured on film look puny on TV and even then, the whole movie is cropped to fit the screen.  If you have a large screen TV, that may do the trick but it's still no match for a giant movie screen.  The best example of this would be to watch the famed chariot race.  Every inch of screen is used to pack in so much detail, your brain almost goes into an overload just trying to take it in. Having said that, the film still holds up after all these years.  Charlton Heston is perfectly cast as the title character.  Betrayed by his boyhood friend, Ben-Hur is sold into slavery and sent to die aboard the Roman galleons.  During a spectacular battle, Ben-Hur rescues his Roman captor and is given a hero's welcome in Rome where is made a citizen.  But, this cannot dissuade Ben-Hur from his personal vendetta against Messala.  He gets his chance in the chariot race, and I have to say that the chariot race has not been matched.  Ben-Hur, like Lawrence of Arabia, The Bridge on the River Kwai, and Spartacus, is a film that needs to be seen on a large screen.  That's the only way to take in the grandeur of those spectacular scenes that range from the highly intimate, to a frame that literally boasts a cast of thousands."
"cmlind","Null","2","5","15 August 2000"," Just Cause Its an Epic Doesn't Make It Good
","I decided one night that I had four hours of time, and so rented what was supposed to be the greatest epic ever. I hoped that it would be a very fine and entertaining film. At the beginning the character development was good, and from then on I felt like I was being tortured. How can people like this film!? Throughout most of the movie each scene is long drawn out and boring with dialogue that I would be able to understand if it weren't for the fact that its so long and dull that I stopped listening after awhile. One thing that annoyed me was some points where they just skipped steps to aid to the story. The one thing that really got me was when they decided that Charlton Hestons character had become a great chariot driver and horse trainer. One minute we haven't seen him near a horse and then the general is bragging about him racing. Where did that come from. After the chariot race, which was pretty good seeing the two childhood friends dueling it out, I figured the end of the movie was upon us. Nooooooo, they decided that now it was a good time to show the crusifiction of christ, who had only been in the movie one time before. Its ok to show this and they did a very good job, but what did this have to do with the rest of the story with betrayal, battles, revenge, and forgiveness? Nothing."

","Together with The ten commandments (1956), this is THE film. It has everything: story, sceneries, drama, message, the greatest action scene ever filmed (the race) and even a humorous scene. I have watched it 16 times and will absolutely watch it another 16 times. You never get bored with this movie. Unfortunatley, it shouldn't be seen on a small video screen - where you usually watch it nowadays."
"Dot-chan","Null","2","5","20 March 2000"," Worth watching for the music alone
","I don't get emotionally affected by movies often, but every time I watch -Ben Hur- I get a lump in my throat.  The musical score for this movie is one of the best and most appropriate that I've ever heard.  That, combined with genuine acting, fleshed-out, believable characters, and a great script, results in a movie adaptation which many believe to be superior to the original work.  Those 4 hours go by a lot quicker than I thought because I was so absorbed by the movie."
"Spleen","10","2","5","19 August 1999"," Grand if allowed to be grand
","I second the comments of the fellow who said that `Ben-Hur' must be seen on a big, wide screen.  Note (for instance) a particular shot in that scene near the end, where we see Miriam surrounded by darkness, staring in fear out at nothing in particular.  Wyler places her illuminated face at the furthermost left of the screen, with nothing but black to the right: it's very effective, especially after three hours of detailed panorama.  On TV this is just another dull close-up.  By a hundred subtle transformations of this kind is Wyler's breathtaking work turned into stodge.<br/><br/>This is particularly fatal because Ben-Hur had some tendency towards stodge to begin with.  The portentous reminders of the divinity of Christ (`He says - he says he IS doing his father's work') are far too many and all of them stage-bound - and what do they REALLY have to do with the story of Ben-Hur, anyway?  Even without the Christianity, Wyler leads us through each scene rather as if the story were some kind of museum exhibit.<br/><br/>Only on the big screen does it emerge that this latter feature is a virtue rather than a vice.  After all - at least it's a museum exhibit we're allowed time to contemplate.  Had the film been made today we would have been hustled through in half the time, a long queue of impatient patrons behind us, none of us getting a good look at anything and all of us feeling short-changed.  You have to be prepared to wallow in order to properly appreciate `Ben-Hur'; but if you ARE prepared to wallow, there IS something worth wallowing in."
"sraweber369","7","3","10","27 May 2011"," Still good but not aging well
","Ben Hur must have been a spectacle for 1959 and the film is not aging well. The look, direction, and acting style all scream 1950's epic. The director's style of long scenes with few cut aways gets boring really quickly if you are more use to modern day style. The acting is overly dramatic with a score that while good plays up the emotion like a soap opera, and the special effects particularly the fleet shot using miniatures does not look good at all (it might look better on a big screen theater than my laptop) but Star Wars did a much better job with models. The chariot scene though is really good and this is most of the action of the film.<br/><br/>Grade B="

There are also some scenes involving Jesus and of course the famous horse race.<br/><br/>Why I think this movie should be edited down, because for large parts of the movie I was bored witless and for other parts I was fascinated and moved in a way few movies can effect me.<br/><br/>Oh, and the chariot race scene is one of the greatest action scenes ever filmed and George Lucas should shot for even thinking of attempting to replicate in ""The Phantom Menace"". <br/><br/>Two recommendations when watching this movie. 1. Go to a cinema that shows it in the original 70mm print, complete with intermission and music played while the theaters are closed (or buy some little curtains for your TV when you watch it at home on DVD). 2. Don't watch Monty Python's the life of Brian before watching this movie or you will laugh during many of the scenes (I recommend getting your brain wiped to be sure)."

In all honesty though this film is perfect in every way and has no flaws.<br/><br/>Refusing to go against his people, Judah Ben Hur sees his former childhood friend, Messala, send him to the gallows after an incident that was misunderstood. Separated from his mother and sister Judah vows to see them again as well as get revenge on Messala.<br/><br/>The acting in this movie is awesome. Charlton Heston puts forth the best performance of his career and won the Oscar for best actor. Very well deserved and I think this is the best performance by an actor in a film ever. Hugh Griffin won the Oscar for best supporting actor which I think is fine but if anything Jack Hawkins should have won it for his excellent portrayal of Quintos Arrius in this film. Stephen Boyd also gives an outstanding performance as the villain Messala. Messala is in my top ten for the greatest movie villains of all time.<br/><br/>The story is one that gets going and develops a great conflict for the protagonist. Watching Judah go through his struggles on his way to the gallows and in search for his family is something that will captivate audiences forever.<br/><br/>The music rules as well. Great music is always around in great films it seems.<br/><br/>The chariot race in this film is one of the best moments in motion picture history. I will never be tired of that scene and no other race scene in any other film compares with the chariot race. It is intense, exciting, and epic.<br/><br/>Also love the scene when Judah is rowing for the Roman Fleet in the bottom of the boat. The intense sea battle is way under rated and nearly as awesome as the chariot race in this film.<br/><br/>Perfect in every way including acting, music, and a great plot. One of the greatest movies of all time and one that I recommend to everyone forever."
"CelluRob","7","1","2","8 December 2019"," Not without it's flaws, but a definite must-see.
","It will probably be remembered for it's chariot race long after all of the rest of it has faded away, but this is more than just that. It is a story about friendship, religion, power and opportunity - it is also about sheer bloody-mindedness and cruelty. It resonates all the more because these are all human traits that abound in all of us to some extent. The film looks truly amazing and Miklós Rósza is on top form with a score that encapsulates the Imperial grandeur of the Roman State in all of it's Tiberian pomp. The story, though, is a less impressive affair. Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd demonstrate how love can turn to hate splendidly when on screen together, the rest of the time neither performance really delivers much beyond the script. Jack Hawkins tries hard, but again doesn't quite hit the mark as the Consul. Hugh Griffith is a star as the mischievous, avaricious Sheik Ilderim and Sam Jaffe is also a good addition to this cast. It is way too long; after the chariot race it turns a little too much into the ""tale of the Christ"" referred to by author General Lew Wallace at the very start and for me, somehow loses it's way. The battle scenes at sea are great and the sumptuous costumes, cinematography and sound all well deserving of their golden statuettes. A very good, but not quite great, cinema epic."

"meeshoffmanns","9","1","2","9 March 2019"," One of the most Cinematic and Beautiful Experiences ever made, even after 60 Years
","I started watching Ben-Hur when I already watched a big amount of movies(I always avoided the old and long ones because I tended to get absolutely bored), and afterwards I was awestruck that a movie was still able to hit me this deep on an emotional and fascination level. William Wyler's epic deserves that name in every way, and still stands as a masterpiece of filmmaking.<br/><br/>Acting:
Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur gives a terrific performance throughout the whole runtime, with a lot of emotional range, showing both subtlety and intensity. He is not perfect though, as it sometimes feels that he is trying way too hard. Is it Oscar Worthy? Yes it is, and he got one. His character goes through a lot, and is fairly simple in terms of development, but Charlton makes every minute of it compelling and interesting.<br/><br/>Stephen Boyd as Messala also gives everything he has to make a hateful and prissy Roman tribune, and watching the friendship between him and Judah fall apart is amazing to watch. The problem of trying too hard is even more visible here, however, sometimes feeling like we are watching a stage play rather than a movie.<br/><br/>Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius is a relatively small role, but a very effective and enjoyable one. Hawkins gives a strong performance which adds a duality and humanity to the Romans that we do not often see.<br/><br/>Haya Harareet is an interesting one; she plays Esther, Ben-Hur's love interest, and at the same time serving as moral compass and emotional guide for Judah. It is a pretty simple yet compelling role, given the though choices she makes, and Haya delivers enough good acting to make her a likable character. A lot of times however, she appears a bit wooden and hollow.<br/><br/>Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ilderim is nice touch of variety in all the rather serious characters, providing a lot of comedic moments with a strong performance. The Sheik is a relatively simple yet very likable character, and if you didn't know better, you'd say that they hired a real sheik to do this role. He got an Academy Award, which is understandable.<br/><br/>Direction:
William Wyler has done an outstanding job to make a finished product out of the hell that was production. All the scenes have a strong gravity to them, and you get the sense that he was in full command with every shot. Not every scene worked as well though, particulary some dialogue. In the grand scheme of things however, this is easily forgiven.<br/><br/>Cinematography:
Outstanding work with relatively simple techniques. The dialogue scenes keep you attention every time because of the framing, and the chariot race is absolutely baffling if you look behind the scenes.<br/><br/>Plot:
The story of Ben-Hur keeps you hooked from start to finish, which is really impressive considering its length. Judah's introduction, downfall, journey, and quest for revenge and redemption are all very compelling and an amazing viewing experience. Not every scene flows as nicely within the narrative, but the end product is nothing short of a masterpiece.<br/><br/>Music:
Miklos Rozsa was John William's mentor, and it absolutely shows that the master of movie music was inspired by a master himself. Miklos delivers a wonderful orchestral score, delivering on both the emotional and epic angle. Without the movie, it is still a pleasure to listen to, and movie soundtracks would never be the same.<br/><br/>Production Design:
One of the reasons why this movie deserves the title masterpiece: everything was done practical back in the day, and every ship, stadium, home and street was built from the brink up and shot on location. This much devotion to detail and realism was staggering and it's a shame that few filmmakers now strive to do the same.<br/><br/>Costumes and Make-up:
With just as much commitment as to the sets, these aspects made the film come to live and truly feel like the Roman Empire at the time of Jesus Christ. It all looks great, even the ragged slave/prisoner robes. I truly do not know how they achieved dismemberment of limbs at the time, but they did it.<br/><br/>Sound:
Perhaps the only real hiccup in this movie. The dialogue recordings sometimes sound pretty off, and pose a risk of pulling you out of the scene. Everything else sounds pretty spot-on however, and particulary the chariot sequence is absolutely a pleasure for your ears.<br/><br/>Editing:
In terms of creating a cinematic experience of storytelling, the movie greatly succeeds in that due to the editing. It is not perfect, and pacing is still an issue sometimes, but for a three-hour 60-year old movie it is still quite the achievement.<br/><br/>Tone:
Everything about this movie feels like what it is: an ancient epic. Very dramatic and impactful, which is a good thing most of the time. Every important moment is felt through the exquisite direction and acting, and save for some ""romantic"" scenes it is pretty much perfect.<br/><br/>General Concensus:
While certainly not without flaws, this movie is a spectacular achievement in cinema history and it is quite the miracle that it still holds up after such a long time. I have nothing but the utmost respect for it and will continue to do so. 8.5/10"

","It is no longer possible to make a film like Ben-Hur.  Oh, George Lucas tries with all his computerized graphics, but this is a REAL spectacle, not some virtual one.  8,000 extras, tens of thousands of costumes, a $15 million budget (in the 1950's!), massive sets depict the power of Rome on the grandest possible scale.  It took six years to complete production. When you think of this film, the chariot race sequence in the Roman Circus shines as one of the greatest sequences ever captured on film.  Yet, its focus remains sharply on the detail, the private human experience of it all. The story doesn't get lost in the enormous vision of the work.  Charlton Heston gives a sensitive and intelligent performance, as does most of the supporting cast.  Ben-Hur's 11 Oscar nominations has been equaled by very few films.  There have been similar efforts in the past (The Ten Commandments, Cleopatra, etc.) but nothing matches the dramatic intimacy balanced with the epic extravagance of Ben-Hur.  Truly a film in a class by itself.  Yet, when I show this film to my friends many of them fail to connect with it.  Much of the acting, dialog, and style seem dated today. That is why it is so important to treat a great film (as with great literature or  indeed  any art form) on its own terms and view it by the standards of its own time.  In doing so, one broadens one's understanding of what culture was like only a few decades ago and one develops a deeper appreciation of how culture is best reflected in art.   This leads to the enrichment of oneself not only through connection with the work in question, but through the development of an expanded vision of filmmaking that is sorely lacked when judging today's efforts.  Perspective is lacking today. Too many evaluate films without it.  By such faults `greatness' becomes a rather common commodity, cheapened, instead of the celebrated rarity that it truly should be.

","When one thinks of the word ""epic"" in regard to movies, certain titles automatically come to mind : perhaps the most popular pick among the mass movie-going public would be GONE WITH THE WIND; but I think there is one picture that truly stands out - it may not be the biggest or even the best, but the elements that define the genre are so identified with this film that the title alone has become a moniker for epic movie-making . I'm referring to William Wyler's 1959 re-make of MGM's original silent, BEN HUR. Back in the early 20s the silent BEN was fraught with countless production mishaps that plagued the then merging Goldwyn and Metro Companies but the problems were vindicated when the spectacular production finally opened in 1925. The movie's centerpiece was a thrilling chariot race sequence that purportedly half of Hollywood's population took part in as extras. Done in the standard florid style of the silent era, the picture was the last word in spectacle for its time; fast-forward to 1959 when a desperate MGM was counting on the new production to save the company from financial disaster. The new version did just that, receiving nearly unanimous critical praise and enormous receipts at the box office. There are several reasons why BEN HUR was such a success. The obvious reasons are all there (great story of former boyhood friendship and later bitter enemies leading to a classic tale of revenge; the requisite big set pieces, costumes and a chariot race to end all chariot races ; it tops the silent classic and remains to this day as perhaps the greatest action sequence ever filmed). There is another key to the film's popularity and that is Miklos Rozsa's monumental music score. Is it great music? Highbrows would probably beg to differ, but has there ever been a movie that punctuated nearly every scene with as much portent and exposition? The music is a virtual stew of borrowed styles that seems to be conducted by a Divine Hand ( a soothing lullaby of voices accompanies the Star of Bethlehem as it hovers over the Manger in the pre-title Nativity sequence; the Christ's hand offers BEN a sorely needed ladle of water to strains of a Heavenly Wurlitzer and the announcement that lepers are present gets a huge boost from a heavy laden brass accompaniment). This is program music, maybe not of the highest order but incredibly effective. To sum up , BEN HUR has it all, including a pretty unsubtle homo-erotic spin on the relationship between Ben and Messala ( thanks to uncredited scenarist Gore Vidal. )"
"tobys-1","10","1","2","12 May 2002"," One of the greatest movies of all time.
","Ben Hur is one of the greatest movies of all time.  I just wish Hollywood could make a movie like it now.  It's a story that plays like a novel (cause it's based on one).   Charlton Heston (Judah Ben Hur) is great in the movie. I like his acting.  Ben Hur has some of the best action ever and as a story can't hardly be beat.   It's drama at its best.  It's the story of a family that had it all, was destroyed and then given their lives back.  Ben Hur depicts both the best and worst of the Roman Empire, its glory and progress and the oppression of the less fortunate who lived under its rule.<br/><br/>There are two action scenes that really get my heart pounding each time I see the movie.  First, the scene on the galley where the slaves are put through a grueling, forced rowing of their ship under the eye of General Quintus Arrius.   The way that scene builds with the alternating of the camera from the slaves to the drums to the general, all the while picking up the pace, is quite riveting.  Second, the chariot race.  Some of the best action ever produced by Hollywood.  I've competed on horseback before and the emotions the movie makes you feel in preparation for the race is a lot like the way I really felt before competition. The race itself keeps people on the edge of their seats.  It appears to have been put together close to real time, which makes it all the greater.  <br/><br/>Although the movie slows down after the race I am still moved by what happens later.  The movie follows up with how Judah dealt with the festering anger inside him and what happens to his mother and sister.   His love, Esther, helps the family and tries to console Judah.  I really like the character of Esther that is portrayed. <br/><br/>Most of all, the greatest character of all in this movie is that of Christ. In Christ we see someone suffering without the hatred and vengeance that is so shown by Judah.  A favorite scene of mine is when Christ gives Judah water to drink.  The Roman commander orders him to stop.  Jesus looks at him and the soldier is speechless.   That says it all.  <br/><br/>Charlton Heston has said that this movie could not be made today because of the prohibitive budget that would be required.  True.  But this movie also could not be made today because Hollywood is no longer capable of portraying Christ in a positive light.  Instead, Hollywood's attitude is one of prejudice towards Him.  How far it has come in the last 50 years.<br/><br/>This a great movie that is must see for everyone"

","This is just one of the greatest movies I've ever seen. It's old, yes, but it's great, great and great to be as old as it is. The special effects are great and the acting is hilarious. The story is from biblical time, when Jesus was living on earth. We meet Juda Ben-Hur who becomes a innocent slave under his best friend Messala, who becomes his worst enemy. The fight for freedom is hard and painfully, and Juda Ben-Hur has to do everything to prove his innocence, but is there much to prove? Charlton Heston does a great job as the leading role as Juda Ben-Hur. And he is great. I've watched this movie first time when I was 10, and I've watched it several times after that. I hope just they could send this old version on the cinemas again. One of the best movie ever made. Look just at the Oscars.<br/><br/>It deserves 10**********/10 :)"

It was nominated for twelve Academy Awards, Best Picture, Best Actor (Charlton Heston - his sole career Oscar), Best Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), Best Director (William Wyler), Best Color Cinematography, Best Color Art Direction/Set Decoration, Best Sound, Best Score, Best Film Editing, Best Color Costume Design, Best Special Effects, and Best Screenplay.

","Aside from Heston's hammy acting, the film is still holding very well after 40+ years. The chariot race is still the best action sequence filmed (even better than the sinking of the mighty Titanic) and most of the performances are still inspiring. It's been judged as being just a mediocre film but on the contrary its far better than that. The script is a bit flowery in the romantic parts but the conflict between Judah and Messala is just as good as anything current. The hatred between the two is so distinctive that you could cut it with a knife. Hugh Griffith provides the comic relief as the Sheik and Haya Harareet is very beautiful as Esther, Judah's love interest. The others performances are a bit outdated including Heston. His acting (in all of his films) is a little too distrustful by today's standards so it may prove a little trite in most scenes. But the story is still terrific and the costumes, sets and the action are brilliant."

","I first saw this film in the Viking theatre in Philadelphia.  That theatre was a true cinemascope theatre - the 50s equivalent of an imax experience. Needless to say, the film does not translate well to the small screen. The chariot race, easily the most spectacular sequence ever put on celluloid, loses much of its power when watched on the small screen.  Yeah - you folk with the in home theatres still won't fully appreciate how spectacular that sequence is.  The only sequence that comes close is the chase scene in Bullitt. But you can't appreciate that either by watching it on a TV.<br/><br/>
The film won 11 oscars and deserved every one of them.  A very long film - it had an intermission in it's original release, but it's never boring.  A tribute to the writers and director.<br/><br/>This movie is a classic in every sense of the term.  Heston has said that this film could not be made today.  Sadly, he's right.  Don't miss the opportunity to view this film - if it's in a theatre."

","Ben Hur is still the best of the biblical epics of the 40s and 50s and it still holds up well today. This is one of those movie that you claim ""They don't make 'em like this anymore"". Large and lavish with 'a cast of thousands', it astounds to this day. 	If you watch this movie for one reason, make it the chariot race which is still one of the best action sequences put on film ever. There aren't many action sequences that get heart racing like this. The rumbles of the horses, the overhead shots, the dust billowing up from the hoofs are simply exhilarating. The chariot race is all 'old-fashioned' film making. There is no computers. Everything you see is happening. There is some magnificent stuntwork (sadly, one stuntman died filming this sequence). 	There are some other strong sequences, like the Galley ship scene, in which director William Wyler (who made one of my other favourite movies ""The Collector"") builds up some wonderful suspense. 	The acting is strong especially Stephen Boyd as Masella, Ben Hur's sly nemesis. Charlton Heston does a fine job in the title role although I think he could do these biblical roles in his sleep. 	Makes a perfect double bill with ""Spartacus"" (if you have 7 hours to kill!)"
"Neal Wruck","Null","1","2","21 November 2001"," Still good after over 4 decades (Some spoilers)
","Recently, I watched Ben-Hur for my first time. The movie got off to a slow start and there are quite a few minutes I would have considered editing out (The overture alone was six minutes). But, after about half and hour or so, this movie really got going. The story revolves around Jonah Ben-Hur, a Jewish prince who is arrested for attempting to murder a roman governor (Which was untrue. It was a mere accident) and forced into slavery. Ben-Hur is portrayed in an Academy Award winning performance by Charlton Heston. Some critics have complained in the years following the film's release that Heston is wooden in his role. While his performance isn't brilliant and does have some poor moments, he is excellent nonetheless. The rest of the cast is also good. The sets, cinematography and special effects are also excellent, which is probably why they won among the film's Eleven Academy Awards, a tally that wouldn't be equaled until 1997's Titanic.  <br/><br/>I though at first that the opening scene of the film (The birth of Jesus Christ) had nothing to do with the movie. But Jesus was a main part in Ben-Hur's life, at least in his Hollywood life. He encouraged him to continue moving on when Jonah was a slave and also baptized him. When Jesus was dying at the cross, he performed one last miracle on the Hur family by curing Jonah's mother and sister of leprosy. <br/><br/>There is in this movie what is among the ten most celebrated action scenes in motion pictures: The chariot race. After more than forty years, the sequence has not lost its original excitement and is still inspiring directors today (See the pod race in Star Wars Episode One). What makes it so good is the way it was filmed. Sometimes, the camera angle makes it look as if we are spectators at the race. In other shots, we are chasing the chariots or even feel as though we are sitting in the driver's chair. The fact it was filmed in the 1950's before such a scene could be computer generated or filmed in front of a blue screen makes us appreciate it more because of the risks the producers took in filming it. Would such a scene be as great and realistic if filmed today? <br/><br/>Three-hour epics such as this are what can be considered an acquired taste. They are long and slow at times and often with unnecessary scenes. But this doesn't mean they aren't worth watching. If you want to learn about the Roman Empire or if you just feel like watching a good movie, Ben-Hur is highly recommended."

"cinemel","10","1","2","29 March 2001"," Classic epic film only improves with age.
","When we imagine the epic film as a genre, 3 films immediately come to mind: The Ten Commandments, Spartacus and Ben-Hur. Of the three, Ben-Hur is probably the most honored. It won 11 Oscars including Best Picture, Actor (Heston), Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), and Director (William Wyler). The only Oscar it didn't win was for Screenplay (Karl Tunberg). The reason probably had something to do with the fact that several other authors, including Gore Vidal, had a hand in its re-writing. What makes Ben-Hur a great epic? First, the sweep of its locations and settings. Giant sets were constructed on the grounds of the great Cinecitta Studios in Rome. State of the art special effects enhanced the two great action sequences (the sea battle and the chariot race). Next, the larger than life performances of the principals brought to life these imagined characters of novelist, Lew Wallace. Stephen Boyd is perfect as the Roman centurion, Messala, who has returned to Judea (Israel) to assume his place as military leader anxious to suppress the Hebrews who are ruled by the Roman Empire. Boyd never again had a role to equal this. He was a fine match for Heston who embodies the princely Ben-Hur whose friend he was in their childhood. It is their enmity that lies at the core of this tale. The underlying story of Christ parallels the journey of Ben-Hur intersecting at two crucial points in the film. Wyler wisely does not show the face of Christ. Instead, he shows people's reactions to him. In one scene, a Roman soldier is trying to prevent Ben-Hur (now a prisoner) from drinking water. After Christ lets him drink the soldier tries to stop him (`I said no water for him'). His reaction to the hidden face of Christ is worth a thousand words. No discussion of Ben-Hur would be complete without mentioning the towering musical score composed and conducted by Miklos Rozsa (Academy Award).  Finally, it is many qualities such as this that give Ben-Hur the stature of more than just a sword and sandal epic, but transform it into a personal drama. Its characters are living, breathing beings swept into events that make for exciting cinema. Jack Hawkins is fine as the Roman general whose life Ben-Hur saves (`We keep you alive to serve this ship. Row well and live.'). Hugh Griffith earned his Oscar as the humorous Sheik Ilderim who supplies Hur with the Arabian steeds that he will race against Messala in the great circus of Jerusalem (`There is no law in the arena. Many are killed.'). It all comes down to the chariot race that is the center of the second half of the film. There are no special effects here. The race is real. Heston and Boyd actually drive the chariots in almost all the scenes. No doubt, the chariot race is one of the greatest actions sequences in any film.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur has just been released on DVD in a superb new transfer with a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The epic was filmed in Camera 65 an ultra-wide process that is almost completely revealed on this disc. It would be something to see these classics projected on an IMAX screen. With the success of `Gladiator' someone in Hollywood should re-release the grand epics of the 50's and 60's in their original 70mm splendor. Ben-Hur could then be fully appreciated as the classic it is (one of AFI's greatest 100 films of the 20th century)."

","(spoiler) I know that most people want to examine the technical aspects of the film, but I can't help but watch ""Ben-Hur"" and marvel at how Lew Wallace (writer of the novel and movie) chose his perspective for the novel and the film. Most movies that tell the life of Jesus choose to tell it from the impartial viewer perspective--from the invisible ""I-know-what-all-the-characters-are-thinking-and-feeling"" standpoint (""Jesus of Nazereth"" for instance.  Great actors, great story--just didn't have that THING, the thing that makes you go, ""Wow, that was a GREAT movie."").  Telling it from Judah's perspective made it seem so real and personal, just like Christ works in people's lives.  HE had no clue what everyone else was thinking, and frankly didn't care (because of his drive of hate and aggression towards Messala).  The music suited the film--it wasn't fake or any of that false-epic-durge kind of stuff. Charlton Heston was perfect for the role because of his ability to convey intense emotions without being melodramatic or put-on (which is what being a great actor is all about).  Seeing Jesus' actions instead of concentrating on his face or physical appearance was genius; it showed the more important aspect of His life--His teachings and purpose--while giving Him the supernatural presence required, since no one can really describe Jesus completely.  The scene with Judah crying for help and Jesus giving him water...a true tearjerker for me!  Also symbolic of how (according to Christian theology) Jesus gives living water, and when you drink of Him you shall never thirst again.   And it is SO TOUGH when the Roman guard barks, ""I told you NONE FOR HIM!"" and Jesus just stands up.  Doesn't move. Doesn't flinch.  Doesn't say a word.  Just stands up and looks at him.  Ha haaaa!  That look on the guard's face--humbled and put in his place.  I just wanted to chide at him, ""You just can't whip Jesus.  Just can't.""  Esther does a great job of being Judah's former self--the Judah before the clash with Messala.  Esther was a great witness as well, telling Judah Christ's teachings without self-righteousness or oppression--just wanting to share the truth of the message.  All in all, I'd say the best movie of this century (sorry Titanic fans) and a masterpiece that's real and human, while focusing on the purpose of life."

","One thing that always bothers me about the Oscars ceremony, now about to enter its 71st year, is the necessity for each award on a yearly basis. Take the award for Best Male Actor. What if there were no good actors in a particular year? Should not the Academy say ""we'll drop this single award for the year, as no actor met the high standard we require?"" Similarly, the need for a ""Best Picture"" on a yearly basis is something that seriously undermines the credibility of the awards. Okay, Citizen Kane and The Shawshank Redemption were overlooked, but what really detracts is the ones that make it. Is the honour of winning ""Best Picture"" really as great when you know that means entering the same league of distinction as Titanic and Forrest Gump?<br/><br/>And so we come to Ben-Hur, which, before Titanic's equalling pull on the golden statuettes, was the largest recipient of the Oscars. This is something that is oft touted, and of course the main draw to watch the thing. Yet has anyone ever bothered to ask what competition it had? Just as Forrest Gump only had the unsuitable-through-excessive-violence Pulp Fiction to oppose it, 1959 was not a highpoint of cinematic achievement. Revered fare like North By Northwest, Some Like It Hot and The 39 Steps were released, but would ultimately have been too mainstream for the awards at that time. Critically popular foreign films such as Hiroshima Mon Amour and Apur Sansar were also led to the cinemas, but when has a foreign movie picked up ""Best Picture""? Room at the Top and The Diary of Anne Frank numbered amongst the token nominations, and so it was that Ben-Hur couldn't do anything BUT pick up 11 of the 29 awards going. (And it was only eligible for 15. Notable losses included no nominations for female cast members, who had little to do anyway, and a nomination but not a win for the writing).<br/><br/>It's just as well, then, that this 212 long minutes of MGM pomp and splendour deserved the awards laid at it's feet (Though I might contest the treacly sentimental music as not worthy of the ""Best Music, Scoring of a Dramatic or Comedy Picture"" Award). A visual feast, if not always an intellectual one, it's epic grandiosity is always present, whether it's in lesser-known scenes like the underground leper colony, or the most famous, the chariot race. For a film that's now over 40 years old, it has aged remarkably well, and if you can spot the odd matte effect in the depiction of coliseums, or the battles at sea, then they have aged far better than early 90s CGI. In fact, probably the only fault you could really level at the film is it's sentimentality which, while not awash with it, does overcome the final reels. Its old-fashioned rigid virtues do tend to drag, but it is, in the main, a constantly pleasing production with minimal ostentation. Take the scene where Hur first meets the horses he is to use in the chariot race. It's a standard scene and far from vital in terms of the narrative, but the fact that the four horses in question enter a tent and interact with the cast is a small delight in the film. A quartet of actor horses who come into a human domain without wrecking the place, and yawn and nod on queue. Yet, delightful as it is, it is stopped before it becomes trite or the training of the animals is overly apparent.<br/><br/>Interestingly, it's the characters off-screen that dictate the action. Hur's childhood friend, Messala (Stephen Boyd) is absent for over an hour of the middle section, yet is it Hur's hatred of what he has become that drives him, the desire for revenge against Messala that keep him alive. So too, the story follows the life of Jesus (the film's subtitle is ""A Tale of The Christ""), as seen through Ben-Hur's perspective. We never get to see Jesus' face or hear him speak, a factor that adds to his mystique.<br/><br/>
While the off-screen presences drive the narrative, the main characters fare perhaps less well. Heston is a strong lead as Hur, though the women are practically non-existent. Instead, what really forms the core of this movie is not the actors or parts, but the sheer spectacle. Films like this were made for the visual medium of cinema, with huge mock-ups of Jerusalem and Rome (cruelly destroyed by MGM after use so no Italian filmmakers could take advantage of them) and hundreds of extras. It's all in the sights, and on this perception alone it shames any latter-day action film for sheer excess. Not the most remarkable of the ""classic"" films, it must be said, but still an unmissable experience."

From the barren landscapes to the spare, beautifully photographed interiors, and then to the massive arena filled with spectators, this is a film to get the kids' imaginations into a reasonably depicted Roman Empire, into the history of conflicting cultures, and into human questions like loyalty and responsibility.  And Jesus was around.  Can't say he wasn't."

","This film is an obvious masterpiece, a real golden age cinematic extravaganza. It was the third remake, but of course the best. And it was showered with academy awards back when they actually meant something. Charleton Heston immortalized himself as the finest screen actor of the 20th century here, and this was his greatest role (even though The Greatest Show on Earth, The Ten Commandments, and of course Planet of the Apes are terrific as well). <br/><br/>Stephen Boyd was superb as the friend turned archfoe Messala, and Jack Hawkins was brilliant as Quintus Arrius, Judah's slavemaster turned savior. The drama, action, scenery, cinematography, and characters were truly breathtaking from start to finish, even by today's standards. Of course no expense was spared to deliver realistic looking Roman ocean battle scenes and chariot races, which are the finest points in this finest of films. And the courage and humanity is so marvelously conveyed throughout, from when Judah is saved from collapse in the desert by a water serving Jesus, to his miraculous escape from death aboard a Roman Galley ship.<br/><br/>
Obviously I loved this film, but don't take my word for it. See it on network tv or borrow it from your local library. Its probably better to see it on tape because you can take breaks from its 3 1/2 hour length. Not too campy for adults, and not too dramatic for children, its perfect for all ages."

The story begins when Judah's best friend, the proud Roman Messalah, tries to persuade him to thwart any Jewish uprisings in Judea.  When Messalah fears that Judah is a conspirator toward Rome, he forces Judah into slavery and his mother and sister into prison.

"lavatch","Null","1","3","4 February 2017"," The Saga of Judah Ben-Hur
","On the surface, the classic ""Ben-Hur"" is remembered for the dazzling chariot race featuring the grimacing Charlton Heston at the reins. But on a deeper level, this leisurely paced and nearly four-hour big-budget film is a great Christian tale.<br/><br/>Based on the bestselling novel of Civil War general Lew Wallace and first published in 1880, ""Ben-Hur""is set in Judea at the time of Christ. Judah Ben-Hur is a patrician Jew, who comes into conflict with his childhood chum Messala, who becomes the Roman Tribune of Judea. An accident that kills a Roman consul implicates Judah, his mother, and his sister, leading to the imprisonment of the women and to the sentence of Judah as a galley slave.<br/><br/>After Judah saves the life of another consul, Quintus Arrius, on the Roman ship, he is adopted as a Roman citizen. He becomes a skilled charioteer who figures in the famous chariot race in which Messala cheats during the race and is eventually trampled under the horses' hooves when he falls from his chariot. Of course, Judah is the winner.<br/><br/>The film has an overt homoerotic level in the interactions of Messala and Judah. But it is Jack Hawkins as Quintus Arrius who steals the show, especially when he is gawking at the manly muscles of the galley slaves during their rowing exercises.<br/><br/>The plot summary above fails to convey the principal mission of the film to tell the story of the Crucifixion. At a critical moment of his life, Judah Ben-Hur was befriended by a stranger who gave him water when he was near death. The stranger touches the life of Judah in a way that will promote love and healing in his family. Of course, the stranger is Jesus of Nazareth.<br/><br/>Much of the Lew Wallace narrative is clumsy, especially the sequence when Judah's mother and sister become lepers and the love of Judah's life, Esther, refuses to reveal the truth to him. It is only the power of Jesus that eventually produces the miracle that will place love, instead of revenge, in the heart of Judah Ben-Hur."
"gab-14712","9","1","3","10 January 2016"," A Beautifully-Made Epic!
","In 1956, The Ten Commandments was released to a massive success around the world. It had such a worldwide appeal due to the story being well-known everywhere. Three years later, another wildly successful epic was released in the form of Ben-Hur. This movie seems like the first cousin of The Ten Commandments. Both are stories based off biblical events, and Charlton Heston plays the lead role in both films. Heston wasn't nominated for any major awards with his 1956 film, but he was nominated and won an Oscar for his amazing portrayal of Judah Ben-Hur, an influential man amongst his people.<br/><br/>If I had to choose what my favorite epic was from this era, I would have chosen Ben-Hur. It has such a fascinating story as it's about a man who wants what is only right for his people. His people are conquered by the Romans, and he wants a better life for them. The movie goes into so much detail on the man Judah was. He was alive for the teachings of Jesus Christ, although he was not seen to be an ardent supporter. However, one of the best scenes in the movie was Judah and his family watching Jesus being marched with a cross on his back on his way to be crucified. That scene did admittedly tear me up.<br/><br/>Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a rich Jewish merchant whom resides in Jerusalem. An old childhood Roman friend of his named Messala (Stephen Boyd) arrives to become commanding officer of Jerusalem. Both men are extremely happy to see each other at first, but their friendship becomes divided over political issues. When the governor arrives during a welcome parade, a tile falls off the roof accidentally injuring the governor. Messala takes advantage of the incident and the broken friendship with Judah to send Judah into slavery and his mother and sister into prison. Judah makes a name for himself in the galleys and becomes a Roman prince. Now Judah comes back home and he vows revenge on Messala for how he treated his family.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston had the fortune to appear in what are the two most famous epics of all time. He was able to convince me in his performance as Moses. Now in this film, he even more so convinces me as Judah Ben-Hur. Both men want to do what is right for their people, but they are two different men. Heston does an amazing job in this role and I believe he deserves his Oscar victory. Stephen Boyd does well as Messala. Both Heston and Boyd have excellent chemistry, which makes the broken friendship even more gut-wrenching. We also get strong supporting performances from Cathy O'Donnell and Martha Scott who portrayed Ben-Hur's mother and sister respectively. They mostly spend their time in the film battling leprosy, which is a very gruesome disease. The makeup department did a very good job in accurately showing the symptoms of leprosy. I also liked Hugh Griffith's performance as Sheik Ilderim, who turns out to be a useful ally for Ben-Hur. He provided some comedy, especially when it came to offering Ben-Hur his daughters to marry. Finally, Haya Harareet does a fine job as the love interest of Ben-Hur, Esther.<br/><br/>At the time of the film's release, it had the largest budget of any film released. It had a price tag of around fifteen million dollars, or 123 million dollars when adjusted to today's standards by inflation. I believe the budget was spent properly. The epic is beautiful and is home too many large, grand scenes. The most famous scene is the well-known chariot scene, which would hold up well in any movie released today. The race itself was epic and it features some hardcore chariot racing. The chariot race takes time to complete, and I'm glad it does. It's my favorite sequence of the movie and it's arguably the most action-packed scene of the 210-minute film. When one thinks of Ben-Hur, they will always bring up the chariot scene. It is a very influential scene on future movies.<br/><br/>There were some other scenes I loved to such as the scene in the galleys where Judah rescues a Roman general at sea during war and he becomes an adopted son of the general. Whenever Judah and Messala appear on screen together is always worth watching. Judah's search for his family is also a powerful section of the movie. The movie looks gorgeous and the production design is wonderful. Ancient Rome actually looked authentic, which is hard to say of movies released during this time period. Jerusalem also looked authentic too. I also loved the score by Miklos Rosza. It was a beautiful score to listen to and it works very well with the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, Ben-Hur is a flat-out great epic. The movie does run into pacing problems, but that can be expected at a movie clocked around three-and-a-half hours. Everything is consistent with the film ranging from the acting to the special effects (no CGI of course) to the wonderful direction of William Wyler. Without Wyler's consistent tonal direction, who knew if this film would work. As a history film, this film may not always be accurate. But they did get the tone mostly right. A winner of 11 Oscars including Best Picture, this is one of my favorite epics to watch.<br/><br/>My Grade: A"
"Seraphion","9","1","3","14 November 2015"," Epic...
","There is only one word worthy enough to describe this movie, as I wrote on the title; EPIC. I watched this movie out of curiosity, and aiming for the IMDb badge. But it turns out that it was a very worthy experience. An epic adventure of almost four hour in duration, this movie was able to include many genres into it. There's the whole drama parts, where I see so many other revenge movies, also epic ones, take their inspiration from, such as The Count of Monte Cristo and even Gladiator. There's the great cinematography done on the ship battle scene and particularly the chariot race scene. And there's the touching moments time and time again where the story brushes with the story of the life of Jesus. The acting overall feels quite nice. Charlton Heston did well in giving definition to Judah Ben-Hur's character, as well as Stephen Boyd and Hugh Griffith in their respective characters. The other cast members also did well enough to attain such deep characters, supporting this colossal endeavor of a movie."

","Like Lawrence of Arabia and other epic mid-20th century film, Ben-Hur is a long watch. Almost 4 hours long with an intermission between the two parts of the film, it does require a lot of patience to get through . It took me more than one sitting to finish the entire movie, but it was worth it in the end. The first part is a little slow to begin with, and yet there's still a lot that isn't shown in the movie and is cut out to save some time. The second half moves along quicker and brings about one of the most climactic chariot racing scenes I have ever seen as well as a crucifixion scene that nearly brought me to tears. <br/><br/>Ben-Hur is not necessarily a ""Tale of Christ"", as the tag-line proclaims. It is a tale of betrayal, revenge, anger and forgiveness set in the backdrop of Christ. The film centres mostly on Judah Ben-Hur's extraordinary tale of his exile from Judea and his eventual return to find and seek revenge for his imprisoned family. In the background, Jesus of Nazareth gains popularity as a speaker promoting love and forgiveness, culminating in his crucifixion which changes Judah's outlook on the world and allows him to open his heart again. <br/><br/>A long watch, but definitely worth it in the end. Wonderfully done."
"Rueiro","10","1","3","30 March 2014"," The epic that topped them all
","I am not going to write an essay on this film, because everything that could have been said about it has already been said. I first saw it when I was sixteen, and loved it. I must have seen it thirty times ever since, and I never get tired of it. The film certainly has many goofs. The chariot race is full of continuity mistakes between shots and the contenders certainly take a lot more than the nine turns they were supposed to take around the circus. But it is absolutely great and exciting, and still unmatched today as a piece of live action. It took weeks to shoot and one of the stunt-men smashed a $100,000 camera when his chariot skidded out of control. In the naval battle you can tell the scale models used in the long shots. But who cares? In the crowd scenes with extreme long shots, both at the Victory parade and later at the circus, you can tell they are matte shots. But they look so beautiful that you almost believe they are real things. Nowadays CGI always sticks out like a sore thumb -that aerial shot of the circus in ""Gladiator"" is just awful! Messala is one of the greatest villains of all time because of Stephen Boyd's brilliant performance. A usually underrated actor, here he steals every scene from Chuck Heston. Also, he has one of the greatest death scenes ever. Miklos Rozsa created the mother of all epic scores, still unmatched today. Two years in preproduction and ten months of actual shooting, thousands of extras, a real-scale replica of a Roman circus, accurate replicas of Roman chariots, and eighty pure-bred especially trained horses. Final cost: fifteen million dollars. The most expensive film ever made to that date. A remake would be totally ruined by today's trendy styles of camera-work, music, acting, sound effects and visual texture. And CGI, and PC issues. Fourteen years ago, ""Gladiator"" was awful. Today, it would be even worse."

","One of the greatest Hollywood epics of all time, the first film ever to win the record amount of 11 Academy Awards, most of them well deserved. Charlton Heston stars as the Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, who finds out his once close friendship with the young Roman aristocrat Messala (Stephen Boyd) has succumbed to his strict duties as a Roman officer. This new distrust between them soon turns to hatred when, after an accident that leaves the new Roman governor of Judea wounded, Messala condemns Judah to the galleys as a slave and sends his family to the dungeons. However, Judah survives his ordeal, fueled by his hate, and in a grandiose naval battle between the Roman fleet and pirates, rescues the life of Roman Consul Arrius (Jack Hawkins), after which he is redeemed by the Emperor, adopted by Arrius and embarks on a star career as a charioteer before returning to Judea to seek vengeance on Messala in the sands of the most famous chariot race in film history. However, winning the race and fatally crippling his adversary in the process does not return his family or his happiness, things only Christ can give him on the Cross. For the majority of modern day viewers, the overt Christian overtones in the final third of the movie – the film is subtitled 'a Tale of the Christ after all – are hard to bear in their cheesiness, but this movie remains a solid undying classic in every other respect (with extra credit going to the great CinemaScope cinematography, the wonderful, catchy music and the excellent production design): the fabulous naval battle and the highly exciting chariot race remain unsurpassed."

It was a history lesson in a way, showing the brutality of the Romans, conflict between Rome and nearby nations, a chariot race, and well-known characters from the era (such as Pontius Pilate and Jesus). The action scenes are quite interesting, especially the chariot race - Remember that it wasn't as easy to do these back when the movie was made (no CGI during the 1950's). There are also a lot of themes in the movie (such as love, hate, death, healing, sadness, joy). The movie is long (more than 3 hours), and there are moments without much action, but I never felt bored while watching it.

"Kubris","8","1","3","21 June 2012"," Prepare for religion
","IMDb Top 250: 158<br/><br/>Here's a fact: Ben-Hur won 11 Oscars, the most in history, and you'll keep thinking about that throughout the film. Here's a slightly opinionated fact: you may not like this as much as Spartacus, or Lawrence of Arabia, or even Gladiator if you've seen them first. That just how films age. And here's a slightly factual opinion: your religious views will affect your liking of the film. As such, this review is subjective in places.<br/><br/>The synopsis claims this film is about Prince Judah Ben-Hur and how he is betrayed by a friend and comes back for revenge. That's not true. That's the plot of Gladiator. Ben-Hur begins the same way, and revenge is sought out... then the film goes on for another hour. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, just a little deceptive. I wasn't prepared for the complete family subplot, and being of a younger generation, I had no idea how prevalent Jesus and the beginnings of Christianity would be. <br/><br/>I guess I'll get right to that. The scenes with Jesus are one of the two best scene types in the film. Seeing him give a pained Ben-Hur water is really something, but his final scene, won't spoil it here but you probably know how it ends, is elevating. I thought it was cool that they were showing Jesus to be realistic, simply a man teaching faith and how to live a better life... until the miracles came into play. It was too positive, considering the gut wrenching previous sequence.<br/><br/>The other great scenes were the action scenes. The naval battle was remarkable, but most iconic is the chariot race that has held up remarkably. Its sheer scope and intensity is breathtaking, but its the cinematography that keeps the very long scene still relevant to today. <br/><br/>Ben-Hur is a well-deserving recipient of its technical Oscars. The sets are grand and filled with period props, the costumes are innumerable and lavish, extras number in the thousands, the sound is remarkable and the music is bombastic. Despite running too long, Ben-Hur gives something good to look at for three and a half hours.<br/><br/>The acting is tough to assess, because its of a different generation. Quick head turns to dramatic music happen frequently, as well as awkward less-than-5-second kisses. But Charlton Heston is great as the wrong Judah Ben-Hur, and nihilistic Quintius Aerius and the gambling horse racer are great characters as well. Messala certainly rises to meet Ben- Hur as the villain though. He's just a bad guy and right until the end he radiates lost love.<br/><br/>Now I can't quite understand the moral of the story, so skip this paragraph over if you somehow haven't seen this film. Judah gets his revenge, and while 1) it's not intentional and 2) he doesn't enjoy it, he doesn't get the closure we thought he would get from it. Then he, because of timing, decides to follow Christianity, but only after his revenge was complete. Also, this is a quote from the synopsis on Wikipedia: ""Miriam and Tirzah are miraculously healed."" That's just bad plot for the sake of a happy ending. I don't really know what's accomplished by the end: I feel like without the miracle the ending would've had a most believable pro- Christian message by being fairly objective from non-believer Judah's view.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur is a landmark in film that hasn't aged as well as some other similar films. Visually it remains spellbinding, but with a long runtime, muddled plot and uncertain message, it just can't hold up in today's less religious society. 7.7/10"
"cinemabon","10","1","3","8 April 2011"," Greatest religious epic of all time
","Everyone writes how great Heston is in this film. William Wyler nearly fired Heston the first day. He said, ""Chuck you'd better bring your game up or I'll have to replace you."" It was Wyler who set the standard for this and all of his films (his movies garnered more Oscar nominations than any director in the history of film). Greer Garson called him ""ninety take Willie."" He demanded perfection and usually got it. From Miklos Rosza's score to the incredible performances from all of his actors, ""Ben Hur"" was a screen classic the moment it debuted. Contrast that with other religious epics and few compare. Wyler purposely did not show the face of Jesus. He felt ""christ"" should reflect all of humanity, and so refused to typify any image, regardless of the studio pressure to do so. Wyler won the Oscar (his third) and capped a crowning career with more hit films, more best picture nominations, and more accolades than any director before or since. Highly recommended on blue ray disc for details not present on previous versions, especially the DVD special feature on Yakima Canutt's second unit who made the chariot race scenes possible."

","Watching 'Ben-Hur (1959)' is a lot like paying a visit to the Colosseum. Situated in Rome, Italy, this massive elliptical amphitheatre is the largest ever built in the Roman Empire, able to seat up to 80,000 spectators for gladiatorial games and various public spectacles. I've never been to Rome myself, but I'd imagine that one would look up at this amazing feat of ancient architecture, and be left in awe at the scale of it all. You would marvel at the amount of care and labour that must have gone into such a project, particularly given the comparatively primitive tools with which the builders had worked. I feel the same way about 'Ben-Hur'  William Wyler's epic of epics, and, at the time, the most expensive film ever made. Winner of eleven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, this colossal cinematic gamble resurrected M-G-M from financial ruin. But is it worth nearly four hours of your time? Like a lumbering elephant, 'Ben-Hur' wallows in its immensity, extravagance and self-importance. But it is epic  oh, so very epic!  and, like the Colosseum, demands our awe.<br/><br/>Earlier this year, I decreed 'Ben-Hur' to be the one film that I wouldn't watch until I had the luxury of viewing it in the cinema. Sooner than expected, the opportunity came along, though the Christmas Eve screening date made it essential that I bring the usual holiday festivities forward one day. The sacrifice was much warranted, for this film can only be fully experienced in the theatre, not least because of the breathtaking 70mm anamorphic print, with an aspect ratio of 2.76:1  one of the widest ever made. William Wyler fills every frame with extravagance, such that even the quietest person-to-person conversation takes place in a magnificent, lavishly-decorated chamber. Such expansive surroundings often promote coldness and detachedness from the audience (many uninvolving historical epics were produced around this period), and 'Ben-Hur' doesn't entirely escape the same fate; for every exciting and emotional sequence, there are maybe two scenes of negligible exposition. But the film thrives on its excesses, and, fortunately, the good scenes are so incredibly good that they merit the wait.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston won an Oscar for his portrayal of Judah Ben-Hur, though his performance is merely adequate without being particularly brilliant. Heston, an actor who flourished mostly on sheer charisma, I think, appears to struggle in the film's most emotional moments {my personal pick for the award that year would have been Laurence Harvey in Jack Clayton's 'Room at the Top (1959)'}. Stephen Boyd, though un-nominated, is quite terrific as Messala, Judah's boyhood friend who was later corrupted by the evils of the Roman Empire. Though there are many exciting scenes  such as the fiery ocean battle or Christ's crucifixion  the film's undisputed centrepiece is, of course, the extraordinary chariot race, a marvel of adrenalin-charged action and suspense. Every single metre of the contest had me enthralled, every jolt and tremble of the carriage sending an agitated chill down my spine. The sequence's enduring influence is to be found in practically every historical epic that followed, most noticeably Ridley Scott's Best Picture-winning 'Gladiator (2000).'<br/><br/>To be denied one's name is the film's greatest tragedy. When condemned to a lifetime of slavery aboard a Roman galley, Judah loses his important status and is delegated a generic identification number  #41. His mother and sister, having contracted leprosy after years in confinement, later flee to a leper colony, where, we are told, names are of no use. After being liberated from captivity by the kindly nobleman Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins), Judah takes on the name of his newly-adopted father, a compassionate gesture but one that he is later ashamed to have accepted. To be denied one's face, on the other hand, is apparently divine. Claude Heater, as Jesus Christ, is never properly seen, glimpsed only from behind or at a distance. In this way, the Messiah is portrayed as something holy and angelic, not to be glimpsed by mortal eyes. Though the story of Christ may only form a subplot, thematically it sits at the film's heart.

"screenman","8","1","3","29 March 2008"," A Flawed Epic
","Judging a movie from the 1950's by third millennium standards is always fraught with problems. Moral standards and censorship mores have changed so much, as indeed have viewer expectations. Half a century ago cinema was the primary source of entertainment; now it competes with many others. <br/><br/>'Ben Hur' has an in-built interpretational problem. Right from the outset we are warned that this is a story of Christ, when in fact; it isn't. It's a story of betrayal and revenge between two friends who become sworn enemies. Christ hardly gets a look-in. <br/><br/>The essential conflict that develops between Ben Hur and Messala is one that it as old as humanity - far older than Christianity. It is my belief that the director should have stuck to the one and abandoned the other. But as I say, perhaps the morals of the day wouldn't readily have accepted it. Observed at the human level, and stripped of all the theological face-ache, this is still a very engaging movie which has many parallels today. <br/><br/>The acting is a little florid and campy but you don't have to go back to biblical times to find people behaving with theatrical excess. The fact that today we tend to have abandoned 'ritual' in our behaviour in exchange for a rather contemptuous simplicity hasn't necessarily improved our society. It certainly isn't more polite or better-mannered. The pace of story-telling is set at a slower tempo, and you either get your head round that and enjoy it - or you don't. I'm old enough to have grown up with it, so I can. In fact I prefer it to the more frenetic cut, cut, and cut again style of modern movies. <br/><br/>'Ben Hur' is a sword 'n' sandals epic. One of the big five, which would include 'Spartacus', 'Fall of The Roman Empire', 'King of Kings' and 'The Ten Commandments'. The cast is top-drawer, they act well, there are some excellent lines and the costumes are lavish. There are also some spectacular set-pieces. The long shots of a naval battle have a slightly 'Airfix in the bath-tub' look about them which are sadly typical of the decade. Some CGI would certainly have helped them along. But the fights are well choreographed. There's a scene where some schmuck climbs out of the rowing gallery with a bloodied stump instead of a hand and that looks suitably gruesome. <br/><br/>And then, of course, there's the chariot race. It only lasts for a few minutes and is the climax of the movie. But what a climax! As a piece of kick-in-the-pants action this has never been bettered. You are right there in the arena, and it's mayhem all the way. Quite frankly, I cannot think of any way it could be improved. Even today, CGI would add nothing to the in-your-face realism, because this race really is happening. Stunt doubles never earned their money half so well. Very authentic dummies get trampled to death. An innocent Roman guard and the ambulance crews are all implicated in slaughter. I only hope that no horses were harmed in the production because they're all right there in the thick of it, live and galloping. This is an object lesson in how to film a race and is itself worth the price of the DVD. <br/><br/>Messala gets his desserts. The skin is practically trampled off him and his woulds look horrific and believable. <br/><br/>The movie should have ended with the final confrontation between BenHur and a dying Messala. Unfortunately it didn't. The director appeared to belatedly remember that this was supposed to be a movie about Christ. As a result, a long, turgid, appendix was grafted on, in which Ben Hur drags his leprous relatives to see the crucifixion, and they are miraculously cured. Miklos Rosza - who seemed to have cornered the market in providing music for the genre - really lets rip big time, with enough heavenly bombast to beat your eardrums limp. <br/><br/>I have no objection to theology in its place and several movies like 'King of Kings' and 'The Ten Commandments' leave you in no doubt what you are signing-up for. You can take it or leave it. But 'Ben Hur' is manifestly not a story about Christ and his inclusion simply muddies the water. <br/><br/>Stripped of the bible-beating excess and with a little more attention paid to the nautical battle, this movie would knock 'Gladiator' into a cocked hat. Certainly, as a tortured soul with an axe to grind, Charlton Heston makes Russell Crowe seem like a ventriloquist's dummy. As it is, with 'musical Micky' out to deafen you, ships like painted shoe-boxes, and the stultifying theological bi-line, it is more of a flawed epic than a masterpiece."

","This telling of the many trials and tribulations of Judah Ben-Hur is indeed one of my favorite classic films.Watching it makes me wish I had been around to see it on the big screen back in the day.The story is quite captivating.He is forced to stand against a man who was a childhood friend that he loved dearly.He takes the blame for his own family in an incident against a Roman governor that was nothing more than an accident,and is forced into slavery by that former friend.Somehow he perseveres,ultimately becoming an adopted son of the consul from the very ship on which he was enslaved,and sets out to find his family,as well as the friend who betrayed them.I have always admired those who take the time,money and effort to bring bible stories,or stories based on the bible to life on the big screen,and William Wyler did an outstanding job with Ben-Hur,as did Charlton Heston and everyone else involved.With it's 11 Academy Awards,it's obvious that Hollywood very smartly thought so as well.Let me not close without mentioning the still talked about chariot race,which is often called the best action sequence in cinema history.I haven't seen every action sequence ever filmed,but it is indeed hard to believe anyone can top that.Excellent film."

","""Ben-Hur"" has always been one of my favorite movies and I find it a very emotional experience every time I see it. ""A Tale of the Christ"", I would suggest that while Judah Ben-Hur is in nearly every scene, the central character of the entire movie is Jesus Christ.<br/><br/>The lives of Judah Ben-Hur and Jesus Christ parallel each other. They're about the same age and later in the movie one of the Magi meets Judah with the hope that he is the Christ Child now grown to manhood. Just prior to Christ's return to Jerusalem and the Crucifixion, Judah narrowly escapes death in the spectacular chariot race (17 of the greatest minutes in the history of film-making) and is cynically hailed by Pontius Pilate as the Jewish people's ""one true god."" Discovering that his mother & sister are not dead but are lepers, Judah is on the verge of using his fame and fortune to lead a revolt against the Romans. But Christ leads the true revolt and through His sacrifice, heals Judah's family of leprosy and Judah of his thirst for revenge.<br/><br/>There are several very emotional scenes throughout the movie and aspect of the movie is terrific. A stirring musical score, sterling acting by everyone in the cast but in particular by Charlton Heston and Hugh Griffith who received deserved Oscars and by Stephen Boyd and Jack Hawkins who could have received Oscars as well. The finest performances of their careers. Tremendous costumes, great dialog, and the centerpiece of the movie, the thrilling chariot race.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"" won 11 Oscars, a feat matched only by ""Titanic"". Both are examples of epic film-making but ""Ben-Hur"" will always remain the standard by which all epics will be measured."
"ericbryce2","10","1","3","22 February 2007"," Ultimate 50s Bibical epic
","This is an excellent movie and I've probably seen it fifty times. The music has become the theme by which that whole era of biblical epics is known. Although a work of fiction it has been embraced by generations for it's religious overtones. The story of one man's life and his search for vengeance and justice in the time of the world first fascist society. Ben Hur's number when he was chained to an oar on a Roman galley was forty one. I've often wondered if that was some kind of inside joke on the set. There is one strange scene which I noticed years ago but I'll bet few have noticed it. When Judah goes and collects his mother and sister from the leper colony they make their way to Jerusalem. They get to a place where they stop to watch Jesus go by on his way to the Crucifixion. Judah is carrying his sister. When they get to the place where they stop to watch, Judah kind of chucks his sister off to the side at that point and throws a blanket on her. It's very abrupt and I believe the actress who played the sister was a little startled too. Watch for it the next time you see Ben Hur."
"classicsoncall","10","1","3","3 December 2006"," ""How do you fight an idea, especially a new idea?""
","The word that kept coming to me throughout my viewing of ""Ben-Hur"" was 'grand'; the film has a wondrous feel of grandeur even in it's most serene moments. The vibrancy of it's color comes through gloriously, perhaps in part due to it's treatment on the four disc DVD special edition. It's a film that one can easily use to describe the term epic, the type of movie that comes out perhaps once in a decade.<br/><br/>I'm particularly impressed with the way director William Wyler managed to intersperse defining moments of Christ's life in a way that did not detract from the character of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston). Those include the Sermon on the Mount and the washing of Pilate's hands as the Judean governor turned Jesus over to the mob. In those instances, Ben-Hur is shown consumed by the urgency of his quest to oppose Roman authority. He is not a direct witness to Christ's mission, yet those pivotal moments come full circle when Ben-Hur realizes that the man to be crucified is one and the same who showed him a kindness as Judah was marched off, condemned to be a galley slave in a Roman war ship.<br/><br/>The scene in the movie that everyone calls to mind obviously is the chariot race. Magnificently staged in an era bereft of the kind of digital effects available today, the segment withstands the passage of time for excitement and believability. What I found particularly intriguing was the incredible stunt work that had it's birth in the early days of the Western film genre, most notably in the work of Yakima Canutt. To my surprise, Canutt's name appeared in the credits as head of the second unit, along with his sons who took up their father's mantle in the business. The scenes of chariot drivers falling victim to their reckless abandon has the indelible stamp of Yakima Canutt all over it, owing in large part to stunt techniques he developed back in the 1930's.<br/><br/>But back to the spiritual message. Judah Ben-Hur's ultimate victory does not involve hand to hand combat with an enemy, or leading a citizenry to revolt against a tyrannical Roman governor. It has all to do with the quiet power of Christ washing away the world's sins along with the disfiguring leprosy of Judah's mother and sister; the same power that compels Ben-Hur to give up his sword, instead of wielding it for hateful revenge."
"ragosaal","8","1","3","31 October 2006"," "" The Race Continues Judah ! ""
","""Ben Hur"" is one of the classic epic spectaculars so common back in the 50's and early 60's and ranks among the best along with ""Quo Vadis"", ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Spartacus"", ""El Cid"" and some other. But which one is ""the"" best? They're all very good films so number 1 will depend on each one's personal preference; perhaps ""Spartacus"" is the top one for me, but a different choice couldn't be questioned.<br/><br/>No doubt William Wyler was a very competent director and he succeeds in delivering a most enjoying, interesting, touching and powerful picture that deals with love, friendship, loyalty, treason, revenge and religious faith.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most remembered moment of film is the impressive chariot's race in a time where computers were not around and stunts risked their physical integrity to make things believable for us. Great music too that goes along with the sense of greatness the picture transmits. In my opinion the last part when Judah searches for his mother and sister is perhaps a bit slow, but it doesn't hurt the film.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston renders an intense performance as Judah Ben Hur with outstanding moments in the role around which the whole film is built. Jack Hawkins shows the necessary dignity as Quintus Arrius the Roman consul that adopts Heston and gives him his name and status. Hugh Griffith won a most deserved Oscar as Arab sheik Ilderim the man who convinces Judah to face Messala in the race (""... there's no law in the arena""). Stehphen Boyd renders what is perhaps his best performance ever as Messala the childhood friend of Judah that becomes his sworn enemy just for ambition and fights him fiercely (his final sequence after the race is outstanding if not brilliant). The accurate supporting cast includes Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell (as Heston's mother and sister), Sam Jaffe (good old Gunga Din), Finlay Currie and Australian actor Frank Thring a regular villain in costume epics back then (""The Vikings"", ""El Cid"", ""King of Kings"") here in a more sympathetic role as Poncious Pilate.<br/><br/>An excellent piece of cinema or even more considering it was made more than 45 years ago. Once again: they don't make films like this one anymore."
"arturus","10","1","3","7 May 2006"," Colossal
","That was a word that distributors used to use to describe their latest releases. In this case that word indeed describes this picture! I've seen this film many times, in many places, in many versions, from its first 70mm ""road show"" presentation in New York during Christmas 1959, to several times at small neighborhood theaters, in a 35mm print with mono sound; on television on a faded ""pan and scan"" print chopped up for commercials. I played the (mono) LP copy of the first recording of the musical score till it was worn out! So I can fairly say that I know this film very well.<br/><br/>I just saw it again, in ""letterbox"" format, from beginning to end, and found it just as impressive as I did the first time, almost 50 years ago. The story moves slowly but one never loses interest, thanks to the splendid performances, Rozsa's score, and Wyler's beautifully composed images and tight editing. <br/><br/>There are some moments that seem contrived and don't work now: The entry into Rome seems totally over the top, particularly since the picture makes the Roman Forum and the steps up to the Capitoline seem three times their actual size, more like 20th century Paris or Moscow than first century Rome! The sea battle is not very convincing (""models in a bathtub"" is what came to mind), and the moments of spiritual transformation, using a change of lighting and the sound of an organ rather than just the expression on the actors' faces, seems clichéd and obvious now. At Ben Hur's final transformation, when he is climbing the stairs to greet his mother and sister, a key light literally turns on and illumines the right side of his face! <br/><br/>Some moments still work splendidly, and some moments seem to work even better than they used to. The scenes with the Christ are all silent; one never hears his voice or sees his face, only the reaction of others to him, and this works powerfully, taking the sentimentality away and clarifying the Christian message. This was a film convention of the time, when picturing Jesus, but Wyler's handling of it is masterful. One can see all of the Sermon on the Mount, for example, in Haya Harareet's face as her character hears it. Thus we see Jesus and hear his voice in our own way. Wonderful.<br/><br/>The motivations, too, are clear, thanks to the well-written script and Wyler's direction, in a way that the 1925 version, and the novel itself, do not clarify, from Messala's anger (unreturned love), Judas' betrayal (fear and lack of faith) to Pilate's denial (political expediency).<br/><br/>The motivation behind the rift between Messala and Ben Hur is particularly clear, and makes total sense.<br/><br/>On every level, this film still works."

Caricatured and lampooned in comic strips, TV skits and popular word-of-mouth jokes, it has achieved an immortality that somehow surpasses the film itself.<br/><br/>Here's one.<br/><br/>The ""hortator"" who beats a drum setting the rowing pace on a Roman galley ship:<br/><br/>""Good news boys, the captain has ordered extra rations of bread and wine and a day's shore leave for everybody.""<br/><br/>""The bad news - the captain wants to go water skiing tomorrow.""<br/><br/>SPOILER: When I got hold of a video version of the film several years ago, I kept replaying that battle scene. As a kid, I marveled at the naval tactics of the Roman general played by Jack Hawkins who exuded an ambivalent mixture of genteel urbanity and a cavalier disregard for human life and suffering. The commands ""Battle speed!"" ""Attack speed!"" ""Ramming speed!"" always sent my pulse racing.<br/><br/>The sound effects and background music are also great considering that this was well before the time of Dolby and THX. The rousing music ""The March of the Charioteers."" It's the same music played during the Roman General's triumphal entry into Rome. It can be ranked as one of the most stirring marches of all time and was included in a Reader's Digest vinyl record collection.<br/><br/>Antiquarians and history buffs surely appreciated the detailed costumes and armor of the Roman officers, the architecture of the famed Fortress Antonia of the Roman garrison in Palestine, the signet rings used to certify legal documents, the brazen fish at the stadium used to mark the end of each lap in the chariot race. Trivia: Most people wrongly assume that the race was held at the Circus Maximus in Rome with the Emperor Augustus presiding. Not so, that city must be Caesarea Philippi, a city near Jerusalem built by Herod the Great for the Romans to accommodate their temples and baths which were not allowed in Jerusalem as Jewish law and moral sensibilities forbade them. The Romans did bend over backwards to accommodate the Jews' insistence on religious autonomy because the latter were such implacable rebels. The person who was supposed to be presiding at the chariot race is Pontius Pilate played by Frank Thring. It was not right to costume him in royal looking robes. Pilate was a military governor. He would have been in soldier's uniform or armor or, as this was a non-military event, he would have donned the white robe with red borders of the senatorial class of which he must have been a member. Many classical paintings of Christ's passion do show him in such costume."

His physical charisma on screen stomps Heston into the ground. His emotional charisma -- look at Boyd's eyes; listen to his voice; watch his body language -- the same.<br/><br/>Boyd's final death scene after the chariot race -- brutally mutilated yet still defiant -- and STILL loving to Judah Ben-Hur -- after all he's put his childhood Jewish friend through -- is -- JOLTING! Your heart is with him until his last breath.<br/><br/>THAT'S an actor.<br/><br/>Heston was bone structure, torso, voice and ""technique"" -- derived from some acting school that bore no resemblance to real life.<br/><br/>Wyler cast Heston, finally, perfectly, as Judah Ben-Hur, and directed him flawlessly.<br/><br/>But it was Wyler's casting of Stephen Boyd -- and Boyd's talent at portraying Messala's love, jealousy, vengeance, hatred, malice, duplicity and weakness that made ""Ben-Hur"" work, emotionally.<br/><br/>Whether we realize it consciously or not, what we're crying for at the finale of ""Ben-Hur,"" replete with Miklos Rozsa's glorious score, is not the resurrection and salvation of ""the Christ"" -- but the loss of childhood love and friendship to hatred and prejudice -- the loss of what might have been, between Judah and Messala.

For the few who do not know the basic plot, Charlton Heston plays Judah Ben-Hur a Jewish nobleman in Roman ruled Judea. Stephen Boyd is Messala a Roman, boyhood friend of Heston's character who has returned to Judea as a top lieutenant of the new Roman governor. Ben-Hur's refusal to betray Jews who are against Roman rule begins a long chain of events which brings him down to a slave than miraculously back to prominence and an opportunity to defeat his friend turned enemy in a chariot race. 	<br/><br/>This movie is filled with memorable scenes. The most notable, of course, is the chariot race that to this day is one of the best action sequences ever filmed. (For the younger viewers, this inspired for the pod race in Star Wars: Phantom Menace and the soap box derby episode of the Simpsons.)  If one is inclined to nit-pick, I do believe the mother and sister characters are a little under-developed and a couple of scenes could have been shortened.  However, those are minor quibbles.  What makes this movie the best sword and sandal epic made by Hollywood is that it has heart along with spectacle.  In certain times, the life of Jesus intersects with Ben-Hur. And tellingly, the movie ends with a miracle and a renouncement of violence not with a bloody battle.  Ben-Hur is one of my top 10 favorite movies of all time."

","Watching the third cinematic rendering of Ben Hur today it is astonishing to realize this film was released in 1959, nearly half a century ago.  It exhibits all of the attributes that bring enduring legs to a film.  Motion picture technology was such, by mid-century, that a print struck today from the three black and white films of the Technicolor process of that time looks as good as anything produced today.  The main difference is the style of lighting where many of today's directors knock themselves out to copy each other and bring a ""realistic"" look instead of designing creative and dramatic light.  They end up delivering a dark film that is quickly dated for its style.  This is not so for Ben Hur, a film that will continue to tower long after we are all gone.<br/><br/>	Here is an exciting and moving epic script wrought from a masterful, 19th Century novel, sets that are meticulous in research, design and execution, the finest actors of the period, including a knock-out performance by England's Hugh Griffith and Charleton Heston during his peak.  They are all in superb costumes with extraordinary photography, editing and music scoring.  The film also features what must be the most startling cinematic sequence of all time in the panoramic chariot race between the protagonist and antagonist of the story.  For fans and film students alike, this is perhaps the finest example of American cinema art of the 20th Century, the very pinnacle and without a single computer-rendered frame in the long 212-minute length of the film."

","What other film can keep the attention for the best part of four hours? It's terrific, well-written in that usual Hollywood glossy style, and everyone's mentioned the chariot race already.  There's quieter moments which are well done too - the lepers watching their son/brother from the shadows, devoted little Esther, the sequences with Christ ... after 40 years it is still the best of the epics.  I loved the silent version too and recently read the book for the first time.  I'd recommend all three."

","I must comment after reading some of the laughable reviews for this movie. You really must have no imagination or feel for movie and acting history to slash Ben-Hur.  The plotline for this movie was full and rich. I am an atheist but I know the story behind Christ.  So what if there is a Christian tie-in?  Get over it people!!! Judah did. The combination of drama and action is complete in this movie.  When I watched Spartacus I was so very dissappointed that it was so watered down and rushed unlike Ben-Hur. These movies are epics and when a movie like Ben-Hur comes along you just got to soak it in.  I love this movie and is one of the very, very few movies that get a 10 from me."

","Set in the time of Christ during the height of the mighty Roman Empire, Ben-Hur follows the lives of two former childhood friends Judah Ben Hur (Charlton Heston) and Messala (Steven Boyd), who become the bitterest of enemies. As they grow older, the latter shows unswerving blind loyalty to the Roman Empire. After Ben Hur refuses to help Messala round up what he perceives to be enemies of the Empire, he is framed for a crime he did not commit and is sentenced to a life of living hell on a galley ship as a slave.<br/><br/>His blind belief in his fate coupled with a thirst for vengeance helps him to survive this torturous existence. For three years, he is chained to an oar until during a battle with Greek pirates he saves the life of the Roman commander Quintas (Jack Hawkins), who takes Ben-Hur under his wing and frees him from his life of bondage. He becomes the main trainer of Quintas's stables and in the course of time his adopted son and heir. Believing that Massala has killed his mother and sister, Ben-Hur exacts revenge by challenging him to a chariot race.<br/><br/>The 40-minute race took three months to shoot, in an arena that was a year in the making, and was one of the most ambitious sets ever staged by a major Hollywood studio.  It forms the focal point of the movie."
"Jon Kolenchak","10","1","3","31 March 2001"," De Mille-esque but without the histrionics and bad script
","When a film director is well known, he usually specializes in one genre. Everyone knows that Alfred Hitchcock made thriller/suspense films, that Cecil B. De Mille made epics, and so on.  Then along comes a director like William Wyler whose films include drama (These Thee, Jezebel), adaptation of a classic novel (Wuthering Heights), adaptation from the stage (The Little Foxes), comedy (How to Steal A Million), and even a musical (Funny Girl). It is said that Wyler decided to direct Ben-Hur because that would give him a chance to do a Cecil B. De Mille movie.  Well, he does C.B. one better.<br/><br/>I have been a fan of the epic film since childhood in spite of how awful some of them can be.  There's something about a film produced on a grand scale with a cast of thousands set in an exotic location that I enjoy. The problem with these films is that they are many times poorly scripted, historically inaccurate, and even though they run between 3 and 4 hours, the characters never seem to get beyond the Technicolor cut-out stage. Despite these flaws, they sometimes can be awfully fun to watch.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur is film that is extremely well scripted (there were a total of 3 writers working on the film, but only one got screen credit), well filmed, and well acted.  Charlton Heston in the title role gives such a sincere performance it almost makes me forget what a jerk he has become in his old age.  Stephen Boyd is great as the evil Messala, and Martha Scott does as good a job as Chucky's mother in this film as she did in The Ten Commandments, when Chucky was Moses.<br/><br/>The film's score by Miklos Rosza is perhaps the finest film music that he has ever written.  It is somewhat leitmotific in technique, and goes on for much of the 212 minutes of the film -- always supplementing and accentuating the drama, but never overshadowing it.<br/><br/>Without giving any plot elements away to those who may have not seen this film, the story deals with friendship, betrayal, revenge, and redemption. The sets are massive, the costumes beautiful, and the characters are people that you actually care about.  The film is one of those rare instances in cinematic history when a remake is as good as the original.  (Ben-Hur was first filmed as a full-length film in 1925.)<br/><br/>This review is based on the newly released DVD edition, with which I have some negative views.  The print itself that was used for the DVD mastering has some amazingly glaring color fluctuations.  The color is also washed out in quite a few scenes, and in the scenes which are softly lit, there is a bluish or purplish haze over most of the screen.  One would think that a better copy the film negative existed for its debut on DVD, but perhaps not.<br/><br/>The DVD is in widescreen letterbox format, which is the format that I prefer.  However, because it was originally shot in MGM Camera 65 (an extremely wide projection) the viewable area on your television is a very narrow band.  I suggest watching this on the largest TV you can find.<br/><br/>If you enjoy this version of Ben-Hur, take a chance and watch the 1925 version.  You may be surprised how good a silent film can be."
"twanurit","9","1","3","30 March 2001"," Intelligent, Beautiful Spectacle
","The film won 11 Academy Awards, and deserved all of them, plus more. The script and Stephen Boyd (who wasn't even nominated) should have won. Actually everyone in the cast is superb. Boyd gives the performance of a lifetime and makes a magnificent adversary, for Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston). Their early scenes, scripted by Gore Vidal, exhibit a most settle homo-erotic behavior, featuring Boyd's eye glances, a ""toast"" scene where they wrap their arms around each other, culminating in a scene of two arrows (that they both shot) in a wall as phallic symbols. Later the relationship sours, Heston is a slave who becomes a hero, but his mother and sister are in prison, and he returns to see Boyd, now living with a blonde hunk (no female in sight). A towering chariot race ensues, ending their relationship, but sending Ben-Hur on a mission to locate his family, now in a leper colony. Haya Harareet glides in and out as a lovely potential love interest, but special mention must be made of Martha Scott, riveting as the mother, and Cathy O'Donnell, a sweet treasure as the daughter. Any doubts about Heston's acting abilities are forever erased with his sensitive, gripping portrayal of a man who finds Christ. And it is very touching that he's not looking for love, but his beloved family. A stirring masterwork, beautifully scored by Miklos Rozsa, wonderfully directed by William Wyler and co-starring stalwarts Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith, Sam Jaffe. Probably the best of all the Biblical adventures."

Charlton Heston, who is one of the greatest actors of the 20th century, is magnificent in this, his Oscar-winning role of Judah Ben-Hur.  While everyone is familiar with the famous chariot race scene, my favorite scene is when Judah Ben-Hur is offered some water by a mysterious man, who happens to be Jesus.

Originally MGM wanted Rock Hudson to play Judah Ben-Hur, but he turned it down and so did the second choice Burt Lancaster. Heston was slated to play the part of Messala and wasn't considered for the Judah Ben-Hur part until Hudson and Lancaster said no thanks. Boyd was set to play a small part in Ben-Hur, but was then promoted to be Messala in what was the films most significant supporting role.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur is a great film in so many ways not to mention it being a true action film. The chariot race is one of the greatest sequences ever filmed in the history of moviemaking. This is also a film about human relationships and human passions revolving around actual historical events and based on Judah-Christian teachings and influences. <br/><br/>The author of this story Lew Wallace shouldn't be overlooked either. The book Ben-Hur was a best seller in the 1880's and Wallace will always be remembered for writing an outstanding original story that was expressed so wonderfully in this motion picture masterpiece. <br/><br/>William Wyler was nominated 11-times for an Oscar as best direcor starting with Dodsworth in 1936 and ending with The Collector in 1966. He won for Mrs. Miniver in 1942, The Best Years of Our Lives in 1946 and Ben-Hur 1959.

Beautifully photographed and staged, the film is magnificent in its scope. Look-out for a memorable performance by Jack Hawkins as a Roman General. Heston's decision to play Ben-Hur led directly to an interesting controversy after Gore Vidal claimed recently that Stephen Boyd had played the spear scene opposite Heston as though the two characters had been homosexual lovers. Heston denied it vehemently. Make up your own mind. They don't make films like this any more, so enjoy it!"

"JamesHitchcock","9","1","4","9 September 2010"," One of the great epics- worth a high mark for the chariot race alone
","""Ben-Hur"" was the Big Film of 1959, big in every sense of the word. It was big in terms of the amount it cost to make, a then-record $15 million. (This record was to be shattered four years later by another epic, ""Cleopatra"", which cost around three times as much). It was big in the sense that it was made on a grand scale; grandeur was generally a hallmark of the epic genre, but ""Ben-Hur"" is the grandest of the grand. And it was big in terms of its success, both at the box-office and at the Academy Awards, where it won a record eleven Oscars, a feat since equalled but never surpassed.<br/><br/>The film is an example of what might be called the ""post-biblical"" epic. Such films (other examples include ""The Robe"", ""Quo Vadis?"" and ""The Silver Chalice"") were popular in the fifties and told fictional stories based upon the early years of the Christian Church. The protagonist, Judah Ben-Hur, is a wealthy Jewish aristocrat living in Jerusalem at the time of Christ. He is sent to the galleys as a slave, and his mother and sister imprisoned, after they are falsely accused of attempting to assassinate the Roman Governor of Judea. The man who condemns them, the military tribune Messala, was Ben-Hur's childhood friend, but the two have quarrelled and are now bitter enemies. (The cause of their quarrel was Ben-Hur's refusal to name those Jews who are hostile to the Roman authorities; was this a veiled reference to McCarthyism?) The story then follows Ben-Hur's further adventures; as a galley slave he saves the life of the Roman commander and is rewarded with his freedom and becomes the man's adopted son. He is obsessed, however, by his desire for revenge against Messala and to discover what has happened to his mother and sister. Like Lew Wallace's novel on which it is based, the film has an explicitly religious theme, and the story of Ben-Hur is told against the background of the ministry of Jesus and the birth of Christianity.<br/><br/>During my youth in the seventies and eighties the epic was deeply unfashionable. ""Spartacus"" was sometimes mentioned as an honourable exception because of the general esteem in which Stanley Kubrick was held, but others of the genre were often mocked as vulgar and overblown, soap operas on a colossal scale. This attitude, however, has changed over the last two decades, especially since ""Gladiator"", the first great modern epic, won the Oscar for Best Picture. The genre (like all film genres) could vary enormously in quality- ""The Silver Chalice"", for example, is a particularly poor example- but the great epics like ""Ben-Hur"" are now much more widely appreciated than they once were.<br/><br/>That does not mean it is a perfect film; it falls just short of the ""perfect 10"" mark; in particular, some of the minor characters are not so good. The obscure Israeli actress Haya Harareet, for example, seems rather flat as Ben-Hur's love-interest Esther; her casting, moreover, spoils the pattern whereby all the Jewish characters have American accents and all the Roman characters British ones. Hugh Griffith's Arab sheikh today looks more like an embarrassing ethnic stereotype than an Oscar-wining performance. (Griffiths won for ""Best Supporting Actor"", although George C Scott was much better in ""Anatomy of a Murder"").<br/><br/>Those, however, would be my only criticisms. Charlton Heston is today perhaps the actor most associated with the epic style and starred in what I would regard as three of the four greatest epics, ""The Ten Commandments"", ""Ben-Hur"" and ""El Cid"". (Spartacus is the fourth). Here he not only brings the required strength and dignity to the title role but also makes a great action hero. (Among other things he learned to drive a chariot for the part). His ""Best Actor"" Oscar was certainly well-deserved, and it is strange to think that he only got the part after several others turned it down. There are good supporting performances from, among others, Jack Hawkins as Arrius and Stephen Boyd as the villainous Messala whose cynical Realpolitik leads him to betray his old friend. (Incidentally, I do not believe Gore Vidal's story of a ""hidden subplot"" about a gay relationship between Messala and Ben-Hur, with Boyd and William Wyler but not Heston in on the secret, if only because Vidal was simply recycling an old theatrical anecdote about Tyrone Guthrie, Laurence Olivier and Ralph Richardson).<br/><br/>One of those who turned down the leading role was Burt Lancaster, who allegedly ""didn't like the violent morals in the story"". (Paul Newman turned it down on the grounds that his legs didn't look good in a tunic- probably a polite way of saying that he didn't want to do another epic after the disastrous ""Silver Chalice""). If the story about Lancaster is correct, I doubt if he can have read the script to the end, because the film emphatically conveys a Christian message of forgiveness over revenge. (It's a lot less violent than some of Lancaster's own films from this period). Yet unlike many films (including some epics) with a religious theme the religious content never becomes preachy or intrusive. The general ethos can perhaps be described as ""muscular Christianity"", a combination of Christian morality with a gripping adventure story. And nowhere does it become more gripping than in that famous chariot race, perhaps the greatest single action sequence ever filmed. The film is worth 9/10 for that alone.<br/><br/>On a final note, Miklós Rózsa's musical score also comes close to justifying that mark by itself."
"derekcreedon","Null","1","4","28 October 2008"," Tell me the old old story...
","Despite gaining First Certificates in Temperance and Scripture studies -or maybe because of it - I grew to hate having to go to Sunday-school when I was a kid. It trapped and depressed me, like rehearsing for your own funeral every week, all best-clothed and po-faced. I wasn't a huge fan of day-school either but at least it embraced a broader livelier plain and the brainwashing was less oppressive. This always comes to mind when I watch the last hour or so of BEN-HUR. The fun people have left the building - Messala's bitten the dust and the Sheik's picked up his winnings and taken his horses back home - and we're left with the humourless Hurs looking for a miracle.<br/><br/>On its original release I still paid lip-service to the doctrines and the blend of the secular and the mystical had cast a spell. The continuing-on into other things beyond the blood-and-guts chariot race seemed rather cool and impressive and the film's technical shortcomings - the ultra-cheapo naval battle and some jarring editing slips - could be overlooked. Now that the doctrines have lost their hold the faults are less forgivable and the gear-shift towards the end quite detrimental. The keen edge of narrative-realism gives way to acute New Testamentitis, everyone parroting the legend like they've been hit on the head with a mallet. They know who this Christ is all of a sudden, because they've read the script and been to Sunday-school. The essential mystery of Christ is not explored but ritualised. The hapless Wyler must forsake drama for dramatic cliché (I don't think Gore Vidal wrote these scenes).<br/><br/>On the other hand it doesn't help that for reasons of multicultural politics the Christian story is soft-pedalled. The carpenter is practically knocked off his feet in the film's opening rush to Roman spectacle while the great ""no water for him"" scene can sustain - despite the organ-music - through sheer humanist power. The road to the Cross is convincingly agonised but the curing of the Hur women through some sort of remote-control amnesty - unlike in the novel - makes no kind of sense. The fine symbolic moment showing Christ's blood flowing out into the world clashes gruesomely with the corny twittering in that cosy little cave. Of course we're glad the family is reunited - a key Wyler concern - but if it had to be done by magic it's a pity the film finally lacked the conviction that my old Sunday-school mentors would have roundly endorsed."

","The 50s were a weird time for cinema. It almost feels like there was two separate film cultures, one producing overblown epics and insipid romances, the other producing masterpieces like The House On Haunted Hill. Of course, as someone who idolizes Roger Corman and William Castle, it might not be surprising that I have little patience for the safe, mainstream, risk-averse world of old Hollywood; but hear me out. With mainstream cinema of the time, much like mainstream cinema today, the goal is to appeal to the widest possible audience. That might not sound so bad, but think about what that would be like in the 50s. Most of the people would have no interest in anything too outlandish (preventing horror or science fiction from flourishing in the mainstream); there would be a significant contingent of people who would demand that everything was in line with 'traditional values' (such people still exist, but fortunately they hold much less of a sway over filmmaking than they did back then), limiting the creativity allowed to mainstream directors; and production codes prevented studios from including very much sex or violence in their movies, making most of them tedious and very difficult to watch (but very popular with the people who think that being 'family-friendly' or having 'good values' is a good reason to give a movie a positive review and prevent crap like God's Not Dead from making it onto the bottom 100). Of course, I wasn't around at the time, but I've done my research, and my position has led me to see enough of them to make a judgment on the era. I fully expect to get a lot of flack for this review from boring people who still think that the Academy Awards represent the best in filmmaking, but if I can get one person to abandon the safe world of traditional popular cinema, I will have already won. Yes, I may be a pretentious, amoral, desensitized 20-something year old with no respect for the classics, but at least I'm not boring."

","I understand that the film is primarily about the life of Ben Hur but think I'll focus my observations on the Hur-and-Jesus dynamic. In this mode, one can see in the tale a Christian's dream: to convert a Jew! Some reviews write of Jesus and capitalize the pronoun ""he"" as if this Jew from Nazareth was divine. Such is the Christian myth. Many conservative Christians continue the slander that the Jews failed to understand their own scriptures and failed to recognize their own messiah (another word that needn't be capitalized except when used in a title as ""president"" is in ""President Donald Trump""). Forgive me for reviewing not just the movie but an aspect also of some reviews. But our reactions to a film can be as interesting as the film itself. Films play roles in our lives and so an epic film in which a Jew recognizes the ""Messiah"" is partly propaganda that might reinforce a bias or movie a viewer toward a bias. Next year a book (The Folly of Fundamentalism) will be available on Amazon that explains all this in greater detail.."

","Ben Hur is a wonderful movie experience. While the pacing is slow by today's standards, it set the standard for many years for action sequences. The chariot race is still riveting no matter how old the film gets. The sets are gorgeous, the coordination of extras & principals is simply breathtaking. But what sets this movie apart from other Biblical-esque films is its story. Its central character is Judah Ben-Hur, but the story is a foil for the Gospel of Christ. In a way, it makes me feel as if I was there on Calvary witnessing the crucifixion. You could tell the cast and crew put their heart into this production, because it shines in every moment. The script is thought provoking, painting few as evil or good, but showing more that they are all people corrupted by power, revenge, too many wives, wealth, etc. Only after they have encountered the Christ, do they become altruistic and loving. And that is pretty true for people who have been truly transformed by Jesus. This would be an excellent film to show anyone who loves movies, action, drama, or is interested in Christianity."

","This was the first film to do it, with Titanic and The Lord of the Rings, all three have won the record of 11 Oscars. From Oscar and Golden Globe winning director William Wyler, the story seems to be about both Jesus' life, as well as the main character, it may be almost four hours, but it is worth it. Judah Ben-Hur (Oscar and Golden Globe winning Charlton Heston) is the hero who disagrees that slavery should continue, Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) obviously thinks differently. Anyway, soon enough Judah is sentenced for attempted murder of the Govenor. When he is a slave rower it is quite a powerful scene watching him and all other made to row faster and faster, and he doesn't stop. But the best scene by far is the chariot race, no other scene of the film grips you as much as that. Although, it is really good when an unseen (by face) Jesus gives Judah water, and towards the end Judah tries to do the same before his crucifixion.

"dallasryan","8","1","6","7 February 2012"," The Pure Essence of Christ is what makes this one Great!
","The Chariot scene in this movie is enough to see it alone, but what makes this movie great and worthy of being on the AFI Best Films List is it's precise depiction of conveying the exact ambiance/mood of when Jesus Christ was around and how he was perceived. We all hear in church about Jesus Christ, read in the bible about him, pretty much everywhere, a person will hear about Jesus Christ, and Ben-Hur captures the very feeling, essence and imagination about how Jesus Christ was perceived and what kind of energy he translated to others during his time. And at the same time what's brilliant about this movie is it's smart in how it conveys all of this by making Jesus Christ a complete mystery. <br/><br/>He's a mystery to us in the present day and he is a mystery to all of the characters in Ben-Hur, including Ben-Hur himself. And this enigmatic quality is what conveys the ambiance of Jesus Christ in this movie. Stanley Kubrick never gave away too much in the film 2001: A Space Odyssey, if he would have given up that 'enigmatic' quality in 2001, it would not have been even close to as great as a film as it is. The same goes for Ben-Hur, if you lose that 'enigmatic' quality about Christ in Ben-Hur, the film loses all of it's luster. Absolute brilliance to make Ben-Hur the way it was made. <br/><br/>Ben-Hur is about a regular man who lives during the times of Jesus Christ, and it's about the struggles Ben-Hur goes through which we can all relate to. For example, being innocent and kind then going through the poisons of life and getting resentful and angry at later points in our lives to finally and hopefully forgiving, accepting and being at peace with the what is even later in our journey as human beings. <br/><br/>But it's about the forgiveness and that's what Christ was about and that's the main theme of the movie Ben-Hur, the Trials and Tribulations of life and forgiveness. 'Jesus Christ died for all of our sins' and if it's tough for you to understand exactly what this statement means, this film, Ben-Hur, will be the closest film you'll ever find to understanding exactly what that statement means."

","In the era of big budget Biblical blockbusters, ""Ben-Hur"" towered above them all. Nominated for twelve 1959 Academy Awards, it won eleven, a record unmatched until 1997's ""Titanic"" came along. Based on an 1880 novel by Civil War general Lew Wallace, this film epitomizes cinema at its most epic. It is a ""Tale of the Christ"" and much more.<br/><br/>During the days of Jesus, Juddah Ben-Hur (Heston) is a Jewish nobleman living with his mother and sister in Jerusalem. When his best friend from childhood returns - Messala played by Stephen Boyd - there is joy. Messala, now a high ranking officer in the Roman army, urges his old friend to convince his people to embrace the Roman way. But Juddah, ever faithful to his own kind, will have none of it. This sets off a chain of events that nearly destroy the Hur family, turning old friends into bitter rivals.<br/><br/>There is a hefty helping of human suffering in ""Ben-Hur"", including the memorable galley scenes which feature a shirtless Charlton Heston in his big screen glory. Then there is the legendary chariot race, a spectacular battle between Ben-Hur and Messala, that cost more to film than most entire movies of the time.<br/><br/>Charting in at three and a half hours in length, ""Ben-Hur"" is a huge Hollywood production that easily captured the Best Picture Oscar. Heston, too, was rewarded with Best Actor and deservedly so. He carries this mammoth movie on his shoulders like no other actor could. Also of note is the stirring soundtrack by composer Miklos Rosza and, of course, William Wyler's direction. They were also honoured with Academy Awards.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"" is an undeniable motion picture classic."

","Contrarily to what the greatly lamented Mr Charlton Heston affirms in his commentary, Stephen Boyd had already appeared in quite a few movies (at least 12!) before «Ben Hur» -- sometimes as the leading man, such as in «The Best of Everything» (1959), «Woman Obsessed» (1959) and «Bijoutiers du clair de lune, Les» (1958), aka «Heaven Fell That Night» (UK) or «The Night Heaven Fell» (USA). As good as his comments are, I deplore the fact that Mr Heston did not seem to bother to check his sources before uttering his remarks. And so, generally speaking, they seem VERY improvised -- with many repetitions, generalizations (such as : «Brit actors tend to be better than American ones (!)», etc. And, alas, not too many precise FACTS or behind-the-scenes details. This being said with sincerity and honesty, we're going to miss you, dear Mr Heston : may you rest in peace."
"bigburlybear","4","1","13","16 September 2012"," Plot and leads fail to deliver the goods
","This film is a remake of an earlier film based on a 19th century novel by Lew Wallace.<br/><br/>It tells the story of a Judean prince, Judah Ben-Hur, who is condemned into slavery for a crime he did not commit by the man who was his best friend as a child, Messala. Ben-Hur is driven to return to Jerusalem to exact revenge against Messala.<br/><br/>There are many good things about this film - the sets, the cinematography, the costumes and the supporting cast. However, the major flaws of the film are the script and the lead actors: these are terrible.<br/><br/>The script is very cheesy, making as many biblical references as possible. It also attempts to give the impression of being historically accurate, which is bizarre. The inaccuracies are almost as long the book.<br/><br/>The Romans and the Jews were allies, and had fought together. Jew legions supported Caesar Augustus to defeat Marc Antony in North Africa. Consequently, Jerusalem was exempted from the erection idols. Also, the Jewish religious leaders at the time were collaborating with their Roman overlords and making the governor rich. So rebellion was far from the mind of the Jewish leaders.<br/><br/>Also the reference to ""patriots"" is simply anachronistic. I could go on with this, but it would not be useful.<br/><br/>The two lead actors - Charlton Heston and Haya Harareet - neither are convincing and they are both very wooden and completely out of their depth. The support actors carry them - showing much more skill and conveying much more of the story and the emotional impact.<br/><br/>The plot is also rather meandering, and has many rather confusing jumps. Why would Messala start asking Ben-Hur to inform at their first meeting? Why would he not then use the leverage of tile against him to inform, instead of sending him away? Why would he consent to the marriage of the slave girl he loves to a man she doesn't care for? Then comes the most confusing part, on the galleys, Ben-Hur is unchained. when the galley is rammed, he is able to escape, freeing the other slaves. When he comes above, instead of joining the pirates and therefore freedom to escape back to Jerusalem and revenge, he fights for his Roman captors. Why? The famous chariot race is staged like a NASCAR race - together with the pace cars, I mean pace horses. This is a spectacular sequence - but it is made absurd by the 20th century sensibilities: of the Boadicea blades on Messala's chariot, the stretcher bearers running out comically to collect the battered bodies, Pilate announcing the drivers &c.<br/><br/>Another problem is that Ben-Hur's mother and sister were locked away in solitary confinement for years while he was away. Somehow they contracted leprosy without contact with anyone - this is never explained.<br/><br/>Despite the wonderful sets, costumes, pageantry and support cast, this film falls down on the basics - the plot and the lead actors failed to deliver."

"TheNabOwnzz","9","0","1","10 November 2019"," The penultimate epic, one of the all-time greats, rich in both scale & scope
","The general problem that a lot of epics have is that behind all their technical expertise and spectacular scenery, the human drama sometimes gets lost under the visuals. This is not the case for Ben-Hur, one of the most splendid of all epics and long productions, as it succeeds on both of these points.<br/><br/>One thing one could always expect in an epic such as this is indeed the grand visual splendor, and not only does Ben-Hur deliver in that regard, it outperforms most of the similar themed movies such as Quo Vadis or King of Kings most splendidly. It is longer, greater, and the sets are simply even more beautiful. A couple of objects in certain sets are drawn in artificially, but it nevertheless looks absolutely gorgeous. In particular the set for the chariot race boggles the mind. Not even keeping in mind how filming such gargantuan sets was even possible in 1959, it's even more so impressive today in an era of plastic made scenery. The production is simply bigger in scale & generally more beautiful than nearly every single picture that has ever been made ( It's in the top 10, at least ).<br/><br/>The costume design is beautiful, the cinematography impeccable, and the widescreen shots of hundreds of people marching across the screen in David Lean fashion is also a sight to behold. The sound is generally outstanding, except for a couple of obvious post-production additions, which sounds a bit off, but that really is something of minor significance in the grand scheme of things. Of course, Ben-Hur also features quite possibly the greatest action sequence of all-time, the chariot race. As stated before, the production for this sequence is already beyond comprehension, but to add such a superbly edited and performed action sequence to it really is quite remarkable. There was this particular stunt in which a stuntman drives over a crashes chariot, being launched into the air before just gripping on, which could have easily resulted in death. It's an impeccable action sequence for both this extraordinarily committed stuntwork & the tight editing.<br/><br/>One also cannot forget Miklos Rozsa's incredible contribution to this picture by providing one of cinema's greatest scores. Nearly a symphony of epic proportions, it creates some of the greatest tearjerking moments in cinema. Of course, this is also partly due to the film itself, but themes like the love theme or the Star of Bethlehem are nearly unparalleled in cinema, truly creating that feeling of literal magic on the screen, coupled with excellent action oriented themes such as Parade of the Charioteers & Rowing of the Galley Slaves. The score is undoubtedly one of the most emotionally superb scores of all-time.<br/><br/>Even though few to no epics score as good in this regard as Ben-Hur, most are still very solid in the aspects named above. But what truly makes Ben-Hur stand out from most of them is the essential core upon which it drives; its genuine human drama. This is not just a spectacle of sound & visuals, it is also the very human story of the gradual redemption of our main character, Judah. The subplots of Jesus Christ aren't just added for the sake of it, but it signifies his final deliverance from the hatred tearing his heart apart. Jesus is symbolized as a reminder against despair, as is so beautifully shown in the scene where he gives Judah water, which is essentially what keeps him alive not only physically, but mentally as well. It renews his will to live. It is heartbreaking to see the injustice done to Judah and his family, and watch him struggle with this loss internally for the rest of the entire movie, yet in the end he finds his redemption and is rewarded for it.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston is the perfect actor for the role of such a biblical epic, as he has proven before in the Ten Commandments, and his nemesis Stephen Boyd as the evil Messala is perhaps even more impressive. His death scene is definitely one of the greatest death scenes in all of cinema. How you could so greatly display such pain and agony and incoming death in an acting performance is quite extraordinary. Their friendship and betrayal seems to affect the heart even more so due to these excellent performances, especially the argument in Judah's house being a superbly acted scene. Esther, played by Haya Harareet, an Israëli actress, is also splendidly affectionate as the true driving power behind the redemption of Judah's soul, even though her odd accent sometimes distracts a litte bit.<br/><br/>Ben Hur is thus grandiose in both scale and scope, internally and externally, visually and substantially, in nearly every aspect of its being. It is beautiful to look at, heartbreaking to witness and especially fulfilling to both the mind and heart of the audience. There's little doubt of its status among cinema's all-time greats."

"ThomasDrufke","8","0","1","15 August 2016"," Holds Up Better Than Some Recent Epics
","There may not be a film so highly regarded in its influence and stature for the history of cinema than Ben-Hur. Luckily, it's themes of betrayal and redemption hold up just as well as the epic chariot race that so many cinephiles hold so dearly to their hearts.<br/><br/>Starring the iconic Charlton Heston as the titular character, Ben- Hur tells the story of a Jewish prince who returns for revenge after being wrongfully enslaved by his childhood friend turned foe. Known for its epic scale as a 1950's film, Ben-Hur is still one of the most impressive achievements in film to this day. Not only does the film have a nice mix of green screen work and on location set work, but the performances and work from William Wyler also deserve some credit.<br/><br/>Wyler, who also directed one of my favorite films, Roman Holiday, does a brilliant job at bringing this classic tale to life through his actors. It's a great story on paper, but if Wyler doesn't bring the best out of his actors than the story can fall flat and melodramatic. With Heston, and great supporting performances from Hugh Griffith, Jack Hawkins, and Stephen Boyd, the story most certainly does not fall flat.<br/><br/>With so many decades passing since the film opened, there's bound to be influences found in other films, but I can't help but draw a comparison to Ridley Scott's Gladiator. Maximus and Judah's story take similar turns, and there's even a massive colosseum sequence in Gladiator that could be seen as a tribute to the chariot race in Ben-Hur. The 1880 novel of the same name had its impact, but the film opened the door for big budgeted ideas to steer their way into theaters for years to come.<br/><br/>But speaking of the original story from the book, I feel like Wyler may have been too stuck on adapting what he saw in the pages to the big screen. Both interpretations have a strong presence of Jesus and the idea of faith, but I don't believe the heavy inclusion of Christ's story worked in the film. Judah and Messala are at the core of this story, but by the end, the story is taken over by the presence of Jesus. That's not necessarily a bad thing, but for me, the film ends when the relationship between Judah and Messala is at its climax. Some things just don't translate to film.<br/><br/>Anyways, Ben-Hur is every bit as impressive now as it has been for decades. To see the crew's clever use of miniatures in action scenes, seamless green screen work, and a grand scale chariot race makes it one of the most important and influential works of art in the 20th century. It's something you'd have a hard time denying. So although I don't think the last 40 minutes of the film are necessary, I also won't deny the influence the entire film had on cinema. Props.<br/><br/>+Heston & Boyd<br/><br/>+Massive in scale for 1959<br/><br/>+Supporting characters help improve the journey<br/><br/>+Gorgeous sets and visuals<br/><br/>-Last 40 minutes drag the film into an unnecessary place<br/><br/>8.7/10"
"CinemaClown","Null","0","1","7 August 2016"," One Of The Grandest Epics To Ever Grace The Silver Screen
","Winner of staggering 11 Academy Awards, Ben-Hur is a titanic production by every means, both in scope & ambition, that ranks amongst the grandest epics to ever grace the silver screen, features one of the most breathtaking moments in cinema history, and is valiantly brought to life through its lavish production design, skillful direction, sweeping cinematography, majestic score & strong lead performance from Charlton Heston.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur tells the story of Judah Ben-Hur, a rich Jewish prince in Jerusalem who's betrayed by his childhood friend, now a commanding officer of Roman legions, when he refuses to sell out his own people to the Roman empire, resulting in his family being thrown in prison while the prince himself is sent to the galleys. The plot covers the epic journey he makes to return to his homeland & seek revenge against his so-called friend.<br/><br/>Directed by William Wyler, this extremely ambitious project comes to life in grand detail and is told with patience, with little bursts of excitement at regular intervals. Wyler leaves no stone unturned to infuse a sense of grandeur to every sequence, and the meticulously detailed set pieces, Miklós Rózsa's epic score, and widescreen cinematography play an important role in realising this vision. But there are also many moments that go on for way too long.<br/><br/>Running at 212 minutes, it's a daunting film to sit through and the relaxed narration plus plethora of moments that are stretched a tad too far don't make this ride any easier. The drama manages to be compelling but there are also scenes in between that overstay their welcome & slow down the plot considerably. Two segments stand out the most, one being the sequence in which a Roman Consul tests Ben-Hur's determination by overworking the slaves and the other is the following.<br/><br/>Ever since its debut, the 9-minute chariot race sequence has been hailed by viewers & critics alike as one of the most astounding, jaw-dropping & extraordinary moments in motion picture history and it still remains one of the greatest accomplishments of epic filmmaking. Heading into it, I was doubtful that it may appear a bit dated now but it's such a gripping, intense & powerful sequence that it effortlessly exceeded all my expectations and kept me on the edge of my seat throughout.<br/><br/>Coming to the performances, the ensemble comprises of Charlton Heston, Jack Hawkins, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet & Hugh Griffith, and all of them chip in with strong inputs. Heston definitely is the standout and plays the titular character with restraint & passion. Another amazing thing about his performance is the apt chemistry he shares with every other member. The rest play their part accordingly. And one striking aspect I really liked was the angles chosen to depict Jesus Christ, never showing his face yet evoking a mythical vibe almost instantly.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Ben-Hur is well-deserving of all its accolades, for what it put on the screen at its time of release was nothing short of breathtaking. Like all great works, it has managed to stand the test of time and even though I had a difficult time sitting through its overly-stretched dramatic moments, I've nothing but admiration for its grandeur beauty. I'm not entirely sure if the picture as a whole will manage to live up to its hype for everyone, but that chariot race sequence is destined to dazzle its viewers and leave them absolutely speechless for decades to come."

","Hollywood has forgotten the epic. Instead of the grand, sweeping and powerful stories -- complete with an overture and intermission -- that characterized cinema of the late 50s and early 60s, our ""epics"" are shapeless bores without likable characters and original stories. Instead of chariot races charged with righteous vengeance (and moral ambiguity), we have Matthew Mcconaughey conquering the galaxy with Southern-tongued exposition unintentionally bespeckled with gleeful hilarity.<br/><br/>If you're thirsting for something loud and powerful (as I was), then Ben-Hur is the film for you. It's unabashedly epic, thunderous, and raw, eliciting wows at every twist, turn, and gargantuan set piece it throws your way. Charlton Heston plays the righteous Jewish prince, returned from wrongful imprisonment in the galleys to take revenge on the man who imprisoned him, his big shiny teeth flashing in the sunlight.<br/><br/>The action scenes themselves are stunning. The chariot race is one of the most fantastically involving sequences I have ever seen.<br/><br/>However, it's undeniable Jewish propaganda, especially considering the glaring historical inaccuracy -- or in this case, a purposeful exclusion of historical facts . And yet, with multiple Jesus cameos, it sees fit to pass itself off as a Christian film. As a sort of religious outsider, I have no right to comment on that, though. What I can comment on is the flowery dialogue. It's consistently sweeping, yes, but also consistently drawn out and occasionally laughably cheesy. <br/><br/>But it's epic. And I suppose that given the sheer entertainment value offered up by this film, its faults are barely more than an afterthought."

Combining all the efforts of those people, we are able to watch a visual wonder on the screen. Remember that this movie was made in 1959 when there are no sophisticated equipment as all the crew now- a-days have. This shows their humongous efforts put into making this movie. Into the story, two childhood friends become bitter enemies because of the religious difference. This turns into one of them being unjust to the other. Judah Ben-Hur( Jewish ) was put in jail, sent to serve on ships and his family members were sentenced to life imprisonment. After all Ben- Hur lives to take his revenge on his friend. The chariot racing in which Ben-Hur( who was not a prisoner now ) tries to defend himself and in the process his friend, who was trying to kill Ben-Hur gets killed by the accident. This scene was acclaimed( is ) as the best shot ever without any special effects.

","I first saw Ben Hur at the cinema in Manchester, not long after its initial release. At the age of 15, this was my first introduction to such a big film on what seemed then to be a massive wide screen. I was transfixed.<br/><br/>Over the years since then, I've seen it several times, mostly on TV. It's a movie on a grand scale and, sadly, even my 46"" screen can't do it full justice. It does try though, and the recent acquisition of Ben Hur on a special Blue Ray edition has greatly enhanced the experience.<br/><br/>There is a good deal of trivial criticism about the movie, concerning the production, editing etc. Some of this may be true, but little of it detracts from the sheer enjoyment the movie has to offer, at least for me.<br/><br/>I shan't even try to detail the many high spots in the film, but there are a couple that I must mention.<br/><br/>1. The growth of the relationship between Ben Hur and Quintus Arrius highlighted just how good an actor Jack Hawkins was - a great loss to movies following his untimely death in 1973.<br/><br/>2. When Judah meets Sheik Ildarim, he's introduced to the Sheik's ""children"", four beautiful white Arabian horses. The scene with the horses inside the tent was quite moving and the horses acted well in this and subsequent scenes. Some may find this trivial, in the scheme of this epic movie, but it gave me a little extra joy.<br/><br/>There are some amazing movies produced today, by many great directors and artists. Yet, somehow, as great as many of them are, they clearly belong to a new technical age. Epics like Ben Hur, made >55 years ago represent remarkable achievements in film, belonging as they do to an earlier grand movie era."

","Greetings from Lithuania.<br/><br/>WOW. This is the first word that comes to the mind after credits of this movie starts rolling. Terrific story, spellbinding craftsmanship, acting, music - everything works here on the highest order. It's so much more that a simple epic, yet witnessing this movie first time in 2015, ""epic"" seems was born with ""Ben-Hur"" 1959.<br/><br/>There isn't anything new that i can add in praising review of this magnificent motion picture. If you haven't seen it yet, and maybe afraid of it's release date or length - don't be - this is amazingly entertaining epic / adventure / drama which doesn't feel or look dated a bit. And this kind of story won't age, it's timeless. <br/><br/>Overall, 11 Oscars (first off three movies with this amount awards) proves, that they weren't sparing when creating this piece. Every scene looks astonishingly even now, that is because it was a pre-CGI era, and we can only be thankfully for this. In this movie i saw so many things that later were copied in another epics (especialy ""Gladiator"") - and what was surprising to me - i liked this movie more that ""Gladiator"" - it is THAT good. Watch this film - it is amazing in every aspect."

","GENERAL: The friendship between two men degenerating into hate because of their ideals.<br/><br/>POSITIVE ASPECTS: The intensity of human issues present in the film.<br/><br/>NEGATIVE ASPECTS : Overlong passages in the second part of the film.<br/><br/>AVENUES OF REFLECTION: The desire to live of Ben Hur will open the door to multiple interpretations. Everyone can go of his personal vision. But it remains clear that it is his meeting with Christ that will solidify this desire to live, because both have this as the first value. Relations between Ben Hur and Messala are so intense that they approach the extreme love-hate. As the film progresses, the love scenes decline to reach a hate climax at the scene after the victory of Ben Hur in the tent of Messala. With all its torments, Ben Hur is still looking for a meaning to life. He wants to live, but why he wants to live? Ben Hur is imbued with traditional values of the biblical Jewish culture, but his understanding of Christ's sacrifice will make him more accepting forgiveness and new values of Christianity. He will try to make a synthesis with both believing in the respect for life.<br/><br/>Hatred allows Ben Hur to survive and Quintus Arrius will make him remark. Some believe that two elements that will allow Ben Hur to survive occur when Christ gives him water to drink and when Quintus Arrius delivers him from his chains. In reality, the image of Christ who gives water to drink refers to reinforce the value of life in Ben Hur. And with regard to the chains, we realize that if it was not at that time, he would have been released at another time, because with his desire to live, he was closely watching every opportunity. We note that Quintus Arrius is attracted to Ben Hur. One suspects that he has sadomasochistic tendencies with convicts. The first time we see him on screen, he go down to see convicts and whip Ben Hur. We often placed hatred as negative, but we realize that intense hatred can also be a driver. We see all the evil inside him. We also remember the love between the two main characters when they meet in the districts of Messala early in the film. Ben Hur reached what Messala valued as a social position, but it was not what Ben Hur sought. In order of importance, the hatred towards Messala and the welfare of his mother and sister, his people and his wife were more important to him. Ben Hur is always thirsty. We try to make us believe that he is no longer thirsty because he heard Christ."

","I read the book to this by Lew Wallace first and understood some of it. Maybe it was because of some of the writing but when I saw the movie I just loved it. I was surprised that it was directed by William Wyler who did ""The Best Years of our Lives"" earlier too.<br/><br/>This was when epics of Christ were goof and did actual effort in attracting the audience. Back then they were actual epics and just a grindhouse movie like Passion of the Christ.<br/><br/>This epic starts with Christ being born with all of the people from the good book. Then it goes to a Jewish nobleman Judah Ben-Hur, played by Charlton Heston. He hears about what Christ is teaching the world. At first he's skeptical about the word of Christ.<br/><br/>Then after freeing a slave he's convicted of murder when the roman's come to visit. He's then taken into slavery and even meets Christ in one scene.<br/><br/>There's also another part of the movie, the chariot race, which is considered a classic scene in cinema. I also heard a lot of people got hurt badly in that scene and I didn't know until someone told me.<br/><br/>I won't tell you about what happens to Judah's family because I want people to watch this. It is pretty long too so give it a watch when you have a lot of free time."

","It's a long film about Judah Ben-Hur and his family, betrayed by their former Roman friend, Messala. Heston is Ben-Hur and Stephen Boyd is Messala. Their mutual enmity animates most of the picture. A combination of luck and skill raises Heston from slavery to the higher echelons of Roman governance, an opportunity he spurns because he has grown to hate Roman civilization. Christ has a featured bit part, whose voice, as Heston says at the end, ""has taken the sword from my hand.""<br/><br/>This is an epic movie by any definition. No expense must have been spared. And the chariot race in the Circus Maximus is without peer. Heston seems to fit into togas and caftans well. He's an impressive presence on the screen. Stephen Boyd as the unregenerate villain doesn't have as much to do but his death scene probably represents his best moments on the screen. He puts everything he has into it and it comes out right. Hugh Griffith is the wily Arab sheik and, as usual, there's always something slightly comic in his pop-eyed performances.<br/><br/>The director was William Wyler, a competent professional who brought some surprising sense of cynicism and outrage to Jimmy Stewart's post-war Westerns. Here, he catches small details of life under the Romans that are usually ignored in the sword-and-sandal epics of the 1950s, the ones with title like ""Hercules Versus the Gorgon."" I'd never known before that the slaves manning the oars of the Roman triremes had to be trained to row at three speeds -- regular, battle, attack, and ramming. Whew. Heston and the rest of the rowers are palpably exhausted after a spell of ramming speed.<br/><br/>And before the chariot race, we see footmen or whatever they are, disentangling the gathering horses from one another and dislodging chariot wheels that have gotten themselves stuck in some mural nook. When a charioteer has an accident during the race, they run out rescue him and carry him off on stretchers before the vehicles appear around the bend again. Nice perceptive touches but done conventionally and without distinction. There is a longish scene in the sheik's test, when Griffith fondles his horses and Cheston forces himself to burp. It's an interesting scene, but in ""Lawrence of Arabia,"" there was a similar scene in a vast Arab tent and David Lean had the actors pause while a strong breeze made the tent poles creak slightly. Here, the tent isn't alive. It's just a dead tent.<br/><br/>In the end, no Jews are actually converted to Christianity, which didn't exist yet anyway. But all the principals speak with hushed awe about Christ's sermon the mount. I kept wondering if the Haifa-born Haya Harareet had any difficulty with the role.<br/><br/>As it develops, the thrilling chariot race is ante-climactic. Long after it's over and Messala's death is forgotten, we have to endure Christ's suffering and crucifixion. Of course, he was the original charismatic personality, yet it's always a downer to see someone tortured and killed.<br/><br/>With just a few tweaks, it might have been changed to one of those anti-Nazi movies of the 40s and 50s. The Romans are racists, persecuting the Jews and other misfits, ridiculing the Arabs, torturing prisoners, consigning the sick to the valley of lepers, shown as a kind of concentration camp. Jack Hawkins is magnificent as the Good German.<br/><br/>It's an important movie if only because of its sprawling narrative, it's quotidian details, and that unforgettable chariot race. A viewer can only imagine how today's CGI experts would dump the stunt men like ""Breezy"" Easton and fill the screen with dismembered bodies, flying arms and legs, and chariots tumbling directly into the camera. In 1959, there were no such techniques available -- a near miss. But I suppose it's only a matter of time before a new version of this chestnut is released."

","One of the great pillars of Hollywood, Ben-Hur is a must see for any movie lover no matter their religion, background or preference. The great leading man Charlton Heston commands an ensemble cast from his first scene to his last in what could be his finest performance. With every desert depicted and every splash filmed you feel it as an audience member. Like any great movie, this one makes you forget anything is around you. You are in a black void watching the adventure from above, pleading for characters lives and suffering and triumphing alongside them until the very end. If you like westerns, this is not it. If you like action films headed by a lone goliath of an actor this is not it either. This is an historical epic and yet so much more."

","The movie starts with the birth of Christ in Bethlehem. In 26AD, Jesus is in Nazareth. Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to his childhood home Jerusalem as the commander of the Roman garrison. He intends to bring order back to the restive province. His old friend Judah Ben-Hur(Charlton Heston) is a prince and richest man whose family used to rule Judea. However, Judah refuses to be Messala's informer. Simonides (Sam Jaffe) is a loyal family slave. His daughter Esther (Haya Harareet) is in love with Judah but she is betroth to another. During the arrival of the new governor, loose tiles fall from Judah's house injuring the governor. Vindictive Messala sees an opportunity to make Judah an example. Judah is turned into a slave and his mother and sister imprisoned. Judah is assigned to row Roman Consul Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins)'s flagship. Their ship is sunk and Judah rescues Arrius. Arrius is given credit for a Roman victory and he adopts Judah as his son. Eventually he goes home in search for his family and seek revenge on Messala. Still he's willing to forgive Messala if his family is restored. However Messala finds them as lepers in their cell and sends them away. Esther keeps their secret and lies to Judah that they're dead.<br/><br/>This is an Hollywood epic for mostly good and a little bad. The bad is pretty minor. It's long and long-winded at times. It does get melodramatic and the acting can be very broad. For the subject matter, broad acting is somewhat appropriate. The movie always gets me when Jesus gives Judah water. It gets the epic arc of the story. The movie rises to the challenge. There are many amazing scenes but non grander than the epic chariot race. This is a movie where epic can't be used enough."

","This is a mythic film and yet most of the time considered as a peplum film whereas it is one more film about Christ, about the relations of Jews and Romans in Judea in the first third of the first century of our CE. <br/><br/>The originality is to center the story on two men, a Jew and a Roman who grew up as mates in their childhood but are torn apart by adult age. Ben Hur is a rich Jew and he represents the desire for peace but without any betrayal of his people, community, religion, culture, God. Messala is the top officer of the Roman legions who gets his dream realized, to be the governor of Judea. When Messala comes to Jerusalem to take his post he at once gets in contact with Ben Hur but since he wants Ben Hur to give the names of the rebellious Jews, hence to be an informer, Ben Hur refuses and they become enemies. Due to some accidental event interpreted as an attack on the governor, Messala has Ben Hur sent to the gallows where you only survive one or two years. He has the mother and sister arrested and put in prison in some deep underground cell where they will in four years turn lepers. <br/><br/>For reasons beyond real understanding during a battle the top officer (and consul) of the Roman fleet has Ben Hur on his flagship. When a battle starts all the slaves are chained to their oars. The consul orders Ben Hur not to be chained. The flagship is rammed but Ben Hur is able to overpower the Roman who has the keys to the chains, to unchain the slaves, which will not be of much benefit to them, and then to save the life of the consul twice, in battle and in the wreckage of his flagship. When they are found alive on some floating wooden piece of ship they learn the battle had been a complete victory. It is as victors they come back to Rome. Ben Hur is emancipated, adopted by the Consul and he becomes a horse-race champion for his adoptive father in Rome's circus. But he decides to go back to Judea before the announced Pontius Pilate arrives there. He wants a vengeance.<br/><br/>That's when his desire to get avenged is confronted to the horrible situation of his mother and sister who he has difficulty finding because Esther, his freed slave, who met them when they were freed from the dungeons where they had been imprisoned, swears to them not to tell. In the meantime the Arabs Ben Hur had had contact with when coming back to Judea try to use him to get even, peacefully, with Messala. One of them has a team of horses and Ben Hur accepts to drive in the circus them against Messala who is a vicious driver. But of course Ben Hur will win and Messala will die after a very serious accident during the race. That's how and from him Ben Hur learns about the fate of his mother and sister, on dying Messala's deathbed. He finds them and retrieves them out of the valley where all lepers are kept. With the help of Esther he brings them out back to Jerusalem and that's when Jesus' passion crosses Ben Hur's story. He and Esther arrives in Jerusalem on the very hour when Jesus is walked carrying his cross to Golgotha. <br/><br/>He recognizes Jesus as the man who had given him water when he was taken to the gallows, water without which he would have died before reaching the gallows. He tries to do the same on this way of the cross but he is pushed back by the Roman soldiers. Then we experience the crucifixion from afar since Ben Hur and Esther are taking care of Ben Hur's mother and sister: they take them to their old home. They then live the eclipse and the storm on their way home and the rain produces the miracles we all expected: the mother and the sister are healed.<br/><br/>This old film made in 1959 is a typical un-historical saga about Jesus and the Jews in Judea. The film over-charges the Romans. The Jews are shown absolutely pure and clean, and their violence is nothing but patriotism and it is never shown. We see them having perfect relations with the Arabs, the Semitic people around them who are not Jews and are at best their servants and most of the time their slaves, like Esther. Actually the limit between Jews and Arabs, servants and slaves is not always very clear. The objective is to show the Romans as tyrants, violent dictators, and even their saluting gesture looks like Hitler's. The Romans are depicted as fascists in all possible ways. The Jews are their victims, enslaved on their land or deported to die working because ""ARBEIT MACHT FREI"" as the famous motto said. <br/><br/>The film is well acted, the scenery is often beautiful and impressive, the mass of people in Jerusalem or Rome is enormous, the reconstructions of Rome and Jerusalem are brilliant and finally the circuses are outstanding. But the systematic nazification of the Romans and total vindication of the Jews living in perfect harmony with the Arabs, even when these Arabs are their slaves is un-historical if not anti- historical. The good critics are going to tell me that this is only a film for entertainment. But Hollywood knows better. The entertainment the film is bringing is nothing but a means to develop and impose a clear ideological if not political message. The fact that the Roman legions are always dressed in red is maybe historically true but it is also in perfect unison with the standard campaigns against the ""Reds"" in the 1950s, at the heart and core of the Cold War.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"

","William Wyler's ""Ben-Hur' is the most entertaining religious epic that I have ever seen with some of the best stunt-work I've ever seen on film. The movie stars Charlton Heston in an Oscar winning performance as Judah Ben-Hur a rich Jewish prince who has a best friend in a Roman named Messala (Stephen Boyd) who eventually betrays him and sends him into slavery. After Ben-Hur is taken out of slavery he seeks to get revenge on Messala for his betrayal by competing against him in a chariot race in the Roman Colosseum. While Ben-Hur is out of slavery he meets a man named Sheik Ilderim (Hugh Griffith). The chariot scene in the movie is the most famous scene in this film and it's the best scene in the entire movie. Wyler also directed such classics such as ""Roman Holiday"" (1953), and is also well known for directing ""Dodsworth"" (1936), ""Jezebel"" (1938), ""Wuthering Heights"" (1939), ""The Best Years of Our Lives"" (1946) of which none of those movies I watched besides ""Roman Holiday"". This movie is also the best color epic since both ""The Adventures of Robin Hood"" (1938), and ""Gone with the Wind"" (1939). the saddest scene in the movie is where Ben-Hur is witnessing the crucifixion of Jesus but before that happens in the movie he gives him some water and is then pushed away by Roman guards. The performances are perfect for a movie like this, as well as the stunt-work and action sequences, and the Oscar winning cinematography by Robert Surtees is excellent who would also photograph movies like ""The Sting"" (1973) which was another great movie. The movie also happens to be the best movie Wyler ever directed and one of my all time favorite films. This a true masterpiece that can't be missed by anyone."

The film is of a grand scale and is an adaptation of a fictional book as well as a remake of a silent classic.<br/><br/>It also runs in parallel to the life of Jesus hence why its known as a biblical film. The story of Jesus bookends the movie from his birth in Bethlehem to the crucifixion. In between an unseen Jesus appears at various points through the film and encounters the characters in the movie.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston is Judah Ben Hur a proud and noble Jew whose childhood friend, a Roman called Messala has returned from Rome and is second in command to the Roman Governor. Messala wants Ben-Hur to help him banish the rebellion to Rome's authority and when he is refused uses an accident to banish Ben-Hur to slavery and his mother and sister imprisoned.<br/><br/>In a galley slave ship Ben-Hur overcomes many obstacles and with luck rescues a Roman General who adopts him as his son. He uses his new found position and wealth to return to Judea and get revenge on Messala which he does through the chariot race when he secures a ride through an Arab tribe. However Ben-Hur is still full of hate and bitterness as he finds out that his mother and sister have caught leprosy and only finds his rage dissipates as he comes across Jesus during the cross. <br/><br/>The film is long, William Wyler wanted a visual feast and the film goes for some grand scenes and set designs. The script is a bit stilted and in this day and age a little hokey. The uncredited writer Gore Vidal's anecdote that he re-wrote the scenes of Ben-Hur and Messala as spurned lovers to bring out the essence of the story has now become famous although its actual credence is questionable. There is however some homo-eroticism present in the film especially during the Galley scenes.<br/><br/>Some of the acting is rather on the fruity side with Hugh Griffith's blacked up Arab with a Welsh accent looking rather odd these days. Charlton Heston is steady and stout while Stephen Boyd bristles with fury and also a touch of guilt as Messala who feels betrayed by his close friend."

","Ben-Hur (1959) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4)<br/><br/>Winner of a whopping eleven Academy Awards, this epic religious tale is considered by many to be one of the greatest films ever made as it follows the Jewish Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) who manages to overcome being thrown into slavery and eventually see the rise of Jesus Christ. I will admit right off the bat that I think there are some flaws in this movie and especially some ""down"" time after the ship attack and the start of the chariot race. I will also admit that I think the original 1925 silent has an overall better flow to it but there's certainly no way to deny the power of this film and not have your jaw on the floor from the mammoth production. There's no doubt that this film wanted to out-do the previously released epics and the size of the sets and the entire number of extras will just have you shaking your head wondering how any of it was done. Obviously, the film will always be remembered for its legendary chariot race, which still looks downright amazing all these decades later. You'll certainly be holding your breathe throughout the entire race and just the epic scale of this is just something we will never see again. The camera shots of the race taken over the statue's head remains some of the greatest scenes in movie history. It also doesn't hurt that we're given other great sequences including the ship attack but there are also some great quiet moments. One such moment happens when Heston's character falls down and his greeted with some water from a stranger. Another moment happens as we see a white figure on a hillside with people gathering around. There's no question that Heston makes this role his very own and the supporting cast is excellent as well. It should go without saying but the cinematography is some of the greatest you're ever going to see and the same can be said for the editing. BEN-HUR wowed people when it was released and it still manages to have that same power after all these years and that's really saying something."

","I won't lie, some parts of Ben-Hur do move a bit slowly. But I think it's alright because just about every scene moves the plot in one way or another. It's not like in Once Upon a Time in the West where you have three guys waiting at a train station for another guy to arrive on a train for ten minutes (not that I don't like Once Upon a Time in the West). And the chariot race is amazing. <br/><br/>Another thing I really like about Ben-Hur is the villain. Real life isn't black and white, obviously. It's sometimes nice to have villains whom you can sympathize with (like Roy Batty in Blade Runner). But it can also be nice to have a villain whom you don't have to sympathize with at all. It's pretty satisfying to see his chariot break and see him trampled under the hoofs of the horses of another charioteer. And the ending with Jesus, well, some people might say it's cheesy, but I think it's amazing. And I'm not even a Christian. <br/><br/>If you're looking at it from an artistic perspective, Stanley Kubrick's Spartacus is probably the superior movie. But I think Ben-Hur is more entertaining and emotionally satisfying."

","Ben-Hur is how to properly make an epic film. What makes this film stand out by today's standards is how it does not use computers to enhance this film. That makes the impressive chariot scenes become already even more impressive. This is a true epic that relies on acting and a well-written screenplay. The score is very good thanks to a memorable theme. At about three and a half hours, this film is very long but with such an effective story, time flew by fast.<br/><br/>William Wyler's film is a historical epic that takes place in the ancient land of Judea. Judah Ben-Hur is sold into slavery by his old Roman friend and Ben-Hur returns with a desire of revenge.<br/><br/>This film has very impressive acting. Charlton Heston is on top of his game as Ben-Hur. Stephen Boyd is also really good as his Roman archenemy. I don't have a bad thing to say about any actor here since they're all very good.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a very impressive historical epic. Compared to the Ten Commandments, I like this film even more. I'm still amazed by the chariot races and they hold up very well today. A classic tale of revenge, but I liked the additions of Christianity symbols because they simply add on to the film. This film is essentially a battle between the pagan Romans and the monotheistic Jews. A very good film and one deserving of multiple viewings despite the long length. I rate this film 9/10."

This scene also touched many audiences by showing them lessons of forgiveness and the presence of Christ in soul.

He kept his promise that he gave in the starting of his adventure which lasted for 4 years! A classic will be the title everyone would give for this mind-blowing movie as it is one of the best classics to be ever produced. The aim of the main character changes as per the situation. Even though the chariot race ended, the race will still go on (A partial dialogue in a different manner said by Messala). This dialogue is said to mean that he will have newer aims, one leading to another. All of this calamity was caused due one brick which was tipped off and in coincidence landed on a governor.<br/><br/>A movie which is rich in culture, suspense, sudden dramatic movements, hatred, and which had a suspense-killing finishing is this movie - Ben Hur!"

","A 1959 ""epic"" directed by one of Americas finest directors, William Wilder. Cecil B.De. Mille had been the great religious epic director, but with Ben Hur, Wilder showed that you need not part the Red Sea...to make a wonderfully epic movie. The main difference between De Mille and Wilder was....De Mille always loved to show over the top scenes....with maximum effect. Some of them worked really well......others flopped badly. Wilder was a superior operator....holding key ...important moments for many extra vital seconds. He also understood his actors better than Cecil. Wilders body of work (Some Like it Hot....Sunset Boulevard Etc.) is vastly superior to De Milles. However, De Mille was a pioneer and should be regarded as a brave front runner. This is one of those old films that everyone should see....if only to demonstrate to-days movies are ....all about CGI...and poor scripts."

","William Wyler directed this Academy Award winning(best picture and director) film about the biblical story of Judah Ben-Hur(played by Charlton Heston in an Academy Award winning best actor performance)who starts out as a rich Jewish prince and merchant, whose childhood friend Messala(played by Stephen Boyd)was recently appointed commander of the Roman Legions. Trouble starts when their political and religious views clash, and after an unfortunate accident in which the Roman governor was almost killed, Messala is forced to send Ben-Hur to the slave-ship galleys, and his mother and sister to prison. Betrayed and enraged, Ben-Hur vows revenge and escape, which he manages, leading to the thundering Chariot race where the grudge will be ended, though he still must find his family... Huge-scale production is magnificently directed and acted, with the climatic chariot race an all-time standout. Does go on quite long, but is still most worthwhile."

","There hasn't been a classic like the 1959 remake of Ben-Hur in so many years. Charleston Heston is at his best in this epic tale set in ancient Rome, of a man who faces the most dire of hardships for love and honor. It's a story of faith tested. How power can be used for corruption or for mankind's ultimate salvation!<br/><br/>If they did a new remake of this film, I don't know if any actor could top this classic star. But with today's effects, I can't imagine how amazing this tale could be. I personally would love to do a remake. <br/><br/>Hmm, what actor do you think might do a great remake? My picks might be; Christian Bale, Matt Bomer, Christian Cooke, Devon Sawa or Peter Facinelli for the lead role of Judah Ben-Hur.<br/><br/>For the role of Quintus Arrius, Ben-Hur's rival, my picks might be; Ryan Gosling, Jonathan Rhys Meyers, Sean Faris or Dave Annable.<br/><br/>And for the role of Esther, my picks might be; Mila Kunis, Megan Fox, Lily James, Gal Gadot or Monica Raymund.<br/><br/>If you love the classics and stories set in ancient Rome, this is a must see!!!"

","For more than 100 years, the tale of Ben Hur has staggered the imaginations of audiences worldwide, as indicated by its successful publication history, having at least three different film adaptations, and even a stage play adaptation. Of all the exposure this story has received, much of its acclaim may be attributed to its famous 1959 film adaptation, which remains a classic in epic cinema, and a standard Easter holiday favorite.<br/><br/>Whether you've heard of Ben Hur or not, chances are good that you've seen this film referenced or mentioned somewhere in pop culture. It stands as one of the biggest, most epic, most ambitious productions in cinema to date. It's most impressive in how it employed thousands of extras, over a million props, and some very expensive and lavish setpieces to bring this larger-than-life tale to life. Even if you aren't marveling at the sheer scope and scale of this film, the chariot race in the film's final act will have you at the edge of your seat. It's a long, uncompromising, real-looking sequence that's still thrilling and intense, and it should stand as one of the best racing scenes of all time. There is a really neat sea battle in the film's first half, which offers even more thrills and violence to behold. For the most part, however, this is a film more heavily built on drama and characterization. Parts of it remain enthralling, as we watch the title character suffer and fight his way through adversity. However, in between the major turning events and the action scenes, the film's momentum does suffer a massive slump. The pacing in certain scenes never agreed with me personally, and is really the only issue I take with this fine picture.<br/><br/>The story for this film is perfectly sound and well-built. Judah Ben Hur is a well-rounded character we can follow easily enough and relate to; his rivalry with Messala provides the conflict to drive the plot forward, and digs up some interesting themes of vengeance and hatred. What really propels the film above and beyond will be the story of Christ, running in tandem with Ben Hur's story; both story lines become entwined to reveal strong themes of redemption and salvation. I have no clue how closely this adapts Lew Wallace's original novel, but on its own merits, this film offers a decently insightful story.<br/><br/>Captured with a sweeping widescreen frame on a pristine 70mm film stock, this film looks every bit as big as it is. Just about every shot is carefully calculated to best present the imagery with incredible amounts of detail. It uses a lot of long shots, which never felt all that intimate or interesting to me personally, but it is definitely a big-scale picture with lots of impressive shots. Acting is pleasing; Charlton Heston plays Ben Hur with enough nuance and machismo to make the character cool and memorable. The rest of the cast do their best. Writing is not too bad either. This production spares no expense on its massive sets, props, costumes, and visual effects. Music is just as big and ambitious as the rest of the movie is.<br/><br/>For its sheer epicness and classic status, this film comes highly recommended.<br/><br/>4/5 (Entertainment: Average | Story: Very Good | Film: Perfect)"
"vincentlynch-moonoi","10","0","3","31 March 2013"," My all time second-favorite film
","I want to begin by saying that I watched this film...again...on Easter weekend, and, by coincidence, when I had just learned that MGM is planning a remake. I'm usually not a big fan of remakes, but I think in this case it will -- at the very least -- be interesting. I understand that the new script will be closer to the story as written by General Lew Wallace. Let me skip to my recent experience of watching the new Oz film...not bad...enjoyable...but knowing that virtually every scene in that movie was filmed in front of a blue/green screen kinda ruined it for me...I felt as if the actors were simply placed within a cartoon. Much as the rather over-the-top special effects in the final Indiana Jones movie ruined that for me. There's nothing wrong with special effects...they're in all films to some degree or another...but it's getting to the point where so many films focus on the special effects that we are losing the ability to judge fine acting and fine script-writing. I fear the remake of ""Ben-Hur"" may end of that way, also -- a special effects extravaganza that will make the new film a shadow of this classic.<br/><br/>I mentioned that this is my second-favorite film...just behind ""Gone With The Wind"", and that's partly because each had a superior story, and each was ahead of its time in terms of sheer movie-making. It seems to me that ""Ben-Hur"" pretty much has it all, beginning with a superb story (even if you're not a Christian) and a very fine script.<br/><br/>And then there's the acting. I'm going to hand out so many kudos here, that I feel I should begin with the one performance that was shallow and so passive as to be nearly worthless -- that of Cathy O'Donnell as Ben-Hur's sister, Tirzah. How bland can an actress get? O'Donnell answered that question definitively. No wonder this was her final film, and that after this she showed up in mostly bit parts on television.<br/><br/>Charleton Heston is an actor that I simply can't stand any longer. I won't watch any of his films, with two exceptions: ""The Ten Commandments"" (because it's hard to resist the spectacle of a Cecil B. DeMille film) and ""Ben-Hur"". As much as I dislike the man because of his political stands, I have to admit that his acting here is absolutely superb and spot-on. His performance as a man who is constantly evolving here, is nothing short of phenomenal. Heston had a few other great performances, but this is the one that stands out and forms the basis of his legacy.<br/><br/>We only see Jack Hawkins in on part of the film -- from the battleship to Rome -- but his performance is also right on target. Interestingly, he didn't want to do another spectacle film so soon after ""Bridge On The River Kwai"", which is probably a better role and performance. But he's still excellent here. Incidentally, this film was made shortly after he had gone through cobalt treatments for what eventually turned out to be throat cancer, which killed him at a relatively young age.<br/><br/>Haya Harareet was an Israeli actress who only made 9 films in her career. Nevertheless, even aside from her beauty, this film is her finest performance, and I felt worthy of an Oscar nomination.<br/><br/>Stephen Boyd also gave his finest performance in this film, and was just right as the selfish and spiteful antagonist. The whole controversy over whether or not he played his role as if he was a jilted gay lover spurned by Ben-Hur is an interesting one, and based on interviews with Gore Vidal.<br/><br/>Hugh Girffith is very good as the Arab sheik. Martha Scott is not a well-remembered actress, but I always thought she was very good and very underrated. As Ben-Hur's mother here, she turns in another durable performance. Sam Jaffe is a treasure as Simonides, and this performance rivals his performance as the abbot in 1937's ""Lost Horizon"". I have always enjoyed Finlay Currie's performance as Balthazar in this film, and only recently have been discovering some other fine performances by the Scottish actor (""I Know Where I'm Going"" and ""People Will Talk""). And finally, Frank Thring as Pontius Pilate is terrific.<br/><br/>And last but not least -- the spectacle. ""And a cast of thousands"" is certainly true here, excellent sets (particularly for the chariot race), and of course -- that chariot race...probably film-making at its finest and most spectacular.<br/><br/>This has it all, with few complaints. This kind of product makes Hollywood proud."

","When the movie was over and in the last scene I saw Ben-Hur Judah (Charlton Heston) approach his mother and sister after he beheld the miracle of our Lord Jesus Christ, I said within myself, ""what a privilege it is to have seen this movie""; and a privilege it was indeed. The most amazing thing about the movie is the score, it is just wonderful, then add the tale of Ben-Hur who went from being a prince to a slave and back and learnt the hard way that revenge does not bring content; What you have is this 50s masterpiece that all should get the privilege to see.<br/><br/>The story of Ben-Hur is set during the birth and death of Christ, Ben-Hur at that time was a good friend of the next in line Governor of Jerusalem. Their friendship is tested (as Ben-Hur is a Jew and his best friend Messala (next in line Governor) is Roman) when Messala calls Ben aside and ask for the names of the Jews leading a rebellion against Rome, Ben's refusal caused both friends to part.<br/><br/>An unfortunate incident about a loose tile led to the death of the present Governor, Ben and his sister were the ones responsible for the accident, but Messala failed to accept the incident for what it was, an accident even after his investigation showed it was so.<br/><br/>Messala, out of revenge for Ben turning him down, had Ben sold to slavery and his family jailed. Something led to another and Ben is free and all he wants is revenge.<br/><br/>Ben Hur was a record breaking Oscar movie, it won 11 out of the 12 Academy Award nominations that it got, some of its wins inclue Best Picture, Best Director and Best Actor for Charlton Heston. Charlton's 1956 movie, The Ten Commandment was also a hit and showed Charlton's gift in epic film portrayal. Ben Hur is based on a book named Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ by Lew Wallace, and the movie production saw the use of wonderful cinematic scenes, shots that will linger such as the one of the chariot race.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur was both a critical and a commercial success making close to 10 times its production cost and the movie is regarded as one of the best epic movies ever made. Holding back ratings in the American Film Institute in their top 100 movies (it is ranked a 100) and Top Epic films (here it is ranked number 2).<br/><br/>Ben-Hur is a beautiful movie and a highly successful one, which many should get the chance to see; the movie like The Ten Commandments is biblical but not totally biblically grounded like Ten Commandments, but it is still wonderful and nice to see even for those who are eager to see a biblical film.<br/><br/>www.lagsreviews.com"
"jmillerdp","8","0","2","16 February 2013"," An Almost-Four-Hour Revenge Film with a Great Chariot Race!
","*** SOME MINOR SPOILERS ***<br/><br/>Basically, an almost-four-hour revenge film, featuring the greatest action sequence of all time! Charlton Heston portrays a citizen of Judea who finds himself in the center of Roman power, and is then exiled from it. He spends most of the film seeking revenge, and doesn't stop wanting it even when he gets a big dose of it! His story crosses paths with that of Jesus Christ, making this film a Christian movie, to an extent. But, it's driven by Ben-Hur's endless need for vengeance. So, having three hours, forty-two minutes pass with this being the case seems like a bit much!<br/><br/>But, then there is the matter of the Chariot Race! It was actually not directed by William Wyler, but by famous stuntman Yakima Canutt and Andrew Norton. Canutt is famous for his being dragged underneath the lead horses in ""Stagecoach"" and ending up letting go and having the coach pass over him. That stunt inspired a famous similar stunt in ""Raiders of the Lost Ark,"" that time involving a truck. Tons of preparation and filming went into the Chariot Race and it shows! It is truly spectacular, and makes the film worth seeing.<br/><br/>Otherwise, it really is a revenge movie, with the Christian theme really only coming into play in the film's final ten or so minutes. Robert Surtees' cinematography is excellent, as is Miklos Rozsa's film score. Certainly one of the most famous epics in film history, but to me, bettered by the likes of ""Lawrence of Arabia.""<br/><br/>******** (8 Out of 10 Stars)"

","Ben-Hur is one of those sword and sandal epics that, like The Ten Commandments or Spartacus, is a good film, well acted, well directed, but ultimately, is just a good excuse to eat junk food, for there's nothing of any real depth to it. In many ways, it is sort of Part Two of Charlton Heston's three part 'religious epic', which started with The Ten Commandments and ended with El Cid (a bit better of a film than the two others). The difference is that this is the least religious of the trio, despite its subtitle being A Story Of The Christ.<br/><br/>The film has a few standout scenes, excluding the justly famed chariot sequence (which includes the accidental flip of Hur over the chariot- done by a stuntman, of course), including the two exchanges of water between Christ and Hur, and the dialogue between Hur and Arrius, before their connection is formed, wherein both men counter-taunt each other with words; Heston seeming to make a career over ironic taunts, which would reach its apogee in The Planet Of The Apes. But, mostly, Ben-Hur is good old fashioned movie-making; an epic that has few weaknesses and a number of strengths, even if it is barren of anything of depth. Believe me, there are many worse ways to spend an afternoon than watching Charlton Heston kick ass on the past."
"elizabethj65","5","0","3","9 May 2012"," The story of Ben Hur
","Obviously most viewers do not know the book. Judah Ben Hur was 15 when the tile slipped from under HIS hand (not his sister's). The first chapter is about the birth of Christ and the three Magi coming to worship the infant Jesus. The Quintus Arrius part is as written - the person who made the comment about a homosexual relationship is obviously not a well read person. Messala did not die after the chariot race but was crippled - a fitting punishment for his awful deeds. Balthazar's daughter Iras becomes involved with Messala and inveigles Judah Ben Hur into a rendezvous where he was to be set upon and killed by Messala's thugs but it did not work. Miriam and Tirzah are trying to get to Jesus and His shadow passes over them and they are cured. Ben Hur finds himself in the Garden of Gethsemene on the night Jesus was arrested and in the Bible it says there was a ""young man"" there and when the Romans caught hold of his robe he fled naked. The book says this young man was Ben Hur.<br/><br/>Although I did enjoy the film I found it disappointing that the main thread of the story was altered so that Judah Ben Hur is a man when he is sent to the galleys and other little things which detract from the message of the book which is subtitled ""A Tale of The Christ"""
"TxMike","Null","0","2","26 December 2011"," The epic Heston classic, Judah Ben-Hur.
","While it is possible that I actually saw Ben Hur over the years, I don't believe I ever did. Perhaps some of the great chariot race scenes, but nothing else. So I watched it today, on DVD, a restored version with Dolby sound. At over 3 hours running time it takes a bit of patience. The DVD has a great picture, with realistic colors, neither mute nor vivid. It also includes the 6-minute musical interlude at the beginning plus a 4-minute one after intermission.<br/><br/>The DVD has a host of valuable extras, including a profile of the military man who wrote the source novel in the 1800s, plus excerpts from various stage versions and the 1925 silent film version. Also very interesting is Heston's selectable commentary on the film.<br/><br/>The story spans the 33 years from the birth of Christ to his crucifixion. Against this background is a fictional story of two men who had been best friends as boys, and who now as early 30s adults find themselves on opposite sides of the politics of Judea and surrounding areas.<br/><br/>Academy award winning Charlton Heston is famously Judah Ben-Hur, a wealthy Jew who is dedicated to opposing the invasion by Rome. Stephen Boyd is his old friend Messala, who has returned to Judea as a Roman official. As they meet and greet again after years apart, it comes down to Messala telling Judah, ""You are either with me, or against me."" With that choice they part ways as enemies.<br/><br/>And that sets the stage for the rest of the story. In what is an accidental falling of loose roofing material, slightly injuring a Roman official on horseback, Massala uses this as a demonstration of his will, he sends Judah away to a life of slavery as a rower on a Roman war ship, and Judah's mother and sister to a life in prison. He knew they were not guilty but this would show the rest of the community how far he would go to enforce Roman rule and suppress any opposition.<br/><br/>The great chariot race is after the intermission, and is a full 9 minutes of running time. Perhaps even more impressive than the filming of the scene is the work that went into building a set of that scale.<br/><br/>History has shown that this is one of the great movies of all time, an enduring classic. Ironically, filming began without a good script and was literally written day-by-day for filming the next day.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: For anyone who has not seen it yet, read no further. Judah becomes a dedicated slave and in a battle ends up saving the life of the fleet commander, who takes him to Rome, legally adopts him, and makes him heir to his name and wealth. Meanwhile, although Judah thought they were dead, his mother and sister had contracted leprosy while in prison and were living in a valley of lepers. In the great chariot race, officiated by Pilot, Massala is using his whip on Judah, who gains the upper hand, Masala falls to the track, is trampled, and later dies. This is happening right before the time Pilate sentenced Christ to a death on the cross. Judah had encountered Christ 4 years earlier while being marched across the desert, and was given a drink of water. Now they go to the place where he passes, and later mother and sister are healed as Christ dies, witnessed by a great wind and rain. Judah becomes an early convert from Judaism to Christianity, although that is treated in a very subtle manner in the movie."
"janecamacho","10","0","3","23 April 2011"," What an epic is all about!
","I've recently searched for a definition of what an epic film is, and found in Wikipedia the following: ""a film that emphasizes human drama on a grand scale"" That says it all. In deed a human drama, with a character's achievements and ordeals in the central stage, generally within the context of an historical event for its background to give it the so called epic scope, and dramatized with big production values. That's what an epic film is, and Ben Hur is THE EPIC. <br/><br/>So that the reader can understand where ""I'm from"", the occasional epic (specially biblical epics like Samson & Delilah, The ten commandments, The robe, etc) where mandatory in Sunday school _when I was a catholic student_ and a delightful treat at home for Easter Sunday. Through them I got to know Victor Mature, Jean Simons, Kirk Douglas  and of course, Charlton Heston! So Ben Hur was an expected addition to the list when I discovered it fifteen years ago, on a Sunday afternoon. I watched it with my grandmother who served me the live ""audio commentary track"", through key moments in the picture like if she was watching her favorite novel, astounded on how much was cut in the old days due to Portuguese censorship. Ben Hur owes much to Cecil B. DeMille's productions, being also a forerunner (in a technical sense) for other epics like Spartacus or any of David Lean's stravaganzzas. <br/><br/>For a bit of plot summary: - Judah Ben Hur (Heston) is a wealthy man in Roman occupied Judea, just about the time of Jesus Christ's ministry. He reunites with an old boyhood friend, Messala (Stephen Boyd). They try to rekindle the old friendship, but find that they have grown in to absolute opposite young men, one being a passioned Jew patriot, the other a roman soldier with the will to make a career at the expense of the Jew people. Thus the short lived Idyll is broken. Just a few days later Ben Hur and its family are involved in an accident with the new roman governor, and are accused and condemned in moments notice by Messala who wishes to inspire fear by making an example out of Ben Hur. So the old friends became enemies, and Ben Hur's hate and quest for revenge gets started. <br/><br/>Lew Wallece's novel (on which the movie is based on) does a pretty good job leaving the ministry and passion of Christ in the background, giving it a strange role of mystical influence over the story unfolding in the central stage, which is Ben Hur's search for revenge and peace of mind. The two stories run parallel to each other in the movie, joining forces in the last act, giving it a very meaningful conclusion and thus shedding some light to the author's chosen subtitled (elapsed form this 1959 remake) A tale of the Christ. A storytelling technique resembling that of D. W. Grifith's movie Intolerence (1916). <br/><br/>Another interesting fact concerning the scale of the film is that Heston's character goes through enough events during the story, over a time span big enough to be called an Odyssey (in the Homeric sense ) thus the epic nature prevailing in the story. From the harsh and cruel scenes in the roman galleys and in the catacombs in Jerusalem, to the Shakespearian dialogs between Ben Hur and Messala during the falling out in the beginning of the picture, and right after the race in the circus _ ""There is still enough of man here for you to hate. () The race, it goes on Judah!"" _ and of course the classical, and ever since copied chariot race show down in the circus. Well, there are enough moments for you to cherish and too many for me to name. And without neglecting the technical aspects, like the huge (unrealistic) sets, many of them built on location, giving a sense of grandeur; Miklos Rosza's score, adding to the epic feel of the movie (tunes like the rowing in the galley scenes, the roman parades, or the final Hallelluya get stuck with you for a long time); Heston's (well deserved) academy award wining performance; Boyd's unforgivably unrewarded rendition of the tribune Messala If Wylliam Wyller wanted to tackle with a Cecil B DeMille special, I would say mission accomplished!<br/><br/>Drawbacks in the picture? Perhaps the religious motif in the story might not sink in with every one, and the viewer that's not sensible to it could feel somewhat detached. Being a catholic myself I must say that watching this movie always rekindles my faith, remembering some of the things that I cherish from the New Testament, like the role of forgiveness in our hearts, and that hate, while a convenient fuel, is a poor substitute for love. <br/><br/>So if my words have tantalized you, my advice is watch it! Take a Sunday afternoon off (preferably Easter Sunday) and watch it!"

In actuality it is a not a brick but rather it is a roof tile. Roof tiles, though still possibly lethal, are lighter than a brick and break apart much easier.

","The best of the wide screen biblical epics may have more brains than all the others combined, but that doesn't save it from being any less of a guilty pleasure. Of course any Hollywood 'Tale of the Christ', however tastefully presented, is going to have a certain camp appeal, and the real attraction of the film remains the sheer scale and spectacle of its many set pieces, in particular the sea battle and thrilling chariot race. In between those two highlights is the usual middlebrow Christian soap opera, full of noble Jews and arrogant Romans, with (representing the former) the young Prince of Hur seeking bitter revenge after being unjustly condemned to slavery by his childhood friend Messala, now a Roman tribune. Ben Hur's vendetta eventually leads him to a Messiah who preaches love and forgiveness, two simple virtues all but lost behind the mammoth production costs and rousing Miklos Rosza music score. But the drama is salvaged by a semi-literate script (the screen writing tag team included a skeptical Gore Vidal), several worthwhile performances (all the more noteworthy from a cast dressed in togas), and a homeopathic dose of that old-time religion."

","¨Where there is greatness, great government or power, even great feeling or compassion, error also is great. We progress and mature by fault. But Rome has said she is ready to join your life to hers in a great future. ¨ I finally got around watching this classic film and I can say with absolute certainty that it doesn't age at all. It has been over 50 years since William Wyler directed this award winning epic and the movie is still stunning. Ben Hur is the film with most Oscars (tied with Titanic and The Lord of the Rings with 11 a piece). It was Wyler's third Oscar for best direction, he won for The Best Years of our Lives and Mrs. Miniver, but everyone remembers him for his masterpiece: Ben Hur. Wyler's film was actually a remake of a 1925 film of the same name and was also based on General Lew Wallace's novel. It is hard to envision how Wyler was able to make such a masterpiece without the help of computer generated effects. These scenes were brilliantly shot and the effects were great, for example the chariot race was breathtaking and very well choreographed. Ben Hur won all the technical awards along with best actor for Charlton Heston and supporting actor for Hugh Griffith. The only award it didn't win that it was nominated for was for best adapted screenplay which was written by Karl Tunberg, although several other people were involved and didn't get the credit for it. This epic movie is three and a half hours long, but time goes by so fast that it never drags. The story is so rich and powerful and the visuals were so amazing that Ben Hur became an instant success and a classic, and it is a movie we can still enjoy now fifty years later.<br/><br/>The story takes place during the first century in Judea, during the time of the Christ. Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) is a wealthy prince of his land, but Judea is under the Roman Empire. It is an unstable time because there are many talks of rebellion and the Jews don't want to pay taxes to Caesar who has to send more Roman soldiers in order to bring order to the chaotic area. Caesar sends a new tribune named Messala (Stephen Boyd) to Judea, who once lived there when he was a boy and was good friends with Judah and his family. The two men are very glad to see each other at first, but later Judah realizes that Messala is a changed man who wants Judah to betray his people and tell him who the rebels are. Judah doesn't help Messala and the two men go their separate ways. A few days later the Romans are parading over the city and as they pass Judah's house, his sister leans over the roof and one of the tiles accidentally falls over injuring a Roman Governor. Judah, his mother, and sister are taken prisoners by Messala who sends him to the galleys as a slave and locks Miriam (Martha Scott) and Tirzah (Cathy O'Donnell) in the cell. Judah keeps alive hoping to some day return and avenge his cause. In the galleys he meets centurion Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) and in battle saves his life. During Judah's epic journey he runs into interesting characters such as Jesus of Nazareth, an Arab Sheik (Hugh Griffith), and one of the wise men Balthasar (Finlay Currie). The story is very engaging and develops nicely.<br/><br/>I can see how many directors and American movies have been inspired by this film which was ahead of its time with so many breathtaking effects. The chariot race is amazing and remains as one of the most memorable scenes in the movie. The message of the film is also very uplifting and positive, and the performances were great. Charlton Heston shines in his role as Ben Hur and he became one of the first true action stars. This is a movie I am glad I finally got around watching and I really enjoyed it. Hugh Griffith also gave a good performance as the Sheik and was probably the funniest character in the movie and he really deserved his Oscar. He was a good addition and probably the reason why so many action films now always introduce the funny character. Ben Hur is a must see film, it won't disappoint.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","Ben Hur is one of the best epics in the movie history and at my opinion the best of all the great movies William Wyler has made. Simply brilliant in every single way. William Wyler's directing in this movie is so ahead of it's time and the screenplay is just so brilliant and well interpreted that i'm simply amazed with how good this movie is. This movie's got it all. It's filled with brilliant action and heartbreaking moments that are never irritating or unnecessary. It's really hard to make those two thing's work so good together but William Wyler did it all with such style and perfect timing that it's near four hours of running time just passes by you.<br/><br/>Anything i say about this movie is completely unnecessary since it really speaks for it self. All the Eleven Oscars it got are well deserved and i'm just sorry that it didn't get the one for best screenplay too.<br/><br/>Watch this movie! It's brilliant! If not for the movie it self than at least for the chariot's scene! It's A-M-A-Z-I-N-G!!!"

","Ben-hur is one of the finest piece of film making,in fact its the best that william wyler offered after 'the roman holiday'. this film has everything it was entertaining as well as didactic in approach.Mr.Wyler has done full justice to the lew wallace's 1880 masterpiece 'Ben-Hur: A Tale of the Christ'. Charlton Heston as Judah Ben-Hur was apt as well as adept in his role, even Stephen Boyd as Messala excelled in his performance. Cinema like this is very very rare & will go down in history of cinema among the all time great movies that will inspire those who can acknowledge both the content and the conduct. I cant rate this masterpiece as it goes beyond my conventional rating system,everything about it from story to score is simply amazing,just amazing."

","I recall watching this film for the first time at least forty years ago and I was really impressed with the action and the sheer scale of this epic. I was however not as awestruck as I was when I watched it again some twenty years later. I do not know why I appreciated it more when I was older perhaps I was little more mature and or maybe I recognised the subtleties amongst the action. I am not a religious person although I did appreciate the sensitivity and care in the way that it was set out on the screen and for me like everything else in this film the attention to detail seemed meticulous. Anyway I do regard this creation as a wonderful classic whose beacon will always shine for me. Yes the film is long just short of four hours but quite frankly if the quality had been the same say for an additional two hours then I would have appreciated it just the same. I am not that bright when it comes to analysing a film but I know what I like and this film will always tick the boxes. For me this film feels right from second one and it simply oozes quality from every frame. I sometimes do this as part of a review when I thank the cast and crew for their time and professionalism in creating a masterpiece. I do this in this review because I genuinely feel that this film could not be made now. The chariot race is breathtaking and in my opinion even the most modern of technologies could not recreate it appropriately and therefore the mere fact that this was filmed over fifty years ago is a testament to the astonishing quality of the cast and crew's efforts. The whole is most definitely a lot larger than the sum of its parts and I have no hesitation in recommending this film to anyone. Please allocate enough time to watch it all the way through because for me there would nothing more frustrating than to have leave it part of the way through. In my opinion that would not be the end of the world but maybe spoil the enjoyment a little. Enjoy a true epic in every sense of the word."
"Enosh Sunny","10","0","2","2 April 2010"," One of the Greatest Epics of All Time
","Ben-Hur promulgates itself to prominence with stunning visuals and astounding vistas. The entire film exceeds expectations in every aspect possible. Director William Wyler makes an indelible impression as one of the greatest directors of all time. His ability to hold the audience through a runtime of 222 minutes on screen is laudable. He delivers a paradigm for future generations to acquire inspiration from by setting an exemplary display of magnificent film-making techniques and mingling the frames with epic, beautiful Technicolor. Charlton Heston has held few of the most acclaimed and successful films of all time in the history of cinema including The Ten Commandments, The Greatest Show on Earth & Planet of the Apes. Ben-Hur proves to be his most praised performance of all, which also rendered him with the coveted Oscar. But without a doubt, he deserved it. Every actor blends in with his or her role exceptionally. There is not a chance where a replacement could have done better. I have a penchant for great Background Score, and I'm sure everyone does. Miklos Rozsa provides the most poignant score I've ever heard. I cannot presume I have heard a better score than this in my life so far. This earned him an Oscar which was indeed a deserving accolade.<br/><br/>The film is a Rome-Set environment, which makes every frame of every scene look like a million dollars, which, of course, is rendered elegant and opulent with Technicolor. It begins with a Roman tribune, Messala, being sent to subjugate a province of Judaea which once was under the peaceful rule of The House of Hur, inherited by Prince Ben-Hur, before it was invaded by Roman legions. Messala and Ben-Hur, once childhood friends, reunite only to end up in a rift resulting from incomprehension of patriotism and misconception of treason. This leads to animosity as a minor accident impels Messala to take advantage of the situation and condemn the Hur family to confinement and possibly slavery. Ben-Hur is sent to the Galleys to serve. The subplot between him and Jesus begins here when he, deprived of strength and will, is reinvigorated after a heartfelt call to God for help. A brilliant depiction of faith and answer. The story continues in the galleys, where a tremendous battle scene is filmed with warships. The chemistry between Quintus Arrius and Ben-Hur is commendable. His conjecture of Ben-Hur's personality, and his intuit of his younger self in him force him to unchain Ben-Hur at the time of battle, which further leads to his escape. Returning the favor, Ben-Hur saves Quintus from the sea and shows him to glory of victory, which he could have missed if succeeded in incessant endeavors of suicide, which Ben-Hur thwarted. Quintus names him his heir and adopts him as his son. But Ben-Hur's return to his land is inevitable.<br/><br/>He returns to Judaea in search for his mother and sister, which brings him face to face with his enemy, once friend, Messala. But the bitter truth revealed to him by the love of his life leaves him vindictive. And then comes the epic, most marvelous, never before or after seen on screen – THE CHARIOT RACE. The most pungent 9 minutes on screen ensue. This was the highlight of the film, and undoubtedly it was the most flawless, most realistic, most believable and unbelievable race I've ever seen. Following the race is the demise of Messala, and divulgence of Ben-Hur's mother and sister's existence. The valley of lepers is seldom visited, but Ben-Hur is drawn to it because of his love for his family. And then follows the greatest monologue; I'm Thirsty Still. But the enlightening and edifying words of Jesus leaves Esther, Ben-Hur's love, in awe and oblivious of the adverse effects, and without hesitation she decides to save his mother and sister. The fear of leprosy fades from their minds as they both bring the lepers out into the city and to the path where Procession to Calvary is in progress. And so Ben-Hur lifelong burden is relieved when he offers Jesus a drink of water. The conclusion brings hope and faith to all hearts as Ben-Hur's mother and sister are healed by the blood of Christ which flows from his Cross. And finally THE END to a compelling story which will set a higher, inimitable level of film-making in Hollywood.<br/><br/>11 Oscars in total, for the first time, proclaim the grandeur of this Film. Altogether an experience of a lifetime, which cannot be missed. My rating 10/10. If you haven't seen it, I'd say you are missing the greatness Hollywood claims to instill. Recommended to all movie lovers."

","A few nights ago, while working in my home office, I was pulled from my concentration to run out and see what my husband was watching on the TV in the family room. My husband had switched the channel and landed on the slave galley scene from Ben-Hur. The sounds of the drum beating as slaves rowed, was instantly recognizable. I immediately told my husband to press ""record"" on our DVR to capture the remainder of this epic show. From that moment, I was unable to tear myself away and proceeded to watch the story unfold as the rest of my household went to bed. I sat rapt and weeping yet again over this glorious movie. <br/><br/>I remember watching this movie in a movie theater in 1959 with my family when it first came out. I was 3 or 4 years old. I recall that during the extremely intense chariot race I had to cover my eyes and asked my mother to tell me when the scene was over and to tell me ""if the good guys won""! That scene, so intense for me then, still caused me to exclaim in trepidation, even now at age 54. <br/><br/>Thinking back, I have identified with this movie each of the three times I have watched it. As a child then, my thoughts were about the cruelty of some, the integrity of others and the wonders of this Christ they spoke about. I remember thinking that I hoped I would grow up and have a brother so heroic that he would come and save me like Juda Ben-Hur did when he came back for his sister and mother and carried them out of the Lepers' colony, and also that there would still be men like Christ for my generation. Later on, in my early twenties, I watched this movie again. I remember wishing then that I could meet a man so honorable and heroic (like Juda) who, if in similar circumstances, would come back and save his family and marry me! Now as an adult and mother to a son and daughter, I wept yet again during my viewing (!) and wondered if my family was in similar circumstances, might my son be so strong and heroic that he could survive such cruelties and still feel such love and devotion that he would be able to come back to save his mother and his younger sister? How the years pass. The movie was and still is fantastic and deserves all the accolades it has received."

The film is about a Judean prince(Heston) who accidentally kills the governor of Judea and his former friend(Boyd) sends him to the galleys and he swears revenge. He has such a strong faith in God and ultimately leads back to Judea on a quest to find his mother and sister(who were arrested along with Judah. His love(Harareet)wrongfully tells him that his mother and sister are dead(they had obtained leprosy) and his revenge culminates in one of the grandest sequences in film history: the chariot scene.

They never say his name but I find it more powerful. The one word to really describe this movie is EPIC."
"jimjo1216","Null","0","2","31 December 2009"," A landmark epic powerful enough to restore one's faith in faith
","This film explains what the Christian faith is all about, through the story of a man whose life has been thrown into turmoil.<br/><br/>The life of Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston), the prince of Judea, is destroyed by the Roman Empire. After years of enslavement, Judah makes an unlikely return to Judea. A man of great faith, Judah becomes increasingly bent on revenge. Life under Roman rule has changed him. But with the help of the woman he loves and the teachings of a rabbi from Nazareth, Judah may find his faith once more.<br/><br/>You see, the story of Judah Ben-Hur coincides with the story of Jesus. Jesus isn't a full-fledged character in this movie, but he appears at different points. It was the kindness of Jesus, a stranger, that gave Judah the will to live while he was a slave. And when vengeance had gotten Judah in its grip, the hope offered by Jesus restored his goodness. Only by then Jesus was sentenced to death by the Romans.<br/><br/>BEN-HUR is a Biblical epic that I found surprisingly entertaining. There's a love story aspect, there's Judah's journey to get back at the man who imprisoned him, there's the classic chariot race scene, and there's the Biblical stuff about the influence of Jesus in the Roman world. The 3-1/2 hour film is manageable because so much happens from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Hugh Griffith gives an enjoyable supporting performance as an Arab sheik. Stephen Boyd plays the complete jerk who was once Judah's best friend. Jack Hawkins is the Roman commander who earns Judah's respect. And Finlay Currie shows up as Balthasar, the wise man from Alexandria.<br/><br/>The movie is a nice dose of Christianity. In fact, the story pretty much explains what Christianity is all about. How it came to be and why people like it. But the film should still be enjoyable for the non-religious viewer.<br/><br/>It's quite an achievement. The epic scale, the huge sets, the action, everything. It has a G rating, but there's a fair amount of blood.<br/><br/>BEN-HUR is not one of my personal favorite films, but I did enjoy the story and I can certainly recognize the quality of this enormous production. Recommended. It's something special."
"Steffi_P","8","0","2","22 December 2009"," ""A strange, stubborn faith""
","In the 1950s, while the up-and-coming independent studios were focusing on gritty small-scale dramas, the majors eked out the last of their glory days with giant-budget spectacles. While at first it was thought the immensity of these pictures was enough, at some point the studios felt the need to adapt and set off in search of the Holy Grail known as the ""intimate epic"".<br/><br/>To this end, it made sense for producer Sam Zimbalist to assign this project to director William Wyler, perhaps the finest director of human interaction who ever lived, but also one who was not afraid of big action scenes or outdoor vistas. Here Wyler shows a good handling of the Cinemascope canvas, making compositions with a lot of depth to them, which evens out and gives definition to the extreme width. He doesn't just do this with the massive sets, but also with the arrangements of people. For example when Messala comes to visit the Hur household, we see Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd in the foreground at opposite ends of the screen, and beyond them Martha Scott and Cathy O'Donnell slightly closer to screen centre. This creates a kind of perspective effect which draws the viewer in and focuses us on the actors.<br/><br/>But a production of this size cannot be made on the efforts of its director alone. Wyler is backed up by a distinguished technical crew, and in fact perhaps Wyler's biggest contribution was how closely he seems to have worked with them, in particular cinematographer Robert Surtees. While the photography in Ben-Hur is rarely exquisite, it is extremely well-tailored to the moods and dramatic necessities of the picture. One of Wyler's trademarks was keeping to very selective angles, for example having an actor's back to the camera, or part of their face obscured behind a bit of scenery, so as only to show certain facets of their performance. Here he does not shoot with such stark variations, and mostly keeps the players in side-view mid-shots with long takes. However Surtees does a Wyler-type job with his lighting, for example keeping Haya Harareet's face well lit while her body is in darkness, capturing and emphasising her reactions, which are the best part of her performance, such as her shocked look when she is first kissed by Heston. For Heston himself, Surtees uses heavy contrast lighting, which makes the actor's face appear more expressive (and, I have to say, more handsome) than it actually is. Other than this, Surtees's biggest coup is his extraordinary nighttime photography which makes the nativity scene and the romantic meetings between Heston and Harareet truly outstanding.<br/><br/>Other honourable mentions go to film editors Ralph Winters and John Dunning, and composer Miklos Rosza. It is the editing process which really makes the handful of action sequences work, especially that of Jack Hawkins urging the rowers to greater speeds, which is a delightfully intense montage of a kind rarely seen in classic-era Hollywood. Rosza's score is both stupendous and lavish, as his often were, utilizing some rather complex arrangements, with counter-melodies audible beneath the main themes. It's a score that can easily change moods to suit the scene, but also sounds authentic for the times being dealt with.<br/><br/>Wyler and Zimbalist were sticklers for authenticity, and one example of this I am quite impressed with is that the nails go through Christ's wrists, not his palms, which is historically accurate. There is one rather glaring error though – the depiction of the lepers. 1959 was a good year for leprosy on screen, from the use of real victims in The Nun's Story to the awesomely nonsensical zombie-lepers in Fritz Lang's Indian diptych. However, according to the MGM makeup department, leprosy looks like a mild case of acne – rather an anticlimax after all the fuss made over it by the characters.<br/><br/>The cast of Ben-Hur is frankly a bit of predictable box-ticking. People like Heston, Hawkins and Finlay Currie were an established part of ancient-world epic furniture, and the rest of the cast is filled by the usual assortment of respected theatre actors. Still, why complain when each is doing a good job? Heston is for once not the embarrassing lump of wood he normally was. His vocal delivery still leaves something to be desired but his emoting is spot on. Haya Harareet manages to stand out in what is a rather small role despite its being technically the female lead, and it is her contribution that makes the romantic angle work. I feel the Oscar for best supporting actor should have gone to Stephen Boyd and not Hugh Griffith. Boyd's performance is one of the more theatrical but it is also the most elaborate in that league – look at those tiny significant gestures he makes, such as a little rubbing of his thumb as he grasps Heston's arm in friendship. Admittedly though Griffith's lively appearance is very refreshing after the waves of pomposity, and I am faintly amused by the fact he sounds incredibly Welsh.<br/><br/>So, were Zimbalist and Wyler successful in creating an ""intimate epic""? No, not quite. They should have taken a tip from the recently-deceased Cecil B. DeMille. These ancient tales were so far removed from viewers' reality that any attempt at emotional sincerity was bound to fail, and the most entertaining epics are those that simply revel in their breathtaking grandiosity. Still, Ben-Hur contains much to enthral us, and in one respect shows the superiority of the vertically-integrated studio system. Although the system's glory days were over, the studios could still be trusted to bring together a tight and professional creative team who could all work towards the same goal. Perhaps the most poignant thing about Ben-Hur is that it is one of that system's final triumphs."

I almost don't see any reason to pursue any other adaptation of the tale, because I can't imagine it being done more skillfully than it is here. While this is clearly a film for and about Christianity, it is not a requirement to believe, or for your faith to be directed towards that particular religion, to enjoy and appreciate it. The themes and moral are broad enough, and I think anyone can get quite a lot out of a viewing, or several. At no less than three and a half hours, this is well-paced, and is rather exciting when it intends to be. The famous and often referenced chariot race scene is impeccably well-done, intense and convincing. Heston nails the role, and the acting is in general spot-on. Dialog is excellently written and perfectly delivered, with good points that you can apply elsewhere. The plot is interesting and engaging, and develops nicely throughout. This has an epic scope, with massive sets, countless extras and a grand score. The production values leave absolutely nothing to be desired.

","As a devout Christian I did appreciate the story taking place adjacent to the life of Christ and the interaction between him and the characters.

The story is bar-none on par with some of Shakespeare's finest and the great literary classics of our time.<br/><br/>The visuals, be they cheap compared to today's standards, are amazing. Sure some of them were miniatures, but many of them were on such a grand scale that seems to be lost in today's modern movies. It wasn't CG, it wasn't completely chock full of real-live locations, and yet it was so believable. This was a Fifty-year-old feast for the senses that hasn't gone bad after all this time. Aged like a fine wine, this film is all the more spectacular the more movies delve into the shock and awe factor of computers and wide shots, as a testament to what people could achieve over half a century ago.<br/><br/>This film, to make a bad joke, is one of Biblical proportions.

","This is quite possible one of the best movies made about Christ. Although Ben Hur is the main character there is quite a lot about the mythology of Christ in this movie.

However, the story is very interesting and Charlton Heston does a great job, just like he does in ""The Planet of the Apes"". Some plot elements are perhaps a bit primitive but the good thing about this movie is the way the viewer can identify with the feelings of the main character.

","""Ben-Hur"" isn't really a film about Jesus, or rather it's a film in which Jesus is the main character, but he's never seen except in partial glimpses, never heard. Rather he is the character around whom the life and fortunes of the Jewish prince, Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston) revolves, though he doesn't know it until quite late in the film.<br/><br/>I haven't read the 1880 novel by General Lew Wallace, nor have I seen either the 1907 1-reeler or the 1925 Fred Niblo version, also a long and expensive epic. But William Wyler's film is fascinating to me in part because of this absence of Jesus - and the absence of religion from much of Ben Hur's life in the film, though not from his thoughts. The basic story is really quite simple: Ben Hur's childhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) returns to Judeah after years in Rome, now a tribune and second in command to the military governor or prefect. Though the two seem overjoyed to see each other we quickly learn that Messala both have ulterior motives in renewing their friendship - Messala to help crush opposition through Ben Hur's help, and the Jewish prince to accomplish the exact opposite. This is not a friendship made to last. In short order, Ben Hur is accused of a crime he didn't commit and sent to the galleys; after years of rowing in chains, he saves the life of a Roman consul during a naval battle, for which he is freed and eventually becomes the consul's adoptive son, all the while earning a name for himself as the greatest charioteer in Rome. But his heart belongs to his homeland, and as quickly as he can he returns to take vengeance on Messala, who has also imprisoned his mother and daughter. Messala, also a great chariot driver, will eventually face him in the justly famed chariot race where no rules apply and each man plans to seek the other's death. This 9-minute action sequence really is as thrilling as I remembered it from years ago and is deserving of all the praise it gets; it has a ""real time"" you-are-there feel to it that I've never seen in any other historical epic.<br/><br/>But in the background is always the young rabbi, roughly the same age as Ben Hur, who gave the then-slave a drink of water as he was about to be shipped off to the galleys, and who the now-freed son of both Rome and Judeah feels compelled to offer the same favor as the Crucifixion draws nigh. Jesus appears in long-shot or in partial view for perhaps 5-10 minutes out of the 3 1/2 hour running time here, but his presence lingers throughout; the biggest problem I had with the film, in fact, was in the last half hour as the rather cheesy-looking scene on Cavalry translates is intercut with the healing of Ben Hur's now-leprous mother and sister and his own conversion - it all seems to obvious and simplistic; but I guess that for a believer it must work. Too, it seems that Ben Hur is able to have his cake and eat it too: achieving his vengeance, getting his fortune and family back, finding the love of the onetime slave girl who had been promised to another. Sure, he suffered, but at the end his worldly happiness seems more obvious than any spiritual redemption.<br/><br/>This isn't a huge flaw for me, however, as I realize how difficult such a dramatization is, and in particular when filmed by believing Jews and Christians and intended for an audience that had not yet tired of such simple homilies and the grand scale that the film does, at least, still impress with. The acting is all pretty much what one expects in such a thing - lots of declamations and stagy, overly dramatic glances, hands thrown up at the site of lepers, etc. The photography is quite beautiful if completely unrealistic - this never really looks like the holy land, never really even looks like the real world, with a lot of dreamy overlit closeups, deep shadows when deemed dramatically necessary, interior lighting that is sometimes indistinguishable from exteriors -- none of it matters really, if you accept that this is ""big scale Hollywood Biblical melodrama"" and look at it in terms of its success as a genre piece. I like a lot of the actors in smaller roles, particularly Frank Thring as a somewhat sympathetic, realistic Pontius Pilate whose words of wisdom Ben Hur rejects in one of the best scenes in a film that is really dominated by intimate character interludes despite its reputation for spectacle.<br/><br/>On the whole, it works for me, Wyler is a fluid enough storyteller to keep things moving despite the immense length and the extremely wide format is rarely a distraction, if rarely necessary either. It's easy to see why this was such an immense hit, earning the equivalent of over $700 million today theatrically; it's also to see why it marked the peak of the genre and why it all went downhill rather quickly, as it was such a grueling production that few filmmakers would want to tackle such a thing again even with the potential of very large returns. By 1966 or so (John Huston's ""The Bible"") the genre was effectively dead, at least on such a large scale."

","Possibly the most sweeping epic ever to hit the screen, the 1959 ""Ben-Hur"" came by its 11 Oscars and 12 nominations honestly. It's truly a magnificent film, beautifully acted and directed by William Wyler.<br/><br/>While working on the film, Wyler informed Charlton Heston that his performance wasn't good enough. When Heston asked what he could do, Wyler said, ""I don't know, but you have to do better."" He did. A controversial figure in real life, Heston nonetheless handed in some excellent performances in his reel life. This is his best, and he's matched by Stephen Boyd, an Irish actor who died too young. Other actors in the film include Sam Jaffe, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, and Cathy O'Donnell.<br/><br/>I'm not going to re-tell the story, just say that the spectacle of Ben-Hur is overwhelming, particularly the chariot race and the battle at sea. I consider myself a spiritual person, so needless to say, I found the story extremely moving, particularly the last hour.<br/><br/>Exquisitely scored by Miklos Rosza, magnificently photographed and acted, perfectly directed by Wyler, with the chariot sequences directed by Yakima Canutt, and a sweeping story, ""Ben-Hur"" is not to be missed, especially around Easter, when its story of forgiveness and redemption is a perfect fit for the holiday."

The direction, the photography,the storyline and everything else about this movie are cinematic achievements and no other movie could ever come close to the standards set by this one. The chariot race shown in this movie and the crucifixion of Jesus in the grand finale will forever be etched in our hearts and minds. This movie undoubtedly was made with a missionary zeal. Watching the last scene where Jesus is put on trial, sentenced and then paraded through the streets is a hair rising experience. The decadence of Roman times and Christ's message of universal love are sharply contrasted against each other. The music adds to the thrilling effect and the sets created for this movie truly take you back about 2000 years. To consider that all of this was done without the aid of any computer or graphics is even more unbelievable and should be a humbling experience to all the present day movie makers."

I always say that good music in a movie can make even a mediocre film good, and the music in this film is inspiring, haunting but at the same time beautiful. The script is dynamic, the acting superb and the gentle love and kindness of Jesus is contrasted nicely with the cold and callous times of Roman domination. The horror of leprosy is startlingly portrayed as the audience is mercilessly dealt a strong dose of Roman cruelty through the machinations of Messala (Stephen Boyd). The battle at sea is mesmerizing and thrilling and the chariot race is heart-stopping action rendering you breathless (especially on a big screen in the theatre). The bond of family is warmly told through a son's love for his sister and mother. The love of loyal friends and romantic love is also beautifully portrayed giving rise to the great musical love theme. Ben-Hur is adopted as the Roman Consul's son (played by Jack Hawkins) after saving his life in a sea battle with Macedonian pirates, giving rise to one of the many great lines in the movie - ""In his eagerness to save you, 41, your God has also saved the Roman fleet."" The sets are stupendous and the colour cinematography is astounding. They just don't make films like this anymore because they don't know how to and they simply can't afford it.

","These Biblical epics were a real part of my childhood. If it wasn't ""The Robe"" it was ""The Ten Commandments"" or ""The Greatest Story Ever Told."" This, of course, is based on the novel by Lew Wallace. It involves a clash between cultures in the Biblical sense. The Romans are the bad guys because they are like us. The downtrodden, eventual followers of Christ, are the victims. Judah Ben Hur finds himself in the middle, confronting his demons and attempting to save his family. The story is pretty slow moving. As a young person, I thought it was endless, but have since gained more of an appreciation for it. There is a lot of action, especially the celebrated chariot race. One of the more interesting portrayals is of the leper colony. Lepers were always talked about in Sunday school, but we never really understood what this was. Seeing food left at the entrances of caves made quite an impression on my young soul. I guess I recommend this because of its grand purpose and wonderful storytelling.

","I was particularly interested in the way the director, William Wyler, graphically depicted leprosy during the time of Christ and the affect it had on the people. Judah Ben Hur's mother, Miriam, and his sister, Tirzah, were imprisoned and found four years later having advanced cases of leprosy. They were let go and outcast to a leper colony, which was a deserted rock quarry with many caves. The unaffected citizenry feared the disease and avoided anyone who had it. The residents of the colony were fed by lowering food from the rim of the quarry.<br/><br/>Leprosy, also known as Hansen's disease, is an infectious disease caused by the Mycobacterium lepta bacterium that can lead to desecration of the body or skin. The modern term for the disease is named after the discoverer of the bacterium, Gerhard Armauer Hansen.<br/><br/>Today, there are cures for this disease and it's effects have been reduced. For most people, a six month course of tablets for the milder form of leprosy and two years for the more severe form will cure them of the disease. However, for those who suffer a disabling reaction caused by the build-up of dead bacilli in the body, additional steroid treatment is given. According to recent figures from the World Health Organization (WHO), there has been a decreasing occurrence of new cases by 21% from 2003 to 2004, or approximately 107,000 cases.

I saw this at the cinema on countless occasions as a child, a teenager , a young adult and middle-age on TV and each time ,as I grew older, I derived different areas of pleasure from it. but every time I weep buckets. I am aware that some people hate Ben-Hur, but why really escapes me. It is film making at its best. The idea of someone remaking this intrigues me though and the idea of perhaps Guy Pearce as Judah and Russell Crowe as Messalah directed by Peter Jackson or Ridley Scott has a fascination for me.

","This was indeed a very powerful and moving picture.I loved the parts,when Jesus gave water to Ben Hur,and the solider who saw this,back away from Jesus.I myself rated it 8 instead of 10.Some things should have been corrected in the movie.The scene in the beginning with Messala and Sextus,when they were discussing,people who were drunk with religion,by smashing the statues of their gods.As usual it was not mentioned in a biblical film,that God had wrote The Ten Commandments,and such talk about gods would go against His 1st Commandments,as far the statues mentioned of their gods,that itself goes against God's 2nd Commandment.But more so as stated in Exodus 20,The Lord Your God is a Jealous God.Another scene was with Messala & Ben Hur.The glory of Solomon is gone,Joshua Will not rise to save you nor David.Ironic that Moses is not mentioned as everyone knows he was God's Lawgiver.Or about the parade in which Ben Hur was in after his freedom was regained,up the top on his throne was The Divine Emperor.I find it most sad that even in biblical movies,that God's Ten Commandments are rarely mentioned,but when there are parades that honor those who have achieved greatness,it should be rightfully so.But God himself has far more achieved,much more than greatness.If there is a parade and a Divine Emperor is looking down at thousands then there should be a parade for The Ultimate Supreme King Of His Universe,The Almighty God,looking down from His Kingdom to countless people paying tribute and Honor to God.The bible says put your banners up for God,and even in biblical movies they don't do this,it would be Supremely Special if a biblical had a parade for God,and displaying His Ten Commandments it maybe wishful thinking on my part,but I pray the day comes when people hosts parades,and honor God is such ways that have never been done,I will never understand why God's Ten Commandments are hardly mentioned in religious movies."
"FloatingOpera7","10","0","2","15 April 2006"," For Easter Watch Ben Hur: A Tale Of The Christ Starring Charlton Heston
","Ben-Hur (1959): Starring Charlton Heston, Stephen Boyd, Haya Harareet, Jack Hawkins, Hugh Griffith, Martha Scott, Cathy O'Donnell, Sam Jaffe, Frank Thring, Terence Longdon... Director William Wyler, Based On The Novel By Lew Wallace, Screenplay Karl Tunberg. For me, the brilliant Director William Wyler's 1959 epic film ""Ben Hur"" which followed the success of The Ten Commandments is the greatest Easter/Passion of the Christ film ever made. It is not only a great film about the period of The Gospels- Roman-occupied ancient Judea during the reign of Emperor Augustus Caesar, but a well-made film for its own sake, adapted from a successful novel and play with thrilling elements of adventure, drama and spiritual redemption. Charlton Heston had previously portrayed Moses in 1957 and immediately followed that role with the role of Prince Judah Ben-Hur, another great role tailor made for his blend of rugged masculinity and peaceful spirituality. He is betrayed by his best friend Messala (Stephen Boyd) an ambitious lord who usurps his position a la Count of Monte Cristo. He sends Ben-Hur to a slave ship where he is forced to row with the slaves. There's a shipwreck and he saves the life of an important Roman senator, Quintus Arrius (Jack Hawkins) who rewards him by granting him his title. In Judea, Ben Hur and Massala meet once again. But this time, things have changed. Jesus is preaching the Gospels and healing the sick, raising the dead and all that good stuff. The beautiful Jewish lady Esther (Martha Scott) comes into Ben-Hur's life. She has a sick mother and aunt Esther and Miriam who are stricken with leprosy and therefore are outcasts. Ben-Hur learns that the true meaning of life is in serving God and that there is no genuine happiness in material wealth and positions of power. Jesus Christ is Crucified and his blood heals Miriam and Esther. More importantly, Ben-Hur is redeemed and transformed from an ambitious and non-spiritual man to one who will devote his life to God and to living a better life. This film is a gorgeous work of cinematic art, the kind of Panavision epic that later films would emulate (Anthony Mann's Le Cid, Fall of The Roman Empire, Kubrick's Spartacus, etc. The costumes are accurate to the period, the natural surroundings of Judea and Rome are well-depicted. Of course, this film will always be remembered for the grand Chariot Race between Massala and Ben-Hur. The Oscar winning music is bombastic (though not as much as Ten Commandments) and works effectively for this drama. The world of Christ's Judea has never before been more romantically yet realistically portrayed. The Crucifixion is a bloodless affair, all we see is Jesus' back on the Cross. It emphasizes the glory of the Resurrection even without showing him as a Risen Savior. I much prefer to see this timeless classic than Mel Gibson's controversial and disgusting, violent Passion of the Christ. Enjoy Ben-Hur this Easter! I wish ABC would also show this film for Easter. It is a popular feature film on American Movie Classics and Turner Movie Classics. This is one of the top films made in the 20th century, along with similarly ""grand"" films like Gone With The Wind, Lawrence of Arabia, Doctor Zhivago, The Bible In The Beginning, The Greatest Story Ever Told, etc."
"MOscarbradley","7","0","2","6 April 2006"," The most prestigious of prestigious epics
","William Wyler is probably the greatest Hollywood director ever to have fallen out of fashion. Winner of three Oscars as Best Director he made some of the most prestigious studio films of the thirties, forties and fifties but they are now largely ignored in favour of smaller, grittier movies from the likes of Nicholas Ray and Samuel Fuller and other of the 'B Diectors'. But a look back at the best of Wyler's work, (""Dodsworth"", ""The Letter"", ""The Heiress"", ""Carrie"", ""Friendly Persuasion""), should ensure his place in the canon of great directors.<br/><br/>""Ben-Hur"" isn't in the league of any of the above but at the time of its release it was seen as the most prestigious of prestigious studio pictures, an epic as significant for its day as ""Gone with the Wind"" and like ""Gone with the Wind"" it chalked up a record number of Oscars, (it won every Oscar for which it was nominated with the exception of Best Screenplay). It was conceived and executed on a scale unimaginable today and it goes on forever, (well, for close on four hours anyway), but then it has everything; sea battles, leprosy, Christ, (and the Crucifixion), and a chariot race that remains unequaled of its kind, certainly in the annals of action cinema, (though the direction of this great sequence is credited now, not to Wyler, but largely to the second-unit director and former stunt-man Yakima Canutt).<br/><br/>In the title role Charlton Heston stuck out his noble jaw once too often. His idea of acting is to crunch up his face and bare his teeth. He's like a horse in the process of being broken. Stephen Boyd's black-hearted Messala is by far the more interesting character, (nobility is such a bore), and Boyd plays him superbly emphasizing the homo-erotic bond between the two men, something evident to everyone except apparently to Heston who was oblivious as to Messala's interest in him, (about the only thing in the script, on which many writers worked, in which Gore Vidal's influence might be found). The other great performance is by the Welsh character actor Hugh Griffith as Sheik Ibderim. He isn't in the film long enough but he steals every scene he's in. You can see a real actor's love of acting in his wily old face and he was awarded the Oscar.<br/><br/>Of course, there is nothing Wyler, or probably anyone else, could do about the banal religiosity, the miracles and the platitudes though he could have censured Miklos Rozsa's Godawful score which accompanies them. Seeing the film now it is obvious Wyler was not the man for the job. His best films are interior pictures, character studies where the dramas are played out in enclosed spaces. Even in ""The Big Country"" it is not the vastness of the plains we remember but the dark, interior secrets of the people who inhabit them. Of course to say that ""Ben-Hur"" could just as easily have been directed by any superior craftsman is, perhaps, to do it and Wyler an injustice. It's a more tightly controlled epic than most, made up of a series of short scenes that carry the story along. This is what signifies it as a Wyler picture. It may be far from his best work but it certainly is no disgrace."

But it is exactly not the tale of the Christ: - The true story of the Christ is even more thrilling - I mean not only for Christians. Ben Hur is an adventurous story of course, including everything what an adventure-opera needs, but yet everything with the endeavour to reach out for reality (not comparable to so many Italian-sandal-films of the sixties) As for the showing of Christ in the film I found it an ingenious idea to show him only from behind and completely silent (there is no need to let Him talk -His words are original in the Bible). Great is the scene for example where Christ opposes the centurion without saying a word, after he gave water to the thirsty galley-slave Ben Hur. To stand in front of Christ and look into his eyes seems to be too much to stand for an ordinairy-sinful human. The film is bombastic, but nevertheless with delicate, distinguished, subtile undertones. This is no contradiction. I warmly recommend this film which displays the tragedy of the fragility of human life. But as well how it can be overcome. A great message."

"al-eaton","10","0","2","18 March 2006"," History versus Hollywood
","There is no doubt that BEN HUR is a superb achievement in movie making. It is deeply moving (esspecially Miklos Rozsa's magnificent musical score), beautifully photographed and well directed/acted. I think it correctly explores the culture of a dictatorship versus an enslaved people. For certain dramatic purposes, it changes the thrust of Wallace's novel. In the novel, Messala does not die in the chariot race, but is only crippled. Ben-Hur becomes a true Christian by bringing the invalid Messala to view the crucifixion and Messala converts. The theme is that forgiveness triumphs over revenge. The movie changes this in Messala's death scene where the Roman dies still hating his old boyhood friend. No redemption for Messasla, only for Ben-Hur. The original idea is portrayed in the new animated version, with Heston recreating his original role. Secondly, and most importantly, Wyler's movie changes history. It begins with a title card stating that the time is AD 26. We learn from Messala that V. Gratus is arriving in Jerusalem as the NEW Prefect. Five years later, after Ben-Hur returns to Jerusalem from Rome, Gratus leaves and Pilate arrives, just prior to Jesus' trial. (In the film, Ben-Hur is introduced to Pilate at Arrius' party where we learn that Pilate is the newly appointed Governor of Judaea, thus reinforcing the historical error.) In actual history, Pilate ARRIVES in Jerusalem in AD 26; Gratus was Prefect from 15-26 and Pilate from 26-36. Thus Wyler and his writers (while getting a true feeling for the cultural setting) have created their own history to serve their own dramatic purposes. I know some would call this nit-picking (and it was not the first, nor is it the last, movie to adjust history for the sake of a good story), so you have to accept the film as it is: good, solid entertainment with a somewhat fickle regard for history. Note: the new, 4-disc DVD release is the best so far. The film is split onto 2 discs. The original aspect ratio is truer than other DVD/video releases, and the sound has been beautifully recorded. Also, the 1925 silent version is included on a separate disc."

I would like to give it a smashing 10 out of 10, but I settle for 9 out of 10, since the famous race scene is way too long in my opinion, and there are also two things, which bother me. First of all, in the book, Arrius dies before Judah leaves him, but in the movie, he still seems to be alive. I would prefer it if Arrius would have died in the movie too, instead of Judah giving him his ring back. I suspect he got it back one way or the other, but still! And also, I think the love story between Judah and Esther should have started way before it did, so that she never was supposed to get married to someone else. But in the book, (Okay, I haven't read the novel, except a comic book version, but I have browsed through the novel, and the comic book version is more true to the novel than this movie), Judah doesn't think about Esther that way before he returns from his years on the galleys. But still, the length of the race scene is still the main reason why this movie gets a 9 out of 10 instead of a full 10."

In fact, if it wasn't for Mr. Boyd, this movie would have run out of steam and become just another overblown Hollywood biblical epic. Another wonderful performance is that of Jack Hawkins as the Roman proconsul who is saved by Ben Hur and ultimately adopts Ben Hur, which allows Ben Hur to return to Judea to search for his mother and sister, who Messala had imprisoned out of sheer spite for Ben Hur. Of course, this movie contains two classic moments: first, when Ben Hur returns to Judea as the Roman proconsul's adopted son and in one of the greatest scenes in movie history confronts Messala and demands to know the whereabouts of his mother and sister; and second, the chariot race where Ben Hur, wearing the Star of David and now hero of the people, defeats Messala.

","The epic by which all others are judged,it remains one of the best films of all time.After having a falling out over Roman rule about to be imposed in ancient Judea,ex friends Roman Messala and Jewish Ben hur become bitter enemies.Set during the time of Christ, it concerns one mans encounter with Him and the impact it will have on the rest of. his life.The acting is first rate with Heston at his best. Steven Boyd is also fine as his nemesis,and Jack Hawkins shines as naval commander Quintus Arias the cynical yet likable Roman who has an offer for Ben Hur while he is imprisoned as a galley slave.The movie has a pro religious and positive Christian point of view that may be considered controversial in todays ultra liberal Hollywood where sex and graphic violence are the norm. Also its three and a half hour running time may put off short attention span viewers.Made for a record 15 million dollars-in 1959 money the colossal scope of this movie looks like twenty times that much. The musical score is so good it can stand on its own.For sheer screen majesty,what can top the chariot parade in the arena before the big race-especially the Ariel shots of the racers with the titanic head of the statue of Jupiter in the foreground. Then there's the race itself.Arguably the most famous sequence in movie history it has been imitated often -Star Wars The Phantom Menace as the pod race but never equaled. All the more impressive because what you are seeing is real. No CGI or green screen FX here.To give any more of it away will not be fair to you. I have seen it many times on TV and video, but I really saw it for the first time when I saw it on the big screen at the Loews Jersey theater ,a restored movie palace in Jersey City NJ. It was a film that I never will forget. Try to see it on a big screenDefines the term ""epic"". Monmunental entertainment."

","I had to rate this film a 9 (extremely high from me!). This despite the fact the I consider the films biggest star a poor actor. Charlton Heston (the aforementioned poor actor) stars as Judah Ben Hur, a wealthy and powerful Jewish prince and merchant in first century (AD) Rome. When his old boyhood friend comes to power as governor, the two find that they are more or less polar opposites now. Eventually, Ben Hur is enslaved and his entire family thrown in prison. Ben Hur manages to battle his way back and eventually becomes a star in the arena. The climactic scene in the film is the big chariot race. I recall a persistent rumor that circulated for years after this film's release that someone had died during the filming of the legendary chariot race, but no one did. In fact, there were no serious injuries either. This film was the first to win 11 Academy Awards, though not the last. It certainly deserved each one of them. This film is a true classic and has stood the test of time. Excellent!"

"marcin_kukuczka","10","0","2","18 September 2004"," One of the BEST movies ever made BUT better than 1925 version???
","The 1959 version of Ben Hur is, probably, the most famous of all Hollywood greatest productions. It is so because of so many Oscars that this movie got. Indeed, it is a classic. I have seen it 4 times and dream to see it at least once again.<br/><br/>Almost everything is perfect in the movie. Photography, cast, filming locations, music, visual effects... However, there are two factors that I would like to concentrate on because I consider them significant to share with readers. It is the choice of Stephen Boyd as Messala and some lack of originality in some scenes and their striking similarity to another version of BEN HUR.<br/><br/>The reference to my comparison is the 1925 silent version by Fred Niblo, the most expensive silent film ever made, and, I think, one of the best silents, appreciated even today, 80 years later, by a number of people. Comparing Stephen Boyd's interpretation of cruel Messala to Francis X.Bushman's in the silent movie proves a huge discrepancy. They are so different that there are only deeds (according to the book) and the name that make them one character. Stephen Boyd did not show Messala's antisemitism so well as Mr Bushman did. Bushman seems to have been, for me personally, a better choice for Messala. His nose and height make him a more stereotypical Roman. All other cast are similar, equally good in both versions. I love the performance of Charlton Heston (maybe even better than Ramon Novarro in 1925), famous for biblical epics of the 1950s and 1960s. Haya Harareet also gives a memorable performance as Esther, and Jack Hawkins is absolutely great as Quintus Arius.<br/><br/>Another striking factor that needs to be noticed is that there are a lot of scenes in this version of Ben Hur that almost ""copy"" the 1925 version. The sea battle, chariot race (equally gorgeous), and the moments with Jesus are SIMILAR! But it does not mean that they are worse in this version. What I want to stress is that both versions have much in common in their images.<br/><br/>Not to bore you with so much comparison with 1925 version, indeed, this version of Ben Hur is great. Of course it deserves the awards due to the great story, and other factors that I enumerated before. However, I would recommend everyone to see both versions and not to be afraid to compare them. Perhaps, someone will infer that they could make an equal masterpiece 80 years ago... I do recommend you to see both versions."

The sights and sounds of a world 2,000 years gone by appeared to be as real as anything filmed in the present. <br/><br/> From the opening act to the surprising and stunning chariot race at the climax, it was as if I were reading a book that I simply could not put down!

","I've always loved this film, but I recently realized a longtime dream come true by finally getting to see it on the big screen at a revival in New York City. How do you even attempt to write mere words to express how deeply you feel about a motion picture which you've singled out to be literally the one Greatest Film Of All Time? It's not easy.<br/><br/>This larger than life epic begins as rich Jewish Prince Judah Ben-Hur (Charlton Heston, in a deserved Academy Award winning portrayal) reunites with his Roman boyhood friend Messala (Stephen Boyd), who Judah has learned has become second in command to the new governor in the conquest of Judah's own homeland, Judea. Their pleasantly emotional reunion takes a turn for the worst when it is learned that Messala is trying to convince Ben-Hur to act against his own people by turning over the names of his fellow brothers who are speaking out against the new regime. Through a series of events, a dejected Messala falsely arrests Judah for a crime he didn't commit and sentences him to die in the galleys as a condemned slave. But Judah tries to stay alive long enough to return for vengeance, ultimately challenging Messala in the action-filled chariot race, which is still possibly THE most awesome spectacle ever put onto celluloid. Along his way, Judah periodically crosses paths with Jesus Christ who begins to have a profound affect on his life and his sensibilities.<br/><br/>That very brief summarization in no way does this masterpiece justice, but is just a general idea of the basic story. I find BEN-HUR to be impeccably directed by William Wyler, a man who was known to drive his actors very hard to the point of exhaustion in order to get the very best performances. His efforts show themselves powerfully in each and every frame of this three and a half hour experience, which is also an accomplishment in that it doesn't feel anywhere near that long. This is a highly emotional film for the senses, which covers a plethora of feelings -- the struggle between good and evil; the thin line drawn between love and hate; the destructive outcomes fueled by anger and personal vendettas; the power of spirituality; the glory of forgiveness; the salvation of the heart; the hope for tomorrow.<br/><br/>Beautifully underlining each and every heart-touching moment is the magnificent award-winning musical score by Miklos Rozsa, one of the most uplifting ever heard. Every actor gives his all to the movie, and that includes not only Heston but Stephen Boyd as well, who is flawless in his villainous part as the evil Tribune who is so obsessed with power and so hurt by rejection that he is almost not to blame for his cruel actions. Jack Hawkins is superb as Arrius, a senior Roman Commander on Ben-Hur's slave ship who admires the younger man's fortitude. Hugh Griffith is a joy as the humorous Sheik Ilderim (he also won an Oscar), and the often-underrated Haya Harareet is genuinely touching in all of her scenes.<br/><br/>This is what's missing from the majority of cinema today (and has been for a long time). A film the likes of which we never see anymore, one which arouses every fiber of your being and speaks to your soul. Moments of this film are so deeply emotional, I cry. A truly excellent and inspirational motion picture by which all others might be judged. Uncontestable winner of 11 Academy Awards. **** out of ****"

","Such classics as Ben Hur, Spartacus and Quo Vadis are in a league of their own and cannot be in any way compared to modern movies such as Gladiator and Troy. Ben Hur is a deep movie and represents the human spirit and hope to overcome adversity. It is a movie about love conquering hate and betrayal. Its religious undertones are convincing and even the atheist such as myself can identify with the message of the value of human decency, understanding and love for others. It is very much a movie about being brave and doing what is right. If you had to send a spaceship to another galaxy and send our legacy out into space, then I would choose to place this movie on board the probe, and perhaps the story of Spartacus. Perhaps I would include a humorous movie and the Star Wars movies also to make the cargo complete and tell others who we were."

","Watching a film like this and ""The Ten Commandments"", it's easy to see why Kirk Douglas had Charlton Heston in mind when he spoke about actors famous for playing heroes who must have really believed that heroes existed.<br/><br/>A few years after he scored a bulls eye with ""The Ten Commandments"", Charlton Heston plays the title character, Judah Ben-Hur, a Jewish Prince enslaved by Masala (Stephen Boyd), the very man who was his best friend when they were children. In addition to enslaving Ben (Heston), Masala breaks up Ben's family and imprisons his mother and sister. After enduring years of pain and punishment, Ben is freed by Roman General Jack Hawkins for saving his life at sea, becomes his chariot racer and surrogate son, and is later freed to do what he will. Along with acquiring a girlfriend, Ben tracks down Masala and threatens to to beat the crap out of him if he doesn't release his family and if they're dead, then he's as good as gone. When they find that his mom and sis have the plague, his girlfriend lies to him and tells him that they're dead and that his mom's last words were to get on with life because they don't want him to see what they've become. But Ben is mad and does the only thing an angry man can do: he destroys his friend-come-enemy Masala in the chariot race, only to regret slaying him later, especially after Masala tells him his mom and sis are actually still alive.<br/><br/>
After tracking them down and struggling with lots of conflicting feelings, Ben's mom and sis are cured by the Lord and they live as happily ever after as possible during this particular era, as it happens to be the time of Christ's death and resurrection.<br/><br/>This ranks with ""The Ten Commandments"" as being one of Heston's best films. Once again, Heston is right at home in this giant epic and his chiseled in stone features, physique, deep voice and dignity are utilized to great effect. Despite his lack of scren time, Boyd is a strong foil to Heston, who dominates almost every scene he's in. Plus everything surrounding Heston and the cast is great: beautiful sets, well designed costumes and the spectacular chariot race. This one deserves its place in the pantheon of Hollywood classics."

Ben Hur, is absolutely the greatest movie I've ever seen! The story of Judah Ben Hur, and the life of Christ is absolutely moving. This is one of the only movies that have made me cry. Not tears of Sadness, but of joy. Judah's run in with Jesus left me almost trembling. As corny as it sounds, this movie really moved me. I think that there is no doubt that this is Charlton Heston's greatest role! Aside from the run ins with Jesus, there is the widely known chariot race that left me on edge, and the sea battle scene, where Ben Hur is enslaved on a ship, along with about a hundred other slaves rowing it along the sea. Although the movie is tied with LORD OF THE RINGS, and TITANIC for most Acadamy Awards won on a movie, I think this is by far the greatest of the three."

","There are many parallels between Ben-Hur and Lord of the Rings (let's take ""Return of the King"", for the sake of the argument). The obvious one is that they're both ridiculously long. I mean, wouldn't you rather watch 30 less minutes of Charlton Heston's over-the-top theatrics? Even then Ben-Hur would top 3 hours and be considered an overly long epic.<br/><br/>   Another thing is that both flicks won 11 Oscars and I'm pretty sure neither deserved that many. I mean, Heston won an Academy Award for THAT? And LOTR's clean sweep obviously happened because the first two were not taken seriously enough by the Academy. I didn't see how ""Return of the King"" was better (or worse, for that matter) than the first two. Perhaps there's a rule that every movie over 3 hours has to win Best Picture and a bucketload of other Oscars- see also Titanic, Schindler's List, Dances With Wolves, Gandhi... I'm sure there are many many more. OK, that's enough ranting for now. Apart from the always unintentionally funny Heston, the performances are good. I especially liked Stephen Boyd as Messala. The chariot race sequence was fantastic and the ending would appeal to every Christian on the face of the Earth. As an Atheist, I just found it chuckle-worthy. In a nutshell, if you have nothing to do for a whole day and don't mind Charlton Heston, you see this. It's pretty good although a little overpraised."

Charlton Heston plays the roll of a lifetime as Judah Ben-Hur, a persecuted Jewish Aristocrat, condemned to the gallows for a crime for which he was innocent by his childhood Roman friend, Messalah. The intermingling of his life and times with that of Jesus is done in a most interesting fashion and gives a message of hope and faith to those who watch it.  The special effects are spectacular considering the time period (1959)in which this movie was made.  The chariot race is still thrilling to watch and 1st rate.  Some critics downgrade this movie for being too long. I believe that it has to be long due to the lenghth of the story that is told.  To shorten it would leave out crucial elements of the story.  It is well delivered and the story-line flows well.  Charlton Heston will go down as the greatest Biblical actor of all times (he also was great playing Moses in ""The 10 Commandments"").

","I just got my first DVD player after holding out for year and have become a total convert. I am watching some of the old classics of my youth, both to see them again in mint condition and to have a look at all the special features, including the documentaries and commentaries. Presently I'm doing a festival of the great biblical epics of the 50's and 60's. My local video store had THE ROBE, (1953), BEN-HUR (1959), CLEOPATRA, (1963) and THE GREATST STORY EVER TOLD, (1965-let's call it TGSET). I thought I'd write a joint review comparing them.<br/><br/>THE ROBE was done at the tail end of the old Hollywood, a studio production whereas these others were all filmed primarily on location with the international casts and crews we often saw making movies in the later era. But THE ROBE has all the Hollywood know-how we've come to expect. Particularly important was the pacing. It's a history lesson and a reverent film but it's also an entertainment. Young Richard Burton, (he was about 28) shows the impressive voice and passionate style that made him a name actor in the next decade, (he was nominated for an Oscar). Jean Simmons is very good and the smaller parts are well cast, particularly Richard Boone as Pontius Pilate, who in one scene leaves much more of an impression than Frank Thring or Telly Savalas, who do the same role in BEN-HUR and TGSET, respectively.<br/><br/>But BEN-HUR is clearly the pick of the litter. This is true epic, full of glorious action scenes including the justly famous chariot race. But, as directed by William Wyler, it's also a very thoughtful film. Charlton Heston is excellent as the passionate and idealistic hero. Stephen Boyd is my all-time favorite movie villain. He's the one who should have won the supporting actor Oscar, not Hugh Griffith for his Arab businessman. But it's Wyler who carries the day. Noted primarily as a director of actors, (and especially actresses), he was by this stage in his carrier looking for challenges. He'd never directed an epic before. By bringing to the mix his sense for dialog and characterization, he gives this a depth you can't find in something directed by DeMille, for example, who was more a director of pageants than movies. Wyler's use of water as constant symbolism for cleaning the body and spirit is brilliant and memorable.<br/><br/>Joseph Mankiewicz was also known for making more intimate films than CLEOPATRA, (which is not quite biblical but close enough). Like Wyler, he brings to the project something a normal director of epics would not have and CLEOPATRA is a much more intimate film than I remembered. Sure there is the absurdly overdone entrance into Rome and the Battle of Actium. But most of the scenes take place indoors and look like a filmed record of a stage play. Both Burton and Rex Harrison are excellent in their roles and Liz Taylor is fine, (and fine looking), as well, although I agree with suggestions that Sophia Loren would have been a better choice being more obviously Mediterranean. Like Martin Landau and others interviewed, I would like to see some effort to restore, as best as possible, the two missing hours of this film and its presentation in the two parts Mankiewicz intended, perhaps on one of the movie channels. Even in its present form, the film is better than I remembered.<br/><br/>TGSET may be the greatest story every told but this is surely not the greatest telling of it. The film is long, s..l..o..w and mournful. It's like sitting through a three hour wake. The only scenes where anybody shows any joy are the resurrection scenes of Lazarus and Christ at the end. One scene is accompanied by the disciples singing the same mournful hymn over and over again. I don't think I would want to hang out with these guys for very long. The scenes in THE ROBE where Burton talks to the people who were touched by their relationship with Jesus and in BEN-HUR where he offers the hero water and where he is given it in return, are much more moving that Max Von Sydow's grim sermons in TGSET. We never see the results of living the way he suggests. And the miracle of resurrection seems an almost pointless substitute. If Jesus's soul has gone to join his father in Heaven, what difference does it make that his grave no longer holds his physical body?<br/><br/>TGSET is filmed not in the Holy Land but in the deserts of Arizona and Utah, (Christ's visit to Utah must have pleased the Mormons.) The place looks totally desolate, such that no one would ever want to live there. Indeed, the area was flooded by a damn project shortly after film was completed. Too bad they weren't doing NOAH'S ARK or the TEN COMMANDMENTS. The actors are totally dwarfed by the surrounding scenery. It makes them and their story look temporary, not everlasting. The eclectic cast with its all-star cameos was considered something of a joke in it's time. At the Last Supper, TV Land viewers can see Illya Kuryakin, Baretta and Klinger! And it's fun to see Ingmar Bergman's knight from 'THE SEVENTH SEAL doing scenes with Ed Wynn, Vaudeville's 'Perfect Fool'. <br/><br/>George Stevens is quoted as saying that someday, people viewing this film will not know who the actors were and will just see the characters. He's right. They all blend in together today. The performances are all very good, except for John Wayne's gargling of 'Truly, this man was the Son of God', which, as I recall, produced audible laughter in the theater in 1965 and still seems wildly inappropriate today. I remember feeling that Charlton Heston walked away with the film as John the Baptist and he still does four decades later. The acting isn't the problem with the film. It's the pace and the setting."

","Ben Hur is certainly a good film providing its dose of thrilling entertainment but suffers from a slow pace and a heavy-handed entanglement of 2 stories : a friendship that turns sour (the pugnacity of Ben Hur to remain faithful to his people and the resulting confrontation with his friend Messala who demands fealty) and an encounter with Jesus that will cure Ben Hur of his hate. The whole story looks therefore a bit shaky and even lame but remains highly enjoyable because the minor faults of the story-telling can be easily forgiven thanks to the magnificent tale of a passionate confrontation of two egos.<br/><br/>(SPOILERS)By far, the most interesting aspect of the movie is indeed the relation between Messala and Ben Hur and the evolution of Ben Hur 's character : the reunion between two old Friends gives rise to a quick misunderstanding and clash (the film suggestively implies that their friendship might before have been very close indeed) for apparent political reasons, Messala is piqued and also wants to use the punishment for his own political purpose. Messala knows that Ben Hur's family is not guilty nevertheless he sends Judah to the galleys and throws his mother and sister into prison. Ben Hur will go through hard times but "" Hate keeps a man alive"". He will hang on and will be able to take a spectacular revenge through the climactic action scene of the chariot race.<br/><br/>Like in a Greek tragedy someone will have to die, and that will appease the passions. And Messala is the victim not only of Ben Hur's revenge but of his own pretentions. Although Judah seems to be without regret, the death of Messala leaves him disenchanted. His noble love for his  family will then drive Ben-Hur to look for his leprous mother and sister. His lover Esther will be able to play the part of being Judah's former self and will reveal him his hardened heart. The film  ends with a triumphant re-birth of the human spirit. : Ben Hur's family will be physically healed and Ben Hur will be redeemed by the very man who gave him hope at the beginning of his harsh journey as a captive. : ""I felt his voice take this sword out of my head"". The film ends as it begins :  a testimony of Christ's power to change people's heart. <br/><br/>Unfortunately the development of characters sometimes lacks a sense of nuance : The unscrupulous Roman Messala versus the Noble Jewish prince nice to his family and even his slaves will be mercilessly condemned but because of his strong character and endless compassion, finds himself adopted by a Roman nobleman and will relentlessly pursue to avenge his lost liberty as well as  as the imprisonment of his mother and sister. Eventually Judah learns that love triumphs over hate, becoming a follower of Jesus. Too much of a good thing is not always better.<br/><br/>However I love this film: despite the fake film sets, the grandeur of Rome proves to be really believable. Despite the far-fetched story, the development of characters is rather fine. Though very pompous, the music is memorable and blends magicly with the pictures. The result is a blockbuster that looks a bit dated  but that can still captivate all your senses and mind.<br/><br/>TO SUM UP : THIS CAPTIVATING  STORY IS AN OVERBLOWN CLASSIC THAT BLENDS GREEK TRAGEDY WITH EVENTUAL RELIGIOUS GRACE.

This is Heston's greatest role, and the historical rendering of Christ's life and of life in this era is by far more accurate than any other file I've seen depicting Christ, despite the fact that this character is given the cameo treatment. The length of this film should not be a bias against seeing it, for the film is a visual and technical masterpiece. I admire the effort it took to create all of the scenery in this film, as well as the effort it took to assemble one of the largest casts in history (next to Stargate, to my recollection). To be honest, I sort of wish Heston was still appearing in films, but I suppose that I'll just have to live with it."

","This film ages well, and is still entertaining.  However, one can see the evolution of acting and it's improvement over the years.  Great script, excellent casting, and the chariot race is unbeatable.  This movie is spiritual, and the ending is spiritually motivating, leaving the viewer with a scene of hope and faith."
"cinemel","10","0","2","29 March 2001"," A classic of the epic genre that along with ""Gladiator"" should help revive films of the ancient world.
","When we imagine the epic film as a genre, 3 films immediately come to mind: The Ten Commandments, Spartacus and Ben-Hur. Of the three, Ben-Hur is probably the most honored. It won 11 Oscars including Best Picture, Actor (Heston), Supporting Actor (Hugh Griffith), and Director (William Wyler). The only Oscar it didn't win was for Screenplay (Karl Tunberg). The reason probably had something to do with the fact that several other authors, including Gore Vidal, had a hand in its re-writing. What makes Ben-Hur a great epic? First, the sweep of its locations and settings. Giant sets were constructed on the grounds of the great Cinecitta Studios in Rome. State of the art special effects enhanced the two great action sequences (the sea battle and the chariot race). Next, the larger than life performances of the principals brought to life these imagined characters of novelist, Lew Wallace. Stephen Boyd is perfect as the Roman centurion, Messala, who has returned to Judea (Israel) to assume his place as military leader anxious to suppress the Hebrews who are ruled by the Roman Empire. Boyd never again had a role to equal this. He was a fine match for Heston who embodies the princely Ben-Hur whose friend he was in their childhood. It is their enmity that lies at the core of this tale. The underlying story of Christ parallels the journey of Ben-Hur intersecting at two crucial points in the film. Wyler wisely does not show the face of Christ. Instead, he shows people's reactions to him. In one scene, a Roman soldier is trying to prevent Ben-Hur (now a prisoner) from drinking water. After Christ lets him drink the soldier tries to stop him (`I said no water for him'). His reaction to the hidden face of Christ is worth a thousand words. No discussion of Ben-Hur would be complete without mentioning the towering musical score composed and conducted by Miklos Rozsa (Academy Award).  Finally, it is many qualities such as this that give Ben-Hur the stature of more than just a sword and sandal epic, but transform it into a personal drama. Its characters are living, breathing beings swept into events that make for exciting cinema. Jack Hawkins is fine as the Roman general whose life Ben-Hur saves. Hugh Griffith earned his Oscar as the humorous Sheik Ilderim who supplies Hur with the Arabian steeds that he will race against Messala in the great circus of Jerusalem. It all comes down to the chariot race that is the center of the second half of the film. There are no special effects here. The race is real. Heston and Boyd actually drive the chariots in almost all the scenes. No doubt, the chariot race is one of the greatest actions sequences in any film.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur has just been released on DVD in a superb new transfer with a new Dolby Digital 5.1 soundtrack. The epic was filmed in Camera 65 an ultra-wide process that is almost completely revealed on this disc. The DVD also has a fine hour-long documentary about the making of the film. It would be something to see this classic projected on an IMAX screen. With the success of `Gladiator' someone in Hollywood should re-release the grand epics of the 50's and 60's in their original 70mm splendor. Ben-Hur could then be fully appreciated as the classic it is (one of AFI's greatest 100 films of the 20th century)."
"Penguin-18","Null","0","3","8 January 1999"," Best film ever!
","I have watched this movie about twenty times, and each time has been as rich and powerful as the first!  This film has impacted me more deeply than all the other religious epics combined.  Heston was a natural in this film and perfect for the part.  His ability to express anger, hate, peace, awe, and forgiveness all in the same film --- and to make it all believable --- is the work of a master actor.  The other actors were also superb.  The score of the picture added so much emotion to the film, and brought out the feelings in the story.  I'm not saying that ""Titanic"" wasn't a good movie, but in my opinion, it doesn't even come close to ""Ben-Hur!"""

"praagsigaar","10","0","3","23 February 2000"," One of the best
","One of the best movies ever made, be it the set design, lighting, camera work, story line, music, editing and, purposefully put in the last place, the acting. But that was the way they acted in those days. Out classes the also pretty good Cleopatra, Spartacus and 10 Commandments, they seem to suffer more under the search for drama than Ben Hur although, again seen through todays eyes, Ben Hur could just as well have done without the over acting. A Rembrant's painting as a movie."
"Steve-267","9","0","3","11 January 2000"," Boyd's/Heston's Best
","Stephen Boyd is awesome as the ultimate bad guy - one who would destroy a family for his own political purposes and show absolutely no remorse on his deathbed. Heston's best role - period. No movie sequence can match the chariot race. Nine out of ten."
"lawrence-14","10","0","3","28 November 1999"," One of the greatest movies ever made
","BEN-HUR of 1959 with Charlton Heston and Stephen Boyd, is one of the greatest movies ever made. There are few films which truly rival it's spectacle and spirit. As well as being one of the best movies ever, it also contains two classic cinema scenes; the slave gallery and the chariot scene. Heston (the title character) and Boyd (as his poisoned, one-time friend) are outstanding in one of cinema's legends."
"ChSarnes","10","0","2","8 June 1999"," The epic movie !
","Whatever you may think about religious epics, this masterpiece of Hollywood leads you out of your mind. It's one of those movies that create this I-am-inside-and-everything-out-of-it-doesn't-matter experience. In my opinion the chariot race is the most magnificent scene any film-maker has ever produced. If you ever get the chance to see this great film in a film theater, make sure you take it. When you then see the horses thundering through the arena, you will be very captured by it. James Cameron's Titanic cannot create this kind of emotion, though it is also a good film."
"Primtime","9","0","2","2 June 1999"," Triumphant story of a man in Christ's time
","This film absolutely dispelled any notions I may have had about it not being great. All I heard in the past from other critics were mainly negative comments about the film's pro-Christian message and at times sluggish pace. This film is a true masterpiece and of epic standards.<br/><br/>Charlton Heston gives a formidable performance in the title role. Could anyone have played it better? Highly unlikely. Heston's performance reminds me of his other great performance in ""The Ten Commandments"", powerful at most, however, showing compassion and a desire to help out his fellow man at other times. All supporting roles are played very well, including the spiteful Pontious Pilate. An interesting note to this film is the fact that the front of Jesus is never shown on camera. The audience only sees him from behind, perhaps because the filmmakers felt it unecessary to give any lines to a man who at many times was left unspoken.<br/><br/>Ben-Hur was a pleasure to watch, especially in its widescreen format. After all, the only way to watch the greatest moments captured on film (The Chariot Race ) is the way it was meant to be seen. Highly Recommended.<br/><br/>9/10 stars."
"Marko-21","10","0","2","20 April 1999"," My favorite movie
","I've seen lots of movies, but none of them are ever as exciting to me as Ben-Hur.  I could watch it a million times.  It's what I like with what I call ""Real People"".  They're not ""Card Board"", with no emotions, or just ""Action Figures"".  This movie also has plenty of action in it too."
"Mansilla","10","0","2","4 April 1999"," I was swept away
","Ben-Hur has always been my Grandad's Favourite film. Until recently I never really 'got' this film, only having seen it on TV.<br/><br/>I then got the opportunity to see this in its full 2.76:1 ratio from 70mm stock with proper, well maintained, 6 track mag sound on a Cinerama screen in Bradford, England. Never before have I been so totally swept away by a film. CG is great, but this is awesome. I saw Titanic on the same screen later, and its effects just paled in comparison. Obviously the Chariot Race is incredible, but the scale of this whole film is beyond belief. As The Emperor is greeted and the camera pans out over Rome all I could do was wonder at the Jaw-Dropping scale of it.<br/><br/>Just that would have been enough to justify this film to me, but the story was great too, and the performances of all involved masterful. However, this film loses all its magic on TV - Think about it, you are losing over half the picture when its shown 'pan and scan'.<br/><br/>This film is a genuine cinematic masterpiece. I think only having it rated at #84 (on 4 April '99) is unfair. It's certainly in my top 10. Go convince your local cinema to put it on, preferably in the original 70mm, and see it in its full glory."
"Eric-62","Null","0","3","2 April 1999"," A Masterpiece
","This is my favorite film and I think time has not dimmed its luster.  This is epic moviemaking at it's finest, when computer generated effects weren't needed to recreate the beauty and spectacle of something like the chariot race.  When you also have magnificent performances from a wonderful cast (Charlton Heston, three years after playing Moses, demonstrates why his epic roles were not a case of mere typecasting), a literate script (which properly should be credited to Christopher Fry) and the greatest musical score ever composed for a movie, the results can only add up to a masterpiece."
"Hurite","10","0","2","2 April 1999"," Always will be winner of most Oscars
","One must always remember, that in the time of Ben Hur and other Holywood legendary films, there were far fewer categories then there are today. Also, most of the multi winning movies of today are racking up ""filler"" Oscars-not like the heavy ones like best pic, or actor/actress.  I'm sure movies will win far beyond the record of 11, but look at the categories of Oscars then and now."
