","Having never played the game I didn't know much about what the plot was about but the games were big hits and popular enough to make a live action movie so I eventually gave it a watch and was very surprised, The story is very loyal to the games from what I seen in the games, Some nice action scenes and good effects, I didn't like the choice of actors but they did ok, As far as game to movies go it's probably one of the better ones, Even if it won't stand the test of time (No pun intended) I think maybe it could of been better if it wasn't made by Disney as they like to tone films down so much that if you're over the age of 11 it's not as enjoyable, But it could of been much worse so I can't complain too much, A good family film that is easy to watch even if you haven't played any of the games."
"OrinAGN","7","286","372","28 May 2010"," The sands have spread fairly thin and it shows... but surprisingly in a good way
","The common view amongst ""professional"" reviews is that the movie is average. scoring below 50% from Rotten Tomatoes, and MetaCritic, and notably a 2 out of 4 stars from Roger Ebert. The average user ranking on MC puts it at 9 out of 10.<br/><br/>Most reviews range anywhere from 8 out of 10, to as low as 2 or 3 out of 10.<br/><br/>If there's one thing critics can agree on, its that the movie is clichéd, borrowing elements from plenty of epics based in the Middle East and fantasy alike, and that it's loads of fun.<br/><br/>The one thing no one can agree on is whether that's good or bad.<br/><br/>It should be pointed out that this film is produced by the same company/studio that brought us 'Pirates of the Caribbean', and it certainly shows.<br/><br/>With that said, I'll lead into my thoughts on the film. The first ""Pirates"" scored on average a 7.8 - 6.4 of 10, while the sequels averaged anywhere from 4.5 to 5.3. I'd say this movie is better than the sequels while not as good as the first. <br/><br/>So, I'd give it roughly a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>The story is fun, for what it is. Which is a rough retelling of the video game ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", while incorporating elements of the following two sequels, as well as incorporating stylistic elements from the following game and the first three of the original trilogy. Thats right! Based loosely on one game, borrowing elements from SIX more. The movie is stretched too thin, and it shows.<br/><br/>The movie feels like your prototypical ""sword and sandal"" action flick, borrowing heavily from films like ""The Thief of Baghdad"", and stories found in ""1001 Nights"". So think 'Arabian Nights', Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Aladdin, all mixed with some Steve Reeves 'Hercules' and Robert E. Howard 'Conan' flash.<br/><br/>Is it as cheesy as that sounds? YES! Is it as awesome as that sounds? YES!<br/><br/>But it's still well edited, well acted, well scored (Harry Gregson-Williams never fails), and overall well done enough to merit an enjoyable experience.<br/><br/>The ONLY complaints I can think of are few, but here they are: A bit too much CGI, not on the stunts (not much CGI there surprisingly) but on things like demonic-esque snakes (you'll see). Too much random slow-motion. The sexual-tension seemed too forced (too many of those really slow ""they're about to kiss but don't"" moments). And whereas yes, the ending is supposed to have a ""Deus-Ex-Machina"" feel to it, in the game it is much more thorough and more explained, in the movie you're just expected to roll with it.<br/><br/>Other than that. A fun night at the movies! Grab your over-priced candy, soda, and popcorn (or do like me and sneak snacks in) and have fun with friends, family and loved ones, recapturing the fun escapism of your childhood with an epic but cliché action movie.<br/><br/>Hope you enjoyed my review... And I hope you enjoy the movie too!"
"thefilmgourmet","8","238","340","22 May 2010"," It was entertaining and fun
","First of all when I read some of the reviews about this movie all my excitement was drained but I went to see it anyway. What do you now, the movie was great. It was fun, had a lot of action in it, the CGI was nice (excecpt few scenes in the beginning). I thought acting was nice Gyllenhaal (prince) and Arterton (Princess) did a good job in my opinion. As a fun of the game; the script wasn't entirely accurate just like most of the movies based on games but it didn't stray too far either. OK it was not the perfect movie but it was something that I would go and watch its sequel.<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed myself and I believe if you go open minded you will enjoy yourself too."
"bucaneerfilms","9","374","545","3 May 2010"," Not Your Average Video Game Flick
","Tonight I was fortunate enough to see an advanced screening of this film. Like many, I became a fan of this franchise with the Sands of Time trilogy, and I was very excited when I learned that there were plans to make a feature film based on it. The storyline of the game is very cinematic (at least in the aforementioned trilogy, not necessarily in the previous games in the series) so I felt that at film adaptation would be an impressive epic.<br/><br/>Having finally seen this movie, I can say that I was not at all disappointed!<br/><br/>One of the main strengths going into this movie was it's involvement of the series creator Jordan Mechner. He crafted a very engaging screen story that pushed beyond the controller, creating an entirely new addition to the mythos. I know that at times including the creator can sometimes stifle the process, as many will fight changes to the source material that may need to be altered to work better with a director's vision; but I feel that Mechner's involvement showed his desire to see his brain-child develop into a success on the big screen.<br/><br/>In addition to involving Mechner, the other big strength was the way that the filmmakers chose to handle the story. Let's face it, movies based on video games have a very poor track record. Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, Tomb Raider... all of them made for films that were mediocre at best, and downright abysmal at worst. Prince of Persia had a mighty big hurdle to clear with this, and they found the perfect team to tackle it. Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney already accomplished a similar feat when they brought Pirates of the Caribbean to the big screen (a movie based on a theme park ride, in a genre that had not seen success in 50 years!) <br/><br/>Their strategy was the same, they wrote their own story that borrowed elements from the game, but did not strictly follow it. The film stands alone, and does not require it's audience to be intimately familiar with the source material. The nods to the game throughout were great, but I was relieved that I was able to enjoy this film for what it was, rather than constantly looking for where it deviated from the games.<br/><br/>This movie clearly was made for someone like me, and in my party of four, three of us, who were all guys, loved it. The fourth, who was the only woman in the group, was less than impressed, and complained that it was too much action. If you're expecting Citizen Kane, you stand to be disappointed, but if you expect this to be another video game adaptation, you are in for a real treat!"
"3xHCCH","8","114","163","30 May 2010"," Very Entertaining Summer Blockbuster Film!
","I was looking forward to this film because of the hype, and I was afraid to be disappointed. But as the film unfolded, I most definitely enjoyed this adventure from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays the titular Prince of Persia, Dastan, who was an urchin picked by the King from the marketplace to be his third son. He and his brothers get caught in a web of political high jinx that cross their paths with Princess Tamina of Alamut (played by Gemma Arterton), and the fabled powers of the Sands of Time.<br/><br/>This is Jake Gyllenhaal's most accessible film so far, and he goes to town with it. OK, granted he does not look the least bit Persian, or of that particular time period, but somehow his charisma was able to carry us on this fantastic ride. I also enjoyed his interaction with the beautiful Arterton, which sparks with humor and romance. She was my favorite part of ""Clash of the Titans (2010),"" and same here.<br/><br/>I highly recommend this film for a good old-fashioned, action-adventure film set in ancient times. The parkour sequences are definitely of the highest order and very well-edited and photographed. The sets and visual effects are excellent. Best of all, the story is intelligent and well-constructed. Producer Jerry Bruckheimer has again delivered a very entertaining summer blockbuster. A very well-executed film of its genre. A must watch!"
"miriam-rios","9","314","470","28 May 2010"," It is refreshing!
","Did you see Iron Man and Robin Hood? Yes? Well, this film is better, simply because the story is original. I know, I know, it is based on the computer game...which I used to play ages ago...but the story portrayed in the script is classic and refreshing at the same time; the performances are natural and the stunt scenes are unbelievable. Now, what did Iron Man 2 miss and this movie excels at? Plot, and a fast action pace without being over caffeinated big bang explosions (ever saw G.I. Joe?)<br/><br/>Having said that, you must be warned, the dialogues are simple but not stupid and it does contain a fair amount of moral references.<br/><br/>Sure everyone is crying out loud about the British accents... ""ohh but Persians didn't speak English"" yeah but this isn't The Passion of The Christ, or Apocalypto and Mel Gibson was nowhere near the production, Jake Gyllenhaal is an American, but the rest of the cast is British, makes sense they should all have a similar accent doesn't it?? So quit yer whining <br/><br/>Overall a good wholesome fun summer movie. worth repeating!"
"monkeymajik153","9","240","364","29 May 2010"," Underrated
","I didn't expect much from this movie, and wasn't planning on watching it after watching the trailer, which had somehow managed to butcher the action sequences which turned to be pretty good in the movie. It hardly depicted the movie for what it made out to be, so i'm more than glad that i did. At first glance Jake wouldn't be my first choice for the role of the prince as i didn't think he really looked the part, with his slightly goofy looking demeanor, but he made up for it as he certainly played the part(and thanks to the costume designer, dressed the part), coupled with a good body double the parkour wasn't far off either. There was good chemistry between the male and female leads, however, granted perhaps overplayed in less than idyllic moments for pda haha, which some might find cliché but hardly something to dwell on in this pretty awesome movie so its not as bad as other critics claim. It offers aesthetically pleasing graphics (as to be expected of the people who worked on the pirates of the Caribbean) and although deviated from the plot of the game, the important aspects blended well and made for an enjoyable, and not totally predictable storyline. Another epic jerry epic i say. I sincerely hope they make a sequel, especially if the the dark prince is involved in the storyline, that would be badass (magma cracks already showing on the prince's body during slow mo time travel scenes so fingers crossed)"
"SDockorockerty_MarkII","9","146","227","25 May 2010"," Movies like this don't come along often- enjoy it in the theatre
","Prince of Persia was an immensely enjoyable movie. Below I list the positives and few negatives of the movie before summarising.<br/><br/>Positives - What I liked about Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time<br/><br/>~Its beautiful<br/><br/>The visuals in this movie are stunning. Everything from the cinematography of the desert landscapes to the city of Alamut and the beautiful sets are a real treat to look at.<br/><br/>~The two leads are excellent<br/><br/>The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton is fantastic and they, like the visuals, are great to look at. Arterton is stunning as Princess Tamina and Gyllenhaal is as watchable as always. The supporting actors all do their jobs decently.<br/><br/>~The fight choreography and parkour<br/><br/>Parkour is going to be the new big thing in movieland so I hear and its great to watch, really adding an exciting new element to the tried and tested swordfight <br/><br/>~The story wasn't actually totally predictable<br/><br/>I haven't played the games so I didn't really know what I was in for with the plot, only that it involved some sands of time... Call me a moron but I actually found quite a lot of what happened in the movie very unpredictable and the ending of the movie for me was totally unexpected.<br/><br/>Negatives- What could have been better<br/><br/>~Historical inaccuracy<br/><br/>I thought the movie was meant to be in Sassanid Persia (3rd-7th century AD) but the map at the beginning clearly showed Achaemenid Persia which was quite confusing so the inclusion of crossbows and the mention of the ""Turkish"" was quite out of place. The Mughuls are also mentioned which is out of place regardless since they Mughuls were Mongols... The movie does include a dagger which can turn back time so perhaps the whole point of moot but I don't feel some more research would have hurt.<br/><br/>~Could have been funnier<br/><br/>The movie could have been a little funnier but the storyline moved at such a pace that there wasn't much chance for much hijinks. There were some funny lines in there however and as I mentioned before, the chemistry between Arteron and Gyllenhaal was very enjoyable<br/><br/>##Conclusion##<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is not the type of movie that comes along often. How often do you really get to see a beautifully shot film set in Ancient Persia featuring such good leads and original story? It was an enjoyable movie and a great movie in its own right I say, bring on the sequels - just don't mess them up like Pirates of the Caribbean."
"acebreaoeva","8","11","13","14 August 2018"," Surprisingly Good
","I've never played the Prince of Persia games, but this movie wants me to try one of the games. The movie is very good and the visuals are stunning."
"interrealm","8","231","381","5 May 2010"," The video game series sets the precident for the movie
","It isn't often that a video game is so vivid, so involving...so enveloping, that it is looked on as a possible movie franchise on all those merits. Usually, just the action (Doom, Final Fantasy), or just the body (Lara Croft...Tomb Raider) or just some other one aspect makes for a great game, but an underwhelming movie. I had the pleasure of watching this movie in an early screening on Monday night, and it is definitely a step above and beyond the aforementioned videogames-turned-movies.<br/><br/>The hallmark from the very beginning of the Prince of Persia franchise (a primitive DOS programmed, side-scrolling adventure through a castle to rescue a locked-up princess) was not only having a great story, but telling it in such a way to keep the player in that world. This film, surprisingly enough, doesn't play out quite as closely to the video games as I had expected. Still, without spoiling either the games or this movie, I can say that it shows Jordan Mechner had full involvement in the movie. Many storytelling elements present in the ""Prince of Peria: The Sands of Time"" video game can be found here, and made for a very entertaining romp through the vast lands of Persia.<br/><br/>I would say that my main gripe is the under-use of parkour, the running/fighting style the Prince deploys in the video games. This is a hard gripe to substantiate though, because of how difficult parkour is to execute, let alone master, nonetheless I had expected something resembling the wall-running, banner-ripping moves seen in the ""Sands of Time"" video game trilogy. It's harder still to be too down on a little parkour, due to Disney's desire that this film would be the first in a Prince of Persia movie franchise, equal to or greater than the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" movie franchise. Therefore, I await with anticipation the creativity that more parkour would bring to the stories this most agile Prince can tell.<br/><br/>""Prince of Peria: The Sands of Time"" gets 8 of 10 stars."

","WOW,i just came back from the I-max cinema and this movie was so so good! Prince of Persia makes Pirates of the Caribbean look like a joke..<br/><br/>I always loved the Prince of Persia games played the 2d ones and all the way up to two thrones, this movie had much resemblance to the game, but unlike other video game movies it wasn't trying to hard to show it off to the audience.Best video game movie without a doubt! <br/><br/>I think the reason some people are rating this so low is because they are USED to rating video game movies so low as they have all failed up to now!<br/><br/>This movie deserves a solid 7.5/10.Ill rate it 10 right now because I'm just so amazed of how much i enjoyed this movie.<br/><br/>IF YOU GO INTO THE CINEMA TAKING THIS MOVIE SO SERIOUSLY YOU WILL BE DISAPPOINTED. This movie doesn't try to be what its not.<br/><br/>It has amazing park-our,good romance, amazing action and fabulous special effects. I recommend this movie to everyone cause its truly awesome!"

","As a Prince of Persia fan i enjoyed this movie. The Park our scenes were stunning. There is a lot of Action in this movie which is in my view a good decision. If you are looking for a some good Swords battles you will enjoy this Movie. the different Assassins characters were also a interesting part of this Movie. I have to mention that Disney done a great job with the atmosphere Music in this Movie. I think Disney did a great job with this movie,at first i was very skeptical with Disney producing it. But with Pirates of the Caribbean and Prince of Persia I'm very satisfied with Disney's quality as a big blockbuster Movie Producer. Overall it was a Good Movie, i will buy the Blue ray version of it."
"dvc5159","5","111","206","27 May 2010"," Entertaining summer romp
","Movies are like food. There are some which are bitter and hard to swallow yet nutritious in every aspect, and those which are tasty albeit fattening. ""Prince Of Persia"" falls in the latter category, it's fun to watch and enjoyable, and where intelligence doesn't really matter.<br/><br/>With Jerry Bruckheimer producing, lots of action, adventure and excitement are promised. With ""Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time"" he continues that promise. The film, from start to finish, is filled with well-choreographed sword-fighting action, fantastic special effects, sweepingly exotic scenery, lavish production design, and a good, sweeping music score by Harry Gregson-Williams. During the action scenes the camera does not shake that much compared to recent movies... although I admit there are one too many slow-motion sequences, that (although gorgeous to look at) distracts the audience too much. However Bruckheimer has a thing for slo-mo, so he's excused. The screenplay is about what you'd expect for a Hollywood-filmed Arabian adventure.<br/><br/>The actors did a good job with the material they're given. Jake Gyllenhaal emits sex appeal and charisma throughout, walking through the film with ease. And he's quite good with the action sequences and fighting! Jake, welcome to the action hero club. A big surprise though is Gemma Arterton's performance as Princess Tamina; it is a HUGE improvement from her bland performances in ""Quantum Of Solace"" and ""Clash Of The Titans""; here Arterton manages to inject wit, charm AND emotion into her character, not to mention looking gorgeous at the same time. However I was slightly disappointed by Ben Kingsley's performance - a two dimensional villain. Granted, Kingsley acted great in the role but I felt like it just didn't match to his standards. Alfred Molina has a funny supporting role and the rest of the cast did quite a good job, although I wish a little characterization would come from this.<br/><br/>Still, Mike Newell's tight direction manage to put all these amazing factors together, thus he and Bruckheimer not only made an entertaining summer blockbuster, they also made arguably one of, if not the, best movies based on a video game ever. Period.<br/><br/>In short, if you want to take a little escape from reality, go back in time to ""Prince of Persia"" and enjoy. It's fun and light on the brain.<br/><br/>Entertainment value: 9/10<br/><br/>Overall: 7/10"
"asterixobelix","9","3","3","1 August 2013"," Good movie
","In my opinion it's a very good and watchable movie. First of all for those who complain about the story, let me tell you, that the ORIGINAL Price of Persia story was: ""The princess was kidnapped, save her within 60 minutes"" so even compared to that it's very good (I know it's supposed to be based on Sands of Time, but I think even compared to that this has a good story). I've played every Prince of Persia game since the first one, and yeah I still find the movie good. The visuals are very good, the characters are mostly great, and the comical characters are mostly funny, and I just love Gemma Arterton, she's beautiful to look at."

","Well having played all the games I can honestly say I didn't know what to think when I found out that Jake gyellenhaal would be playing dasdan in the film. Well as always Jake impressed me at his fullest and the film was a fantastic piece of work. I expected it to be once I knew Jerry bruckhiemer was the producer and once again he impressed me. The visual effects team on the film deserves to be credited due to there brilliant work throughout the entire movie. The last effect sold the work of the effects team to me as outstanding. I also really like the way the director chose to open and close the film with the same shot and subtitles. After the film is done you really understand why the director did that. I really hope they follow this great film up with an equally great sequel and i don't think I will be disappointed."

"nolketessa","8","19","32","16 June 2010"," Good fun, even for non-fans of the genre
","OK, let me start by saying that I am not a person who likes fantasy movies, I am not a person who likes action movies and I have never in my life played a computer game (not counting Patience and Spider Solitaire). I do however like me some Jake Gyllenhaal and when I read that for this movie he had trained an additional 5 pounds of muscle onto his body AND that he speaks with an English accent, I knew I had to see it, if only to swoon for two hours. So I admit I went in for completely shallow reasons. <br/><br/>As for the shallowness, I was amply rewarded. My oh my that Jake looks good!! And I really loved him with his English accent - I certainly hope he will do that more often. For those leaning more towards enjoying female beauty there is Gemma Arterton who is a stunning beauty so they were quite the handsome couple.<br/><br/>But all in all I was pleasantly surprised by the movie. It had a good story to it, the acting was steady, the tone was humorous and the CGI people went all out for the lush scenery and the crowd scenes. Two additional reasons that I thoroughly enjoyed it were: (1) Alfred Molina who provided the humour bits in his role of Sheik Amar (I sat through the end credits because he was unrecognizable to me and I wanted to know who played the part. What a 180 degree turn from his part in An Education where I saw him last!), and (2) the use of parkour/freerunning we see Jake do in his role of Prince Dastan. Obviously he must have had a stunt double for this and some parts of it must have been enhanced by CGI but still it was a welcome change to the standard (to this genre of movie) chasing scenes which I am not particularly a fan of.<br/><br/>If - contrary to me - you are a fan of fantasy and action, you will enjoy this even more than I did, and I already enjoyed it very much. A couple of hours of unpretentious fun of the kind that Jerry Bruckheimer has such a knack for. Well done."
"EUyeshima","5","40","75","2 June 2010"," Bruckheimer and CGI Effects Dominate a Paper-Thin, Fleet-Footed Video Game-Derived Epic
","The sight of Jake Gyllenhaal in a defiantly heroic pose with his imposing dagger on the poster of this 2010 fantasy adventure would seem to portend a film filled with self-parody, but alas, the actor takes the Aladdin-like title role semi-seriously. He's actually better than expected in the over-the-top derring-do role, but the movie itself is absurdly convoluted and overly ridiculous, even by the standards of the 2003 video game which inspired this CGI-saturated production. It should come as no surprise that the executive producer is action-schlock master Jerry Bruckheimer, whose commercial track record extends from ""Beverly Hills Cop"" to the ""National Treasure"" franchise. What did surprise me is that the director is Mike Newell, better known for soft, female-oriented fare such as ""Enchanted April"" and ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"". However, both he and Gyllenhaal give themselves almost entirely to Bruckheimer's more commercial, comic-book sensibilities.<br/><br/>The fanciful plot takes place in the sixth century B.C. where we find a Persian street urchin named Dastan being adopted by King Sharaman for his courageous acrobatics in a crowded marketplace. He grows up with his loyal foster brothers Garsiv and Tus, the rightful heirs to the throne who lead the Persian army in an attack on the sacred city of Alamut. In a none-too-subtle allusion to current-day Iraq, the siege on Alamut comes from a wrongful assumption that the city's people are selling weapons to their enemies. Behind the assault is the King's brother and trusted adviser, the Dick Cheney-like Nizam. Elsewhere in the city, Dashan leads a swashbuckling rogue effort that leads him to the comely Princess Tamina who holds the secret behind the mythical Dagger of Time. The dagger has time-bending powers that allow the user to undo any mistake and redo any moment. In short order, Dashan gets framed for murder and escapes with Tamina and the dagger.<br/><br/>All sorts of contrived shenanigans subsequently follow with the addition of Sheik Amar, an ostrich-racing thief who amusingly hates both taxes and the confining role of government, as the dagger elusively changes hands and a fatalistic sinkhole yields an ending that may remind you of Pam's unexpected discovery of Bobby in the shower on ""Dallas"". Aside from Gyllenhaal's muscular performance, Gemma Arterton (a memorable bit as Strawberry Fields in ""Quantum of Solace"") makes a fetching princess with plenty of predictable moxy. As Nizam, Ben Kingsley is not nearly as embarrassing here as he was in ""The Love Guru"", but his Oscar will continue collecting dust by itself with his string of disappointing movie choices. The ethnically versatile Alfred Molina steals the film in an act of petty larceny as the comical sheik. With so many special effects coming at the viewer uninterrupted, it was extremely difficult to find a core of humanity in this whole venture. But that's Bruckheimer's objective after all - to overwhelm your senses until you turn into the exact same pulp he chooses to present to all the fanboys and fangirls who will flock to this paper-thin extravaganza."

","My friend dragged me to this movie, I am usually picky and wouldn't have seen this on my own but there I was in the theater on my friends insistence watching Prince of Persia. Surprisingly it was pretty good for a summer movie meant to entertain. I was never a fan of the main actor in this movie, but he was good in the role as the Prince of Persia who was not royal born.<br/><br/>There are lots of jumping and sequences that remind of video games where you have to do fancy acrobatics to get to the next point, and good action scenes in the movie. It kind of reminded me of ""The Mummy"", but of course wasn't as good, but did have a similar vibe going on.<br/><br/>The computer generated backgrounds were excellent and showed exotic fantasy architecture of middle eastern flavor and normally I would hate that a lot of the movie had computer graphics as backgrounds but this was done so well I have to make an exception.<br/><br/>For other picky movie goers like me I can give you a recommendation for this movie, it is a fun lightweight summer movie and you will have a good time watching it."
"CihanVercan","7","22","39","15 June 2010"," When a very best combat/platform game turns age 21, now it became a Swashbuckler film
","Prince of Persia is the BEST PLATFORM GAME on computer I ever played as a child. It's not that industrial standard movies can create new ideas, they have to find a source to make an adaptation, but Sands of Time doesn't stand enough loyal to its title. What not staying loyal to Prince of Persia means, there is not any visually admirable combat with the film at all. When it's been first released, AUTUMN 1989, in Apple II; there were only a palace, a peasant child, a princess under the Caliph's servitude and hundreds of guardians defending the palace. Our peasant child as a spy was there to rescue the princess to bring her back to father the Persian Emperor. Looking at the continuation of the game series, the story is taken back in time about 15 centuries back to Persian realm before the birth of Christ. When I played the 2003 Sands of Time game on X-Box, the combat sense of the game had been gone. It was rather boring and bothersome since our peasant has become a prince, with not much to do other than jumping back and forth over the house roofs like Spider-Man.<br/><br/>What's good with the movie better than its 2003 version of video game is we have more challenges than the game here. It's widely enriched with industrial standards. Classic cat and mouse type tags, rebel and noble girl falling in love with the boy, people from evil side turning to good side, suspicious characters seeking tricky and manipulative ways of possessing more power and authority, good side falls into an adventure/journey as a team, proves the importance of teamwork and beats the odds: The very-well known SWASHBUCKLER clichés since 1950s' Erol Flynn flicks, 1960s' Akira Kurosawa Seven Samurai, 1980s' Conan the Barbarian with Arnie, Indiana Jones with Harrie, 1990s' The Mummy, and from recent years the LOTR and the Pirates of the Caribbean. Prince of Persia has a lot to offer to the video game fans, but not much to offer for movie fans at all.<br/><br/>With great aspects from locations and change on weather conditions especially on desert, this movie is considerably interesting, even though most of them are CGI; animals from desert, the OSTRICHS, the COBRA SNAKES and ARMORED HORSES even though it's not appropriate with its history.<br/><br/>Sands of Time as a production had great potential of usage in props, but either the producers never made a deep research or may be they just couldn't provide them. In the computer game, the props were the heart of the franchise. FLYING CARPET, DOUBLE-SIDED ALTER-EGO CREATOR MIRROR, POTHOLE AMBUSHES, BARRED DOORS, ROTTEN PUNK FLOORS, ELIXIRS...(for the full list props from the game, please go to the Message Board to find my message, in the title page). Here in the film, a large barred door been used, but it was a pre-built one with very well-known studio usage from 1980s' RED SONJA especially. Other cons were the SACRED DAGGER which given its name to the title of the movie, the POISONED KING DALMATIC. Other than those the costumes of the actors were only average. But the Princess needed a better costume other than a gown.<br/><br/>I found the editing job in the introduction scenes and the first half very pathetic. It became a matter of story design afterwards. There are bunches of continuation mistakes, costume changes without the location changes and errors in every other scene while telling the drama sequences. I'm crazy for sword combats in action movies, but Sands of Time displayed one of the worst sword combats I've ever seen, Jake needed to practise more on handling swords. In this case, even the Pirates of the Caribbean was so-so. If it's the matter the best sword combat was used in Star Wars 30 years ago. As a reminder, the first 3 games until 1999, Prince of Persia was full of excitement with its excellent sword combat simulations. Instead of sword combat, we witness the agility skills of our Prince, making the guardians run after him, jumping back and forth over the house roofs. If you're using agility skills to display in such a Swashbuckler; then what's Spider-Man, X-Men, BatMan for? For the cuts and takes from the action scenes, which is hard to say ""combat"", director Mike Newell has preferred mostly C.U. shots, that's dated back to John Woo, which is underclass nowadays. So as an action genre, Sands of Time fails almost every aspect. But there is one thing, I most fond of is the Hassansin soldiers and their combat weapons, and the successful sound effects comes with them.<br/><br/>The story design is pathetic, but we feel a nice development work on the story-telling. There is not many heritages from Persian Mythology, so it's fine and dandy to draw the long bow, but why is it always TIME-TRAVEL, isn't there anything else for the Mythological Gods to represent their power on Earth? After the first half, when the exact idea of who is on evil side, who is on good side is established, and when it's their time to challenge each other; it becomes breath-taking to watch and admire the Sands of Time.<br/><br/>Story: 3/10 , Story Development: 9/10, Production Design: 2/10, Sounds: 7/10, Effects: 7/10, Acting: 5/10, Script: 3/10, Visuals: 7/10, Action: 5/10, Adventure: 7/10, Fantasy and Creativity: 4/10. <br/><br/>Overall my mark is 6.5/10. Time is never wasted if it's for fun while watching Sands of Time"

","Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time is supposed to be based on the video games of the early 2000s, and it does have some of the elements from the games: parkour, time-shifting elements, etc., but the film version of the PS2 classic is closer to an average sword and sandal adventure than the magical, sprawling world of the video game.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia tells the story of Prince Dastan, an Aladdin-type orphan thief turned Arabian hero, played by Jake Gyllenhaal, as he attempts to stop the evil vizier, played by Ben Kingsley, from destroying the world and capture the affection of Gemma Arterton's beautiful princess Tamina. There is more to the story, but it all amounts to the basic ""stop the bad guy, get the girl"" story. That's not always a bad thing though, and Prince of Persia does add some clever time reversing tricks to the plot thanks to a mystical dagger that runs on the sands of time. However, with the exception of a back story regarding a ostrich farmer played by the always wonderful Alfred Molina, Prince of Persia's story is fairly strait forward.<br/><br/>Still, this outline could've made a truly great film, but Prince of Persia: Sands of Time fumbles some key elements. For one, the set design and the locations don't have the same type of flair as the game at all. Where the film could've taken us to enchanted gardens and vast temples, it sticks close to the typical cityscapes and mountain ranges. While some of the sets and locations in the film are impressive, it seems like a big missed opportunity to create a truly unique Arabian world. The other thing holding Prince of Persia back from reaching the heights of its video game inspiration is the action. The Prince of Persia series of games is built on parkour and sword combat. The movie has a fair amount of parkour and of course there is some fighting, but it all seems small-scale. The parkour is simple and practical instead of daring and dramatic like it is in the games. The same goes for the fighting. In the games it is epic, in the film it's kind of boring.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, Prince of Persia is a fun movie. The action is fast yet cohesive, the sets and costume give off a nice Arabian flair, and Alfred Molina breaks up the stiffness of the main characters nicely. It's simple, mindless Jerry Bruckheimer produced fun, but considering its source material, it could've been great. For fans of classic sword and sandal adventures it is well worth a watch, but fans of the game might be disappointed.<br/><br/>67/100"

"Floated2","7","8","12","19 August 2010"," Entertaining but should have been better
","Prince of Persia the sands of time, is a great video game ever, and I was really curious at first to see how this movie would turn out. I am not an avid gamer of this game but I have played the game sometimes. I wanted to see if ''Disney'' could make the movie as epic as the video game. When i first saw the first look i was really intrigued by it. Then the official casting has been made and I notice that i saw Jake Gyllenhall as the Price Dastan, then I sorta knew that it was going to be a complete disaster. Not only they changed the whole theme of the video game but also i was really shocked that the only character that came even close to the game was Ben Kingsley's role, he was without a doubt the perfect one for the role of Nizam.<br/><br/>For the movie, it had nice special effects and the landscape was nice but the story wasn't that great. It could have been much better, and it was a little confusing to follow. Also the relationship between Dastan and the Princess Tamina was quite awkward. At first they didn't like each other then after a few scenes together they were scene teasing each other, and fooling around town (no pun intended).<br/><br/>It should be noted that Disney produced this. Disney basically means no violence, no gore nothing. The video game was rated M for Mature, while this movie is rated PG-13. I guess they wanted to make the movie visible to more people so they could get more money from the profits. Not the best move but I can see why they did this. I really like the armoury, i love the way they designed the weapon and the dagger of time itself was a pretty good job. I really loved the way they presented us Tamina (Gemma A) she was one of the good points of this movie along Sir Ben Kingsley's fine acting. The movie was actually really boring at certain parts. The only real parts were the fight scenes and when he's using the dagger of time. Also the ending was alright, could have been better. Though I know they're be a sequel and am expecting that to be better. Overall this movie is not close near the game and it was quite disappointing. ==================================================================== ======= After a rewatch (02/24/17) after nearly seven years later, my opinions have changed slightly on this film. I do not quite remember the video games as I once have but this film isn't too bad. The actions sequences are there and although it is Disney and the games were rated R, it wasn't as bad as once remembered, it could have been a lot worse. It is quite predictable in the ending but noticeably entertaining and a decent journey. Knowing that this film did not produce a sequel, may have been for the best. Changed from a 5/10 to 7/10."
"mike-adly5","7","9","14","30 May 2010"," In a Nutshell: Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time..If you're thinking that this is another cheesy video game based movie, think again!<br/><br/>As much as being based on a major video game makes a movie widely anticipated, it also makes the audience very hesitant towards going to see it. This one may not be perfect but it's a win for your money. At least this is not another ""Street Fighter"" or ""Max Payne"".<br/><br/>The Sands of Time or the first of The Prince of Persia series gives us the Genesis of Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), your favourite video game Prince, the story of how he is adopted by the good king of Persia and how he becomes a part of the royal family of one of the biggest kingdoms of the world. The story goes on to tell us about Dastan's brothers making the decision to invade the Holy City of Alamut in which Dastan joins hands with Princess Tamina for a dark race against evil forces to protect an ancient dagger that has the power of releasing the Sands of Time.<br/><br/>The good thing about The Sands of Time is that all aspects of moving making behind the lens come together to put on a good show. Cinematography and Art Direction play some of the biggest roles in this picture. The shooting angles and the set decoration make it all so vivid and so real. There are times in the movie where you think you're in the game itself, that you're moving Dastan, as he jumps from one roof top to the other, with your own hands. For all this to happen, you have to have Oscar winning cinematographer John Seale directing those cameras, the man behind photography of ""The English Patient"", ""City of Angels"" and ""Cold Mountain"".<br/><br/>About the acting, I have to say it was average except for Alfred Molina who portrays the character of Sheikh Amar, a desert con man who runs ostrich races. Not only does Molina excel in every line of his role, he also plays lead in the comic relief side of the story. Molina gives you the laugh you need every now then between sword fighting and knife throwing scenes. No wonder he's become the top story of every critic's review about this movie since it was released. But regarding the role of Princess Tamina, let's just say it was very unfortunate for that Iranian actress who was planned to play it to get arrested before the shooting, because as far as I can see it; Gemma Arterton has made the princess of the, supposedly Holy City, look like a sorority girl.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, apart from the acting that could have been more satisfying in some parts, this film is an entertaining ride. This is good fantasy movie making with a strong promise of a sequel."
"MaxBorg89","7","11","18","29 May 2010"," Bruckheimer does it again
","One thing has to be said about Jerry Bruckheimer: he isn't afraid of anything. Despite the frequent criticism he receives for having launched the dodgy careers of Tony Scott and Michael Bay (ironically with both achieving their finest work to date without his tutelage), he's also responsible for crowd-pleasing franchises like Beverly Hills Cop and Pirates of the Caribbean. Even by his standards, though, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time was a bit of a risk. Sure, he secured a competent director (Mike Newell, who helmed the best Harry Potter film to date) and a reliable cast (Jake Gyllenhaal, Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina), but the project still came with that one unpleasant characteristic: based on a video game. Then again, everyone said he was crazy when he wanted to make a movie out of a theme park ride, so maybe he had the right tools to get the game-to-film transition right for once. Based on the finished product, it looks like the gamble mostly paid off.<br/><br/>Based on the fifth installment in the popular game series, The Sands of Time focuses on Gyllenhaal's Dastan, a street kid who finds himself adopted by the Persian king. Well loved by the people and his family, he does fine until a series of circumstances lead to his being accused of murdering the king and being on the run alongside the mysterious and beautiful Tamina (Gemma Arterton), guardian of a dagger that allows its user to travel back in time, something that might come in handy for Dastan to prove his innocence and save the kingdom.<br/><br/>What makes Prince of Persia stand out in the genre is the fact that, except for the (excellent) scenes that involve running, jumping and fighting, it doesn't look like a video-game movie at all. In fact, the surprisingly coherent and fun script follows the Pirates of the Caribbean formula by combining equal doses of action, wit (the exchanges between Dastan and Tamina), pure laughs (Alfred Molina) and charismatic characters (ditto, plus Gyllenhaal, despite an initially shaky English accent). It's formulaic - no prizes for guessing who the villain is - but enjoyable, and the time travel aspect of the story makes the third act less ridiculous than it would have been in an average action flick.<br/><br/>The only real defect, save for a bit of inevitable parallels between then and now (Persia is currently known as Iran, you know), is the fact that the compromise between Bruckheimer (money shots) and Newell (story and character) leads to some chunks of truly awful dialogue, especially the repetitive exposition scenes: is the audience's attention span really so limited that someone has to explain the dagger's function seven times over the course of two hours? Granted, there is time travel in the mix, but that doesn't mean we have to start over every single time. Maybe the screenwriters should have considered hitting the rewind button too.<br/><br/>Overall, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is exactly what it sets out to be, namely a professionally crafted blockbuster that is guaranteed to entertain for a couple of hours. It doesn't quite pack the same charm as the first Pirates movie, but if Bruckheimer has his way and a new franchise begins, there's plenty of potential to exploit in future installments."
"Generic_Gooner","7","24","46","24 May 2010"," Proof a video game cross over CAN work...
","We all know the score. Movie based on a video game, it's going to be poor, right? Well actually Bruckheimer, Newell and Disney beg to differ, and I have to agree with them on this one.<br/><br/>It's not perfect, but it is far superior to many other efforts that came before it. Even those that promised much like Hit-man failed to deliver on the hype beforehand, so with a trailer that had me questioning how good this really was (in hindsight it held back a lot of story reveals and the better scenes, which was quite a gamble) I went in not sure what I would get.<br/><br/>And what I got was a film made by people who seemed to understand what was required to entertain. The flow was perfect, and the story seemed to run cohesively. The story itself wasn't groundbreaking and at times could be a little predictable, but it was enjoyable and not over complicated or patchy.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal is an indie movie mainstay, so to see him in a role like this was interesting. He certainly looked the part and didn't do a bad job on the English accent, but the acting ability of the guy in general made him believable. Gemma Arteton has at time felt a little wooden in films I have seen her in, but this role of the feisty princess worked well for her and her chemistry with Gyllenhaal made the characters more believable.<br/><br/>The supporting cast were solid too, and the comedy turn from Molina's Amar was a very welcome addition.<br/><br/>But then a film like this will also live or die on the action, and this is an area that may divide people. The film wasn't packed out with it, but what action scenes there were came at perfect moments in the story, and some had genuine class to them. The nod to the earlier prince of Persia games too will not be lost on some of the older audience, like the leaping from one roof to another and climbing and running across strategic poles stuck out of walls. It offered a return to the swashbuckling sword fighting that looks very impressive and doesn't require a CGI monster to enhance it in any way.<br/><br/>To summarise this movie I would offer a comparison to another Disney film that was born of a different media, Pirates of the Caribbean, a ride that became a successful film franchise. Prince of Persia soars towards that level of quality, and is only really let down by a lack of a scene stealer of Captain Jack Sparrow's genius.<br/><br/>But it certainly has made a claim for the best video game adaptation of them all."
"killer3000ad","6","12","21","1 June 2010"," Not as bad as people say it is
","First off I didn't play the games so I went in with no knowledge of the storyline. Secondly I'd taken the liberty of reading the IMDb reviews and after separating the AstroTurf from butt hurt gamers, I went in with modest expectations.<br/><br/>These modest expectations were largely fulfilled, or one could say my expectations were so low that I was actually entertained. Lets be straight, pretty much every movie based on a game has stunk. I've seen such classics as Doom, Hit-man and Max Payne get absolutely ruined by studios who never played the games, so perhaps it was fortunate for me not to have been a fan of the PoP games.<br/><br/>Essentially what Prince of Persia: Sands of Time boils down to is Pirates-of-the-Caribbean in ancient Persia and I suspect that's what they were aiming for, nothing like beating the franchise to death in another new franchise. Prince Dastan is easily a stand-in for Will Turner,a street urchin wanting to be something more than his low-born background. There's the high born damsel-in-distress Princess Tamina, clearly projecting the aristocratic Elizabeth Swan, only thing is Tamina spends a lot of her time whining which actually makes Lizbeth rather more tolerable if you re-watch Pirates. Then there's mysticism, magic, supernatural elements and a creation myths thrown in regarding a magical dagger created when a young pure maiden made a plea to the gods who were angry and wanted to kill humanity with a sandstorm and a dagger that can turn back time.... oh man this fecal matter is BANANAS! This convoluted stuff certainly reeks of all that Aztec gold curse cum sea god-imprisoned-in-mortal-form who loves tentacle Davy Jones from the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.<br/><br/>Is all that wrong? Well it wouldn't be except the direction of the action sequences are so familiar that even the addition of park four sequences from the games adds little that one hasn't already seen, assuming you've already watched the Pirates of the Caribbean movies.<br/><br/>In the end, I was mildly entertained, certainly at least more entertained than Clash of the Titans or Percy Jackson. In both those movies, I came out wondering, ""What the fudge was that bovine excrement?"" With Prince of Persia, I came out thinking,""Rather tasty but could have used less sugar."""
"wolf1324","10","17","32","29 May 2010"," If you've played the game it makes it that much better!
","Great Movie. If you've played the game it makes it that much better because the movie keeps most of the high concepts of the game and a few in-game jokes. How it stuck really close to the game and still came out to be a great movie made it worthwhile for me. However the director & just Disney in general had to make some modifications transferring the game into a movie to make the movie more entertaining. The music is very Pirates of the Caribbean'ish and some parts in the movie may remind you of Lord of the Rings -__-.<br/><br/>I did not like how the commercials/trailers for the movie ruined the best action/acrobatic sequences of the movie. Therefore I advise not to watch trailers for the next one...which will probably be in the making or already is. =P"

","Once upon a time there lived a young prince named Dastan. Even though the prince was Persian, he spoke like a cockney chimney sweep (with sporadic touches of Australian).<br/><br/>The prince was an athletic young fellow, climbing walls and jumping between buildings, in a manner reminiscent - not of the Prince of Persia game franchise - but of the hero Altair from Assassin's Creed, with some shots being direct homages (read: ripoffs).<br/><br/>The olden days of yore in Persia was a wondrous period, filled with hammy acting, crappy CGI, and Persians who speak Arabic instead of Persian (save for the main characters who speak Queen's English).<br/><br/>But it was also a time of great peril, with one of the greatest dangers being a clan of wizard ninjas called ""Hassansins"" (not a typo) - predating the existence of the real Hashshashins by roughly 1500 years.<br/><br/>One day, for reasons which are not entirely clear, the prince and his royal family invade a sacred city. There he comes across a young princess with full, luscious lips and annoying voice, and the two embark on an adventure together.<br/><br/>Sparks fly between the young couple. Well, not the young couple of *this* film, but the one from the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise - something which this movie desperately aspires to be. The couple in this movie has the chemistry of a vacuum, and the screen fizzles as they deliver their supposedly witty banter.<br/><br/>They charge to and fro in the Persian country side, bumping into comedy sidekicks and gallant black men who (of course) die first.<br/><br/>The couple is trying to stop something, which isn't entirely clear, from happening. Or are they trying to make something happen? The viewer can barely remember, as he couldn't care less by this point."

","It seems like Walt Disney have co-operated well with Mike Newell by looking at this brilliant motion picture. Therefore, I call this the beginning of a new generation on Disney movies.<br/><br/>Basically, the movie chronicles the story of Dastan with Tamina to protect the Sands of Time from the enemy.<br/><br/>Why I said this was a new generation on Disney movies, it has action scenes that will astonish you. The movie is very exciting and the story is pretty sophisticated as being a Disney film. For most Disney fans, I think that this film would be very good for them.<br/><br/>I praise Mike Newell for his directing. One of the reasons that I give the praise to him is that because from approximately 116 minutes of running time, he gave a lot of scenes that makes the movie good. I also like the way he directed every time Dastan uses the Sands of Time where he gave an extraordinary vision on him.<br/><br/>There's only one problem I think. For young Disney fans, I'm afraid some of the action scenes and the violence may be unsuitable for your age.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to you people reading this review.

","I don't expect much from movies like this one except for a good time. For me this means a good looking movie, likable characters and short sentimental bits.<br/><br/>The movie delivers these. It would have been a treat if the plot was a bit more original, the solutions not quite so simplistic (**MAJOR SPOILER** Dastan just turns back time and everything is alright?! Even the dead are gotten back!) and the conversations had a bit more wit, but it doesn't do any good to dwell on these things. I enjoyed the fast pace and even the humour provided by Sheik Amar worked. I'm not an expert on special effects but the fight sequences looked pretty good to me and these were quite frequent.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal makes a charming action hero. There is a certain honesty about his face that makes Dastan more real. Gemma Arterton sounded a bit wooden at times but that may be the script's fault, I also liked Seso, it's a pity that he died, oh wait...<br/><br/>Ultimately I felt safe watching this movie, that I wouldn't have to sit through dizzying plot twists, explicit sex scenes, gruesome bloodbaths or lame acting and boring scenes. The movie stretches to do what is expected of it but nothing more.<br/><br/>I must mention one last thing to be completely honest.

","The name of our hero is Prince Dastan (also means hero in Persian). Dastan previously was a street rambler who was adopted by King Sharaman to live among royalty in his kingdom. And now with his mystical dagger and accompanied by enchanted Princess Tamina, he has to clear his name and finds the truth while he is falsely accused as King's murderer. Since 1989, we have known ""Prince of Persia"" as a famous video game which is created by Jordan Mechner. In thiz movie, the chemistry between Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is identical with Orlando Bloom and Keira Knightley character in the trilogy of ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" (2003-2007), which is also produced by Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney. In summary, they fight and they love each other. The other Cast members, Alfred Molina delivers some funny and comical moments as Sheik Amar. Ben Kingsley provides a firm performance as Dastan's mysterious uncle named Nizam. All actions (sword fighting, horse racing, arrows war, etc.) are typical action sequences in thiz kind of adventure, except the jumping scene that have become specific characteristic of ""Prince of Persia"". With slow motion and precise camera angles, thiz scene seems to work quite well. The film Director is Mike Newell, the man behind ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"" (1994), ""Donnie Brasco"" (1997), ""Mona Lisa Smile"" (2003) and the fourth Harpot movie ""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"" (2005). My critics for Newell's directing is the story-telling and editing are too fast in most of the times. For the result, the character development doesn't work well. The ending is meant to be twisted. But on second thought, since he has a magical time-machine dagger, it's supposed that all problems can be solved easily, so what the conflicts are all about in the first place? All I want to say is the storyline could have been better. The plots still have many holes. With those time travel elements, they should be able to make thiz story becomes more interesting.

","If I thought the overlong, frightfully dull ""Avatar"" contained and rehashed every Hollywood cliché ever used, albeit in blue, ""Prince of Persia: Sands of Time"" runs the gamut of every mindless Hollywood action-feature effect, computerized or not, and even as an admittedly escapism event, it falls short of any intended mark. It is obvious that there is little new under the Hollywood sun. Frankly, 1942's ""Arabian Nights"" did this plot line much better and Shemp Howard, of Three Stooges fame, surpassed Alfred Molina's deadly dull and ineffective attempt at humor. Jake Gyllenhaal, in spite of much daring-do stunts and macho posturing, is still not the virile stud hero that his handlers are trying to turn him into, and Arterton's clichéd bitchy dialog becomes tedious after 10 minutes. It's a shallow waste of time from beginning to end and how Ben Kingsley could keep a straight face throughout this loud, noisy romp is a testament to his enormous experience in front of a camera."
"bkoganbing","7","9","15","29 May 2010"," Souped Up Sabu
","There was a time back in the day when Hollywood turned out dozens of films like Prince Of Persia. Universal Studios was the chief maker of these ancient Middle East fantasies. Maria Montez had a set built for her films and when she died it was used lots of times by stars like Rock Hudson and Tony Curtis in their early days. And of course the boy from India, Sabu kept his career going on films like Prince Of Persia.<br/><br/>Now if you're expecting to see something remotely realistic about the Persian Empire which Alexander the Great put out of business, don't look at this film. Based on a video game, Prince Of Persia has about as much realism as an old Sabu movie. But that doesn't mean it isn't fun.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays the adopted son of the King Of Persia Ronald Pickup who as a lad is taken into the royal family and becomes like another brother to his two natural sons. There is a brother of Pickup played by Ben Kingsley who is a chief adviser to the throne. All seems like a happy family.<br/><br/>But Kingsley's got Richard III like ambitions and Shakespeare immortal crook backed child murderer has got nothing on Kingsley. He gets the sons to invade a Holy and peaceful city run by Princess Gemma Arterton on the pretext this crowd is plotting with folks who want to overthrow the Empire. However Kingsley wants to get at an artifact which in his hands can make him the master of time.<br/><br/>I think with all the computer graphic generated effects which are considerable and nice, still don't make this that much more than one of those Arabian Nights fantasies that Universal used to specialize in. Sabu, Rock Hudson, and Tony Curtis, and Maria Montez were never in a film with a budget like Prince Of Persia.<br/><br/>So with a plot based partially on Richard III and a bit taken from the Biblical account of the flood, Prince Of Persia will give you a couple of hours of good old fashioned film entertainment."

","I'm quite disappointed of the average score this movie's got here so far, because I normally trust IMDb's community a lot when in doubt.<br/><br/>All in all I can recommend this movie for all people who had a good day with lots of sun and fun. Because this movie will contribute to that.<br/><br/>The story is kinda shallow, I have to admit, but the theme of time, the question of ""what if"", and the power it can contribute to story changes, wasn't wasted. The end of the movie proves that in my opinion. I definitely like such story elements! And anyhow, at least you'll be inspired to think about making it better. So if you're flexible enough to see the better side of this coin, I argue you'll appreciate the story.<br/><br/>Furthermore I've really liked Prince of Persia's music and overall look. It sustained a good deal of atmosphere, magical feel and hotness. As did the actor's accomplishment: The characters. They fit into the surroundings. With all their mimics and costumes and beauty(iful post-processed skins) and make-up. The action scenes, albeit the motivation for their brutality is somewhat unclear to me, were nicely choreographed and conveyed believably the impacts and suspense that were involved. Man, people telling the ""graphics"" and make-up are cheap and whatnot, they definitely had a rainy day. And it shows they don't have a clue of the time and effort needed to achieve the skills shown off in Prince of Persia.

"gsic_batou","7","6","9","12 June 2010"," A sword of two edges: a balanced review
","Prince of Persia is one of the few games that have an interesting enough plot to turn into a movie. Another example is the successful Resident Evil, which is an interesting twist on the zombie genre.This movie uses those interesting narrative points well enough to make it an engaging, entertaining movie. The directing is effective, as is the acting(whatever the hell Ebert was complaining about, I missed it) and the visuals are incredibly well done. I feel I must however explain what well done means to me: it doesn't mean an impossible world with good textures and a lot of camera gimmicks, like that of Avatar, but rather a plausible world where CGI is invisible enough to make one not think about it while enjoying the picture.<br/><br/>Now that the good is out of the way, let me say the rest: it is not a brilliant, one of a kind movie. It uses narrative devices that we've seen over and over and it abandons character and narrative development too many times to replace it for action. And while I'd say much of the action is high quality and many people crave for it, in this case I felt the movie could have offered more, had it not been so divided between its story and the violent entries,far too easy to insert in such a tale.<br/><br/>Overall, I was entertained and highly appreciated the visuals(very true to the games). However, I felt more of an emotional impact in the end of the 2008 Prince of Persia game than I did at any point in the movie.<br/><br/>7/10"
"shushens","7","6","9","4 June 2010"," Liked it, but can't say I should
","I watched Sands of Time today ignoring all the negative reviews. It is true that if you have not played the game, you will not come to appreciate the film much. I heard Mechnar was in-the-loop all the way. But I feel if they took me instead, I would have suggested better cinematography and dialogues, if nothing else.<br/><br/>Jordan wrote somewhere that the prince had to be given a name because there were several conversations addressing him. Not mentioning his name even once would make things abnormally dramatic. Princes and princesses almost always were addressed by their positions and peers, at least in India. I do not know about Persia though, but does anybody? Prince calling princess by her first name within moments of introduction, even under stress, reminds me of IT companies, not Persian royal dynasty, or any other noble bloodline for that matter. If Jordan watched some Japanese films involving princes and princesses, he would know how far the story could progress before the princess were called anything other than hiime (princess).<br/><br/>But having said all that, I am very happy I watched it. Though it blew the chance of being an epic or even a memorable film, it still struck a poignant chord somewhere, bringing back many a sweet memory. Perhaps the credit is largely due to the game and not to the film. But the world was never a fair place to begin with.<br/><br/>The ending of the film was predictable. The game Sands of Time did not give the story any closure and left the gamers begging for more (though they never really received what they begged for). The film does. Just like Pirates of the Caribbean, Disney wants to observe box office success first and then bring up some weird new disaster scenario, along with some new prophecies, to start a sequel, if one ever comes out.<br/><br/>What bothered me the most in the whole film was the feeling of haste. People were delivering dialogues like they were being timed. People were fighting and even relaxing under strict time constraint. Scene transition, camera movement, warm moments, everything was rushed, often unnecessarily. Some moments in a larger than life tale deserve to be lingered. Sands of Time, of all stories, should not have excluded that from consideration. It ruined the film to a great extent, though perhaps a teenager who has no clue what PoP is all about will have fewer yawns watching the film because of this.<br/><br/>No or very little attention has been paid to the way words were delivered. Evidently there is no way of telling how an actual conversation between a Hindu and a Persia would sound back then (whenever that is), but a style could have been implemented to make the language sound a little more flowery, a little less discrete and a lot more exotic. They somehow, in their good conscience, excluded ""Oh $hit!"" and ""What an a$$hole!"". The rest was pretty much modern day American street English, which, under these circumstances, was revolting at best. Richard Coyle had probably never imagined talking without a British accent, but I expected far better from Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley. Kingsley has spoken with excellent Middle Eastern accent before in The House of Sand and Fog. Doing that here would make his shallow part somewhat redeemable. It would not be considered a spoiler, I am sure, to say Ben is the villain in the story. He found out about the dagger and the power it could unleash. But under no circumstances he uttered one word of how he became privy to that information. Information of such gravity must have been a closely kept secret. Skipping bits and pieces of cement in the story made the weak plot weaker.<br/><br/>The chemistry between Tamina (I do not like that name one bit) and Dastan (I dislike it a little less than Tamina) was, in one word, easy. That, however pleasant at the moment, was highly uncalled for. The resistance Tamina put in for the prince was strictly a formality, as if the director would say ""Cut! That's going too far!"" if she warmed up to him any easier. The resistance, the defiance, the sarcasm, the arrogance, the deceptiveness with which she hid her concerns for the prince, and most other character traits of Farah were missing in the film. Remembering Farah constantly seemed to be the only way of coping it. Of that I read here everyday from so many American viewers, I am convinced those subtle nuances of her character would not go unnoticed in the film. Why I came to see nothing of it is completely beyond my wits. Close to the end, when Dastan delivered Tamina a surprise, (can't say what that is but those who have played the game should be able to guess) Gemma totally failed to portray the mixture of awe, amazement, delight, curiosity and dilemma. It was a very defining moment in the story. She ruined it. However, I chose not to hold it against her. If she was in charge of the production, she would have shown wisdom enough never to pick herself for that role. She has done a good job considering.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia to me is more fun to watch than films like Robin Hood, directed by a man far more great than Mike Newell is. Mike, however, just like most other directors making game-to-movie-adaptations, forgot to watch and learn from the great directors who have attempted similar ambiances and done a far better job. He, along with Jordan Mechnar, should have thoroughly studied the likes of Kingdom of Heaven Director's Cut, if for no better reason, then at least to understand when to take things slow and let a passionate viewer cherish the moment, and the fact that the secret to an enjoyable film is not as conspicuous as a silly sequence about ostrich racing."

","Jerry Bruckheimer strolled on stage in front of the massive Leicester Square Odeon screen with the director Mike Newell and both men were thrown bubblegum questions by television's Alex Zane. Five minutes of obliged gushing followed: gushing about the film, gushing about its stars, gushing about each other. I half expected a man with a mop and bucket to follow these gentlemen on stage, such was the gushing. That's Hollywood, I guess.<br/><br/>The night before this press screening of Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (""PoP:TSoT"") I had attended the BBC's election party, the consequence of which was getting only two hours' sleep, a monster hangover and the worst working day of my professional career to date. So I entered the cinema in a semi-vegetative state with an exhausting headache. It may have been because of this predicament that, against all expectations, I rather enjoyed the movie. Indeed, my mental activity was probably akin to that of the film's target audiences: children and video-gamers, no disrespect meant to either group.<br/><br/>PoP has been a popular platform computer game since the early 90s and this aspect of the character's history is represented faithfully in the film - it has a very gamey feel to it. Impressive parkour allows the Prince to leap around the film as if he were being controlled a skilled 'gamer'. The dialogue is, for the most part, cumbersome and lazy, just like the tedious interludes in a computer game when the play stops and you are transported into a conversation with an informative avatar, except in the film you can't press A to skip. There are little outcrops of humour in the script but these very much feel as though they have been crow-barred in to later drafts, rather than having been woven in to the original.<br/><br/>The plot goes a little like this. Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) must run away from his family and his country as he has been falsely accused of doing a bad thing. For an unknown reason he grabs the Princess (Gemma Arterton) on his way out and whisks her away with him. So they start out on the run, being chased by angry Persians. At the beginning, of course, the Prince and the Princess don't seem to get along, as is the way with all uncreative screen romances but rest assured by the end of the film they get along famously. The main body of the film follows them desperately evading their hunters, getting into various scrapes along the way and it's all quite exciting, especially when the unit of menacing Persian black-ops 'Hassassins' are unleashed. The CGI-laden grand finale sequence is pure, unbelievable fantasy which cements the film in the 'children' genre.<br/><br/>PoP:TSoT was filmed in Pinewood Studios, England (and also in Morocco, Africa) so most of the cast are British. Perhaps this explains Gyllenhaal's use of an English accent - poor old Jake just wants to fit in with us Limeys. The accent is perfectly acceptable and his performance is good considering this is his first dig at an action hero. Arterton's face is well cast as the beautiful princess and her acting is less pouty than Bruckheimer's other muse (Keira Knightley), although still a little bit pouty. Sir Ben Kingsley doesn't seem out of place as the Prince's trusted uncle and his fee from this performance will presumably see him through his next ten low budget art house ventures.<br/><br/>Having cat-o-nine-tailed the Pirates of the Caribbean franchise to death, Bruckheimer has simply used the same formula and plonked it into a Persian theme, except this version is lot less snappy, lazier (probably to do with the absence of Johnny Depp). However, it is a mildly enjoyable action romp if you go in expecting just that, and it will surely be one of the summer's smash hits. If you're looking for mental stimulation then you will be disappointed. In fact, if you aren't a child or a gamer, it might be best to drink a lot (responsibly) and deprive yourself of sleep the night before viewing.<br/><br/>Originally reviewed at www.thedooleyreview.co.uk"

"honorhorror","6","16","31","14 June 2010"," Sadly, it spent too much time being run-of-the-mill.
","I tend to feel Prince of Persia the movie owed me a watchable story, after paying 140 Baht(more than average in Thai cinemas) and two unremarkable hours in the digital cinema. I also tend to doubt the possibility this movie will ever speak to you with any messages, should them be fairy tale messages or serious politic messages. That being said, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is quite a disappointment from a bunch of names I admired.<br/><br/>The Parkour sequences were fun to watch, so was the siege sequence, but if you have watched the trailer, you've seen them all. It's never really captivating. You got eye candies, just like you've got Dastan and Princess Tamina, but you've also got terrible performances and disturbing character background illustration. That part that talked about Tamina's coronation as the Sand prophet was so hilariously bad that I almost laughed out. What was more hilarious was her character's development after the flashback, that Tamina transformed magically from a cursing,sarcastic-talking person into a religiously holified person......<br/><br/>I guess the movie's intrinsically bad because of the script, that they tried to please all the demographic groups so they had to forgo all the valid, culture-identifying messages. The CGI landscapes of ancient Persia spent many millions, yet never succeeded in giving you anything material. The story had Dastan started in the slum, and granted him a heart of gold that cemented sibling love as the only thing that's closest to a ""soul"" in this hollow story. Unfortunately, the most emotional role who also provided the best fighting sequence is not our prince, but some ""knife thrower"".<br/><br/>I gave the movie 6/10 out of the respect for Ben Kinsley having very dark eyeliner, and the final act that somehow managed to save this movie. What I like to talk more about is the potential it wasted in this great context. With human dreams to go back in time to fix mistakes, sands as the symbol of infinite bleakness/lifelessness, exotic locations with exotic tales, POP the movie could have told you a story, favorably in a fable style, just like the original games. Yet it misused the knife of time, made the prince an underachiever in almost every remarkable aspects in the original game, and tell you craps like ""some souls are bound beyond time"". Time-traveling in a fantasy context was great, at least in Groundhog Day, The Girl Who Leapt Through Time, and the Sands of Time games.For the record, The Two Thrones gave you great opportunities to recognize and reflex on your own dark sides, and suggested you to choose the way of repent rather than the way of chasing shadows. Are mainstream audiences really so secular that they can't even stand fables with a bit biblical touch? Or are they only being awed enough to respect some environmentalism because Avatar had awesome visuals? I doubt it, and I strongly believe someone can make a much-better POP movie that is really epic."
"cinemabon","1","28","60","13 June 2010"," Wow! Special Effects!
","Anyone still impressed by CGI after we've had Star Wars and Lord of the Rings and hundreds of other fairly decent films thrown at us needs to get a life. Please stop talking about how good the special effects are. Impressive explosions or magical events on the screen do not a Jedi make, or a good movie. Any good movie or film has two key elements, story and direction. In this case, you have no story and a very convoluted plot. The story is a made up fantasy based on a video game that is only partly successful. Strike one. Secondly, let us consider director Mike Newell and his mostly television career. The small screen is one form of entertainment. When you take an image and blow it up to seventy feet across, you'd better put something interesting up there, because people will see every detail. Unlike television that shrinks a world to sameness, film is an art form that examines details. A good director can use even limited actors and make something work. But a bad director will fall back on things like special effects to sell a bad scene. This film is an example of directing at its worst. The stumbling pace, the up and down tempo, the failed execution, and the poor acting I lay at Newell's doorstep. This film is about to lose about a hundred million dollars or more for Disney at a time when their Magic Kingdoms have seen dramatic fall off in numbers, and I would not want to be in his shoes when they start adding up the loses."

","I remember playing the original Prince of Persia on the Amiga 500. It was a race against time to rescue a princess from an evil vizier. And that was it. No time-bending; no art du déplacement. Just fencing and jumping and pits of spikes.<br/><br/>The new tie-in from increasingly hack-like director Mike Newell is based on more recent incarnations, of course. But however complex modern videogames have become, it's not that interesting to watch someone else play a computer game, and that's basically what you get here. The Sands of Time element involves a dagger with a button which rewinds time by a few seconds. You can imagine a young Spielberg revelling in a craftily-written scene in which the smouldering heroes bicker and flirt, jostling events to out-do one another, subtly subverting our expectations whilst satisfying our need to be entertained. This script (the product of four minds, including original PoP creator, Jordan Mechner) gets the bickering and flirting bit, but there's none of the craft.<br/><br/>In fact, the script is downright lame. Lots of plot, yes, but written so thuddingly, and with so much exposition, that none of the boring characters have a chance to do any acting. Least of all Sir Ben Kingsley, who seems to be having zero fun as the sinister patriarch. There's some wit in Alfred Molina's Sheik Amar, but ultimately his presence only serves to remind us that the aforementioned Mr Spielberg made a vastly superior action adventure 28 years ago.<br/><br/>Indeed, Raiders of the Lost Ark spawned a phenomenal franchise. Disney and Bruckheimer may hope for similar affection, or at least the dollars of the Pirates machine - but I fear they'll receive neither."
"MrGoodMovie","1","30","65","30 October 2010"," How to fail spectacularly even when you're Jerry Bruckheimer
","So what makes this movie such a failure? Well<br/><br/>Firstly there's the plot which is actually quite plausible (for a Persian fantasy flick) and could have resulted in a sort of Matrix meets Ali Baba meets Inception type of movie. Instead it just fumbles along from scene to scene, with little smooth interconnection, and a villain in the camp telegraphed so early in the movie you're left screaming ""IT'S HIM"" at the screen well before the supposedly wise ruling ""brothers"" figure it all out. <br/><br/>Secondly there's the casting. Now Jake Gylenhall is one my all time fave actors. He is fantastic at playing ordinary people, usually underplaying by accentuating their flaws. A doleful look here, a wistful smile there and he's nailed it. Fantastic in Brothers, Jarhead etc. etc. But a Persian Prince? A flamboyant saviour of the human race? A kind of super hero? No way. It just doesn't work, it ain't Jake. Even looking at the promo pics he just doesn't look comfortable.<br/><br/>And then there is Gemma Arterton (who? I hear you say). Never heard of her before either , won't worry too much if I never hear of her again. Solid wood. No expression, no empathy, nothing. A mysterious queenly temptress? You're 'aving a laugh gov. There was absolutely no chemistry between Jake and Gemma – nothing, zero, zilch.<br/><br/>Even that great veteran of character acting, Ben Kingsley, struggled to salvage the plot and script though he was, in my view, by far and away the best thing about it.<br/><br/>So we have massive conquering armies sweeping across swirling sand deserts , a usurped and seemingly bitter queen, and the boy who was once the apple of his (adopted) father's eye becoming an outcast as he is accused of his murder. The journey that these two (Jake and Gemma) embark on to seek justice could have been the highlight of the movie, but it is just awkward, almost embarrassing to see them spar and dump, reunite and spar, etc. etc. Yawn. <br/><br/>Possibly the best action scene in the movie (and no doubt the ride we'll see soon at Disneyland) is Jake jumping off a high rock with two crossed swords on his backpack, looking for all the world like a male Lara Croft. It is almost as if the rest of the movie is simply in-fill to this climactic scene.<br/><br/>So many reasons why this movie doesn't cut it, yet the sequel is already in production.<br/><br/>Ah well WTFDIK."
"gts3000","3","31","68","23 May 2010"," Went in with medium expectations, ended up spitting my drink in pity
","I am usually quite a fan of films such as this for the enthralling fight scenes, but I have to say, this film was very poor indeed. The main thing that absolutely DESTROYED this film for me was the fact that the musical score was blatantly bought from iTunes for £0.79. It was just generic eastern music and didn't fit some parts of the film. Without trying to give to much away, at the end of the film there is a huge special effects extravaganza of awesomeness and some heavy metal there would of fit it in my opinion but the generic music played throughout! What else was hideously horrid was the fact that they all had English accents. Now, I'm a proud Englishman, about as English as a cricket bat and a fruit cake, but I realise this was a weird choice. And now for the worst thing about the film. The screenplay (as in the script) just wasn't up to scratch. The conversation, especially at the beginning was very disjointed, and whilst it picked up near the end it could have still been better but I think the actors did a good job with the absolute abomination placed before them. There are some good things about the film, however. I didn't think the acting overall was too bad and the fight scenes were well paced and exciting (but the music let them down in my opinion, maybe it's because I'm a fan of the Rocky series and used to amazing music in films, I don't know) and the special effects were really nice. Oh, and Arterton looked hot! All in all, maybe I am being a little to harsh but I have seen films done better for a budget 100 times less than this. Would I recommend to see it? Well, if you don't have to pay £4.50 to see it and waste a Tango Ice-Blast, then by all means, but be prepared to feel a little disappointed because I feel this film had potential."

","Jake Gyllenhaal is clearly having a good time as he portrays ""Dastan"" the adopted street-urchin son of the Shah of Persia. Along with the two true sons of the Emperor, they lay siege to the holy city of Alamut where the beautiful Gemma Arterton is the inviolable princess. Based on some dodgy intelligence, they attack and capture the city. When their furious father (Ronald Pickup) arrives to establish what drove them to this sacrilege, he dons a glittering prayer robe and mysteriously dies. Dastan, who presented it to him, is blamed. He escapes (with the princess) and tries to stay one step ahead of his pursuing former family - and of some ostrich-racing slavers before saving the world and proving his innocence by way of a magical dagger than can alter time itself. It's a great, action-packed little adventure feature with Ben Kingsley adding some theatrical ham as his wicked uncle ""Nizam"" and Alfred Molina as the man with the ostriches. You don't need to know anything about the game to watch - it's just good family entertainment with a good looking, if somewhat bedraggled, top biller."

It's interesting, full of combat as the games, with a good and entertaining plot which eventually leads to an exciting finale. What I don't like about it is the fact that it doesn't take itself seriously in too many scenes, leaving the impression of a parody and not a serious movie.

","I liked this movie very much, it fast-paced, fun and action packed. As a teenager, I was a big fan of the games and played them whole summer. It was nice to see moves from the game, such as when Dastan horizontally ran on walls. Humor was used in the right amount, the bandit who chose his career out of his adversity to government taxes was successful as comic relief. The bantering between Princess Tamina and Dastan was also engaging, without becoming banal. I agree that slow motion was used more than warranted. I found it less entertaining that the dagger kept on changing hands before it was finally claimed by Nazim. Those parts felt like the movie was just trying to fill in screen time. Another downside was that there was some unnecessary orientalism when Tamina was complaining how her beautiful city was invaded by ""camel riding"" Persians. Granted, Alamut is also an 'Eastern' looking city, however that makes her comments all the more bizarre since presumably her people too owns camels. I also wish they did not pick a blondish guy to personify the Persian King. (He looks more Viking than Persian, regardless of the amount of dark foundation on his face)."

","Prince of Persia is a really fun action adventure flick. While it isn't entirely void of flaws, a few missteps don't affect the movie much. The 3 core elements of the movie are, action, interaction between the main duo and the story. All 3 are quite good actually. The pace of the movie is about right, it's fast, but it's easy to follow. Yes this is a popcorn flick, but it's totally rewatchable and as just as fun each time.<br/><br/>So, I've been singing praise of the movie, but I might also shed some light on the flaws. First of all there is shaky cam during a number of action sequences, then there are quite a few slow motion shots that were added in post production without acrually using a high framerate camera (12fps stuff that looks bad). There is one bigger plot hole that is really difficult to explain without spoiling (which I would prefer to avoid). And last but not least, an enemy introduced halfway through the film is quite cheesy and cheese continues whenever that enemy is present.<br/><br/>All in all, if you want to watch something really fun (not necessarily very smart), I can't recommend Prince of Persia enough."

","This is one movie I'd definitely recommend to families with late elementary/middle school aged kids. It's not overly cheesy or dumbed down in my opinion. The casting is spot on too, Gylanhaal is perfect for the lead role and Kingsley sure is a great villain, very believable and fitting for the character. The dialogue is typical action/fantasy movie type stuff, nothing really surprising or anything that breaks the mold, but I didn't really see that as a bad thing, I received what I was expecting on the writing front and was happy with it. The special effects and visuals were pretty good looking, nothing that'll win many awards, but not fake looking or cheap by any means. The costume design was another thing I liked, Jake Gylanhaal's period piece costume fit his bodily Physique very well, and his body was very in shape for this movie, another reason he was good for the character. Gemma Arterton was good. The acting was overall good, and the entertainment value was definitely there, which is ultimately the sole purpose for this movie existing. This movie and other movies like this exist only for the purpose of being pure popcorn fun, entertaining the audience and giving them a fun ride to enjoy. And Prince of Persia: Sands of Time did that for me. 7/10."
"YourFamilyExpert","7","2","2","17 January 2017"," Serviceable summer fare
","Though fairly violent by Disney standards, Prince of Persia is nonetheless an agreeable fantasy adventure, recommended for families with older children and teenagers. Produced by Jerry Bruckheimer, who also brought us the Pirates of the Caribbean movies, Prince of Persia is not as good as the first film in that series, but superior to its sequels. It strikes a similar tone of comedy, romance, action, and supernatural fantasy, with Jake Gyllenhaal providing a dash of charm to go with his muscles and Gemma Arteron proving herself both lovely and graceful as a princess. Alfred Molina (Spiderman 2, Maverick, Raiders of the Lost Ark) is the best thing about the movie, stealing every scene he's in as an opportunistic sheik. <br/><br/>Think Aladdin meets Indiana Jones and you'll get an idea of the movie's tone. The action scenes are fantastic, the sets and clothing are exquisite. The story isa typically middle-of-the road summer movie story, but it never bores. As for potentially objectionable content, this film is roughly comparable to the first Pirates movie, so one can use that as a gauge."

Which is a rough retelling of the video game ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"", while incorporating elements of the following two sequels, as well as incorporating stylistic elements from the following game and the first three of the original trilogy. That's right! Based loosely on one game, borrowing elements from SIX more. The movie is stretched too thin, and it shows.<br/><br/>The movie feels like your prototypical ""sword and sandal"" action flick, borrowing heavily from films like ""The Thief of Baghdad"", and stories found in ""1001 Nights"". So think 'Arabian Nights', Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Aladdin, all mixed with some Steve Reeves 'Hercules' and Robert E. Howard 'Conan' flash.<br/><br/>Is it as cheesy as that sounds? YES! Is it as awesome as that sounds? YES!<br/><br/>But it's still well edited, well acted, well scored (Harry Gregson- Williams never fails), and overall well done enough to merit an enjoyable experience. he actors(Jake Gyllenhaal is one of the best actors from Hollywood and here he plays Dastan in his first big action movie), Gemma Arterton, Sir Ben Kinglsey and all of them are just great actors."

"joeravioli","7","2","2","30 January 2016"," Inconsequential awesomeness
","Although I haven't yet ceased obsessing about Mad Max: Fury Road, I have little patience for action films. As a late teen, and one raised on violence, cartoons, and the Internet, my desensitization was quick and irreversible. As a result -- despite requiring some time to form a capacity for unfettered critical thought -- I eventually realized that I find action films simply unbearable. Of course, every once in awhile I am proved wrong by action films that push the boundaries of my bias, but this is usually if the film in question is either technically brilliant or manages an emotional effect.<br/><br/>But there is nothing wrong with inconsequential entertainment, especially if said entertainment does not attempt to pretend that it is more than it is. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an excellent example of this. It is pure, silly fun, relying on clichés and stunts to carry its slipshod plot along to a satisfying conclusion. While this of course isn't what one would expect to be a ""good film"", I think that the film's ability to deliver on the expected while exercising effective creative restraint - never overstepping the limits of its genre - is worthy of appraisal.<br/><br/>I didn't know that Prince of Persia was an adaptation of a video game until I after I saw the film. As such, I'm sure that my expectations were higher than those of critics, and I find that low expectations often result in poor experiences. But it does at first feel like a video game, complete with fighting, running, simple problem solving, and excessively smooth and mobile camera-work.<br/><br/>However, the film leaves its video game visuals behind by the end of the first action scene, opting for a more conventional action style (with a few neat visual tricks). Although the plot is simple and goofy, and the acting even more so, the action scenes are relatively smooth and enjoyable. There is one scene - involving snakes - that is almost too good to be true, and another involving the craziest knife-toss of all time that left me grinning like a goon for the remainder of the film. I don't care if what I saw came from a video game, because as a teenager, I can say with absolute certainty that it's FREAKING AWESOME.<br/><br/>As bad as this film is, it is satisfying and fun, and that is really what action films should try to be."

","I have completed the game POP Warrior Within and POP The Two Thrones. I didn't play Sands of Time and haven't played Forgotten Sands either. But watching movie was really a fun for me. I have it on my computer and I watch it often. Normally, I like the movies relating time manipulation. The simple concept of manipulating time in POP is just to reverse it, no any traveling to past or future like in any other movies. This is the part, I like the most about it. I don't care its IMDb rating. No matter how much it gets, this movie will remain one of my favorites forever. <br/><br/>My first impression on Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan was not good. But as the story moved on, I found the character interesting. He was almost like the prince in the game, a good swordsman and an athlete. I guess, Tamina (Gemma Arterton) from movie is actually Farah from the game. (In 'The Two Thrones', when Farah meets the Prince, she didn't recognize him.) If I'm not wrong, there are many changes in the movie and it doesn't actually follow the game plot. However, the movie is absolutely fantastic. The costumes, backgrounds and acting were almost perfect. It has a good action sequences and visual effects. I don't know whether sequel to this movie will be made or not, but I'll always be waiting for that."

The humour was lame and over-used , acting from key areas quite poor, the soundtrack over-used and tacky and characters just not fitting the bill.

","As soon as I heard Gyllenhaal was put in the role as the Prince of Persia, I was excited as he has performed brilliantly in many serious dramas, but apprehensive because this was suppose to be an all action Disney film.... Oh yes I was right to be worried, this was utter trite, Gyllenhaal and Price of Persia have been Disney-fide (in a bad way) Gyllenhaal just relies on his wit and good looks (of which I was kind of put off by his long, greasy hair) and there is no depth to his dialogue, his English accent reminded me at times of Dick Van Dyke in Mary Poppins.<br/><br/>The funniest parts were unintentional for example when Princess Tamina who one of the 'worlds beauty' unmasks herself to the soldiers and they all stop and gasp in amazement...yeah she is pretty but not THAT much. This therefore added to the very unrealistic plot and at times I felt I was being spoon-fed information which was not needed; 'THEREFORE THE DAGGER USES SAND TO TURN BACK TIME!?', such information made the experience of watching very tiring and as for action, when it eventually comes, it had been so overly CGI'd that there is barely no actual on location stunts, very disappointing. This is up there with some of the biggest flops of all time, please do not make a sequel."
"dpac13","4","19","39","3 June 2010"," Yup. Games should definitely NOT be made into movies. Period.
","Like always, before watching any film, I checked its review on IMDb. Up till now, IMDb has been adequately dependable in movie-watching-decision-making.

Not only was the script as flawed as a Dan Brown story, but the acting just made matters worse. I do not remember ancient Persians having a British accent. But I guess I can let that one slide.<br/><br/>What really got me antsy was the flow of the story, or rather the lack of it. At one point, it felt like the editor decided to just give up and randomly collage the scenes together. Actors were conveniently appearing and disappearing in scenes as per the director's requirements.<br/><br/>Being a big fan of the video game, I entered the cinema hall with moderate and, what I thought were, appeasable expectations. But I think its quite clear that this has not happened.<br/><br/>However, there were a couple of stand-outs in Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina. Molina, in particular, was brilliant. Or maybe that was because he got all the punch lines.<br/><br/>All in all, this would be your 'meh!-nothing-to-do-lets-watch-a-movie' movie.

"SouthSideChgo","2","21","44","3 June 2010"," A Waste of Sand and Time
","There's a very good reason why SouthSide's chosen profession is reviewing live music instead of cinematic feature films. At least within the independent scene, there's a wide variety of bands/artists to discover and music to be heard. Something new and eclectic is always rocking' the stage. However it seems Hollywood today has yet to learn that especially with its current trend of crappy re-makes and turning video games into movies. Prince of Persia:The Sands of Time is a prime example of a movie ""based"" on a video game though not really like or about the game itself. Produced by the same duo who brought you Pirates of the Caribbean (Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer), this movie doesn't even earn the rank of ""swashbuckler"" like Pirates since it had no swash to buckle this reviewer into liking it.<br/><br/>The biggest problem with Prince of Persia (besides the noticeably lack of any Arabic/Middle Eastern actor/actress represented in this film) was the jumbled mesh of movie influences and clichés it borrowed to have a plot. The opening sequences had more sand than Lawerance of Arabia before jumping quickly into The Thief of Baghdad meets Aladdin. There's plenty of Matrix-like action scenes mixed with campy Pirates of Caribbean leaps and swings. Honestly, do we need point of view shots from an arrow's prospective? And how could they think no one would notice the Lion King reference (brother plotting against brother for his throne and kingdom - he's definitely no Scar, folks)? The Romancing The Stone love interest banter between Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and Tamina (Gemma Arterton) was so nauseating that SouthSide nearly shouted - ""KISS HER ALREADY!"" - at the movie screen. Plus the National Treasure and Indiana Jones references and clichés were so obvious than the booby traps near the end of the movie. Also toss in Star Wars zen-like references and characters ...whew, this is so exhausting while spotting the many movie references that SouthSide will stop here. There was nothing original about the swashbuckler part of Prince of Persia ...it doesn't even deserve the title of action/adventure. Sorry, those days of cinematic scores, thrills and action/adventure (i.e. Captain Blood, Mark of Zorro, Robin Hood - not that current Russell Crowe crap) are long gone. Those examples and many more truly emulated the essence and spirit of what a swashbuckler movie was.<br/><br/>Next, Jake Gyllenhaal isn't what you would call a ""swashbuckler"" hero-type for this movie. It was so confusing watching him trying to handle the suavity and charismatic charm (like Johnny Depp's Capt Jack Sparrow) and the bright-eyed, diamond in the rough hero (like Orlando Bloom's Will Turner and Aladdin) at the same time. In SouthSide's opinion, he was playing it straight ...so serious as he could as if he was reverting back to Donnie Darko. There was no charm ...no sense of him being a hero to cheer for with his unfunny one-liners mixed within Dastan's script. Gemma Arterton was essentially boring as Princess Tamina. She tried so hard to have that spunk and fire (like Carrie Fisher's Princess Leia and Jasmine from Aladdin)that there was none to be found whenever she shared the screen time with Jake. There was NO real chemistry ...this reviewer felt their ""love/hate"" taunting were shot separately to save time (and money). Also SouthSide feels that Sir Ben Kingsley's superb acting talent was totally wasted as the baddie brother, Nizam. This role was really beneath an actor of his quality ...not his best outing. And Alfred Molina - *sighs* - his character was totally unnecessary as an ostrich race promoter/tax evader (who knew ostriches were common in Persia). He was the ""Han Solo"" of the Prince of Persia with his silent (and rather hunky) ""Chewbacca"" who ONLY has a few lines near the end of the movie! SouthSide found herself rooting for the Hassassins since they were the only characters that she found worth interesting - wouldn't mind snuggling up with the guy who charms/stares at snakes.. AND what's up with the FAKE British accents switching to American and then back to British throughout this movie?!?! Shouldn't we sound like Persian with some sort of Arabic dialect? UGH - SouthSide wishes she could turn back time and stop herself from agreeing to review this movie for the team (and you know who you are! She's sending you the therapy bill soon).<br/><br/>Overall, SouthSide hopes (and prays) there isn't a sequel to this movie. Seriously, this isn't a really a movie franchise that deserves one since the ending summed it up with MORE FREAKIN' SAND! There's nothing left ...however, this is Hollywood and sequels rule the box office (sometimes). SouthSide's afraid Disney and Bruckheimer are probably working on Prince of Persia 2: The Revenge of Nizam.<br/><br/>UGH - what a sickening thought ...bad SouthSide!"
"emmabrunyard","1","25","54","25 May 2010"," Bad film, and spoilt the game
","After being a huge fan of the game; Sands of Time, i was excited to hear about the release of the film. I expected the film to differ slightly from the plot in order to damaticise the film and to extend the time, however the film did not stick to the plot in the slightest and the ways in which the sands are released and the sands create hell are not included, and the sands do not actually cause any bad reactions. The acting however was good, and if you haven't played the game and would like a film similar to avatar in levels of action and romance then go ahead. But in my opinion the director has killed the game and should have at least looked at the plot of the game before making a film. For me it was a complete let down but hey, what you gonna do."
"TBJCSKCNRRQTreviews","5","25","54","22 May 2010"," Is that all you've got?
","Yes, my response to the team behind this, and an example of the clichéd and trite lines found in this. Nothing in this stands out. The Disney-fying of this only gave it the worst that the brand has to offer; without being compelling, it plays it so safe that you may fall asleep. Oh, I didn't. I watched it for one reason; quite frankly, I cannot get enough of the games. Because of that, I was able to enjoy it somewhat. Will those who haven't played them not be entertained? Tough for me to say, but if they like the concept, I can imagine that they will find parts cool. This is a leave-your-brains-at-the-door Summer blockbuster, though it doesn't provide the thrills that those are meant to. Oh, it's fast. There's plenty of action, too. The problems? The characters are just barely there(no connection between them, or them and the audience), everything is predictable, half the humor falls flat, and while this can look pretty nice(the CGI is fairly well-done, if so devoid of emotional impact that it is quickly forgotten, and there is an over-reliance on it), there isn't a single image in this that will take your breath away(isn't that a record of some sort? Seriously, it ought not to be possible to point a camera in any direction in Morocco and not produce an impressive visual). Fights are entirely too short(yes, there are quite a few... quality over quantity, guys), and they(along with the parkour and such) are filmed poorly(at times, you have no idea what's going on), taking away from the excitement that this can achieve(and does now and then). Acting is hit and miss, even from people you'd expect better from. There are obvious miscasting decisions to draw people in(Gyllenhaal? Really? I like the dude, still, are you being facetious?). Arterton is not as stunning as the reactions to her suggest, if she is attractive(and almost as willing to show cleavage as Farah is). I think the choice of director was wrong, as well; this is one of the only things I've seen by him, however, he doesn't seem to know how to do this type of flick. The leads distinguish themselves merely through being annoying in slightly different ways. Dialog is unremarkable. The spirit of the franchise(there are elements of all three titles of the recent trilogy) is present at points, and there is fencing, stunts and exotic weapons and locations in this. Plot-wise, it's average. I don't know about historical accuracy; with that said, I wouldn't bet money on there being much of it here. Sequels? It certainly leaves room for them. Well, I wouldn't rule out that they'd have to reboot and do it properly before it comes to pass. About the racism that I've heard several argue to be in this... it would have been appropriate to have it star people who actually come from the region. I'm not sure we should be surprised that they didn't dare. Body of Lies did better. So did The Kingdom. Couldn't they be classified Hollywood(with a little effort)? Come on. What would Walt say if he was to be thawed up right now? There is a lot of mild, occasionally bloody violence and a few crude jokes(they may go over children's heads) in this. I recommend it to those who badly want to see aspects of the VG's on the silver screen. 5/10"

There was nothing about his character Dustan (the Prince in the game never got a name, go figure) that made me want to jump from my seat and cheer ""You go boy!"" He was too obnoxious for my taste and Gyllenhaal isn't what I would call the hero-type. And what was with the 2 hours of Arterton and Gyllenhaal's characters teasing each other. If you were there with me, my fellow readers, you would heard me constantly screaming at the screen ""JUST F--- HER ALREADY!"" I mean really, what was all that about? Why do bullets and arrows need their own point of view now in days in movies? That was just too much for me, you can keep your silly SloMo but there's no need for the over the top PoVs.<br/><br/>Once again, I'll spare you readers from my wrath of hate for this monstrosity.

","The Sands of Time? A mythical dagger that can turn back time? A sandstorm created by the Gods that will destroy humanity? All sounds a bit rubbish, doesn't it? Well it is. And isn't. For all the silliness of the story and convenience of the plot, Persia is remarkably fun, thanks to the unhinged action set pieces which rotate through at a terrific pace. Have the characters been talking nonsense for over a minute? Never fear, in about 15 seconds Dastan will be doing something cool. Like free running on the Persian rooftops or climbing a wall using freshly shot arrows. Or maybe even battling with a whip-wielding assassin or his sword swinging brother.<br/><br/>Costing somewhere in the vicinity of $150m, it's not hard to see where most of that cash went. The CGI is tremendous – the only noteworthy flaw being in the penultimate sequence which can't completely handle its larger scale – and undoubtedly enhances the ambitious action scenes. The moments of slow-mo increase excitement but thankfully aren't overused whilst the fighting and running choreography is suitably uncontrolled and free ranging, you'll never guess how Dastan gets his way out of some situations. It's a credit to the director and crew that they've produced such adrenaline-pumping action that the ridiculous script is hardly noticed.<br/><br/>Not an actor you would instantly think of for a role like this, Gyllenhaal makes a wonderful Dastan – following the recent trend of studios choosing known actors (Depp, Bettany, Downey Jr, et al) for their blockbusters rather than typical action stars – with his wry humour an integral part of the casting success. The road to stardom continues for young Brit actress Arterton (Clash of the Titans and Quantum of Solace) with another decent performance under her belt, her incessant vocal jousting with Gyllenhaal shows major confidence. Kingsley chalks up an additional wooden, one-dimensional portrayal for the sake of a paycheque and the other experienced cast member Molina isn't as humorous as intended as the morally dubious sidekick.<br/><br/>In true form for a Bruckheimer movie, Sands of Time has little substance but makes up for it with more bang for your buck.

I found that to be VERY annoying.<br/><br/>Sorting through all the tiresome hype and relentless BS and focusing on the movie itself is refreshing at this point. The film suffers on a few fronts. One, there is little emotional connection between any of the characters (especially the limp romantic emotional misfire). Two, everything not CGI stupidity simply saps the energy gained by any action scene. Third, a lot of those action scenes scream ""overkill"" to me. The same ideas and effects used over and over equal boring. Think movies like 2012 or the last Mummy flick. There are flaws in logic literally from the one minute mark through the entire running time but I guess everyone expects that in most summer popcorn these days."

","In this visually stunning fantasy-ride we follow Dastan in ancient Persia. PoP is a fun popcorn movie that is capable of entertaining a bored person for 2 hours. This movie doesn't aim to be historically correct nor does it take itself too seriously. Yes, events do happen in the convenience of moving the plot forward. But to be fair, PoP is an adventure film aimed at the younger crowd . And in that respect PoP does do a decent job of making a movie with great visuals, humor, creative fight scenes and an overall fun storyline.<br/><br/>I haven't done a deep analysis on how true it stays to the video game, but it was cool to recognize elements of the video game (been a while since I've played it). Although this is a movie released by Disney, people do get killed (no blood is shown). Best advised to follow the PG-13 rating. 6/10"
"claudio_carvalho","9","11","21","21 August 2010"," A Delightful Adventure
","In Persia, in the Royal City of Nasaf, the fair King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) rules the empire with his brother Nizan (Ben Kingsley). Sharaman has two sons, but adopts the orphan Dastan that becomes part of his family. Years later, the Holy City of Alamut ruled by Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) is under siege of the troops led by Tus (Richard Coyle), Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), after their uncle Nizan had intercepted a spy carrying weapons manufactured in Alamut. Dastan invades the city with his men to avoid a massacre and the Persian army conquers the city. Dastan gets a dagger from an enemy and King Sharaman comes to Almut very upset with the invasion of the holy city. Then he arranges the marriage of Dastan with Princess Tamina. When Dastan gives a holy cloak delivered by Tus to his father, the mantle is poisoned and kills Sharaman. Dastan is accused of betrayal but he escapes with Princess Ttamina. Sooner he finds that the dagger is a powerful device to travel and change time and that Tus is not the traitor and he engages with Tamina in a quest for justice. <br/><br/>""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is a delightful adventure that gives a sensation of nostalgia from the times when movies were just for entertainment without the necessity of sex scenes or graphic violence. The use of CGI is excessive in some moments, but never replace the great performances. The story and the screenplay are excellent, full of action and humor, and the motive for the invasion of Alamut is a clear joke with the invasion of Iraq by USA. The art direction is carefully detailed and set decoration is awesome with locations in Moroco and Pinewwod Studios in England and David Belle that created the Parkour is responsible for the stunning choreography. Gemma Arterton is extremely beautiful in the role of Tamina and Jake Gyllenhall is a great surprise performing a funny hero of an action film. Their chemistry is wonderful and this movie is a magnificent entertainment for the whole family. The music score of Alanis Morissette is awesome. My vote is nine.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): ""Príncipe da Pérsia – As Areias do Tempo"" (""Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time"")"

There was no thought put into the effects and there certainly was no thought put in to the writing. The action scenes are weak simply because they scream cartoon.

"Sparrowmaniac","8","7","12","30 May 2010"," Finally, a video game movie to be remembered!!
","Like millions of people, I am too a huge fan of the Prince of Persia Video Game series. When 2 years ago, it was announced that Prince of Persia: Sands of Time was going to be made into a movie, I totally disappointed that arguably the best game of the series was going to be made into a movie, and people will totally hate it. It was further compounded with the fact that Gemma Arterton was going to be the Princess Tamina (Farah, in the game) and Jake Gyllenhal was the fabled Prince. But come last October when the first trailer came out, it seemed really impressive. <br/><br/>UBISOFT did it right when they sold the rights to Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer Films, rather than the usual distributors. Sands of Time stands alone as a movie, and you need not play the game to enjoy it. It follows the general premise of the game, but the makers have added some more middle east folklore to make the movie interesting, like the addition of the mythical Hassansins. <br/><br/>The movie is visually stunning. The special effects as expected is top notch. It was a joy to see some of the moves which a player can make the prince do in-game, shown on screen. Jake Gyllenhal for all his critics did make an impressive Prince Dastan. Gemma Arterton also didn't do a bad job, as Tamina. A huge turn off though was the accent being used by the actors. The story is set in medieval Persia, and Gemma Arterton and Ben Kingsley are speaking in perfect British accent. That was something that could have been rectified. But this is one fun popcorn loving movie, which can be an ideal getaway from your daily lives for 2 hours."
"MovieManPat","Null","12","24","30 May 2010"," An enjoyable summer film, but ultimately forgettable
","I've never been much of a video game player. I tend to mash buttons and swear loudly while playing Mario Bros., so anything beyond that, I tend to stay away. However, back in 2005, a good friend let me try Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. I was enamoured. It suited my button-smashing style though it slowly forced me to learn how to play the game properly. I really enjoyed it because the puzzles were challenging. the villain was great and the story was pretty decent.<br/><br/>So when I heard that uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer was going to make a big-budget adaptation of the movie, I was thrilled. Of course, video game adaptations have never fared very well on the big screen (I'm looking at you, Super Mario Bros and Ecks vs. Sever), so I had a little trepidation. When I saw the first trailer, I was a little underwhelmed. The movie looked good, but I didn't get a sense of what it was about.<br/><br/>The story is fairly convoluted. Jake Gyllenhaal plays Dastan, the adopted son of the King of Persia. After helping his brothers and uncle Nazim (Sir Ben Kingsley) attack an conquer the holy city of Alamut, he comes into possession of a dagger. Later accused of killing his father, Dastan flees with Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), leader of the city of Alamut. She reveals the dagger has the power to turn back time, which, in the wrong hands, would be very dangerous. There are betrayals, battles with mystic assassins, and copious shots of Arterton's cleavage. However, all this doesn't amount to much.<br/><br/>The film is an enjoyable diversions. The action is well-choreographed and well shot, even if director Mike Newell (Donny Brasco, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire) goes a little overboard with the slow motion shots. The whole film is relatively well shot, with some sequences lifted directly from the source video game. However, the story is overly complicated and there is no ""money shot"", no big action sequence or iconic image that lingers in the viewers mind when they're walking out of the theatre. Honestly, by the time I got home, I'd already forgotten half the movie. Kingsley seems to phone in his performance as the conniving Nizam, bring no menace to the character. He's more petulant than evil.<br/><br/>What little did stand out was good. Alfred Molina as a scheming sheik who runs an ostrich racing racket was one good thing. Molina steals every scene he is in, going from silly to menacing with the turn of a word. His colleague Seso, a skilled knife thrower, is also impressive. Gyllenhaal does what he can with his role, though most of it seems to just require him to run and jump entertainingly, while flashing his most impressive torso. Arterton is good as Tamina, but again, is hindered by the story and dialogue, which is heavy on exposition throughout the movie. Gyllenhaal and Arterton may have had some great chemistry on screen, but the fact that both are tasked with explaining everything kills that and slows the movie down at some points. You kinda just figure they're going to wind up together.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a decent summer movie. It provides the right amount of thrills and laughs, but is ultimately forgettable. I doubt anyone will be talking about it by August."

","Prince of Persia - The Sands of Time is a fun and adventurous movie. If you want to go to the movies to see something in this category you will not be disappointed. If you are concerned about the gore factor there are a few fighting scenes but they are done in a Walt Disney fashion. Rated M in Australia.<br/><br/>I made the mistake of reading some of the other reviews from this website and others and went in expecting cliché after cliché...they are there, but the fun and adventure keeps you entertained. All actors in my opinion played their parts well and if I was asked to fault the movie I would be speechless so just enjoy."
"darthchris19","6","6","10","11 June 2010"," A true prince of Persia movie!
","I have played all 3 prince of Persia games (that last one is not with Dastan so I will not count it) and when I watched this movie I always said during the picture ""Hey that was in the game too!""<br/><br/>When the movie finished I said to myself ""is it that hard to make a decent movie inspired by a video game"". The answer is obvious and it is hard, because it is not easy to make a movie for fans and for people who like movies at the same time. But if someone thinks they cannot do that just do not do that (we all remember street fighter and mortal combat). Mike Newell did a solid job in directing but the cast was a mixed bag. Jake Gylenhall surprised me in his role, because I thought that he would suck, but he did not and he portrayed the acrobatic Persian prince very well. Gemma Arterton however failed to deliver. Her character changed from a noble princess to an annoying snobbish girl in a blink of an eye and I did not like it. But I have to admit she was very beautiful in this movie. But the biggest surprise was Alfred Molina! He portrayed the tax-avoiding sheik who delivered humor in this tale and it helped the score I gave a lot. Who would knew he still had it in him?! And the special effects were also very decent and up-to date.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of the best video game adaptations so far and is rivaled only by Resident Evil (the first one anyways). I suggest this movie to a hardcore Prince of Persia fan and to someone who likes Pirates of the Caribbean type adventure movies. <br/><br/>my score: 8/10"
"jeshj316","8","6","10","10 June 2010"," Not just another video game movie....
","Well, few of the hyped video game movies released in last couple of years, Max Payne (which actually induced maximum pain to sit through whole movie), over hyped under delivered Residence Evil-Degeneration and passable Tekken. Of this genre, Prince of Persia is the best I have seen in recent past.<br/><br/>This movie is everything which its promise to be - entertaining, enthralling and remind you the video game. Bonus, it has a story as well, which I was not expecting at all. If you'd have played the game, you know it's more of a jumping, acrobatic prince you're handling than sword and hand-bomb actions. Movie gives you the same dusty game like feeling, remember you have to make prince jump from pole to pole, roof to roof in the game; you'll find a lot of that in this movie. <br/><br/>On critical side, movie has underplayed bond girl Gemma. Her role could have been more glamorous as Princess Tamina. <br/><br/>Take away - refreshing and entertaining"
"avedicg","9","6","10","8 June 2010"," Not gold, but definitely silver
","It is certainly not the best movie based on a video game but it is amongst them. Prince of Persia brings us an interesting story, somewhat similar to that of the game but adapted for the silver screen. Adding more characters, such as the two brothers of Dastan(our prince) and much more background story regarding these given characters was only a necessary sacrifice. I am a great fan of the video game and i must say, i quite enjoyed this.<br/><br/>The story follows Dastan and Tamina(the new and improved Farrah) in a journey to stop Dastan's uncle(Perhaps the Vizier?) from destroying the world by unleashing the sands of time with a magical dagger. Although the story is not spectacular in any way, the screenplay is written with wits and unexpected(sometimes) situations. Time traveling and its consequences has been one of the screenwriter's most favorite topic and it has transformed into somewhat of a cliché but this movie makes no exaggeration. <br/><br/>The acting was not fabulous but it was not disappointing either. I believe Jake Gyllenhaal proved he is more than a mid-class actor and as for Ben Kingsley, i was gladly surprised he still had it in him.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a good fantasy-adventure film, with a bit of comedy and action as well. We have to give them credit, we don't see many of these every day. Give it a try, you might not be disappointing. <br/><br/>I give it a 9/10."
"xamtaro","8","6","10","5 June 2010"," Could this redeem the sad state of video game movies?
","Video game adaptation movies never had a good track record, especially so following 2009's critically panned financial failure ""Street Fighter: Legend of Chun Li"".(Gamer does not count). But Prince of Persia: Sands of Time looks set to break that trend, boasting a blockbuster level budget and a screenplay by the original creator of the video games himself, Jordan Mechner. Mr Mechner had stated that he did not wish to do an exact translation of the ""Sands of Time"" game onto the big screen, but instead ""taking some cool elements from the game and using them to craft a new story"". The result is a fun summer blockbuster romp that is remarkably true to the spirit, look and feel of the video game franchise.<br/><br/>Progressing at a breakneck pace, the plot may seem convoluted but is actually no more confusing than an overblown adventure story straight out of the forgotten ""Arabian nights"" genre of films. Similarly, the story plays on the audience's expectations of predictability and then shatters it; just as one expects that Dastan is about to clear his name, a new unexpected revelation is thrown the audience's way. Smarter than your average blockbuster, Prince of Persia does a respectable job of fleshing out its theme of brotherhood. That trust between the three royal brothers is put to the test as each suspects the other of treachery. This plays on the viewer's expectations of the typical ""Jealous other sibling who wants the throne for himself"" type of story but manages to believably turn it on its head with some well placed twists. The seemingly ""convenient"" turn of events and ""coincidental"" happenings or ""lucky breaks"" that this movie is littered with may seem juvenile at first, but really play into the overall theme of ""destiny"". Every action done, every person met and every convenient plot hole was MEANT to happen in order for Dastan to fulfill his eventual destiny at the end of the movie.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia's lighter elements seem to come from its characters, both in skin tone and in dramatic development. True to its Arabian adventure roots, each character is simplistically depicted; the hero is a handsome hunk, the feisty damsel is exotically beautiful, the villains look genuinely sinister and so on. The impeccable cast does a wondrous job in ""becoming"" their roles and delivering one solid performance after another. A point of constant criticism of this movie was the lack of actual middle eastern actors as opposed to the mostly British cast selected for this movie. What some might forget was that Charlston Heston was not Israeli when he starred in ""Ben Hur"", nor was Yul Brynne an Egyptian when he played the role of a Pharaoh. It can be argued that Jack Gyllenhaal is as ""Persian"" as the American actors who played Sinbad or as Tom Cruise was German in the film ""Valkyrie"". Looking past the apparent racial dissonance of the cast, one could come to appreciate their earnest performances. Of particular note is the chemistry between Dastan and Princess Tamina which may call to mind the ""wise cracking scoundrel/haughty royal woman"" relationship between Han Solo and Princess Leia from ""Star Wars"".<br/><br/>Like any good summer blockbuster, Prince of Persia is delivers a hearty mix of action and humor. Unfortunately, director Mike Newell seems to favor ""jerky cam"" shots as a way to make his action scenes feel more frantic. This seems to work for some scenes, such as Dastan's incredibly choreographed rooftop ""Parkour"" sequences but renders other scenes, like the sword fights, rather difficult to follow. There are also points in the movie where our heroes traverse the great middle eastern deserts within moments and hop from city to city as if Persia itself were no bigger than Singapore.<br/><br/>Nitpicks, simplistic characterizations and its seemingly rushed nature aside, Prince of Persia is a worthy addition to that near extinct Hollywood-made Middle East fantasy genre. Its rich narrative is peppered with wit and the familiar charm of old period pieces while themes of trust and destiny are woven into an apparently familiar plot that is really as unpredictable as Dastan's own fighting style. Fans of the video game may thrill at seeing key scenes and signature combat moves faithfully recreated in live action on the big screen while casual viewers can enjoy a fun, refreshing and energetic adventure movie that might soon become regarded as the best video game adaptation to date.<br/><br/>7.5/10 round it up to 8"

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time, as a fan of the games franchise since the early DOS versions, I loved the film, as no matter how much odd it sounds, but since then, I had always wished Prince of Persia to be a movie, and then later since Sands of Time, the game franchise took a different and fantastic take over our beloved Prince, and so did my wish, and in 2010 my wish was complete, and seriously speaking, I enjoyed it to the fullest. Even if we consider this has an independent film like any other action-adventure, it still is a fantastic movie.<br/><br/>Of course, my rating is just 7/10, with all this appreciation of the film, that is because I have rated it according to what it actually stands. Frankly speaking, it was not a huge epic like LOTR or 300 nor was it fantastically remarkable like any of the ones those are so much hugely rated, but it certainly makes it mark in many other fields such as CGI, acting, directing, etc., but mostly in action. It is surely a flawed movie, but nonetheless an fun ride to Persia. The background score is awesome, and so much of what I anticipate for the setting of the movie.<br/><br/>As a fan or as a general moviegoer, the film delivers what it means to, and does it ""beautifully"", and without a doubt is the most best VG-to=- Movie genre film yet, and has set up a huge bar for the genre with the all others following no where close, with only Resident Evil series and Silent Hill tieing up for the second and third place (according to me), but that too very very far from what Prince of Persia has done.<br/><br/>As a fan and a general moviegoer, I suggest it is a must-watch and thoroughly entertaining.<br/><br/>I hope my review is helpful, Thank you."

The trailer gives an impression to avoid this movie but you will be surprised when you see the movie. I was not bored or thrilled so much but entertained for nearly 2 hrs. I never thought Jake can carry out the role this ease. I thought Jake was a bad choice to play this character but he played it with ease. I never played the game and so I never knew much about prince of Persia when I entered the theatre but the movie kept me entertained. Gemma did a good job in her role and she looks good too. I personally thought the chemistry between the lead pair is good.The movie has no great dialogues or interesting plot twists at the same time it doesn't fail to keep you engaged.<br/><br/>Get your friends, buy a popcorn with coke and enjoy the film keeping aside logical thinking.

","Alright, so being a huge fan of the game I went into the movie already knowing exactly what happens. I went with a friend who had no idea about the story, and I think he may have even enjoyed it more than myself by the feedback he gave. I can't help but wonder how I would feel if I hadn't played the game. It may be even better than the 7/10 I have currently given. A second viewing down the road will be a must.<br/><br/>I also went in with expectations that it would be a solid action movie, and nothing that will necessarily be revered. In short, if you don't want to read on, I was not the slightest bit disappointed and neither will you.<br/><br/>This isn't to say that it's without it's little blemishes though. I would describe the film much like a beautiful, funny pet dog, sometimes straying from the path ever so slightly, but the leash does it's job and makes sure you stay completely engaged and pulls you back where you should be.<br/><br/>There are several moments in the movie that flirt with greatness, if I may be so bold to say so. This film had an uphill battle from the beginning, because it basically had to stretch about 20 minutes worth of cut scenes from the game into a 2 hour adventure. I don't think it's much of a surprise that the greatest parts were those ripped straight from the game, left completely intact. This is truly testament to how great it was.<br/><br/>The film crew does an excellent job at executing these parts, and it is extremely satisfying for someone like me. So could it have been a better film as a whole? Sure, but you would be completely greedy to expect it. The fact of the matter is, the crew made the first good video game adaption. Can you believe it? If they stick to it (and it makes enough money), I can see sequels surpassing it for sure. I wonder which direction they will take the story though?"

If you're a fan of the films that Jerry Bruckheimer produces, chances are you will love this movie. I have to admit though, the group I was with didn't enjoy it. They felt there were too many characters, too many different things going on at once,a tad too long, and they didn't like how it ended. All of these are partially true but I still liked it.

It had a storyline that was straight to the point and Gemma and Jake had very good chemistry together.

","I went to view this despite hearing somewhat negative reviews. I was expecting the worst and boy I was wrong!<br/><br/>The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time totally blew my expectations out the window. When I saw the first trailer on T.V, I couldn't help but chuckle seeing Jake Gyllenhaal in this completely ""out-of-character"" role. It's fair to say I see him as the sensitive type, but not in a negative way. He completely transformed himself for this role and good for him! He was completely believable as the protagonist ""Dastan"" and i must commend him on an almost perfect British accent. Gemma Arteton was captivating as the feisty princess and Ben Kingsley put in a good turn as Dastans uncle. Afred Molina was especially hilarious as an Ostrich tamer. <br/><br/>I was gripped throughout the film with it's interesting twists and turns. It has a bit of everything, mainly action followed by fantasy, with a romantic sub-plot and various comedic moments. Something for everything. I think the ladies will especially enjoy Mr Gyllenhaals new image.<br/><br/>It was a perfectly fun blockbuster. The cinematography was beautiful. The music, fantastic. You must stay till the end as during the credits Alanis Morriesette sings the title tune ""I Remain"". A perfect conclusion to a beautiful movie and the next big franchise."

"nesmacias","6","11","22","26 May 2010"," Nice Pop Corn Movie
","I just watched the movie and i have returned home with the sensation this movie was worth the money. But it is only worth it if you expect deadbrain entertainment. Do not sit and wait for a big and twisted plot, a nice romance nor matrix-like fight scenes. Worst of all is the Disney seal you can see in nearly every frame of the movie. Best of all is the Disney seal as well. Let me explain: while you won't see any real blood on any of the sword fight scenes i thought the way this movie teaches us the Disney moral terms was pretty fun. The one chosen for this endeavor is Alfred Molina is who really steals the show, always having a laughing moral term to tell; taxes ""Sadam has nucular weapons""... The main drawback is the princess. Despite she plays a fair role, she isn't so pretty as she is supposed to be. I also missed Ben Kingley: he could have added so much more depth to his character that i really thought i was watching the old style bad guy from the B movies.<br/><br/>All in all, the movie was fun and entertaining, pretty fun and pretty entertaining, but nothing more than that. If you don't expect to be thrilled by the plot, you can watch this one and have the same sensation i had when i left the movies that i hadn't been taken. <br/><br/>For the Prince of Persia Vgs there are lots of cameos from the first to the last of the series, but it's not really a Prince Of Persia VG came to life."

I can't imagine how hard it had to be for the director of this movie to make a whole movie from a plot from a game where the only thing you do is almost.. climb, jump.. and kill!

","I went to watch the world premier of the new Jerry Bruckheimer summer ""blockbuster"" - prince of Persia The sand of time yesterday at Starcity in Birmingham UK.<br/><br/>Some spoilers below.<br/><br/>All I can say is what a load of rubbish ! I was so let down by the film. The acting by all in the film (including Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton & Ben Kingsley) was really really bad - at times I thought I was watching a comedy sketch making fun of bad actors. The comedic part of the film played by Alfred Molina was terrible - the jokes just did not work.<br/><br/>The special effects (as you would imagine) were great and some of the fight sequences were good - but there was no plot - except everyone fight to location 2 then to location 3 then back to location 1.... really bad.<br/><br/>No one cared who died or lived in the film - both brothers (Toby Kebbell, Richard Coyleand) and father (Ronald Pickup) did nothing to support Jake Gyllenhaal - which I think really showed in the overall film. These character really needed to help support the main character to give depth, but this was just not the case.<br/><br/>And Ben Kingsley as the main ""bad guy"" was soooo bad. They really did not build his character up as evil at all - one small act does not make a terrifying foe for the hero of a film.<br/><br/>Although I got free tickets for this event (thank you sky . com) - I was totally let down by the film. Really really disappointed."
"oshahos99","4","19","43","25 May 2010"," Bruckheimer needs to take a course on making his plots less convoluting.
","It seems all that Bruckheimer is doing nowadays is copying all his old movies, renaming a few characters and plot elements here and there, and re-releasing the movie under a different name. This time, he's moulding the underrated Prince of Persia video game franchise (a classic game franchise BTW) into his stock Pirates of the Caribbean script.<br/><br/>The plot is your standard early-90s video game plot. Orphan boy (Gylenhaal) becomes King Sharaman's (Pickup) prince, much to the dismay of the King's brother (Kingsley). Kingsley, intent on seizing power, seeks to retrieve ""plot device"" from guardian, the guardian in this being a hot, young Princess (Arterton). Prince becomes attracted to Princess and sends Prince on a mission to retrieve said ""plot device"" by venturing across Persia (which seems to translate to Middle Earth). In this case, the plot device is a crude time machine that's shaped like a dagger (I wonder how much Bruckheimer wasted on the prop department for that?)<br/><br/>This film is litigiously similar to the first Pirates of the Caribbean. The characters are the same, the story is the same, the fights are the same (only the clothes are different in this movie). This film's Sparrow is played by Molina, this film's Bo'sun is played by Toussaint, Gylenhaal and Arterton obviously transpose Bloom and Knightley, the three-Sparrows scene is now an ostrich race. The film includes a Nazgul-inspired hassansin force, and contains at least one Indiana Jones like booby trap scene that makes you want to scream ""Only the penitent man will pass"". This is where Bruckheimer's strength lies, his wide assortment of likable characters filled with humour and chemistry (albeit a little gimmicky), and he places them in enjoyable adventure scenes which thrill and make you laugh.<br/><br/>Hampering the movie is what hampers all of Bruckheimer's recent work. He has no clue on how to glue his plot ideas into a coherent storyline. Remember Sparrow repeatedly siding with Norrington then double crossing him in Pirates? This film is so packed with such double crosses / betrayals / alliances with the enemy that by its halfway, you have no idea who is the good guy and who is the bad. But who cares as long as there is sword fighting going on? (A: all non-Bruckheimer fans) The effect these double crosses have on the plot makes it so convoluted, that you might as well give up on the story by the time they reach the Mount Doom scene. Bruckheimer tries to make up for it by having plot dumps every 10 minutes (exacerbating the plot convolution), but he now has to reduce the segway scenes to a single panorama, then the 3-5 minute scene (lots of scenes don't help the convoluted plot).<br/><br/>Bruckheimer needs to learn to cull his films more. If a scene is making the plot convoluted, you should cut it, not try to fit it in between two scenes which break the continuity. Not every scene has to make it into the final movie. You'll also make the movie shorter (quite important because Bruckheimer films are among the longest).<br/><br/>Another convoluted film which will entertain Bruckheimer fans, and fill his bank account again."

","I didn't go into Prince of Persia with any expectations and I came out really enjoying this popcorn flix. It doesn't take itself too seriously but it's not silly either. I don't know anything about the video game and I guess that's good because I wasn't biased by it. The acting is mostly very good. Ben Kingsley always makes a good villain and Jake Gyllenhaal makes a decent action hero. The sword fighting scenes are really good and it moves along really well. The plot is simple to follow and at least doesn't insult your intelligence. It's also a nice love story that doesn't get in the way of the action. It's about out makes a family, blood isn't everything and true love does conquer all."
"TheLittleSongbird","7","3","4","2 May 2011"," Entertaining film
","This film I see has had a mixed reception. I am inclined to think that while it is flawed it was an entertaining and above average film. As I've said, it is flawed, the film is rushed sometimes, I personally would have liked more room to breathe, the script does have its weaknesses, some of it could have been more witty and less wordy and banal though there are some funny moments, and while I don't think Gemma Arterton is a bad actress-she was brilliant in Tess of the D'Urbevilles her chemistry with Gyllanhaal is rather dull and her character was quite vapid.<br/><br/>However, the visuals, cinematography, costumes, special effects and sets are all excellent, as is the rousing music and exciting action sequences. The story has some nice nods to the games but is essentially a stand-alone which I didn't mind at all, and for me it was a not-too-predictable and fun story. The direction is serviceable enough, and the acting apart from Arterton is good and the characters if slightly unoriginal and under-developed fun. Jake Gyllanhaal is a handsome and likable lead, Ben Kingsley is excellent and Alfred Molina steals the show.<br/><br/>In conclusion, I thought it was entertaining albeit with flaws. 7/10 Bethany Cox"

"jeddjong","6","4","6","26 March 2011"," Prince of the Theme Park
","In 1989, Jordan Mechner created the first Prince of Persia video game on an Apple II. Since then, the video game franchise has come a long way and is one of the more successful and recognizable titles in the industry. Jerry Bruckheimer Films acquired the film rights to the 2003 video game Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time and now it's a Disney blockbuster.<br/><br/>Prince Dastan (Gyllenhaal), an orphan from the streets of Sixth Century Persia, is taken in by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) and his brother Nizam (Kingsley). Dastan takes his place as the adopted brother of the two sons of Sharaman, growing up as a Prince. Now adults, the three princes lead an assault on the Holy City of Alamut, suspected to be the site of several forges where weapons for enemies of Persia are manufactured.<br/><br/>In Alamut, they encounter Princess Tamina (Arterton), the guardian of the Dagger of Time. The wielder of the Dagger can turn back time and only he is aware of what happened. Dastan is framed for murder at the victory celebration, and escapes with Tamina. Neither likes the other a whole lot, but have to cooperate so that Dastan can prove his innocence and Tamina can safeguard the dagger.<br/><br/>Along the way, they meet Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), an ""entrepreneur"" who runs an ostrich-racing syndicate. Amar assists Dastan and Tamina in traveling to a sanctuary where the dagger can be safe. They are ambushed by Hassansins, treacherous hired killers skilled in a variety of deadly arts.<br/><br/>It is revealed that Nizam is behind the scheme and plans to use the dagger to turn back time such that he and not his brother Sharaman would be the true king. Dastan and Tamina thus have to prevent the dagger from falling into the hands of the evil Nizam.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time sets out to be an epic, sweeping adventure. There is some spectacle, several good action sequences and well-choreographed fight scenes. Despite this, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time feels more like an average Hollywood actioner dressed as a sword-and-sandals tale.<br/><br/>It is more than obvious that the film's main purpose is to try to replicate the success achieved by Disney and Bruckheimer's previous venture, the Pirates of the Caribbean film franchise. As such, comparisons are inevitable. Unfortunately, Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time does not feel as refreshing and swashbuckling as the Pirates of the Caribbean films, especially the first movie. It had a bigger scope, took greater risks filmmaking-wise and really broke more ground. Elements of other Disney films are readily recognizable: the street urchin-turned prince from Aladdin and the evil uncle from The Lion King, among others.<br/><br/>The film boasts a cast that can be best described as ""interesting"". Indie darling Jake Gyllenhaal may seem the furthest thing from a marketable action star, but he is very charming and likable as Dastan. Gyllenhaal's dedication is also evident in the amount of muscle mass he gained to play the Prince, providing plenty of eye candy in what is not a typical ladies' film. Gyllenhaal performed many of his own stunts, including swordfighting and parkour-style jumping across rooftops. Who knows, this may be the start of the Brokeback Mountain guy's mainstream movie action star career.<br/><br/>It is a bit of a pity then that his leading lady doesn't exude the same kind of appeal. The casting of Gemma Arterton seems to be inspired by choosing fellow English Rose Keira Knightley as the leading lady of the Pirates of the Caribbean films. Arterton is stiff and shares little chemistry with Gyllenhaal, and looks nothing like the perceived image of a Far Eastern princess. There is a scene where Tamina removes her veil and the whole room gasps at her beauty-while Arterton is somewhat attractive, that's incredulous at best. I would have rather a Bollywood beauty be cast as Tamina, someone like Malika Sherawat, Frieda Pinto or Katrina Kaif.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley is excellent as a mustache-twirling evil uncle, and it is no surprise at all when he is revealed to be the villainous mastermind-that eye shadow should be indication enough. Being half-Indian, he definitely pulls off the Middle-Eastern look better than many of his co-stars.<br/><br/>It is Alfred Molina who steals the show as the comic relief. His character Sheik Amar is greedy, shifty and untrustworthy, but somehow Molina makes him utterly likable, relishing the chance to ham it up just a little.<br/><br/>Filmed partially on location in Morocco, the film possesses a hint of the exotic. However, the film feels culturally and historically ambiguous, especially since everyone speaks with a crisp British accent. Also, the audience can easily tell when the action moves to the sound stage, and, unlike Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest, it's not going to win an Oscar for Best Visual Effects-or anything else, for that matter.<br/><br/>That being said, the film is undeniably good fun, and is really something the whole family can enjoy (a good measure of violence keeps it from being too juvenile). Just keep one eye closed to the faults and go along for a theme park-style ride."

","Arabian nights, princes, princesses, shiny cities and lots and lots of desert sand. Story wise this film is more or less a typical fairy tale one: handsome prince comes to the rescue of handsome princess and during that process there's battles and blood.<br/><br/>Films based on games usually end up to be a complete waste of tape. This one doesn't do quite that bad, but it could have been a fair deal better too. I must admit I only played the very first Prince of Persia game and this film doesn't seem to take too much from that - apart from the acrobatic jumping around. Not bad, it works, and the storyline used for this film is good enough to keep it entertaining.<br/><br/>One bad thing that struck me was the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as the Prince - his style and looks really do not fit what one would expect of a battle hardened prince. I love his roles in many films but in this one he falls out of place a bit too much.<br/><br/>The good things about the film include the humor which is in many places completely out of time but entirely fitting to the film - it gives the film just that bit of extra it needs to become pleasurable.<br/><br/>All in all, 6 out of 10. It's an enjoyable watch but forgotten five minutes after leaving the cinema."
"doctorsmoothlove","4","16","36","25 May 2010"," Another bad video game film (but better than most)
","Preface: The new adventure film Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is based on a video game of the same name that was released in 2003 for all major platforms. The game is cited as one of the best titles available on multiple counsels (of its time). The title Prince, ""the most famous middle easterner in video gaming"" was first introduced in 1989 as a PC oriented take on platforming gameplay made popular by Super Mario Bros. a few years earlier. The franchise lay dormant for several years later after a failed foray into 3D on Sega Dreamcast and was reintroduced with the Sands of Time trilogy.<br/><br/>I'm saddened to write another film review discouraging people from seeing a film based on a video game. This may be the best of the lot, occurring nearly twenty years after the genre was introduced by the film adaptation of Super Mario Brothers in 1993. And like many of its cousins, the movie pushes credulity (even for its video game origins) too the point of absurdity. The main attraction of the game was turned into a deus ex machina contrivance in an effort to attain blockbuster clichés. The film version of Sands of Time effectively ignores the first game's placement in a series and throws elements of all three games together in one lumpy mess. It's been edited (expanded) to nothing more than the Prince saving Persia from his traitorous uncle.<br/><br/>Nothing has time to unfold as either moviegoers or fans of the game would like. Those who have not played the game will not like how they are bludgeoned with well-executed but relentless action sequences. Some of these are done in real time without the addition of too many digital effects. They are the most memorable parts, and you'll know which they are. Video game players controlled the Prince through a variety of obstacles as they guided him to an objective. Completing the game did not require all enemies to be defeated, and it was sometimes favorable to leave them be. The film Prince is as cunning as any video game player but too rash. Our hero was determined and fearless yet shrewd. He would disapprove of his representation here.<br/><br/>I did enjoy how the film's fights were staged, even the hallucinogenic CGI ones. The platforming element of the game was replicated very well. We see the prince run along walls, jump from place to place, and use his dagger to reverse the flow of time (see title). Admittedly, the dagger is the worse part of the movie. It grants its holder temporary time travel, and the screenwriters failed to translate it properly into the story. There are two narrative purposes to it that are laughably bad. The film ends with the dagger being corrupted and magically sending the Prince back to the beginning of the movie where he apprehends his uncle and experiences the mandatory happy ending. This is the kind of comedic retailing of a story I would expect out of a youtube or newgrounds parody. I got another chuckle when I read on Wikipedia that the film was delayed due to the 2008 writer's strike.<br/><br/>I was hoping this would finally be the one game-to-film adaptation I could freely recommend to anyone. It's another failure, and I now think the great game film will be a low budget adaptation of a non-mainstream game. I can see a film noir being made of Hotel Dusk: Room 315. Film studios, I beseech you, buy the movie rights to a recently released well-received game that didn't sell very well. Let someone be forced to craft a satisfying film out of it and release it in few locations.<br/><br/>30th of 2010 Not Recommended ):"
"bezaad@aol.com","3","11","23","30 May 2010"," This Movie should've been titled 'Prince of Hollywood' & not 'Persia'
","Even though I was disappointed with a very bad opening of the movie I kept watching because, well, I am a Persian and had to see the movie about my country. However it was evident from beginning that the 'Prince of Persia' was not much about Persia but more about Hollywood. So here is my take of the movie: 'Prince of Persia' suffers from lack of character and plot development; audience are forced to understand the interaction between characters without prior explanation. It also suffers from incoherent action sequences, for instance in some shots the actor Jack Gyllenhaal jumps in the air in dangerous situations and in the very next shots and without any explanation he is in a safe landing. According to an article in LA Times, the creators of the movie had no idea of what they were working on. The director of the movie, Mike Newell confesses ""I didn't know 'Prince of Persia' at all."" I would not have expected anything better from someone as clueless about Persia as Newell, but the producers felt Newell was good because he directed English story 'Harry Potter' movie, a subject that was familiar to the British born Newell. Since the movie 'Avatar' I have been comparing other movies and other movie creators to a new standard in movie making called 'Avatar'. While rare people who made 'Avatar' are professional story tellers who are also concerned with the intelligence of their audience, others and majority of movie makers in Hollywood consider their audience bunch of simpleton morons who should be satisfied with any nonsense thrown at them."

","I went to a screening of this earlier tonight despite reading for the most part negative reviews for this film. I bit my ignorant tongue, and I went anyways because the majority of the reviews I read said at least it was entertaining. And it was some of the time, but unfortunately for me there were and are too many things wrong with the beginning and middle of this film for me to love it. I asked myself ""why?"" on several occasions in regards to the plot, the director's use of slow motion, the use of characters, the Hasassains in general, and the Emu racing ""entrepreneur"" ( lame attempt to replicate Jack Sparrow). For the most part, the acting was great that goes without saying mostly everything that was going on around them was not. Like the critics said, Jake proved that he could wear the role of the action hero well. Another thing worth noting is that the ending scenes of the movie were an overall significant improvement compared to the previous hour and fifteen minutes. From a suspenseful knife throwing and needle shooting fight into the last scene before the credits roll, I was entertained. Overall, this movie is not worth paying $9.75 to see in the cinema. Save your money and catch it in two years when it will be playing on TNT before POP 2 comes out. Hopefully, they will fix the problems and live up to the potential of what their first movie could have been. It is really easy and frustrating watch and see where POP could have been SO much better. It made me want to leave, and play the game on my PS2. I would have had more fun watching someone play the game that this movie was based on."
"ajs-10","7","9","18","22 May 2010"," A great adventure...
","As a player of the original video game, back when computers were clunky and slow, I was quite interested to see how the Prince has evolved. I wasn't disappointed; a lot of the moves and mythology from the original game survives in this film. Obviously the graphics are much better, and the film isn't too bad either.<br/><br/>Dastan is an orphaned street urchin when he is taken in and adopted by King Sharaman, who has seen something he likes in the boy. He grows up alongside the kings' two natural sons, Tus and Garsiv who treat him as an equal even though he will never inherit the throne. The king's brother, Nizam is with the three brothers when they approach a city that the king has told them not to take. Nizam tells the brothers that a spy has found evidence that the city is making weapons for the Persia's enemies. They take the city and Dastan comes into possession of a mysterious dagger that everyone seems interested in. Princess Tamina, who rules the city, also wants the dagger, but to protect it. The king comes to the city and is murdered, seemingly by Dastan. Fleeing for his life, he takes Tamina with him. That night, he discovers the dagger's secret, it can turn back time, but only the person holding the dagger is aware of it. This makes the dagger a very powerful weapon. It will only work for one minute though before the sand is all used up. The magical sand is hidden below the city and if it is released, it will destroy the world. Can Dastan discover who really murdered the king, and can he and Tamina keep it safe from those who would use it for evil? Well, since I don't want to spoil the ending, I'm not going to tell you right now.<br/><br/>As with previous Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer productions, I'm thinking of the 'Pirates of the Caribbean' films, there plenty of swashbuckling action. It's a very well made film, as you'd expect with some very good special effects. Decent performances from all of the main cast, Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan, Gemma Arterton as Tamina, Ben Kingsley as Nizam, Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, Steve Toussaint as Seso, Toby Kebbell as Garsiv, Richard Coyle as Tus and Ronald Pickup as King Sharaman.<br/><br/>A special mention for Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, his comic role reminded slightly me of Robert Newton as Long John Silver. There was plenty of action, although I felt the ploy of running and jumping over rooftops was a little over used. Over all a very entertaining film with some great action and a pretty reasonable story, a great one to take the kids to! Recommended.<br/><br/>My score: 7.0/10"

","Perfectly banal and overwrought, with CGI and other special effects that move at the speed of light and make a crap load of noise, but are completely incomprehensible in terms of understanding who is doing what to whom or why any of it matters. Jake Gyllenhaal is hunky and pretty in Arab drag, but he and all the other actors are basically just collecting their paychecks; apparently no one told Ben Kingsley that it was all essentially a big joke, because he occasionally tries to transmit an actual emotion, which makes him look ridiculous (even more than all the mascara he was wearing) in the context of the others who are literally cartoons. Richard Coyle is arguably the worst, but the inevitable ""princess who must be saved and screwed (Gemma Arterton) is an utter, irremediable dog and my eyes bled every time she appeared on screen."

","This movie is one scene of: flipping through the air; fights; escaping; getting caught; and then starting all over again for the next scene which is more of the same, usually in the same order or close to it. You can literally take this combo-scene and duplicate it ten more times with some corny segues in between and it is the whole of the movie.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time at the box office... rent this plot-less action-fest at Redbox for a buck and you'll be glad you saved the other $9 for beer.

","""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is the movie version of the very popular game franchise, ""Price Of Persia"". The movie, in addition to dealing with the childhood of Prince Dastan briefly, showcase the journey of Prince Dastan of Persia and Princess Tamina Of Alamut Kingdom as they fight against great odds to prove the innocence of Prince Dastan for the murder of his father and the protection of the sacred Dagger of Time against malicious seekers.<br/><br/>Cast-wise, it goes all wrong. Frankly speaking, Jake Gyllenhaal is not at all suited for the role of Prince Dastan. He did give a gutsy performance, but I guess it was far less from sufficient in my vision. Gemma Arterton is a great beauty, but I feel it was possibly the worst casting mistake of this decade. She doesn't have the authority, loyalty, sense of prowess etc of a princess, who is supposed to rule a huge sacred city, Alamut. Her acting was that of a young girl, who is always excited and doesn't seem to exhibit a bit of intelligence. I really feel she need a reality check, as it seems being part of high budget films like ""Quantum Of Solace"" and ""Clash Of Titans"" has made her over ambitious and foolish. Sir Ben Kingsley didn't mesmerize in his pivotal role, seems he is accepting every role coming his way, irrespective of the fact whether he can do justice to the role or not. Toby Kebbell of ""RocknRolla"" fame also disappoint big time.<br/><br/>""Price of Persia: The Sands of Time"" seems as a movie made because there were no previous attempt made concerning the game franchise. The whole casting, screenplay, acting, action...everything disappoint big time. Seems everything was hurried with the point of making a summer blockbuster, something that didn't happen considering the much less anticipated box office returns.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Price of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is a failure. I can't think of Walt Disney Pictures continuing the series with the dismal cast. Another reboot might be worth taking, but it involves huge risk for any production house. Let's hope for the best, otherwise I don't want to be served cold coffee again with the promise of its counterpart.<br/><br/>My Verdict: 4/10"

Then my son mentioned to me that it was a Disney film so it peaked my interest level up. Slow and drum in the beginning but it gradually sped up and turned out to be a so-so movie with loads of special effects. The storyline here has taken many liberties on the original storyline in the game, as far as i can remember that is. Good cast that has Jake Gyllenhaal in the lead pulling of an English accent perfectly.

I thought it was well acted for a tongue in cheek type movie. I mean , you don't go to movies like this looking for Shakespeare, and quite frankly Shakespeare is boring. Too many people who haven't even seen it are trashing it as a flop based on box office receipts which aren't doing bad at all, last time I checked it was over 120 million(this includes domestic and worldwide). Too many movies get bad mouthed simply for box office receipts when most times they do well overseas. The US is not the only market people. And the stupid comments that this movie is racist or bigoted are unwarranted about why aren't the actors of the race they are playing. Do any of you not understand the word acting ? it's called playing a part .And how may people of persian descent are decent actors. Geeze. I mean it looked good to me, why do people analyze , for any movie like this , you must suspend any link to reality - if you don't your foolish. It's fiction treat it as such.

Since his Brokeback days, Gyllenhaal is a man of many talents – he does his own stunt work. In this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal, best friend and brother to the late great Heath Ledger, lives up to his name. With an incredible cast Sir Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina and the director who brought us Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire Mike Newell, this movie beats all other Walt Disney films by a landslide.

","If you like your movies fast, handsome, colorful, but at the same time deprived of any coherence,unfolding itself with the help of staged action pieces filled with corny characters, than this Prince of Persia may be right down your alley.<br/><br/>I understand that those types of flicks are being made merely to provide some kind of escapism for a viewer for a couple of hours, but it's nice when you can invest your time in the story and make some connection with what's going on on screen.<br/><br/>I mean after we have been exposured to this dagger that can move back time for the person who possesses it at the moment, movie's plot completely loses remains of any credibility. Whoever will die and whatever will happen later on, you know that it may all be turned around when our hero will push a ""button"" on a dagger. And let me just tell you that there is a lot of pushing button in the movie.<br/><br/>Main evil character played by Sir Ben Kingsley is suppose to turn around bad in about half of the movie's running time, but you know just when you look at him for the first time that he will be there for no good. As this movie is generally about attacking, killing, framing and generally evildoing(without sex, cursing and blood, this is PG13) you need to have comedic relief, and taking into consideration that blacks weren't much popular at those times(although we have one heroically dying here too) we got Alfred Molina playing according to those principals.<br/><br/>So what is in PoP to look for? You can say that arresting landscape, as it was shot on location in Marroco, but yet again there is so much CGI effects here that you cannot really tell what is real and what's not.<br/><br/>And ending of the movie, which I will not give away is very frustrating and plays against audience showing that you can come for the first 15minutes than leave and return for the last 10 and you will literally have seen whole movie.<br/><br/>So when people like to compare which movie based on video game is the best and where this one ranks on that list, I like to point out that it's poor choice to begin with."
"kenny_wolfs","9","11","25","23 May 2010"," Prince of Parkour
","Just returned from the theatre where I watched the PoP-movie. I must start of by saying I am biased when reviewing this movie, but the PoP-trilogy is the only game I ever finished (apart from God of War I and FFX). All others made me lose interest after a few levels, so I absolutely love this series.<br/><br/>But apart from my gaming history, I really liked the movie. Does it contain a lot of depth? Does it contain the best worked out characters, Not really, so why a nine? Because that is not what one should expect from such a movie, which more drives on atmosphere, scenery and action.<br/><br/>In the beginning the movie starts a fun adventure, with drunk and dashing Dastan even reminding me a bit of Jack Sparrow. He loses this edge though later in the movie, when he turns into a more serious character out to save the world. The ostrich races also attribute to the light hearted atmosphere in the beginning of the movie since running ostriches are just plain cool and funny animals.<br/><br/>However, around 30 minutes in the movie, the real story begins with the time traveling dagger. These time travel effects are quite impressive, and I momentarily can't think how else you could have portrayed them in this movie. However, there are only four or five time transportations, which is kind of a shame since I expected more.<br/><br/>Another special effect are the parkour moves from the Prince of course. These are present throughout the entire movie, and even though sometimes it is a bit hard to follow what is happening, they stayed close to the game when it comes to the prince's moves.<br/><br/>The plot is quite predictable after around 45 minutes, but that doesn't bother me in these kinds of movies. These movies aren't really made for plot twists anyway. The only thing I didn't get is that they predicted the world would end if they released all the sands, but instead, the Prince is returned to before everything started, instead of the world ending. I didn't pay all attention at this point, so maybe it's clear if I rewatch the movie.<br/><br/>Last of all, I want to say something about Jake Gyllenhaal and Ben Kingsley. Ben puts a great performance here once again, from minute one he radiates something evil, although that could also have to do with the fact this is how evil Persians are portrayed now (bald men with eyeliner). I never really noticed Jake Gyllenhaal, but after this movie I have become a fan, especially in the first 30 minutes where he's playing the fun loving Dastan.<br/><br/>I didn't think this was a bad movie, but one should enter the theatre with the right mindset, sitting back for some mindless special effects action."

","This is a fairly open and shut film and your enjoyment of it will depend on what kind of film you like to watch. if for example you are willing to let slip completely shallow characters, poor plot, muddled story-line, bad dialogue and poor writing in general you might want to book yourself a ticket with the hope that at least the action sequences will be well choreographed and shot and that the special effects will be passable. Let me warn you NOW film fans, DO NOT MAKE THAT MISTAKE, do not part with your cash. For If it is the rule that big budget films must at least be visually engaging with good action scenes then this film is the exception to that rule. i will start simply by saying that the action scenes are so poorly shot you won't be able to follow what is happening. Secondly the characters are so poorly realised and explored that you won't care about anything that happens to them. thirdly the plot is so confused and reliant on the dagger device and the sands of time that the film itself gets muddled in the laws of its own fantasy and buckles. the biggest sin of all here is that the whole film for all its bang and all its buck is just BORING, and not sporadically boring but consistently boring and dull. I can understand people liking transformers, a big part of me loves watching robots smash each other, the kid in me loved watching quadritch jump out of the exploding bomber in a mechanised suit of war on avatar.. this film however is just unforgivably boring considering its subject matter, way too ambitious and just buckles under its own weight, the film is like a desperate stand up comic; desperate for approval but dramatically failing in its increased effort. don't waste your time on it."

","Back in 2003, Ubisoft made a wonderful story around an action and puzzle filled video game. Where you play a prince who is assisted by a princess/slave girl named Farra. The basic video game hook was a dagger that could reverse time and thus save your character from multiple deaths. Fending off sand zombies in a labyrinth palace maze the game plot was very riveting.<br/><br/>First I will state, the only elements to survive the game and was incorporated into this movie are the dagger and the prince. Farra is replaced by a different princess and we only see the dagger used four times in the whole 2 hours of the movie. While the game has the prince battling mystical monsters brought forth by the sands of time, no such action takes place in the film. The game has some very challenging puzzles that make you want to play again and again. No such mental puzzle solving feats appeared in the movie.<br/><br/>The movie, apart from the game, was just a run of the mill action flick. Something you might enjoy watching once and will be tossed on the shelf to collect dust. Nothing really stands out, the acting was nothing to rave about, the special effects were average for a Disney movie, the sword fights and acrobatics was less than expected, and no great revelation was made. Personally there has been worse done with the video game to movie genre.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a below average rating because I would expect better from Disney Studios. Lately it seems everyone has lost their imagination and cannot create something original. Today they resort to remakes, sequels, and borrowing from old video game plots. If they must resort to pulling stories from video games, at least stick to the elements that made the game great."

Bring on the sport rock. When did that rubbish become desirable? I was interested enough to watch the film because it looked like a decent cast; but I should have known that Bruckheimer was behind it, making it all bigger, dangit, bigger! And louder! More sand! More swords! Those tits aren't big enough – hoist 'em! And so we all get exactly what we deserve: a poorly thought-out ""epic"" in name only.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton are both likable actors, but here, very much a second-rate Luke Skywalker and Princess Leah combo, being pulled through the labyrinth of the plot as if by a piece of invisible wool. Their characters reminded me of fruit in British supermarkets: it looks like a strawberrybut it doesn't taste like anything in particular. Alfred Molina stole (saved!) the show not only with the best lines, but with the film's only really funny delivery.<br/><br/>I've never seen such appalling editing in a major Hollywood film. Clearly the director often couldn't be bothered to show how an action set piece developed from shot to shot – so they just show the character, now in one place (e.g. leaping across columns), now in another (just arrived on a racing horse), and these obvious 'logic' gaps strip the film of believability. Of course, that's what happens in video games too, isn't it? No pesky explanation shots keeps things moving faster for all those goldfish-attention spans. I thought the point (if there is one apart from profit) of bringing a video game to the big screen, was exactly to fill in all the bits the video game leaves out, to generate some magic up there. But no one cares about its faults – the makers are so busy making money and looking at future merchandising and franchise options.<br/><br/>If scripts are bad and over-referential now, imagine how awful they'll be when future scriptwriters have material like this to refer back to. And I'm not even going to begin talking about the consistent 1950s-style casting of anglo-saxon white people as Persians. It's not as if this film is a first for that; and besides, what fan of this film would care anyway? I feel soiled and used."

","Having played many of the instalments of the Prince of Persia gaming series, I must say I was quite looking forward to seeing this film. Although it has to be said that I never really expected anything from it. I thought that going in with low expectations would be enough to get me through it, unfortunately I was very wrong. The film begins with the backdrop of a desert sunset and some very shaky digital writing, which may have been engineered by a child. The film then proceeds to introduce a whole host of CGI blunders in the form of snakes, slow motion back flips (every 2-3 seconds) and out of body time travelling experiences, culminating in an almost laughable shot of our hero surfing on a wave of CGI sand making lots of macho noises reminiscent of the Williams sisters in a Wimbledon final.<br/><br/>The film then proceeds to show us an ancient map of the world, zooming in upon Persia, patronisingly explaining to us that there once was a place called Persia...blah blah blah. This was a sign of things to come, with the film casually stopping to explain the plot at least every 5 minutes. This was clearly made an issue due to two things. The first is that the film is based upon a game, so there is no clear narrative and it does in fact feel more like watching someone play a video game. The second is an attempt to keep the children in the audience up to speed with the non-existent plot. There are ways of doing this that do not patronise your audience; a brilliant example of which can be found in Peter Jackson's 'The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers', in the scene where Faramir and his captain review there position on a map and make a plan. This helps the plot development, keeps the audience up to speed and doesn't patronise the audience as Mike Newell does. This also makes the film feel repetitive, which is then not helped by seeing the same fight scene replayed over and over again, followed by the same awkward 'almost' romance scene where our prince and princess exchange witty banter, explain what 'must be done' and are then interrupted.<br/><br/>Even with this films decent cast including a certain Ben Kingsley, it cannot be saved from its ultimately dull screen play, poor visual effects and non-existent plot. I firmly believe that this film was doomed to fail as soon as it was confirmed as a live action movie. I really believe that Disney and Bruckheimer could not resist the prospect of another 'Pirates of the Caribbean' cash cow, so they made it live action, when by rights it should have been a cartoon. All of the cheesy nonsense that we are subject to in this film would have worked if it was shot as a classic Disney cartoon. This would of course been forsaking seeing the beauty of both Gemma Arterton and Jake Gyllenhaal who I have to say are very well cast, as is Ben Kingsley who (spoiler alert!!) plays the most obviously covert Thunderbird villain of all time. If you watch this film with any expectations what so ever you will be disappointed, but if you want a fun film to take the kids to on a bank holiday I would recommend it...don't worry they will have no problem keeping up with the plot."

Jake Gyllenhaal is beefed-up eye-candy and sports a cut-glass English accent (is this Jake, or has he been dubbed?), but his Prince is a cardboard action man. Gemma Arterton is even blander eye-candy. Ben Kingsley's villain is straight out of 1950s children's television. The CGI is great, especially in the climactic cavern scene, but the movie stands up poorly in comparison with franchises such as The Mummy or National Treasure, which have more pace, more action, better scripts and simply deliver more fun.

But you know what that amazing video game didn't have? Stale, tired Hollywood clichés. <br/><br/>So now we come to this movie. Does it follow the (amazing) storyline? Nope. Does it follow it loosely? Nope. Are there one or 2 elements in the movie that come from the game just so they can claim that it's Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time? Yes, it is. You know what this is? Just a pretty cheesy adventure film. Let's see what's common between the source and this derivative. The fact that there's a dagger that can turn back time. A few action moves. And the twist ending (I'm being VERY generous with this one). <br/><br/>What does this movie mainly have? Just about every Hollywood cliché in the book. The quirky protagonist with the sappy back story and humble beginnings, the love interest who doesn't like our hero initially but later falls in love with him, the evil uncle who kills the hero's father (Lion King anyone?), a comedic relief character, pointless chase and action scenes etc etc. And what's with evil uncle anyways? He's bald, has a goatee, has a dark shade under his eye. Why did they have to make the villain so friggin obvious? I've seen more subtle Disney bad guys. Sheesh! Oh yeah, and the movie has a typical happy happy ending.<br/><br/>I can just imagine the scenario of the producers coming up with the idea for this film. <br/><br/>Producer1: 'Hey got any ideas for a new film?' Producer2: 'Hmmm... well I saw nephew playing this game called Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time. It would make for another great lazy video game adaptation!' Producer1: 'Cool. What's it about?' Producer2: 'I don't know. Some dagger with sands in Persia or something. Who cares? We'll just get some rookie story writer to slap together a lazy plot and we'll market it to the unsuspecting video game fans and the other people who don't know anything about this Price Of Persia' Producer1: 'Brilliant! Money will fall on our laps like snowflakes.'<br/><br/>To be fair, the movie is a bit entertaining. But that doesn't cover up for all the plot holes, lazy writing and general predictability. Hollywood can do better. They just don't because everyone pays for stuff that's generic and therefore easier to make. If you want to watch a cheesy adventure film, go ahead. If you're like me and are expecting the complex, layered and dark plot of the game, you better avoid this."

","If anyone out there listens to just 1 review in their entire lifetime let it be this one. If you find yourself thinking ""Hey maybe we should watch Prince of Persia"" turn around run into a wall as hard as you can and I promise it will be time better spent. There is not 1 moment where this movie is remotely interesting, the script, acting, directing are just horrible. One of the worst viewing experiences of my life! This makes The Scorpion King look like Citizen Kane. I haven't even finished watching this piece of trash yet but I am forced to let the world know of this mockery of my 116 minutes that I can unfortunately never get back."
"Davidon80","4","7","16","8 June 2010"," Bad on every conceivable level.
","Now I'm not one of those movie goers that gives 1/10 for movies like 'Jingle all the way', and 10/10 for a movie like 'The Matrix'. No, I believe that I am a balanced critic that can see most movies for what they are. Which brings me to Prince of Persia, a movie I saw yesterday. How I wish I spent my hard earned cash on anything but this. Even the opening titles looked cheap and hastily edited, where was the Bruckheimer razzle dazzle that we were used to.<br/><br/>I'm actually a fan of Bruckheimer, I can run of a list of his movies that were half decent or quite good, though POP is none of the above. Let's begin with the bad as that would be a lot easier: the story is wafer thin, the actors all have cockney accents including the Princess, and why would the Prince of Persia speak in Cockney. Yes acceptable for a video game but on screen, embarrassing. <br/><br/>Then the acting, Kingsley it seems has made a niche for himself as Hollywood's Shakespearean trained darling, when in fact this is the man who makes crap like The Love Guru and Species. Someone please see him for what he is, which is an overly paid East end of London boy who struck gold starring in Gandhi. Then Jake Gyllenhal, oh Jake, a fantastic actor though his best scenes in this movie was when wearing a hoodie simply because seeing him play an Arab with long flowing Herculian like hair and a cockney twang just killed his actor status. Gemma Atherton, very volumptious and lovely lips but need to stop confusing acting with whining or crying. Empire magazine said that the Ostriches in POP were in danger of winning the award for best acting in the movie, nuff said. <br/><br/>What about the action? Well it is no where near the quality we have gotten used to, it would be foolish to even put this anywhere near a comparison with Gladiator or 300. Mike Newell is no action director, but by this he is also pretty bad at directing drama as well. For a summer block buster there are no great set pieces, no real explosions and Persia is shown as merely deserts and two castles. What did they spend the budget on other then Jake Gyllenhaal? Having seen movies getting bigger and more ambitious in recent time, the shoe string feel of this movie is like a throwback to the literal swords and sandal days of the 50-60s but without the charm or the mystery for the unknown. <br/><br/>Plot ? Well what may work perfectly for a video game doesn't ever translate to movies, I defy anyone to prove me wrong on that. And POP is no different, Bruckheimer may be able to make a movie out of a theme park ride but video games are still proving tricky.<br/><br/>Now the good. The movie is purely action driven so to that end some may be entertained, but we're talking kids type entertained. Some of the stunt work is commendable but ruined by slow mo's that obscure the depth of the scene and thus robbing the movie of ifs one potential plus. Finally it's a movie of a video game so fan boys will be pleased, a few anyway.<br/><br/>In conclusion those expecting solid entertainment or even mindless fun will be sorely disappointed. Those expecting a fun video game adaptation will be left unsatisfied. Stay away by all accounts."
"anarresa","5","7","17","29 May 2010"," Silly Bit of Action Fun
","I saw this as part of a double feature, had no expectations going in. It is probably the most exciting and stunning film a 12-year-old boy has ever seen, for an adult it's silly and fun and utterly unrealistic.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it.<br/><br/>Here's my issue/warning: I thought it was the Middle Eastern twin bother of In the Name of the King: A Dungeon Siege Tale (I had to go look it up, neither movie is that memorable). For reasons I don't quite understand people HATED that movie. This movie has all the same characteristics: lots of special effects fighting, special effects landscapes, impossible anatomical movements, ridiculous evil characters, PG romance, PG family tensions, no sense of history or travel, creative fighting tools and techniques, a silly sense of self, light comedy, respectable but smaller-name actors. I actually thought it was going to have the same writers and director, but no. Prince has a slightly bigger budget which led to bigger fake landscapes, but that's about it. If you hated the King movie I can't imagine you'll like this, but the reverse is also true, if you enjoyed this you really should like the King movie."
"Jackpollins","5","7","17","28 May 2010"," Not bad, not great, just kind of in between
","With all the crap littering the screens lately, I am neither fortunate nor unfortunate to announce, while not a good movie, Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time is better than most of the crap littering the screens lately. It's a muddled mess, sure, but with Robin Hood boring up the screens, you could do a lot worse. It's simply disposable family entertainment. This is based on a video game, and is one of the best video game adaptations I've seen, which is far from saying much. The film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan, a young orphan from the streets who was adopted by Nizam (Ben Kingsley). Gyllenhaal and Kingsley, usually two fine actors, are bland here. The show really belongs to Alfred Molina, who steals every scene he's in as Sheik, who helps Dastan on his quest. He's unpredictable, delightful, and brings some much needed comic relief to this film. Just like Robin Hood, the old fashioned stuff doesn't work in Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time, it feels too put in. Prince Of Persia: Sands Of Time would look better on the big screen, but a great cast can't ever save this film, so you can probably just skip it because it won't be worth the money paid to see it on the big screen & it won't be effective enough on the small screen."
"karleto","1","4","8","15 December 2013"," I was UTTERLY shocked and disappointed about how woeful it was
","When I first heard the announcement of this movie I was IMMENSELY excited, being a huge fan of the game franchise, I simply couldn't wait to see it on the big screen. Even though a lot of people were skeptical about the actor who was cast to play the Prince of Persia (Jake Gyllenhaal), I was actually quite happy with the choice, there may have been a better option but to be honest I was more than happy.<br/><br/>However, when the moment of truth came upon us, and I finally saw my 2003 childhood game adapted into a (2010) block buster film I was UTTERLY shocked and disappointed about how woeful it was. Now, I GUESS I can see people who haven't played the game(s) enjoying the film. But for those who have and who were avid fans of the franchise, I tell you, it was HORRIBLE!!! It was honestly as if the director knew nothing about the game AT ALL. I pictured the director asking someone ""what the game was about?"" and someone answering saying ""well, it's about the Prince of Persia who finds the Dagger of Time and with it he can go back in time using the Sands of Ti-"", director: *cuts him off* ""OKAY, THAT'S ALL I NEED TO KNOW!!!"". Then he starts scribbling down the script at super fast speed.<br/><br/>Obviously I'm exaggerating a little, but still. And when I say ""a little"", I literally mean it. The ONLY thing that was remotely kept (but not kept the same/ accurately) was that he was the Prince of Persia, he had the Dagger of Time (and I forgot if they used the actual Sands of Time or if they used normal sand), there was an evil Vizier, and of course Farah (his lady), and that's pretty much it Oh, and the fact that his father dies. Everything else is pretty much written as if it weren't even remotely following the story.<br/><br/>I never saw the film again after that and I don't think I ever will. In fact, I think I spent more time watching the SWEET trailer than I did the actual movie itself. If I were you, Id' just watch the trailer and leave it there.."
"amesmonde","Null","4","8","19 October 2010"," Entertainng enough but average
","An adopted prince and a princess must unmask a villain who threatens to destroy the world with a special dagger that can reverse time.<br/><br/>Slick director Mike Newell gives a Disney adaptation of a video game. Borrowing from Disney's own Aladdin and key visuals from the game, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is entertaining enough. What's notable is John Seale's cinematography, sweeping deserts and fantastic skylines and a great score by Harry Gregson-Williams.<br/><br/>Gemma Arterton is great as Tamina, however, Ben Kingsley gives another average performance and Alfred Molina appears to have been handed a Mummy squeal script. The brothers of the Prince of Persia, 'Rock n Roller' star Toby Kebbell is on top form but does not get enough screen-time and Jeff from 'Coupling', Richard Coyle, is surprisingly superb. Jake Gyllenhaal looks comfortable in the lead, nevertheless, he lacks hero charisma.<br/><br/>There's swordplay and special effects galore, but the big budgeter only amounts to average fun."
"p_jones92","4","4","8","2 October 2010"," Another example of why video games don't convert well to movies....
","It's been a while since I wrote a review on IMDb, but I felt compelled to write this one because this is a very poor effort of a movie that seems to somehow have gained more recognition than it deserves.<br/><br/>I will first state that this was watched once the movie had come out on DVD, I wasn't compelled enough to want to see this in the cinema but thought it might make a good night in rental. That ideas was wrong.<br/><br/>I could only watch this in 15 minutes sections, after which time I would become so disgusted with either the story, acting, or directing that I would be sure there was something better to do - and every time it turned out there was. I ended up watching this movie over a 2 day period, I had to take that many breaks from it because it was so bad.<br/><br/>The story itself is too complex but still very cliché, it's hard to keep up with who's double crossing who, what the whole myth of the dagger is, which person is from which tribe and who's good and who's bad. I think the script writers think constantly keeping things changing and people guessing is entertaining and creative. It's not, it's annoying. The story is supposed to guide us as viewers and take us along for the ride, not keep trying to throw us off. Of course a good thriller has you double guessing or following a red herring, but the good ones lead you down one path and then revealing the other true path the end (think Sixth Sense or Shutter Island).<br/><br/>The acting is wooden and poor. Ben Stiller isn't menacing, Gemma Arterton isn't engaging, and Jake Gyllenhal isn't funny or heroic. You really don't care for any of them, particularly Gemma Arterton, who just grates by constantly flipping from a damsel in distress to mythical queen spouting hokum' pokem' nonsense. The only saving grace was Alfred Molina, at least he was watchable.<br/><br/>The action scenes are not well choreographed or directed, it's hard to really tell what's going on or get a sense of the action as the editing is so quick and swift you don't really get a chance to see any of the sword play, it's lots of quick cuts of close-up of swords hitting swords and then running and jumping away. There's no grandeur to them at all, and the elements taken from the video games (i.e. running along walls and back flipping everywhere) turn these scenes from the ridiculous to the absurd.<br/><br/>What is this movie supposed to be? It's not an actioner, it's not a comedy, it's not an epic, it's not a romance movie, it's just a very bad attempt at trying to be all of these. Thank God I got this on DVD, at least I could turn it off. If I'd have seen thins in the cinema it may well have been the very first movie which I actually walked out of."

The story of this movie has completely been spoiled.<br/><br/>The only good thing about it is the good action and some humor but it is not enough. Where is that great real story????

It's accuracy to the true storyline was worse than the Eragon movie's to the Eragon book's.<br/><br/>I will not spoil the storyline of either the game or the movie for anyone, but, all who have played the game, do not watch this.<br/><br/>I hope that one day movie makers will make accurate movies, not cheap immitations of great books and games."
"tdevereaux","3","4","8","3 June 2010"," Pointless and Boring
","I went to see this film with low expectations. I knew it was a video game made into a movie so I was ready to just enjoy some fun and action. I got very little of either one. The story was tired and warmed over and the acting was just average.<br/><br/>When there was some good action it would be interrupted by pointless conversations between the main characters who have suddenly forgot about the battle going on. At one point they stop worrying about saving the world and try to work in an awkward kiss.<br/><br/>And in the end the whole movie is negated by traveling through time and keeping everything from happening. So why would I watch it again? So much time was spent making you care if these characters died and now since they didn't, you don't care.<br/><br/>The only bright part of the movie was Alfred Molina who added in some nice comic moments.<br/><br/>The time has passed when an audience is amazed by CG in movies. We've all seen it. Slow motion shots of arrows and snakes as well as vast panoramas of sunsets over temples. Use them when they can add something to the story. Stopping everything just to throw one in for some kind of ""Wow Factor"" doesn't cut it anymore. And this film had them every ten minutes.<br/><br/>So, if your are the kind of movie goer that just likes pretty things moving around on screen for no reason, then you might enjoy this film. If you want story or plot or acting or even just good action... go elsewhere."
"RileyOnFilm","6","2","3","30 October 2016"," Romantic Humor with Sword and Sandal Action
","This Jerry Bruckheimer production truly ""brings it."" On the heels of Pirates of the Caribbean, this mega-producer was able to produce another highly entertaining Summer swashbuckler for Disney. It is partially based on the popular video game of the same name.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal (Jake from here on out) plays Dastan, a street rat who becomes a prince. Sound familiar? No, actually other than that there are no parallels to Alladin. He obtains a dagger that is able to rewind time one minute in duration. Naturally everyone wants this dagger so he must keep it safe. Gemma Arterton is the beautiful princess who is charged with the task of getting it back from him. Dastan wrongly believes she wants HIM and not the dagger, as every prince probably would, but he is mistaken. Their romantic comedy banter back and forth is some of my favorite stuff from this film.<br/><br/>There are a couple of actor heavyweights in the film as: Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina. They bring a stoic feeling to the film. Both are very physical in the film, along with Jake. They appear to do many of their own stunts including Alfred Molina's harrowing scene when he kisses an ostrich. I understand these are mean animals and yet, they manage to be ridden in the film without the use of CGI. Quite amazing if you asked me.<br/><br/>The film looks like a sword and sandal epic but feels just short of it at times. It isn't a bad movie but it's not as good as The Gods of Egypt or The 300. The story is a bit complex and I think could have been more engaging if it were whittled down and simplified a bit. Despite poor reviews and some stale audience periods, It did gross over 300 million dollars so something definitely is there that kept people swiping their cards and slapping down bills at the box office. I would recommend this film for fans of Jake or possibly the video game (I've never played it) but only after you've seen everything else he's done. I think you'll find it a lot of fun in a branched off performance for him."
"Rob-O-Cop","6","2","3","17 August 2010"," looked great, but unsurprisingly played out like a video game
","The money was up there on the screen to see, it certainly looked exotic and rich but unsurprisingly the script is where the big holes lie, and I don't think it had to be that way. After managing to get my head around Jake Gyllenhaal's unusual accent which drifted in and out, and settling down with a visually stunning screen, it was time to digest the story and how it played out. I warmed to some of the characters after a patchy start but then they started feeding trite lectures through their mouths, particularly the princess's and it didn't even really make sense. But what did I expect right? it's a movie that expands on a jump and run video game. Pirates has shown us we can and should expect more and this movie was certainly stocked high with talented people so a quick look at the writing team explains the let down here. I could stand seeing a sequel to this but only if they get some writers with a little vision beyond the cliché. Just cos it's an action movie doesn't mean it has to be dumb. Well done everyone else."

1. The action scenes are amazing.

3. The acting is good, from the main and supporting characters to the villains. Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, Ben Kingsley, and Alfred Molina do good job.
4. The production design is well-made.
5. Costumes and properties are visually interesting.
6. The music makes the action scenes and adventure even better.<br/><br/>The resolution does not fit perfectly. The animations for the Hassansins, the snake, and some landscape scenes are not smooth. The main characters are mostly whitewashed, unfortunately.<br/><br/>Debatable holes:
1. Dastan and Tamina were very lucky, they were barely injured.
2. If Alamut's defense was known to be very formidable for years, than it should have not been breached that easily.
3. The Dastan, Nizam, Tus, Garsiv , and Tamina did not have guardians at all, although they were princes and princess.
4. People who could actually fight are only the main characters.
5. Sheik Amar and Seso changed their heart too easily to help Dastan and Tamina.
6. Hassansins were known to be fierce warriors, but they could not even defeat Sheik Amar and Garsiv's people.
7. It was unclear why time rewound to the moment Dastan found the dagger.
8. Dastan was a superhuman, he was so durable, strong, fast, lucky, healthy, fit, and had high stamina, power and energy.
9. How could the snake swallow the dagger?
10. The enemies did not kill the protagonists whenever they could and they were easily distracted.
11. The characters easily found each other with little effort, whether it was in a crowded village, a vast dessert, or any locations.
12. Tus and Garsiv easily believed in Dastan at the end of the movie.
13. Dastan and Tamina could escape easily on the day King Sharaman died."
"TheMovieDiorama","6","1","1","27 February 2018"," Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is one of the stronger video game adaptations, although that's not saying much.
","Nearly every production studio has made an attempt at making a decent video game adaptation. There are some good iterations but the dreaded curse has unfortunately yet to be broken. Based on the Prince of Persia franchise, we follow Prince Dastan who is framed for killing the king. He soon stumbles across a jewelled dagger that has the power to turn back time, and must ensure it does not fall into the hands of someone who has a more insidious agenda. This is just old fashioned fun. Harking back to classic adventure movies like Indiana Jones. If you dust off your sandy serious mind and just observe what's on screen, you'll enjoy it. Start analysing it...and well you'll find issues. Straight away, you feel energised by the light adventurous tone that Disney set out to accomplish. Several action set pieces to keep the eyes engaged, but upon reflection it's not really memorable. They all merge into one. Performances were all solid. Gyllenhaal tackles his first above average blockbuster (*cough* The Day After Tomorrow is below average), I did find his accent confusing. Was he trying to be British? I spent half the time deciphering in my head what his accent was meant to be. Arterton surprisingly held her own and occasionally portrayed a strong independent character. Kingsley...well, I don't think big flashy blockbusters are right for him. The visual effects still look impressive, particularly the scenes involving time reversal. The sandy after effects suited and enhanced these scenes. The script tries to embed humour, but fails. It's so focussed on the word ""time"" and explaining the rules of the dagger that it just doesn't have enough space for the world building which is fundamentally important in an adventure story. I despise the ending. It negates everything that happened (I understand why) but all the relationships that are established and deaths were just meaningless, making the story forgettable. Tries too hard at creating a franchise."

","From the start, the film introduce the audience to the magical Persian atmosphere. The landscapes full of sand and sun help to held that all through out the film. Fantastic costumes and nice cities, accompany the great performances from the actors, who are keeping up the excitement. The action scenes are many, however they make the prince look supernatural rather than just a boy from the streets. Fortunately the romance is not too much, limited only to a few scenes, and does not over covers the whole story, which is about the sand of time, given to the men kind by the gods. Even the end is surprising, making a twist by returning to the one of the first scenes of the movie. All in all, an interesting film, with lots of action and Persian atmosphere."

Their best bits add up to about five minutes. Otherwise the movie is cluttered, meaningless, and boring.<br/><br/>""Prince of Persia"" is orientalist in a way that feels unacceptable for 2010, even in a movie based on a video game. Every cliché of the Middle East is piled into the movie, junkyard style – whirling dervishes, sand dunes, camels, women for sale, the Hashshashin, Arabic – whether these items fit in sixth-century Persia or not.

"aurora_vampiris","8","8","22","21 May 2010"," There's only one word for it - ""Fun""
","The problem with us, as viewers and critics of cinema, is that we demand too much. We want too much, we ask for too much and (ridiculously enough) we demand that we be disturbed by what we view at a fundamental level. The demand for meaningful, noir movies with dark themes has been so great since The Dark Knight that I've grown sick and tired of people whining and nitpicking tiny little threads in the tapestry that forms a movie. <br/><br/>Basically, what I'm trying to say is that I don't demand much from a movie. There's three things I do ask for though, and justifiably so - solid acting, splendid direction (within which I include cinematography, editing, screenplay and other things to do with guiding the actors and the scenario to make a visually striking scene) and a nice story. I definitely don't go to movies like Prince of Persia expecting a dark, brooding tale filled with passion and gore. The games - at least the ones that I've played - have come close to taking themselves WAY too seriously, but the fact is that they're just loads of fun. <br/><br/>The thing about video games is that we'll always like them better than the movies. It's the human brain - we're conditioned (via video games) to think that WE are in charge. WE control the fate of the main character. WE control his parkour moves. WE control whether he merely flees a fight or engages with the enemy in a brutal hack-and-slash fight. And that's definitely not going to happen in a movie. What we're watching is the vision of another human being - how he/she would play the game. How he/she would watch the story unfold. <br/><br/>Ultimately, I just don't remember having this much FUN watching a movie. It reminded me of times past when we merely used to enjoy a movie instead of demanding it provoke us to feel, sometimes at great expense to the senses a la Hostel. Don't get me wrong. The Prince of Persia does have feeling - it's got solid chemistry between the leads and brilliant acting. (SPOILER: For instance, the scene when Gemma Arterton lets go of Jake Gyllenhal's hand while hanging off a cliff. She doesn't do it with calm serenity or with a smiling face. She screamed, she pleaded and showed a very human vulnerability that is completely atypical of a Hollywood blockbuster). The Prince of Persia also has its fair share of beautiful CGI (yes, I actually love this fascinating new technology) and fan-tribute scenes that hark back to the games. Yet, it holds its own ground in terms of storyline and the direction that the story takes. It explains how Dastaan (Jake Gyllenhal) came to be, and how he chances upon the strange dagger that seems to have some elusive mystic power which in turn alludes to a much more powerful and devastating secret. The scenes in Persia are fantastic and the city the Persians invade (Alamut) looks inviting enough. <br/><br/>However, the film does have its fair share of flaws. The dialogue could do with a lot of work and the film does try to cram everything into the script - from ostrich races to snake attacks in the desert to an assassin's creed style chase. However, the film does have its high points too - the fight between the Sudanese knife thrower and the Hassansin blade-thrower was sheer awesomeness. The camera angles do get a bit frustrating during the parkour scenes, but the parkour does justice to the game so it's all fair. <br/><br/>Either way, Prince of Persia is a fun, fun ride... especially on IMAX. You just have to open your mind and it'll remind you of a long-gone era where fairy tales were just like their namesake - feel-good stories with happy endings that made you wish you were a part of their world rather than the one you live in. Also, Disney might be a tad disappointed if they want this to be the Pirates replacement franchise... mainly because it lacks the main spark that made Pirates tick - an overtly eccentric and humorous character, called Jack Sparrow. While the tax-hating merchant seemed like a cue in to be some sort of Jack Sparrow replacement, his cheesy dialogue completely took the humour out of his short appearance. <br/><br/>PS: As far as the discrimination against Persians is concerned, I'd say the depiction of Persians was fair - they are shown as a civilised empire that while resting on the glory of its conquests, also knows how to show mercy. Again, if you can't get past the obviously Caucasian cast, well... bully for you."
"Eronimus_Platts","3","5","12","2 June 2010"," Did not live up to expectations
","On Friday night I went and saw the Prince of Persia movie with my friend. When I first had learned of the production of the video game based movie I was more then excited to see it. However after 15 min of the movie I quickly wanted to leave the theaters. The movie in my opinion was nothing like the game. The story used the sand dagger and sands of time element, but that is it. It is as if writers made up their own story, but using the sands of time concept.<br/><br/>I wasn't really concerned so much with the casting as I was with how horrible it followed the game's story. Though I can say I'm no really fair about this movie expecting a high standard for this kind of movie. I was prejudice about it before I walked into the theater. I already had it set in my mind that the movie was going to be terrible before I saw it, but I still hold to my beliefs that it was terrible. <br/><br/>One of the biggest disappointments was that there were no sand monsters. Another disappointment was the fact that they make the hero prince seem like a pathetic orphan, trying to prove himself to the whole world. Which is to say that this is an over used story plot turned cliché. And finally the other major disappointment was the seriously mis-timed kissing scene. The writer decided that it would make more sense to have the hero and his maiden kiss with only a few minutes to save the world. As well as many more minor disappointments through-out the entire movie.<br/><br/>However there was on thing that I thought was good, that being the ending. The ending where the hero prince goes back in time to the beginning stayed pretty true to the game's story line. Overall I think movie sucked and in no way lived up to expectation. I would give this movie a 3 out of 10, but would advise seeing it for yourself, so you can understand where I coming from."

"zardoz-13","5","5","12","29 May 2010"," Tepid Arabian Nights Nonsense
","""Pirates of the Caribbean"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer's antiquity-themed potboiler ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" qualifies as an anemic sword and sorcery fantasy with Jake Gyllenhaal of ""Brokeback Mountain"" and Gemma Arterton of ""Quantum of Solace."" Loosely derived from Jordan Mechner's videogames, this adrenaline-fueled, ancient-times fantasy unfolds in the sixth century when Persia was a super power. A wrongly accused innocent must clear himself of a murderous crime he never committed, expose the real murderer, and deny him possession of a fabled dagger. The crystal hilt of this bejeweled dagger holds the sands of time. A man can rewrite history by pushing a button on the dagger. Although this far-fetched, family-friendly, special effects-laden spectacle rarely gives its characters a chance to catch their collective breaths, the sands run out of ""Prince of Persia"" long before the story concludes with its happily-ever-after ending. Remember, ""Prince of Persia"" bears the Disney Studios imprimatur. Original ""Punisher"" scenarist Boaz Yakin and ""The Great Raid"" co-scribes Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard have contrived a frenzied but forgettable actioneer about palace intrigue supplemented by cliffhanger heroics. This doesn't compensate for the dearth of compelling characters and quotable dialogue. <br/><br/>The worst thing about ""Donnie Brasco"" director Mike Newell's ancient times epic is that it is simply no fun. Mind you, the lightning-fast, ginsu knife editing pares everything to the minimum among camera angles galore, but the action doesn't leap off the screen in a metaphorical sense. Alfred Molina of ""Spider Man 2"" plays the only character that has fun. Sadly, the chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton is lukewarm.A miscast Jake Gyllenhaal with an Estuary accent looks uncomfortable as an ""Aladdin"" style hero. He appears perfectly ridiculous beneath a black lion's mane of hair, while the villainous Ben Kingsley sports far too much eye-liner. Gemma Arterton emerges from this hokum with some dignity. Whether she is wielding a weapon or displaying her superior intellect, she makes a striking but not always triumphant heroine. Unhappily, most of the characters make little impression aside from their choice of weapons. Some of the CGI effects, particularly the slithering vipers, look too spurious. In his prime, actor Burt Lancaster could have done in real life every stunt that Jake Gyllenhaal performs with obvious support of CGI.<br/><br/>As ""Prince of Persia"" opens, we learn that Persia ruled the world from Asia to the Mediterranean. Persian King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) has two sons by blood, but adopts a third. Sharaman saw a street urchin named Dastan defy authority in a village and try to help another boy out of a jam. The King admired the youth's bravery so much that he adopted him. Fifteen years later, a grown-up Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal of ""Donnie Darko"") has acquired a reputation for derring-do that defies good sense. Dastan's eldest brother Tus (Richard Coyle of ""Young Blades"") and his mighty army approach the peaceful city of Alamut. Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) prepares her people for what she fears may be the fall of Alamut. None of her subjects believe that this is possible. Meantime, Tus' spies have informed him that Alamut has fired up forges and is mass producing arms for Persia's enemies. Wonder where the scenarists cooked up that plot? Tus has a conference with blood brother Garsiv (Toby Kebbell of ""RocknRolla"") and his adopted brother Dastan. Dastan agrees that Alamut must be attacked, but he is disappointed when his brother Garsiv gets to lead the charge. Later that night, Dastan and his commando-style squad hit the city where it least expects it and opens it up for Garsiv to rampage inside. Tamina entrusts the legendary dagger to a warrior. As the warrior is with the dagger is leaving, he spots Dastan and tries to kill him. Dastan kills him and acquires the dagger. <br/><br/>After the city falls, Tus proposes a marriage of alliance with Tamina. She considers the offer more seriously when she sees that Dastan has the dagger in his belt. King Sharaman arrives for the victory celebration, and Dastan presents him with a gift. It is an Alamut prayer regent's cloak. No sooner has Sharaman shrugged into the cloak than it ignites into a blaze that kills the monarch. Everybody points fingers at Dastan, but Dastan remembers that Tus gave him the present. Tamina shows him an escape route and he follows her on horseback into the desert. Tus offers a substantial reward on Dastan's head, and our hero and heroine fall in with an outlaw band of desert thieves lead by wise-cracking Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina) who hams it up with relish. Amar is an outlaw because he hates paying taxes that the government would use for unscrupulous ends. Dastan discovers the secret power of the dagger when Tamina tries to relieve him of it. Tamina brings him up to date on the mythical history of the dagger. It seems that the gods had decided to destroy mankind when one person stepped forward and raised their hand in protest. The gods relented and put the sand that they plan to use to destroy the earth deep into the ground. This sacred sand is the only kind of sand that makes the dagger magical. Dastan wants to get to Sharaman's trusted brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley of ""Shutter Island"" and warn him about Tus' treachery.<br/><br/>""Prince of Persia"" duplicates virtually every search for hidden treasure movie that you've ever seen, including all the ""Aladdin"" and ""Ali Baba"" epics as well as the ""Mummy"" movies and ""Raiders of the Lost Ark"" franchise. There is nothing here that you haven't seen before and seen done better. Moreover, once you've seen the hero turn back the hands of time to survive an encounter with an antagonist, it doesn't require much brain power to anticipate that more of this kind of nonsense will follow but on a grander scale, not matter how many important characters bite the dust. Make the ""Prince of Persia"" a rental."
"Velociraptor256","5","5","12","27 May 2010"," Below-par summer action flick
","Having never played the game, I went into Prince Of Persia to view it not as a video game adaptation, but as a simply entertaining action-adventure movie. Unfortunately, it wasn't quite as much fun as I expected from a movie produced by Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>The script is silly at times, the dialogue is often unrealistic, the pacing is occasionally a bit too rushed; perhaps worst of all, none of the characters are terribly interesting, with the exception of Alfred Molina's comic relief Sheik. The action scenes are quite fun, with an appropriately video-gamish feel to them, but even they suffer from too-fast editing that makes it difficult to keep up.<br/><br/>Prince Of Persia isn't a terrible film, it certainly has its moments, but there's just too many flaws to really recommend it."
"TheUnseenMovieLover","6","5","12","24 May 2010"," A Fun Summer Blockbuster
","Video-game adaptations have never been that good. The Tomb Raider series came close, but apart from that, the track record has been pretty messy. Anyone remember Super Mario Bros.? So Prince of Persia deserves credit for being the best video-game adaptation to date; a light action adventure with just enough old-school charm, star chemistry and visual razzle-dazzle to deserve its marketing as a summer blockbuster.<br/><br/>Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was an orphan plucked off the streets and adopted by the King of Persia (Ronald Pickup). Determined to prove his worth to his father, his uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) and his two brothers, Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Tus (Richard Coyle), Dastan plays a pivotal role in the successful siege of the city of Alumet. The celebrations are brought to an end by the murder of the King, of which Dastan is wrongfully accused. Going on the run with the beautiful Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), Dastan realises that he holds a dagger which Tamina is meant to protect, and which is the key to the most powerful weapon in the world; the Sands of Time. If the Sands of Time are unleashed, it will mean the end of the world. Dastan and Tamina must stay one step ahead of the bad guys who are after the dagger, all the while trying to find out who set up Dastan.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia has the same problem as this month's Robin Hood; its storytelling is bloated where it should have been fast and efficient. However, unlike Robin Hood, Prince of Persia tends to be borderline insulting in the way the audience is treated like unintelligent morons. OK, granted this film is first and foremost aimed at a younger audience (as well as fans of the game), but I would have preferred it if the writing was a bit more subtle, and not akin to being walloped with a sledgehammer. At one point, Dastan says, ""releasing the sands turns back time. And only the holder of the dagger is aware of what's happened."" This would have useful, if it hadn't been portrayed through some brilliant visual effects which showed exactly how the dagger worked one minute beforehand. The fact that he is saying this to Tamina, a woman who has been guarding the dagger for her whole life and who knows the powers of the Sands, only makes this dialogue seem more like poorly handled exposition and less like organic conversation. This happens regularly throughout the film, and is likely to annoy several viewers. It did me. The screenplay is easily the film's biggest flaw, not only poorly written but often rushed in the relationships between the characters. Dastan and Tamina's relationship isn't developed as much as I would have liked it to be, and other characters often seem undeveloped. We get the bare details of why they do what they do, but apart from Dastan and Tamina, no one is satisfyingly fleshed out.<br/><br/>That being said, Prince of Persia is still an entertaining film. Why? Partially because it has that matinée Saturday film feeling. This has a charm to it which reminded me of the Indiana Jones series. It also has a sense of fun. The action is satisfying, if not as gritty as the scraps in Robin Hood or as impressive as the show-downs in Iron Man 2. The sword fights, in particular, have a real sense of immediacy, which is (for once) aided by the use of the shaky camera technique. You feel disoriented in a good way; you can still see what is going on in the fight, and you feel like you are involved.<br/><br/>Technically, this film is stunning. The locations ooze a perfect exotic sensuality. The score by Harry Gregson-Williams is rich and engaging, whilst the sets are beautifully designed. Costumes are also good, although there is nothing particularly inventive. The visual effects are breath-taking, with the finale, where Dastan and Tamina race to find the Sands of Time, being the most electrifying visual effects orientated set piece so far this year.<br/><br/>The acting is what keeps the film together. As Dastan and Tamina, Gyllenhaal and Arterton are brilliant. Gyllenhaal brings a puppyish enthusiasm to Dastan which makes him instantly likable, whilst wonderfully hinting at his character's maturation throughout the film. Meanwhile, Arterton brings an authoritative grace to the role of Tamina. She isn't an all-out warrior, but she ain't no damsel in distress either. Both of them share a chemistry which goes beyond the call of duty (and the low ambition of the script), and which makes them a couple who we root for. Ben Kingsley is nicely malicious as Nizam. Kingsley clearly relishes the role, and he sinks his teeth into it. Both Kebbell and Coyle develop their characters into strong yet human individuals with limited screen time, whilst Alfred Molina provides solid comic relief as a sheik with questionable morals.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is flawed; there is no question about that. It is overly convoluted, the script has some clunkers which are actually painful to hear and there is very little in the way of intelligence. But you genuinely care about the main characters, and you want to see what happens to them. The action is well-done, the production values are top-notch and Mike Newell's direction keeps the film moving along nicely. Overall, Prince of Persia is a fun summer blockbuster, one which is likely to be a big success at the box office. Hopefully, any mistakes here can be rectified if there is a sequel. So how does it do against the other two summer blockbusters so far? It's not as witty or as exciting as Iron Man 2 (although it does avoid the dip in quality that Iron Man 2 suffered from in the middle act), nor does it have the gritty intelligence of Robin Hood. But it is still a decent, if not overwhelming piece of summer entertainment."

","May contain spoilers, tiny ones.<br/><br/>This movie was dreadful, obviously Hollywood folks don't play games because the original history was WAY better than the movie.<br/><br/>I had really nice hopes with Jerry producing it, a new trilogy would have been so nice.<br/><br/>The crappy script changed all the tale, merged characters and introduced meaningless ones. Had over dramatical dialogue and acting and a stupid plot.<br/><br/>No, I'm not bashing the acrobatics moves of the prince, that's his trademark, nor the special effects of the dagger of time. Those were the only good things about this whole garbage.<br/><br/>Honestly, how hard could have been to do a trilogy like the games? This one should have been about the prince, the vizier and Farah in the desolated palace infested by sand monsters, you din't need more characters other than the extras (soilders and slaves) and the king of Persia and his sand-monster form.<br/><br/>They could've just got rid of the puzzles and the excess of combat and there! You had a fantastic adventure movie, narrated by the prince like the video game. Finnally you could change some details here and there so hardcore fans get surprised! But no...they had to change everything, merge characters (they merged Farah and Kaileena into one support role) and add stupid brothers for the prince.<br/><br/>It could have been done like ""I am Legend"" few characters surviving some hazards, been developed while they explore the desolated palace. Some acrobatics with some ""trust me"" scenes, a few uses of the dagger in so people don't scream ""deux ex...!"" at the grand finale and the whole ""honor and glory"" moral lesson instead of ""family is cool!"" Disney poop."
"practicallypeach","4","4","9","8 June 2010"," It's not that great...and here's why
","I've never played the game so I have no idea if the movie holds true to the original Game content. I will say this: it's not that great. *SPOILER* For those of you who have seen it, think about this. Why did the uncle kill off his brother and frame his nephew? He was going back in time to do that anyway, so why do it in present time? By framing his nephew, he created conflict. No one would have went up against him prior to the kings death. He could have went about his business looking for the sands, simply asked for the dagger from his nephew in law (who didn't know about it and was unimpressed by it at first sight), and he could have gotten what he wanted. Movie would have been over in 15 minutes. There is no earthly reason why.<br/><br/>Another, this is a time piece (sloppy as it may be). So why is this princess willing to give up her life for a dagger but won't give up her beauty? She was traveling in the desert, (sometimes) by herself, and she was heading towards a place called the valley of the slaves. Cut throats and rapists aplenty there. Yet her hair was down (IN the desert) and she wore all white. If I were her, I'd cut my hair and make myself out to look as much like a poor boy as possible. She made herself out to be a target. Yet she'd do anything to protect the dagger and its secret.<br/><br/>In the end, such a piece of technology doesn't need to exist at all. Why does it exist? Why does it have people protecting it? If I knew about the dagger, I'd try to destroy it. Someone like that in the movie would have made the story a bit more digestible. It served no purpose. It was never to be used or discovered. Smash it against a rock. Save the world a whole heap of trouble. And how many main characters in this movie we actually Persian? Unless Hollywood thinks that tanning a white person and not letting them shave for a few days is suddenly Persian.<br/><br/>It's a pretty big disappointment honestly. From plot holes to racial inaccuracies, it's not worth the experience."

I also didn't like that there were no sand monsters in the movie those creatures were so much fun to fight in the game, It would be so cool if they put them in the movie. Im going to bring up another part that seemed really pointless, and that part is when the prince is trying to convince his brother that he didn't kill his father, the prince succeeds and his brother is on his side the bad guy comes in right after and slits the brothers throat, Why did they need to show that if he was going to die right after it was a waste of time!

","I seem often at odds with the mainstream reviewer community when it comes to big summer action movies.<br/><br/>The press doesn't like this. The gameboy community does, I suppose because any sort of serious recognition outside the shell is valued.<br/><br/>Well, I liked it. I'll recommend it, though only on cinematic grounds; I know nothing of the games on which it is based.<br/><br/>When I go to these, my values are specific: I am going for a cinematic experience, period. The story is largely irrelevant: I need it to be enough to provide a linear skeleton on which to pace my visual imagination. It provides a rhythm of concepts only. This is not a trivial requirement, and is dependent on all the normally valued qualities: the actors, dialog, empathy and so on. You cannot have too much or too little story. It has to know its place in support of a deeper experience. There must, must, must not be too much condescension or elaborate justification of the worlds.<br/><br/>So far as the story, this suits and nearly achieves a very high mark. The only problems were the overdeveloped notions of fraternal allegiance. Someone crept into the studio at night with the notion that they could say something that matters, so they larded something ""important"" onto the script. This could better have been handled in the ""Lion King"" way, without the Shakespearean aspiration and actor.<br/><br/>So the story gives a pace of ideas, and it also supports the creation of a cosmology. This is far more important to these films. We have to just get how the world works. Once we do, our minds fill in the blanks of sense and what we expect to see. The situation we accept is what allows the narrative unfolding to work. They did a very good job here. That is despite two dangerous problems.<br/><br/>I know a great deal of Persian history, and of course this has nothing to do with that rich reality, richer and more magical than is imagined here. And there was a cosmological quandary in the central magical device. It would have reversed time while destroying the world, but the destruction would be in a future that would be erased. Huh? But even picky me easily skipped over those otherwise barbed snags.<br/><br/>Those two foundations did well enough in setting up the cinematic experience. In just the past couple years, all of Hollywood has developed a new sense of space. This may be related to the rush to 3D, but that is primarily an anti-piracy measure. Real filmmakers have just simply developed new spatial tools as the SFX compositing software allows for radical camera sweeps and editing continuities. This makes some of the new crop of action movies spatially cinematic.<br/><br/>We are lucky enough to see some exciting experiments in how this will play out. Here is an approach dear to my heart. The camera is conservatively used; it is not placed in the action. It always has us as a disembodied, prescient observer. I like the blend, but we do not have it here.<br/><br/>In other experiments, we use space in a large unconstrained way. Dragons swoop, Nemo swirls. King Kong falls. There is very little of that here, and in fact there is a cinematic parody of this in the ""sands"" effect at the end. What we have instead is a complex, detailed, accurate spatial interaction with the architectural spaces. The characters — mostly our Prince, but also some Jedi Ninja Magi — establish the planes and occlusions with an understanding of the new cinematic vocabulary we have, a collaboration between our minds and the software (based on surfaces, luminescence and occlusions). There is a dance between object and situation that simply thrills me.<br/><br/>It may thrill you as well. <br/><br/>Gemma is wonderful. I do not expect her appeal to last.

","I'll start off by saying that I am a video game fan and have been ever since I was a small boy playing Super Mario 3 for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES). Unlike a lot of my contemporaries, I did not ""grow out"" of it after entering puberty. Sure, I loved nudity and girls but I was still a big gamer. Can't say I'd put the Prince of Persia series amongst my top 5 but I can say I always enjoyed the game-play and storyline. That, I cannot say for the film adaptation.<br/><br/>What is it about video games? Why are they so hard to translate to the big screen? If a movie about a fat Italian plumber who jumps on turtles isn't a masterpiece and actually turns into one of the biggest pieces of excrement to ever be internationally released, well that's no surprise at all. But one with such a rich storyline like POP? You have to start wondering.<br/><br/>This wasn't directed by untalented good for nothing directors like Uwe Boll (Who I hope doesn't beat the crap out of me after reading this). Mike Newell is actually a 30 year pro who's made decent to good flicks like Donnie Brasco (Also starring Gyllenhall). So you can't just blame the poor quality of the film on the director. Maybe video game films are not to be.<br/><br/>The Sands of Time does not have any interesting characters. None of the protagonists are developed the least bit to make the audience care for them. It also might have been a mute film. The dialogue was more poor than Sierra Leone. Not one good line that stays with you during this whole 116 minutes.<br/><br/>And what's worse (At least for a movie with a 200 million dollar budget), the action was horrible. Those were some of the worst A-Movie fight scenes I've ever seen. They were going for an epic feel to make you gasp but really, the only thing that made me gasp was that I actually stayed until the end.<br/><br/>I would not recommend this movie to anyone with at least a sub-par standard. If you want to see a video game movie, just rent Mortal Kombat which at least has a cool techno song. Persian or Arab film? Heck, Alladin beats this one out of the park. Yes, Disney's Alladin.<br/><br/>The only redeeming factor in this (And I'm being very liberal with the use of the term) is Alfred Molina's character.<br/><br/>Here we have Gandhi, who gained independence for his country by peaceful protest. But not even he could save this."

I got the impression they were aiming for Pirates in turbans, but fell a long way short. Movie goes for too long. Involvement of Hassassins is half-baked. I never got the feeling of brotherhood that was so highly valued in the film.

Under the direction of adequate director Mike Newell and with a cast that includes Jake Gyllenhall, Ben Kingsley, and Alfred Molina, it cannot be easily dismissed.

"helldorado-873-659002","9","3","6","17 October 2010"," Mistakes
","Actually a very good movie, I enjoyed and I recommend it to others but there are two historical mistakes in the movie which can be labeled as HUGE mistakes.<br/><br/>1.In some of the scenes members of Persian Guard speaks Arabic, though Arabic was never used in Persia and no Arabians served in Persian Army or guard, the only place where Arabic were spoken in Persia was in Al Manathira Territory they were the Arabian allies of Persia and they were just a buffer state to stop Al Ghasasina ""who are Arabs also but allied with Rome"" from attacking Persia, so the point is Arabic language was never used in Persia but yet in the movie its used by soldiers where they should use Persian language.<br/><br/>2. When the Prince talks to the outlaws in the valley of death they tell him that he is in the HEART OF SUDAN, Sudan was never occupied by Persia neither Egypt, they were occupied by Romans and in Sudan there was a king called Najashi who ruled under the name of Rome, add to that the Prince told them later that he was going to sell the Princess in Iraq, he was at Persia ""which is Iran these days"" he went to Sudan in order to sell the princess in Iraq, get a map and laugh at this.<br/><br/>3. The Hassanssins or the Hassasins are a group of murderers who was created at 1200 which is at least 1000 year after the fall of Persian Empire, this group was created by Hassan Al subah who lived at the age of Saladin and king Richard the lion heart, so there is no way this group was at that time in Persia."

Unfortunately, I can not say the same about this movie, which was by far not what I thought it would be. They were too few special effects and the cast was bad (is it me or were they talking in a British accent?. Plus, I really think of Jake Gyllenhaal as a really bad choice for playing an ancient Persian man) ). All these things made it for me even more difficult to watch the pretty boring story of the film,which was enriched with many unnecessary scenes (what was it about with the ostrich..?). At the end, add some historical mistakes ( someone is referring to a Turkish harem. A pity that the Turks appeared some 1000 years after this time period)and you can see why i did not like it.

To add insult to injury, all the actors spoke in British accents which was just idiotic, all the more reason not to take this film seriously.

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010) – A Review by Phil Congleton What I found most interesting about this experience is the fact that I didn't know this film was based on a video game until after I saw it. I was told about that fact by a friend and once he said that to me I immediately felt that I wouldn't have liked it as much if I had known that ahead of time. So, when you see this movie forget that it is based on a video game. So, with my ignorance intact I went into this film thinking it was another sword and sandal movie with neat special effects. Produced by the same group (Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney), that produced the Pirates of the Caribbean films, this one is much like the Pirates films. Huge sets, groundbreaking special effects, large cast, even larger cast of extras, and booming soundtrack. It contains the same general formula – very Disney. The good guy (Jake Gyllenhaal as our Prince), the beautiful, but tough love interest (Gemma Arterton), a supporting cast, who you can never tell is good or bad and bad guys, who you can't tell are good or bad either, much like the Pirates films. You just don't know who is good or bad. Is the bad really that bad? Will the bad turn good or the good turn bad? The film contains high-octane energy, great music and special effects and wonderful stunts. Gellenhall does a convincing job as an agile, sword-wielding superhero from the ancient lands of Persia. It could be a tough sell for some people because it involves a lot of time-traveling. If you don't have the brain capacity to handle time travel than this isn't the film for you. Arterton, although I liked her in other things, seemed kind of weak on the acting in this one. It felt like she was going through the motions. Alfred Molina is great as usual as the owner of an ostrich racetrack who becomes intertwined with the plight of our Prince. However to keep in-line with some Jerry Bruckheimer-produced fare it is light on story and contains a lot of corny dialogue. However, throw caution to the wind and sit back and watch this thrill-ride unfold on the screen. It is fun and that is all it's supposed to be."
"east-emerald","4","3","6","16 June 2010"," At least I got to see trailers for Tron and The Last Airbender
","First off, thanks to Staceybon from Twitter for helping me come up with a one word description for ""Prince of Persia"". You see, I thought I would be clever and asked for suggestions about what to call a movie where you ultimately enjoy the trailers more than the movie. She cut right to the chase with a concise and easy to remember answer - ""crap!"" Does ""Prince of Persia"" deserve to be called crap? I think to do so will at least nod toward the fact that some of these big blockbuster type movies are trending toward being unforgettable and unsatisfying. Don't worry ""Iron Man II"" I'm not talking about you but yes ""Clash of the Titans"" I am talking about you. I guess now I need to justify such a lukewarm response to Prince of Persia...<br/><br/>I was never any good at video games although I did have a good run at Frogger one time. My characters are klutzes who bump into things and die in embarrassing and shameful ways. Based on all of the jumping, leaping and wall climbing involved in ""Prince of Persia"", I am sure I would have sucked at the video game the movie is based on. This story is set in the sprawling empire of Persia and is about Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) who was adopted by the King and rescued from the life of a street urchin. This happens because like most movie orphans Dastan practically glows with spunk and virtue that the King may see missing in his own over privileged family. The downside of this situation is that eventually somebody is going to try to discredit and/or kill you. When the King is killed, Dastan is framed and finds himself on the run with the most beautiful princess in all of Persia (Gemma Arterton as Tamina). She is no ordinary bare belly Persian princess though because she is the sacred protector of a dagger that contains the ""sands of time"" which can turn back time. While on the run we get all of the expected video game like action, effects like Dastan using the dagger and snarky flirting between Dastan and Tamina. It's the type of flirting that really begs ""get a room"" or in this case a tent but never rises to the level of passion implied later in the movie.<br/><br/>The plot really fails when there is exposition about what to do with the dagger. There is a source for the sand but putting the dagger there will lead to very, very bad things, It can be returned to the stone from which it was made or ( and this is where I checked out) there is a secret fortress where it can always be kept safe. OK, why not keep it at the fortress to begin with? Also we only see one other person besides Dastan use the dagger and why not? Couldn't said brave princess use the dagger's power to keep it from being capture to begin with? Oh well, we end up with a huge finale full of sand, fire and death that leads to......wait for it.... a big fat reset button that renders all we have seen moot. <br/><br/>Good points? The scenes of vast deserts and Persian palaces are done well. Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley can go to the head of the class because they play their one note characters well. Molina is used for quite a few laughs and Kingsley arches his eyebrows in just the right deceptively evil way throughout the movie. I've read that Jake Gyllenhaal's nicely buffed up body might be a reason to pay up and see this movie. I prefer leaner Brokeback Jake, and I don't think the abs factor even makes this movie worth the price of admission."

","What's with Video Gamers with no sense for film doing putting down this film? Shouldn't you all be busy buying EGM's Calander Issue for the sexiest pixel breasts? Seriously guys, let me break down to you why this movie is a great dedication to the game series. From someone who has played and beaten it.<br/><br/>The movie would have been an 8 or higher if the action was a bit more involved. People keep claiming this movie had amazing parkour. It was good, but hardly amazing (comparing this to the freelance free-runners seen on Youtube that are a dime a dozen). Now I am not asking for more blood. I understand this is Disney and they have limits, but there seemed to be some slow moments (think The Mummy Returns).<br/><br/>Actually! This is a lot like the Mummy Series. Now maybe I am just being biased and geographically racist ""A desert flick is a desert flick"", but the action is few and far between with some hardly enamored moments, and very staggered pacing. But! The film still survives my critical grasp for giving it a low score, because it's a great play off the game series, the cast was phenomenal, and the effects were top notch.<br/><br/>Now for you gamers saying they didn't stick to the story good enough. If we take this as the first movie to the first game, let me correct you in your assumption that you're smart. You're an idiot. Sorry, no one would make profit on a movie based on a guy running around a castle that is more dilapidated than Ground Zero. No one would watch a movie with a shallow story line; like that in the first game. (This is not a video game review, but I do love that game, but let's face it. A full transition into a movie would be worst than Saw XXIII).<br/><br/>So is this film worth seeing in theaters? Maybe. Kids loved this film, so take them, it's a rare kids movie that the jaded father won't mind. If you have no interest in a watered down action movie, wait for it on Bluray. If you simply spend money on just the best of that genre. Then save your money for A-Team for your action movie for summer."

Arterton was very good as well and unlike in most movies like this her character played more than just the stand in pretty girl. Kingsley was as well great and played the part perfectly. And finally the much talked about Molina. He was well great as well. The supporting cast was even well enough. So it goes without saying, the acting is above par here.<br/><br/>The story line was a clichéd yet interesting one and very easy to follow. The action scenes were immensely entertaining and the effects were great at times and not so great looking at others.

The movie was fun, gave me a laugh here and there, gave me some sleep urges in the middle but nothing too slow.The amount of action definitely keeps it going.<br/><br/>This is similar to the mummy and the new clash of the titans, but definitely a lot more fun than the latter.

","Have you watched and enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean, King Arthur and National Treasure? Well then you very probably like Prince of Persia. To be honest my expectations were not that low, considering Jerry Bruckheimer as producer. It really fulfilled all my expectations. First, the movie feels good, it feels genuine, the sets look great, the costumes, good acting, it's all there. Plus it has nice story that keeps it easy to follow. The length was just right, maybe ten minutes longer wouldn't have hurt, but still it was long enough. It also felt they set the cast for the movie to support upcoming sequels, and I hope they are coming. Now over to the overall acting, first off is Jake, and he convinces. By my knowledge the first movie he played an action role, and he executed it brilliantly. Then we have Gemma, as the princess, besides sometimes, especially in the beginning, an annoying accent. She was OK, she didn't do anything special, in good way but neither in a bad way. She was there, she looked good, but in the sequels I hope see more of her background and dig more into the character, making her a real show/scene stealer. So her problems were more on paper than in the real acting. Then we have Sir Ben Kingsley, and he plays the villain, but not so you know it from the start, they build onto that moment and it comes out brilliantly. And then to the ending, for one it's a little pity, everything they did in throughout the movie is undone, but that is what you get with time traveling. So aside from the ending and Gemma's character, it's a solid action/video game adaptation, and I'm eagerly awaiting the Blu-Ray release of the movie."

"Ryan_MYeah","8","3","6","7 June 2010"," The first good film adaptation of a video game.
","Maybe Jerry Bruckheimer was hoping this movie might become the next Pirates of the Caribbean. Well, this movie fell short of that feat. But, you know what? It actually fell closer than you'd think.<br/><br/>Based on the video game series, the film stars Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan, a young man who years earlier, was living on the streets of Persia, until he was adopted by the king. He helps his brother, Tus (played by Richard Coyle) invade a kingdom accused of forging weapons for enemies of Persia, all the while finding a mysterious dagger. Life is good, until Dastan is forced to live as a fugitive, after a traitor in his family frames him for murdering the king. He travels across the desert with the guardian of the dagger, the beautiful Princess Tamina (Played by Gemma Arterton). Dastan learns that the dagger has the ability to turn back time, and only the holder of the dagger is aware of what has happened. They both must protect the dagger from ending up in the wrong hands, and if it does, it could unleash a sandstorm that would destroy humanity.<br/><br/>Okay, so the plot is pretty much by-the-book Bruckheimer. It has a rather simplistic action filled plot, the threat of an oncoming apocalypse of hellfire proportions, silly, yet clever comic relief (provided here by Alfred Molina), and two romantic leads who sometimes choose the oddest of times to kiss. It has a bit of predictability to it, but it's simplicity honestly isn't a bad thing. And the action in the movie is fast paced, and never loses interest thanks to film editors Mick Audsley, Martin Walsh, and film editing LEGEND Michael Kahn.<br/><br/>The performances are good in the film as well. Jake Gyllenhaal (who probably isn't THE most obvious action star) was very good in a very physically demanding role, and carries the film so well. Gemma Arterton was fine in the film, and she has good chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Alfred Molina was such fun in his role, providing some great chuckles. And Ben Kingsley (Bald and/or scarred villain number 964 and counting) was great to watch as the jealous brother of the king, who murders him, and wants the dagger to, you guessed it, take over Persia.<br/><br/>I also have to throw out praise to the technical crew, who made this movie look and sound so impressive. I'll give special mentions to Production Designer Wolf Kroeger, who made an epic Persia with a little style thrown in, and Costume Designer Penny Rose of the Pirates of the Caribbean trilogy, for creating such lovely costumes.<br/><br/>And, I am happy to say that this is the first film adaptation of a video game that was actually GOOD. It's always a tricky source material to adapt, but it did it so well. It's not perfect, but it's a vast improvement.<br/><br/>Predictable, yes, but I never once got bored while watching it. It has good performances, good humor, and thrilling action sequences.<br/><br/>It's a good movie, that's a lot of fun, so I give it *** out of ****"

Yes, the CGI is all in the background and it allows stunts to be beefed up, but not in your face like a Cameron movie - note to James, watch this and learn, less is more! It is a pretty romp, very much in the tradition of Harryhausen-based Sinbad films or even further back to Sabu! As such it does not demand too much, and bounces along like an old friend. OK so there is one too many chase sequences through the crowded marketplace, and the film stops for the plot explanations to occur, but at least there is an attempt at plot and characterisation! Writing is alright, and the direction fairly pacey if startlingly unoriginal. The acting is minimally challenging - English accents all round, old boy, because it is about kings and absolute rulers! No problem with the basis being a video game because most video games are based on old films or stories anyway! Full circle! The plot to save the world because a valuable artefact might get into the wrong hands of an evil old bald guy is pretty standard for action thrillers and fantasy adventures. A pity the film was not shot in sequence, because the most distracting thing is Gemma Arterton's complexion, which ranges from white to freckles to reddish sunburn in no particular order! far more distracting than Crowe's accent in 'Robin Hood!' I don't rate Jake Gyllenhaal as an action hero - he's rather limited and one note - so can we have a bit of heft next time, which means no Sam Worthington as a replacement!!!!!!!!!!!"

The story also remained fairly faithful to the original game, which also for me, made the movie more enjoyable. But with the parts they did change they executed well and I was still happy.

""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is a familiar swashbuckling adventure only transplanted to the Middle East and outfitted with turbans, swords with even bigger curves, snakes and lots and lots of sand.<br/><br/>Based on the popular video game created by Jordan Mechner, fans will delight to hear that ""Prince of Persia"" is one of few truly enjoyable adaptations out there. But then again, when Disney is there to throw money at it, this is hardly unexpected. I can't speak to loyalty toward characters or game story lines, but only a few lines of expository dialogue that repeat a bit too often and one or two scenes actually feel mildly like a video game.<br/><br/>""Persia"" lacks the charm of ""Pirates,"" but there's no deficit in the area of thrills or adventure. The plot is sometimes too complex for its own good; at numerous points we turn to Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) as she explains some previously missing piece of information about the sands of time that suddenly shift the direction of the story toward yet another adventure or action sequence, but it's not poorly contrived -- just contrived -- and the thrills that await don't disappoint both in terms of visual effects and creative fun.<br/><br/>Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was an orphan plucked from the streets and raised as a prince for a heroic act he performed as a child. Fast-forward to now. After leading a crafty siege of Tamina's holy kingdom of Alamut, who allegedly has been aiding Persia's enemies, Dastan is framed for the king's murder and becomes a fugitive from his own people, escaping with the help of Tamina. The reason for all of this is a dagger that controls time, which fortunately, Dastan possesses. But all it means is more trouble awaits them both.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal wears the blockbuster lead hero crown just as well as everyone thought he would and Arterton (""Clash of the Titans"") matches his likability in giving the film's only multi- dimensional performance. Their classic loathing-turned-love romance subplot ends up being the only attention the script gives to developing character, but they achieve the goal of winning the audience's favor in spite of some ineffective humor. Alfred Molina's money-grubbing side character is about as funny as ""Persia"" gets and funny just means he can be a pretty good quirky character actor.<br/><br/>""Persia"" works as a fun summer holiday blockbuster with flaws that are not too difficult to overlook, kind of like last Christmas' ""Sherlock Holmes"" only without the prowess of a Robert Downey Jr. at the helm. Mike Newell (""Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire"") knows how to command a fun film and get the most bite in terms of action for a PG-13 movie. There are one or two more jumping or slow-mo shots of Gyllenhaal than necessary, but never a dull moment, especially with the script's ever-building momentum. There's probably not enough juice here for two or any sequels for that matter, but ""Persia"" is far from another mediocre video game adaptation.<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site at http://moviemusereviews.com"

","'Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time' brings back escapism, it brings back the fun element in the auditorium. Now, My brothers are unabashed fans of the games based on this legendary character, it's a craze in my house! I anyways enjoy talking about 'Prince Of Persia', so watching this one was a must! I expected entertainment from 'Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time' and it delivers that! <br/><br/>It's loosely based on the 2003 video game of the same name, and thats the reason why I liked it. It's a different take altogether. Plus, Mike Newell's direction is stylish, which only adds to the advantage. John Seale's Camera-Work is also superb! <br/><br/>Coming to the acting department, Jake Gyllenhaal suits the part and has performed well. Gemma Arterton looks angelic, and delivers a performance that is sure to be noticed! Sir Ben Kingsley is convincing as the menace. Alfred Molina is first-rate in a brief role.<br/><br/>Summing up Satement: If u love 'Prince Of Persia', then u will surely enjoy this one. And for those, who have never played the game and experienced it... Watch this film by expecting entertainment, not enlightenment! Reccmended!"

Well the game was very popular and it has a really good storyline. Everyone who played the game will like it. Even though they could've made it better it is still a good movie. And as with the game I think the second movie (if they make another movie, which I think they should)will be much better.<br/><br/>The movie is worth watching if you like the genre, but if you go to the theatre with too big expectations you probably will be disappointed, it is not avatar after all."

","I've seen The Clash of the titans and I thought that was a bad movie, but this one takes the victory! I did't like the beginning, it reminded me of the beginning of some childish very bad fairytale. Jake as Dastan (not a good choice) as some punk kid who is ''playing in the sand'' and than showing us that he is more than that...in a Hollywood kind of way. The cast of other actors gave me the answer who is who just after 15min...Richard Coyle is not the one who suppose to be serious lead character, I was always holding not to laugh when he was having his 5 minutes (Coupling was the reason) and Ben Kingsley was the only one who was there because the third brother (yes, I can't remember the name of his character) was not remotely relevant - his character is like the one in bad teenage horror movie who dies first. Next...the story is severely poor, almost offending not to mention the relationship between Tamina and Dastan. Action sequence are weird with accent on very small details and not on whole action scene, sometimes they cut one part and continue from another angle without the end of the scene before (you have to see to understand)... Basically, one of those movies that you'll soon forget and after couple of days you would not remember no matter how hard you try. Too bad..."

It will be a totally Awesome piece of beauty filled with fantasy and Picturesque scenarios that will leave enough for the imagination to play with. <br/><br/>Prince of Persia:Sands of time delivers with utmost preciseness and enough enjoyment to last for a long time to come.

","You can see what they were after - that Pirates Of The Caribbean vibe. Unfortunately, they didn't get a script that sparkled, nor did they get anything like Johnny Depp's out of left field performance.<br/><br/>Instead they got a workmanlike and likable hero in Jake Gyllenhaal's Prince Dastan, a feisty (is there any other sort?) and sometimes rather too shrill princess in Gemma Arterton, a selection of royal relatives led by Ben Kingsley who kept you wondering briefly whether they were friends or foes, a comedy sheik in Alfred Molina, a colour palette consisting of different shades of sand, some OK CGI, a story which kept going enough to hold your interest (with chunks borrowed from CS Lewis' Narnia book A Horse And His Boy), shedloads of action, and early sections comprising a definite tip of the hat to Disney's animated Aladdin.<br/><br/>There were also things you didn't get. You didn't get (as soon as you understood that the maguffin was a mechanism to enable you to go back in time) much dramatic tension - if you know that time can be wound backwards then you never really feel that your characters are in any real jeopardy: the time reversal needs to be hidden in order for there to be anything at stake, but here it was displayed in the title. You also didn't get a classic score - you got functional underscoring with middle eastern influences. And you didn't get much flesh - OK, so it was Disney, but Miss Arterton was a very heavily covered up princess. It would have been welcome if there had been navel sightings from time to time, or if a bit more bosom had heaved into view.<br/><br/>So I was entertained, but it didn't give me any more than I expected."

","When it discovered that a nearby holy city may be manufacturing weapons for enemy states of Persia, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and his brothers decide to attack the city in order to stop the treachery. When King Sharaman of Persia (Ronald Pickup) arrives Dastan offers his father a gift that ends up poisoning him. Dastan is suspected of murder and so he flees along with the captured Tamina (Gemma Arterton). Dastan soon discovers that he is possession of a powerful dagger that gives its bearer the ability to rewind time.<br/><br/>The Sands of Time is based upon the 2003 video game of the same name but there are few similarities shared between the two. For starters, the narrative is completely different but that does not stop certain story elements from the game sneaking into the odd scene of the film. Fans will definitely appreciate this aspect but their disappointment in the lack of faithfulness to the original game can be understood to some degree. While adaptations always bring about fun possibilities by never been entirely accurate, Prince of Persia forgoes a tale of the Prince finding redemption in place of a tried-and-tested tale of the protagonist attempting to clear their name of some terrible act not of their doing. This inevitably leads to a variety of locales in place of the single castle which contextualised the game and ultimately feels less unique then the premise of the film allows it to be. That said the story works just fine even though it loses direction on the odd occasion. It falls victim to being predictable at times but a decent mix of humour and some workable action sequences keep the experience from never being dull. On a side note, the film does get some depth from its political allusions to the US invasion of Iraq.<br/><br/>The cast can appear unorthodox considering it is a group of Westerners playing Persians and without any changes to speech. Though considering the original game contained a British speaking Caucasian protagonist, the casting come across more like a stylised option rather than a lack of desire to authenticity. The actors do a reasonable job but consistency is somewhat of a problem. At times the actors come across as flat but thankfully there is a charm to Gyllenhaal, intrigue with Arterton, and workable humour from Alfred Molina which prevents the acting from being poor. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arterton only ever finds ground with their constant quips so their romance never feels involved enough by the films end.<br/><br/>The film is littered with computer animation and many acrobatic manoeuvres. The animation is an on and off affair but thankfully does more right than wrong. The scale of some of the imagery is wonderful such as the establishing scenes of the holy city and especially the Hourglass of Time itself. Though, the scenes involving the reverse of time appear underdeveloped. The acrobatic sequences are fairly enjoyable affairs but they are more akin to the Prince of Persia spiritual successor Assassin's Creed rather than the original game itself.<br/><br/>As a Disney film you can expect that nudity and sexual content play no role in the film. The same goes for language while the violence, frequent and somewhat lengthy at times, is relatively bloodless and involves a variety of weaponry slashes and stabbings.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an intriguing take on its source material, albeit an obviously commercial one. Perhaps, the creators felt that the original plot was not marketable enough and for all intents and purposes they are most likely correct. The problem for the film is its lack of individuality in a stream of Hollywood blockbuster titles: it is just a pity that with a workable plot and metaphorical imagery that the film never reaches the height of its proposed fantastical nature. Granted, the narrative, acting, and base level sense of wonder gets the job done and makes for a fun time. Though, you would think that if the creators themselves had access to the mythical Dagger of Time, they could have gone back and given the film the needed sharpening it deserves."

","Quite possibly the best video game movie ever (so my favourite game movie Silent Hill goes down to number 2). Unlike other game movies where there is no seriousness or lack of originality/not sticking to the source material. This movie delivers greatness in all aspects. Mike Newell (Monalisa Smile - watch it if you still haven't) proved yet again that he is capable of directing a movie of any genre. (He is also my 3rd favourite director of the Harry Potter films). Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a big WIN 'cause it has DEPTH and not many video game movies have that. With an amazing cast (some unexpected awesomeness) and crew, this is a 'must watch, worth every penny' movie. Not only this movie does justice to the amazing video game(s), it will make the fans go crazy and clap with both hands and feet like I did. Jordan Mechner must be happy and proud!"

","I just came back from the midnight showing of this and I have to say that one thing these reviews did do for me is help me enjoy the movie a lot more. I went in preparing to have dung hurled at me for the length of the film, when in actuality, I came out of the theater with the same feeling that I had when I left Pirates of the Caribbean. Now, by this I don't mean that it is like Pirates of the Caribbean, but it achieves its goal through different means, strumming different chords with the audience.<br/><br/>The acting was a bit clichéd in parts, the dialogue iffy in others, but all in all, it was a believable film that made me forget I was in a theater, which is the goal of films altogether: to suck you so far into the story that you aren't thinking about anything else.<br/><br/>As a side note, I found this also to be a more romantic story than that of POTC and I found the protagonist to be much less annoying than Will Turner (who I believe was poorly acted by Orlando Bloom).<br/><br/>But really, don't just read reviews and decide if you want to see it. It is definitely worth your money, if anything for the entertainment value. See it for yourself and don't take the brain-work of critics, for we all know that bad criticism could mean it is either really good or really bad. And it seems like everyone is a critic these days.<br/><br/>A solid 7.5 from me, but a 1- on the review's scale just to help bump it up."

","Whilst the movie is BEAUTIFUL in many aspects, it mashes together aspects of all 3 games, with elements of Assassins Creed, which, while making for BEAUTIFUL cinematography equals a really awful story untrue to the games. In addition to the fact that the story has been horribly twisted and mutated to fit a love story (which it contained, but wasn't the most defining part of it), the character truly learns nothing, unlike in the game. He doesn't grow. The movie twists key parts of the story, and adds an awful, garish soundtrack, where the original lines and soundtrack would've been far more than sufficient. And what the frak was with Jake's posh British accent that's totally misplaced?"
"harry_tk_yung","Null","3","7","31 May 2010"," More than just video game adaptation
","It has been publicised that this movies evolves from a video game. But if I hadn't heard, I would have recognized it 10 minutes into the movie, with the first action scene, an ambush of a walled city and palace. The venue and the action sequences cannot have proclaimed this more loudly. Subsequence scenes all reinforce this connection. I intend this observation to be a compliment. Taking fighting sequences from movies, video games have given them a new, intriguing vitality. Putting these now well-developed sequences back on to the big screen in turn gives them a new attraction.<br/><br/>But this is not all video-game action. This is a remarkably old fashion adventure that brings back everything you have always enjoyed from heroic tales in their prime Hollywood days, plus sprinkles of exotic updates. It is somewhat pointless to indulge in a detail description of the plot or the feast of almost non-stop entertainment, in one way or another. Just go and enjoy.<br/><br/>Gemma Arterton, with pouting lips (""..that seem to say: kiss me, kiss me, kiss me, kiss me."" – operetta ""Princess Ida"", Gilbert and Sullivan), has an additional edge in being able to project intelligence and sincerity when needed. Though he is trying, Jake Gyllenhaal still has a long way to go in shedding his ""nice guy"" image (maybe he needs more time, like Leonardo DiCaprio with his pretty boy image) even though he did manage a degree of flippancy. But, as one female movie columnist in a local magazine intimates, ""Gyllenhaal looks hot(but) the prince of Persia ain't no Captain Jack Sparrow"". What can I say?"
"DarthPaul85","5","3","7","29 May 2010"," Not as good as the game.
","I hate to say this, but the game Prince of Persia is superior to this film in every way.<br/><br/>The game is funnier, has better dialogue, and (IMO) has a better ending.<br/><br/>There were a couple moments in the film where some original vision came through, but ultimately the movie felt watered down, clichéd (studio-driven) and lacked any real character. The acting wasn't bad, but it had such a dull script to work with.<br/><br/>I think I should excuse the film for any problems about ""plot"" or ""writing,"" though. This is, after all, a movie based on a video game which is based on acrobatics. And there are some good stunts in the movie, but not nearly enough to carry the film. Not even enough to make it a selling point for the movie. And to its credit, the movie didn't ""mess anything up"" from the first game's major storyline. Perhaps the writers and producers thought it best to keep things simple so as to not stray too far from the established game story. Unfortunately, I think they over-simplified...<br/><br/>..Why doesn't the prince narrate this story? ..Why doesn't the prince have the same wit he had in the game? ..Why is the dagger only used two or three times? ..Why are there sub-plots in a film that barely has a central story to begin with? ..And for the love of god, what is the point of the intro/exit titles that appear with the sand dunes? They're completely inane and don't fit the tone of the film.<br/><br/>So if I had gone into this film with no expectations, I would have said it was a mediocre action/adventure movie, worth a rental but that's it. But it's based on such a great game, a game that actually had a plot and storyline. I wished the filmmakers had trusted the game's universe more, and relied less on watered-down adventure-movie clichés. This one could've been great...if only Hollywood could turn back time and try again."

","Prince of Persia – Sands of Time Not being too big a fan of the newer Prince on Persia games, I went into watching this movie with a pretty neutral frame of mind. But having played the old school version of Prince of Persia, I had a feeling of familiarity while watching this. But let me just tell you, there's not too much common with that old version of the game and the movie.<br/><br/>This film is about this boy Dastan(Jake Gyllenhaal) from the streets, who is picked up by the king of Persia(King Sharaman – played by Ronald Pickup), for showing heroics and courage during one of the king's rides through the village. His men are about to kill the poor boy when the King realizes that the little kid has potential and goodness in him, so he decides to adopt him and commands his second-in-chief, Nizam(Ben Kingsley) to take the boy with them to the palace. There he grows up to be a good courageous prince along with his two brothers, who are the real sons of the King.<br/><br/>Jump to the present, Nizam convinces the King that the Persian army should conquer the city of Alamut because he has reason to believe that it was producing WMD's. So after conquering the peaceful city of Alamut, Dastan is falsely accused of killing his father but miraculously escapes with the beautiful princess(Princess Tamina – played by Gemma Arterton) of Alamut. He discovers that Alamut was indeed a peace loving city and that there was a plot to steal the 'dagger' which could take one back in time, which also looks like a WMD. To save the world from destruction and to clear his name as well, he goes on an adventure with princess Tamina all across Persia where he meets Sheik Amar(Alfred Molina), a conman and a funny touch to the movie who races ostriches and hates the government because he thinks they charge useless taxes.<br/><br/>This movie is a decent one time watch, nothing great, not too bad either. It hasn't got any memorable action sequences, most of them look a little fake and way too computerized. And specially after James Cameron's Avatar, a lot of the special effects are gonna look fake, unless they are done in the same way as Avatar's.<br/><br/>A decent pop corn flick, not too much substance, average acting, poor effects but bearable.<br/><br/>Even if you don't watch it, you're not missing anything great.<br/><br/>5/10"

It was the first game, for me, that elicited a kind of reverence from me. The way your footsteps echoed through the empty halls, dust hanging in the air, listening to the narrator (the main character) recant his story as you slowly worked your way through these decrepit ruins which, despite their condition, still had a certain beauty and grandeur. Apart from the enemies and occasional NPC's, it was just you, alone, trying to find your way home. It was a solemn experience. <br/><br/>The film, however, with it's Mummy-esque, jarringly juxtaposed slap-stick comedy, it's lively marketplaces full of people, and it's romantic tension-infused banter, bares almost no resemblance whatsoever to the game which it is based on.

","PRINCE OF PERSIA: THE SANDS OF TIME is the movie adaptation of a long-running video game about a character who embraces an ancient form of Parkour; the game invariably involved having him jump from ledge to ledge and platform to platform, making his way through myriad scenarios in a quest for riches.<br/><br/>Unfortunately this turns out to be an exercise in movie-making that is both generic and soulless. The plot seems to have been inspired by the likes of PIRATES OF THE Caribbean, taking its characters through a series of frankly unbelievable situations and dealing out oodles of mind-numbing action sequences which are filled with effects and little else. There's no style in sight and director Mike Newell brings the same level of disconnected coldness to the characters as he did in HARRY POTTER AND THE GOBLET OF FIRE.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal's wooden hero Dastan is uncomfortable enough but the real embarrassment is in the shape of the comely Gemma Arterton, who delivers a performance of such excruciating awfulness that it brings to mind her best-forgotten antics in QUANTUM OF SOLACE. Arterton's plummy accent and stilted delivery combine with her vapid character to make her the most grating love interest yet seen in a movie, instantly dragging the film's rating down a point.<br/><br/>Serviceable special effects fill the screen with all manner of sparkling wonder yet none of it means anything, and the plot is so slight as to be not worth mentioning. Ben Kingsley's villain is straight from a pantomime, complete with twirling moustaches, and I find it a little sad that ALL of the major cast members are played by western actors, rendering the Middle Eastern history a joke.

Anyways back to the story, the beauty of the game was the fact that only the prince, farah and the vizier remained in the country. the additional characters in this movie was super annoying and bogus! <br/><br/>-The game has so much touching moments unlike the movie where too much is happening at the same time for instance the part with the dagger and his brother.<br/><br/>-The ending was so bad I wanted to cry. The game has one of the best ending ever. The call me ""Kakolokia"" was amazing, he doesn't have to get the princess and thats what makes story memorable."

","Despite many negative reviews about this movie I still pretty much find it pretty entertaining, it is definitely not the best or as entertaining like Pirates of the Caribbean (actually it can't really be compared) but it definitely fun film to watch.<br/><br/>Synopsis: A young prince was framed for the murder of his father; as a fugitive he must now tried everything to prove his innocent with the help of the princess Tamina and her time reversing sand dagger.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia almost has everything to it – good casts, entertaining story, big budget, good director and so on; but what it lacks was charisma, humor and that ""wow factor"" into it. And that what takes it toll on what suppose to be super fun film.<br/><br/>The story is not something new (mind you I base my review on film, never get the chance to play the game yet), or you can say you have seen it zillion of time like Scorpion King or read it from Arabian Nights. But we haven't really seen anything that really base on Arab like this since Aladdin and You Don't Mess with Zohan (don't ask me how does it get into my mind) so it is nice to see some from Hollywood. I say go along with this ""pretty much"" childish storyline and some flaws of it and try to enjoy one self.<br/><br/>If you can't do that, then watch Jake as Prince of Persia – He fit the role perfectly (maybe a bit too muscular) but I can't see anyone better than him. Other people are also great too; thought due to the underdevelopment in their character people will not really recognize or remember them at all.<br/><br/>Otherwise I think everything else was OK, the wardrobe, the score, CGI, the backdrop, though dialog and acting was a bit wooden from time to time, but all in all acceptable in some level. Though the lack of major ""memorable"" scene make this movie just a one time watcher and after having seen it people will forget about it within two days.<br/><br/>Overall, I think it was just OK. Worth a DVD rental from the store, but will definitely not be adding this into my collection.<br/><br/>Reason to Watch: Jake, better watch on boring night (with friend maybe).<br/><br/>Reason not to: A bit too happy, too predictable.<br/><br/>Rating: 6/10 (Grade: c)"
"Just_James","2","2","4","13 October 2010"," Not even a little good
","I had high hopes for an fantasy action thriller based on a game I played years ago as a kid. The movie had a lot of promise but failed to deliver on many points. Technically it is not well done. The camera is jerky during intense scenes, the CGI looks like it was done by the local community college and the world is way too plastic and cardboard to get you in the moment. The characters are flat, the British accents are really distracting and the director really likes scenes with people alone in high places while the camera whirls around them. Being a Disney film, there are no mothers or any really useful female characters. Even the female lead comes across as half baked, overly proud an in need of a man to save her. I wish I had something nice to say about the movie, but it just had no redeeming qualities."

","From the enthralling and imaginative mind of the Persian story-tellers comes this incredible Arabian tale of the "" Prince of Persia, The sands of Time. "" Directed by Mike Newell, who followed the writer Boaz Yakin script, this is a magical legend which tells of Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) a common youth, plucked from the very streets of Persia and adopted into the royal family, due to his remarkable courage and adventurous spirit. Raised next to his royal brothers, he is bonded to the Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who's remarkable beauty has become legendary. His scheming uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) is but one of his many teachers. Another is the friendly enough, but highly unpredictable scoundrel and desert Arab Sheik (wonderfully played by Alfred Molina). Together they each have much to learn as they invade a fabulous, mountainous city to search for a magical knife who's powers can make one the Ruler of the Earth. With many of the same elements taken from a dozen movies, like 'Pirates, Simbad the Sailor and of course Jumanji' this movie is exciting, dramatic and filled with magical CGI wonders. Despite being hampered with romantic almost-sequences, it makes up for it with incredible displays of physical confrontations and cinematic landscapes. All in all, a wonderful escape film made for any audience seeking full screen entertainment ****"

","Uwe Boll could have directed it.<br/><br/>Throw all the money in the world at this and it's still junk. Arterton is never going to be a leading lady, this and Clash of the Titans is enough to prove this. She may get away with some quirky British films but even then...<br/><br/>Just after halfway through this film I was getting seriously bored. Kingsley was stereotyped and wasted as an actor, Jake is, well, meh. And as stated a few lines up Arterton is, well who cares and that's the point. She could have died early on and I'd have not not given a second thought.<br/><br/>I don't care how much you throw at a movie and this had a lot of dollars, you can't take poo, cover it in glitter and call it a diamond.

If your stuck and this is only option, see if you can make it to the end.<br/><br/>Now perhaps, if your a Prince of Persia game junkie and have some kind of emotional link from gaming, your experience may be more enjoyable.

Gemma is pretty, and the only refreshment here was Molina who was really funny and if it wasn't for Him I would have maybe stopped watching it.<br/><br/>Also good thing is that it's better than Clash of the Titans, mostly because Clash was trying desperately to be serious, and the fights are better here."
"colinrgeorge","4","2","4","14 June 2010"," The Prince's New Clothes
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is the sort of stupidly grinning blockbuster I might find intolerable if it weren't so damn silly. Nearly every aspect is misguided, broken, corny, or all of the above, and yet when brooding melodrama is the status quo for summer releases, it's refreshing to be able to laugh my ass off at the expense of a cheeseball like this.<br/><br/>Of course, I'm beginning to believe its many flaws were predestined; it is a video game adaptation, after all—And according to Rotten Tomatoes, the best yet. That I'm inclined to agree, despite its stagey references to the high-flying acrobatics of its virtual progenitor, speaks volumes. If there's one thing the ""Prince of Persia"" film does right, it's to downplay its video gaminess by crafting a story that isn't exclusively a series of action sequences (historically, the problem with these adaptations is that they're about as engaging as watching someone else play a video game).<br/><br/>Nevertheless, there's still that wink and nod to the source material that I can't imagine even fans care about. It's as if, in adapting a book, a director felt the need to insert page-turn animations as scene transitions to remind the audience that his characters are adapted from a different medium. I don't care what it used to be; it's a film now.<br/><br/>Appropriately then, even more so than the somewhat-popular game series, ""Prince of Persia"" draws heavy influence from Disney's other live-action flagship franchise, ""Pirates of the Caribbean."" It's painfully obvious that Jake Gyllenhaal is meant to be a charming scoundrel in the vein of Jack Sparrow, but that character and performance are a tough act to follow, especially when you're doing the same routine.<br/><br/>Characterization is generally uninspired in the film, ranging from one-dimensional (Gemma Arterton as a feisty princess), to cliché (Sir Ben Kingsley as the Royal Council with an eye on the throne—Oops, spoiler), to the chin-scratching ridiculous (Alfred Molina as an ostrich racing bookie). It makes for a film that's often funny in spite of itself, with earnestly delivered lines like, ""You can't organize an ostrich race WITH JUST ONE OSTRICH!"" and curiously long reaction shots accentuating Gyllenhaal's bizarre facial contractions.<br/><br/>But the Prince's ultimate failure is that his film, in its transparent attempt at cinematic junk food, critically ignores its plot, which is as cavity-stricken as a decaying tooth. Granted, it may not consist of a string of forgettable action sequences, but ""Prince of Persia"" is instantly forgettable regardless because it never feels substantial, and its McGuffin—That is, the 'dagger of time,' which grants its carrier the ability to undo the present and travel a finite distance into the past—Is underutilized. In its stead are scenes chock-full of verbose and expository character herding devices, which for all their impatient roving, never manage to bring our heroes anywhere interesting or visually distinct. My whole experience with ""Prince of Persia"" is sort of a beige blur.<br/><br/>Had the film been cut drastically shorter and thematically simplified, there may have been a cute little family action film here, but instead, it submits to the running time penis-measuring contest; any title under 100 minutes need not apply. ""Prince of Persia"" clocks in at just under two hours, and with so little narrative cohesion, it's not hard to start picking out the extraneous chunks. What you get is a messy and dissonant sword-and-sandals wannabe epic that carries not a single distinguishing mark.<br/><br/>Well, there is the one. ""Prince of Persia"" dares to attempt fun in an age of doom and gloom gravitas, and it succeeds—Albeit at it's own expense."
"jshadle0807","7","2","4","31 May 2010"," Slightly Different Perspective
","I saw the trailer for this movie and not gonna lie, I was not planning on seeing it. It didn't look all that great and when I found out that it was based on a video game, I thought it would god awful.<br/><br/>I was very wrong.<br/><br/>The Positives: <br/><br/>I found the plot to very unpredictable. There're some twists and I didn't expect any of them. Well, no I expected one but then it changed. And the change worked.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal and Arterton have good chemistry. Gyllenhaal was looking hot as always and he proved himself worthy of being an action-movie-hero complete with never-failing-honor. Arterton was not as wooden as she's been in the past and manages to bring emotion, wit, and charm to her character.<br/><br/>The fight scenes were sweet. Parkour is the new style and it worked in this film although it could have been used a little less. But that's just a personal preference. All of the choreography worked.<br/><br/>The cinematography was fabulous! All of the places they traveled to and lived in were beautiful yet realistic. They're a treat to watch! <br/><br/>The Negatives: <br/><br/>There are a lot of 'oh now they're about to kiss really slowly but then stop and go save the world' moments and they get real old real fast. So old that when a kiss does happen, we don't care.<br/><br/>If the one character wasn't there, there would be no comic relief. The script is good and doesn't allow for many quips but sometimes we need a quip. At least, a few more than this film allows.<br/><br/>The snakes get old. They're not scary and are unnecessary. Besides, the guy who owns them? He keeps popping up and we don't know him at all. I was really curious about him but we only know a little (that I won't give away).<br/><br/>However, I give the film a 7.5/10 overall. And I never played or have seen the video games. I went into this film with very low expectations but I am very glad I saw it. I would recommend Prince of Persia to anyone. It's a great summer flick and I believe its the best of the films based on video games genre."

I can tell that I enjoyed almost every part of it! <br/><br/>The action was great, you will enjoy every scene. Actors were pretty good,some say that Jake Gyllenhaal doesn't fit for the role but he actually does and even though I thought that the story would be bad it turned out to be decent. It has some good twists and it keeps your interest 'till the very end.<br/><br/>I consider myself as a fan of the game and I was glad that the movie has the atmosphere of it!<br/><br/>So in my opinion it's a ""must see"" movie of the year, don't miss it!"
"montera_iulian","7","2","4","30 May 2010"," One Of The Underrated Movies of 2010...
","I will admit three things at first: the plot is not as accurate as you might want to, Jake Gyllenhaal was a so-and-so Dastan and that the movie was so underrated that I had to overrate it a little bit.<br/><br/>The trailers for this movie made it look like another cheap Hollywood representation but after I saw this movie in the theater it did changed my view on it. In the beginning I was not expecting something good from it so I was bashing it from the start but 20 minutes into the movie and I was surprised. It made the movie like it might be something good and it turned to be a good movie and entertaining. Now I won't speak upon the script, but I'll just say that it isn't accurate in 100% but ignoring that I enjoyed the wonderful made action scenes and the way the movie was delivered. What I want to mention though is that the dialogue might seem a little bit forced at times and it didn't actually delivered too much emotion to it so I don't know if that's a good or a bad thing because I was having a really fun time watching the action even if some of the stunts were pretty ridiculous.<br/><br/>It sets a specific mood from the beginning, it has a great cast especially Ben Kingsley or Alfred Molina who seem they can take on any role and turn it into something exciting to watch. I wasn't feeling Jake as Prince Dastan but still he managed to pull a good performance though he didn't actually looked like a persian. Now, judging the female character Tamina, played by Gemma Arterton, I didn't liked her accent but she was beautiful, hot I don't care you name it...<br/><br/>As far as the way the movie was delivered and edited, the guys from the department of art direction managed to make a very good job, the movie was edited pretty well as the video part concerns me but the sound editing kinda lacked in essence. The soundtrack made entirely by Harry Gregson-Williams was actually very good; I enjoyed all the violins used and drums or tribal drums etc. The thing I'm having a biased view is the visual effects. The cinematography was pretty good except the part were the sand sap or slide in the temple where the captions of the action were kind of lame and the visual effects there were this second good and nice to watch and the next second you saw the CGI behind it... it was not that realistic and it kinda ruined that last part for me.<br/><br/>At the end the movie is entertaining, it's not awful like some people say (which they are not too many) and it's a fun ride in the theater. Now I guess there will be a second movie of Prince of Persia and what I hope is that it will be much more entertaining than this one."

","As a fictional story it is a good movie at all.
you may ask why fictional story?!
because it's full of historical mistakes for someone like me who knows history a little bit!!
Persia: Persia is the first and the greatest empire of the human history. they were so ethical and the history has not seen an empire with that much good thoughts and believes. Cyrus the great has made the first human right in history and even the first animal right 7000 years ago! Soldiers of Persia didn't insult people and their gods when they capture a city. Cyrus the great has make Jews free in Egypt. Persia was the canon of science and mankind is owe to Persia for being this much scientific. Kings were kind to people and people loved their kings for being kind. there was forbidden in Persia to have slave 7000 years ago. You can find many things about this amazing empire of you read the real history of Persia.
Allamute: Allamute is in middle of Persia and todays Iran. i wonder why Persian empire has marched to Allamute which is a city of their empire! today you can go from Persian empire city (shiraz) to Allamute in 3 hours by a car!! how the writers didn't know it and made the story like Allamute was a country far away Persia while it was and it still is in middle of Iran!!
Sands: the capital of Persia was Shiraz which you can still see the remains of that empire. Iran has every climate in it! you see only jungle at the north of Iran while there is Loot desert at the east of Iran which it is the hottest place in the world. Shiraz, the capital of the Persia is not in the jungle but it is not desert either! this movie shows Iran fully desert like Saudi Arabia but Shiraz is well known for its gardens and flowers!! i don't know why in holleywood movies they show Iran a desert of sands while most of the cities of Iran are green and beautiful! Arab countries are desert not Iran please don't show Iran an Arab country!
Hashashins: they even miss pronounced Hashashins into Hassansins!! I'm not sure if the writers know anything about Iran at all!
Hashish in old Persian means herb and they have called herbal doctors Hashash in old Persian because they were cure using herbal drugs and IN makes it plural. Hashashins used to farm herbal drugs so they were called Hashashins but Hashashin mis translated someone who eats Hashish in English!
Hashashins were a group of people lived in Allamute and they used to assassinate ( assassin derived from Persian Hashashin into English) a particular persons for a reasonable manner.
Hassan Sabah was the leader of Hashashins and only he could give the order for assassination.
Assassins were forbidden to kill citizens or innocent people while they were so scary which all kings of all countries were afraid of them.
and what was the reasons of assassinations?
for example when there was a war, they assassinate the generals and leaders so the war would be ended and no soldier would be killed or cities destroyed. or they assassinated cruel kings which oppress the people.
and what you see in this movie? Hashashin are hired by every man giving them money to kill every person they say!! compare this hassanssins thing to what Hashashins were and what they have done and gave their lives by the orders of only Hassan Sabah for no money...
the writers really know nothing of Iran!! the time and the place of the story of this movie is funny and don't match to each other.
<ul><li>Persia was the empire of Iran 7000 years ago before Islam comes to Iran. Nizam (or Nezam) the brother of the king has an Arabic name! people of Iran and the kings only chose Persian names for their children. Nezam is an Arabic name and its impossible for queen of Persia to choose this name for her child while there was forbidden to choose a non-persian name for children. Also arabs were so primary and savage to has impression to the greatest empire and kings of history for choosing an Arabic name! Persia was a modern empire and Arabs were savages.</li><li>As i said in Part 1, Allamute was and still is a city of Iran and why Persian empire marched there?!</li><li>Hashashins were created by Hassan Sabah about at least 2000 years after Persia empire!! Hassan Sabah named Hassan (Arabic name) so he was born at least 600 years after Islam came to Iran and Persia empire was before Islam came to Iran so how Hashashins helped Nizam 2000 years before they were be created?!</li></ul>Also Allamute was the city of Hashashins and Hassan Sabah and his assassins were living and rule the Allamute in the Allamute castle (Allamute castle remains is still in Allamute, Qazvin, Iran) so who is that queen and why are not Hashashins in Allamute and Allamute castle which was their land and their castle and their refuge?
Hashashins are not in Allamute in this movie. instead of Hashashins and Hassan Sabah, a woman is the queen there and Hashashins are hidden somewhere not in Allamute (their real place) 2000 years before their existence!!"

","I guess ultimately it is what it is, a Disney backed video game adaptation of the blockbuster kind.<br/><br/>In truth it works just fine and dandy as a family fantasy adventure, with swords and sandals - shields and sarongs, all in abundance. There's the mythical and the magical, the swish and the swash, the HD photography a treat for the eyes. The leads are pretty, likable and energetic, and even though it consistently reminds us that it is based on a video game (jumping and rolling, jumping and rolling), the choreography is niftily arranged and there's a lovely old fashioned feel to the story; which works in that wonderful Sinbadish way.<br/><br/>Not perfect by any stretch of the imagination, and if one was so inclined? One could deconstruct the faults of the production with the same clinical impact of that achieved by Ben Kingsley's (Sir) wallet when it hit the floor after this paycheck was deposited. It should be viewed in the spirit of how Alfred Molina plays his character, with tongue in cheek and a complete understanding of how to have a good time with popcorn fluff.

The story is interesting and doesn't go too deep, so you can watch it with no background information.<br/><br/>Only flaw is some things that just don't fit in the timeline, like when somebody says Thursdays or something about god. But it is fantasy and they can turn back the time, so you shouldn't focus on little things like that.<br/><br/>I was surprised, because i didn't think, a video game adaption could be really good. But i stand corrected. This makes me really expecting Assassin's Creed.<br/><br/>I would give it 9/10 . It is really not the movie of the century or a juwel in the industry. But it was a lot of fun to watch. And i really liked it. You should definitely go and watch it."

","The movie is based on the action-adventure video game published under same name by Ubisoft. This is one of the best works from Mike Nowell after Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. The story hovers around the historical empire of Persia and the holy city of Almut. It goes like this- Sultan(King of Persia) had two sons but while he was on a walk on the streets of Persia he sees something brave in a young child named Dastan that he adopts him. Sultan ruled his kingdom with pride and honor and there was a rule of law. But everyone in the kingdom was not happy with him. Since he had grown older his eldest son, Tus wanted to succeed him . But there was someone else who also wanted to become the king and so the conspiracy starts.<br/><br/>There exists a group of corrupted Persian warriors called Hassansins whose ways of fighting add another edge to the movie. Jake Gyllenhaal as Dastan is outstanding. His looks have been purposefully kept similar to that of prince in the games to keep you attached to the character. Ben Kingley as Nizam, and Gemma Arterton as Princess Tamina have both done justice to their respective roles. The chemistry between Tamina and Dastan also makes the movie interesting and worth a watch. It starts with a note ""some lives are linked across the time"" so let's find, is that really true, at least in the movies.<br/><br/>Overall the story goes fast and keeps one thinking and involved. The movie succeeds to put a lot of thrill and suspense before the viewers. Unfortunately, it has been underrated. But believe me, it's a good movie to watch so i would suggest you to have a look once, you won't regret."

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is based on a video game, but this is more than a video game homage. In the previous movie I reviewed Jake Gyllenhaal played a political cartoonist turned amateur detective. In this movie he plays a prince who is capable of incredible gymnastic feats.<br/><br/>The movie begins by talking about the Kingdom of Persia. Persia was an empire that existed long ago. Many of the stories about Persia are a part of myths and legend... this included. But of course the creator of the video games and the writer for this movie did a pretty good job researching Persia in order to create a realistic looking story.<br/><br/>Prince Dastan (Gyllenhaal) is an orphan and street urchin as a child. As a young boy he saves a friend from being beaten by a guard for stealing an apple. The way he does this is performing his incredible gymnastic flips and jumps. The king of Persia, King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup), witnesses this act of courage by Dastan. After hearing the Dastan doesn't have parents, Sharaman adopts Dastan as his son and raises him as his own to be brother to his biological sons.<br/><br/>Years later, Prince Tus (Richard Coyle), Prince Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Prince Dastan along with their uncle, Nizam (Ben Kingsley) and their army attack Alamut. A spy reported that Alamut was supplying weapons for the enemies of Persia. Dastan does what he does best and allows the Persian army to enter Alamut and conquered it. In Alamut, Dastan discovers not only his destiny but the truth. He also discovers Temina (Gemma Arterton), Princess of Alamut.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is not only a fantasy story, it is also a love story. For in this movie Dastan and Temina fall in love as the story continues. However, in the end Dastan is the only one who remembers.<br/><br/>There are many scenes I like about this movie. I like Dastan's gymnastic abilities. I love the fact that Gemma Arterton was cast to play Temina; she is very beautiful woman.<br/><br/>This movie gets 9 stars out of 10 from me."

","After a while I realized that rating do not matter at all - this movie is underrated. Greatest role is marketing and placing the film on the market (and advertising), after which people no longer think for themselves. Funny, but it really is true. Today we have a lot of bad movies that are highly rated (example: Man of steel, Skyfall, Pirates of Caribbean - even my kid gaper while watching pirates ... Iron man etc.). Well, this film is better (and underrated).<br/><br/>I will not compare this movie with the video game, but only as movie, regardless of video games. Prince of Persia is fantastic movie with great story. It was fun, had a lot of action, acting was nice, great CGI and suitable for all age groups. <br/><br/>Those people who rated this movie low are mainly fans of video game. They will probably give a better rating to a movie like Skyfall only because it is covered by better marketing and more advertised. I think it is about time that people start to use their head, instead of the media bomb.<br/><br/>After all, I recommend this movie. Watch it, will give you a great entertainment."

","I saw Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time shortly after it came out on DVD. Since I come from a large family, we rarely see films in theatres anymore. However, I wish I could go back in time simply to see this one in a theatre. Prince of Persia is one of the better movies I have seen before, and that is saying a lot, considering I've seen hundreds of films. The acting by Jake Gyllenhal and Gemma Arteton was absolutely superb. They both played their parts exceedingly well, along with the rest of the cast. Personally, I enjoyed the film's lack of profanities or obscurities in it. Thanks probably goes to Disney for that one. This film is one of the best I've seen that lacked the vulgarity so many good films nowadays seem to include. The action was more than enough to keep the boys in the family on their toes, and the budding romance between Dastan and Tamina made my mom and me smile. Honestly I'm surprised it only has a 6.6 rating. It deserves at least an 8 or 9. With its twists and unexpected turns, this is definitely a film anyone could enjoy."

Is it Disney's fault that it wasn't any monsters in it. I have no idea.

","The Prince Of Persia The Sands Of Time, is, in our opinion, one of the best 'Game to Film' projects we've seen in a long time. The storyline is in time with the plot, sub-plots and twists, while the acting is of quality and execution of lines. A great adventure film for the family, especially those who have played the game as well as wanting to see the movie, too.<br/><br/>From the off-set, the growing up of Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), the movie opens up straight away with action and the introductory of the cast players. It is when Dastan grows up into a man, that the story really begins to unfold and unleash the scenes that people and fans have been waiting for. There is a touch of everything in The Prince Of Persia The Sands Of Time, with swashbuckling fights, acrobatics, humour and good versus evil.<br/><br/>As a critic, I for one liked this film, but there were places and times in which I believed that the film may have been done by Gerry Anderson, rather than a serious Director. Jake Gyllenhaal, who plays Daston, in certain scenes became a little dull, detached from the part he was playing and somehow over shadowed by the rest of the A-List actors that carried his acting on one or two occasions. Altogether, the film made the ratings and has come off unscathed by the many 'Game to Film' projects in the past. DVD Archive Rating: 7/10"
"Polonius85","6","0","0","23 January 2012"," FINALLY, a good video game-based movie!
","Okay, so this movie wasn't as successful as it was hoping to be, and it wasn't the absolute greatest acted or written movie...but for once, I'm judging this by mainstream, A-movie standards rather than the usual B-movie nonsense that comes with movie adaptions of video games. PoP: SoT has truly broken the mold of 20+ years of attempted video game movies that produced class-A failures like Mario Brothers, Alone in the Dark, Blood Rayne, and the Resident Evil series. Even as a big fan of the Sands of Time game series who was disappointed that the story and characters from the game were scrapped completely, I enjoyed the film. It was fun, there were good sword fights, good special effects, and it kept my attention. The storyline of the movie is more of a mash up of all the Prince of Persia games, not just the Sands of Time series. I get the impression that the writer of the movie and the games, Jordan Mechner, was always disappointed that his first PoP series was not as successful as it could have been and by combining that story with the more successful Sands of Time series, he created this movie (though this is a bit of speculation on my part). Usually doing things like that become trying to fit a square peg in a round hole, but Mechner did it pretty nicely.<br/><br/>Okay, the cons of this movie. First, Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton, had very little chemistry. It was painful and awkward to watch, and did not have the playful flirtation, nor the character development, found in their counterparts in the game, The Prince and Princess Farah. Alfred Molina's quasi-libertarian character as well as the thinly veiled anti-Iraq War message (going to war under false pretenses to seize weapons that don't exist) inserted politics in a movie that did not call for it. Political messages in movies have been done to death. Also, while a straight adaption of the Sands of Time game would essentially have produced a zombie movie set in Persia, there was very little attention paid to the actual Sands of Time and the dagger, and the movie is basically following the dagger as it changes hands over and over while the Prince is being chased based on wrongful accusation of murdering his father...it sort of feels like a mix of The Fugitive and What's Up Doc? but with swords and sandals. The writers of the movie could have found a middle ground.<br/><br/>Finally, as I said, I was disappointed to find out that the Sands of Time movie would NOT be following the Prince and Farah through the Palace of Azad as they tried to return the sands to the hourglass, all the while, slowly falling in the love. As I said before, a straight adaption would have resulted in another zombie movie, but rather than strip the story to its basic structure and pillars (that is, leaving the characters, setting, and basic story), the movie strips the story down all the way to its concept (a prince, a princess, and a dagger) and building from there. I don't think this was necessary as the game offered a lot more to work with in making a movie than what was used. I'm hoping perhaps in the future, another Prince of Persia movie will be made that sticks closer to the Sands of Time game's story (perhaps with THAT prince being the great-grandson of Dastan or something). But that's a pipe dream.<br/><br/>All in all though, I do recommend this movie. It's a good party movie, and it's one you can watch with most kids over age 10."

"Mike_Devine","2","3","8","1 September 2017"," ""Ridiculous"" doesn't even begin to describe this
","Video game-based films have mostly suffered at the box office, with only a few bright spots - namely the 'Lara Croft: Tomb Raider' series (and a lot of that was due to the ""Jolie Effect""). 2010 brought us Disney's attempt in 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time,' which was directed by Mike Newell and produced by none other than Jerry Bruckheimer.<br/><br/>The $200M big-budget action blockbuster was a blistering blunder at the box office, which explains why there was never a follow-up effort. At one point, Disney was hopeful that 'Persia' could follow in the footsteps of successful franchises like 'Pirates of the Caribbean' or 'National Treasure.' So what went wrong? For one, while Jake Gyllenhaal is generally a good actor, he didn't fit the part of Prince Dastan, the protagonist who stumbles upon a magic dagger that can turn back time, as well as a feisty princess (Gemma Arterton) who becomes quite a handful for him, given the rest of the situation he's in. Gyllenhaal is as wooden as a park bench and has an accent that is pretty much indistinguishable.<br/><br/>In a nutshell, 'Persia' is a total mess. It's not entertaining, feels unintentionally comical at points and is just ridiculously campy. Whether it's the fighting scenes that look like a 12-year-old designed them, complete with slow-mo and over-the-top sound effects, or characters who add little-to-no value, there's plenty of that to go around here. Even talented actors like Sir Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina have their talents wasted in this film. The only good thing about 'Persia' is it's not too long, at just under two hours.<br/><br/>No doubt, 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Times' was a big gamble taken by the Mouse House, and like most video game adaptations, it crumbled under its own weight."
"navneet13","1","3","8","31 December 2010"," Bad story
","When I played the game I thought it would be a nice story for a great movie and a new concept but the director screwed up all with a silly and crappy story. The story of sand creation in movie is such a silly idea that I am not able to digest. They should have taken most of the story from the video game itself. The story should have many twists and turns so as to reveal the power of sands of time. I personally think the story should goes like that – The Vizier (from a different kingdom) visits the King Sherman's court and advises him to attack his kingdom (Vizier's kingdom) by narrating him tales of richness and wealth and by offering never seen before diamond, jewelry etc to the King. The King Sherman then orders the attack and with the help of Vizier, he is able to win the Kingdom. The King was killed and the Princess is taken as prisoner. Prince finds the hour glass filled with sand; King Sherman then asks Vizier about the hour glass and why it is kept in secret. The Vizier tells the story that the hour glass contains the magical sand which can grant unimaginable power to the one who opens it but it can only be opened by a dagger hidden in a separate fortress guarded by the elite forces and died King's loyal army. The Prince promises to bring the dagger as the army is tired after long and devastating battle. The King Sherman then asks the Vizier, if the sand is so powerful then why the dead king didn't claim the power for himself and why he kept sand and dagger hidden in such high security. The Vizier tells that the dead king travelled to a forgotten island with a huge army but returned alone with the sand and the dagger. Since then he is afraid of using its power. The dead king gave him some books which he got from the island to decipher it and he got to know about the secret of the sand from those books. King Sherman ordered the Prince to fetch the dagger for him. When he returned the Vizier takes control of the situation and ask prince to hand over the dagger to him in return for the life of his father. The Vizier has grand plans to claim the power of sand and princess for him. The Princess then reveals to prince that the Vizier must not use the dagger. The prince then plunges it into the hour glass. This results in reverting the time to several years to a point when Prince was not born, without affecting the ages of Prince, Vizier and the Princess. King Sherman now young didn't recognize his son and order to arrest him and princess for the crime plotting to kill him. Actually reverting the time results in Vizier inviting the King Sherman to attack the fortress that contains the dagger first as Vizier changed his strategy of attach this time. The Prince and Princess became friend in Jail. The princess tells that they can go to his father fortress and then reveal the plans of evil Vizier and prevent all this from happening. The Prince like the idea and plans to escape. The Prince and Princess escaped from the prison and while escaping the Prince got the opportunity to steal the dagger once again. While stealing the dagger, he is intercepted by his father. While protecting princess and in order to escape the Prince killed his father. The Prince and Princess now head Princess's father's fortress so that they can reveal the plan of Vizier. Killing his father results in Prince dying a slow death and his body turning into sand. The Prince must hurry as he has very limited time left and will convert into a sand wraith soon. Taking advantage of King Sherman's death the Vizier sends his assassins to kill Prince and Princess and took the dead body of King Sherman in front of Princess's fathers to prove his loyalty once again. He tells that he has killed the invading King and now the King must muster his army to displace the invading army. The Princess's father asks Vizier why he grew so old, the Vizier said that he learned about the attack and went to protect the fortress and was able to kill the invading King with the help of dagger and this turns him old but now his son posses the dagger and planning to launch an attack on this fortress, so the King must hurry and send all his army to attack the invading army. Meanwhile the assassins killed the Princess and badly injured the Prince. The prince must now use the dagger to kill the assassins and save his life. He fills the dagger with the sand falling from his body, reverts the time and kills all the assassins. He is not able to bring the Princess alive because the dagger can only revert the time for a limited moment as it contains limited amount of sand. The Prince reached the Princess fathers' fortress and revealed the Vizier's evil plot. But to his surprise it was the Vizier in the King's garments. The Vizier actually killed the king and claimed his Thorn. Taking advantage of shock the Prince is in, the Vizier stab the Prince with his knife and tells him that he killed countless people to claim the sand's power and now he turns the time to favor his destiny and today he finally going to taste the sand's power and no one can stop him now. The prince laughed, he took the sand falling from his body, fills the dagger, reverts the time before he was killed and plunges the dagger in the hour glass resulting in releasing the sand and forwarding the time to a point when Vizier had come to King Sherman's court to invite him."

","""Prince of Persia, The Sands of Time"" was probably one of the movies which turned my disappointment other way around. To be honest when I entered the cinema I was expecting crappy story and not a lot of action. Those expectations were destroyed when the movie started to with back story to prince and then a battle scene. The battle scene was made in really awesome way and I was left pleased. Through out the whole story it was just ups and downs, they didn't leave the watcher waiting for action or any other events for long, since the action scene just kept on coming on and on. The ending was pretty interesting and it wasn't another misleading and disappointing story. This was a review for guys and girls in between the ages of 18-infinity. For young girls who are in love with twilight I have to say that apparently the prince, Jake Gyllenhaal, was. hot? I don't know that's what I hear from people and girls saying, ""OMGEEEEZZZ THE PRINCE WAS SOO LIKE HOTT."" There was some love going on and bla bla bla.<br/><br/>The negative part is probably that there was too much of action, I thought I would never say that.

I really enjoyed ""Prince of Persia"" because I had just finished reading a pretty neat fantasy book called ""Timbuktu Chronicles: Aida and the Chosen Soldier"" which just like ""Prince of Persia"" was set in an exotic unusual place. The book was set in the Mali Empire in the 14th century and I hope a movie may someday be made from it. ""Prince of Persia"" had a perfect and flawless ending and one cannot ask for anything better. This is a must see for fantasy lovers, and for fantasy readers, I recommend ""Timbuktu Chronicles: Aida and the Chosen soldier."""
"DICK STEEL","6","5","19","24 May 2010"," A Nutshell Review: Hallelujah!
","Unfortunately I do not have an iota of experience with the Prince of Persia games, given that they were all the rage some 20 odd years ago when I was still in school, being the oddity that used the Apple IIe computer before Apple became sexy, amongst a group of geeks swapping their latest adventures as the titular character on some computer based adventure. I'm sure Prince of Persia by now has a seizable fan base to warrant a large scaled action adventure slated as a summer blockbuster, but if only had Mike Newell's execution made it less meandering than a medieval Indiana Jones.<br/><br/>With three scribes working on Jordan Mechner's story from the game, the film suffered from the lack of coherence as it strung together premise after premise of mindless mumbo jumbo to pass off as mythology involving time travel with a dagger as the DeLorean and some precious sand as the fuel for its flux capacitor. And I wonder just who is responsible for the plenty of plot loopholes and conveniences found littered throughout the film, that you'll roll your eyes no sooner at the next cliché that managed to find its way on screen. Clichés so bad, you'll want to reach out and utilize the dagger of time yourself to escape from a horrible story.<br/><br/>Take for instance, the usual bad guy monologue, and the trust to an unidentified, faceless minion to finish off the hero, which led to an embarrassingly bad take (ran out of film?) on how an interrupt occurred to save our Prince. Or how by keeping mum instead of trying to kick our hero's rear in front of an adoring army just didn't make much sense other than to provide for a means to a more conclusive finale. And what about the inexplicable ego boosting of needing to have a precious artifact put in a display case for all and sundry to see and admire, with an ""alarm system"" of only 1 dagger throwing minion, again a faceless and glorious extra?<br/><br/>There are many of such strange set ups that you wonder if they should just junk the story, and show action after action. After all, with computer wizardry employed in full glory to bring about plenty of sand buffering around, and that tinge of thick orange that drenched the film, nothing seems to be impossible as our hero had to overcome jealous brotherly rivals, betrayal, a feisty princess (played by Gemma Arterton whose star is slowly but surely rising), with a mouth that just wouldn't stop spewing sarcasm (with lips always so seductively pursed that one wondered why it took so long for the Persian Prince to plant a big fat wet kiss to shut her up), and go up against enemies like the precursors of Assassins, soldiers, and ostriches even. Yes, I kid you not, as Alfred Molina's Sheik Amar runs an underground betting ring with expertise on ostrich races, and provides some laughter as an anti- government critic if you translate his lines into a modern day context.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal put on plenty of muscle to be that swashbuckling hero so sorely missed by Hollywood standards, and going by the skills of his character Dastan, one may mistake him for being Prince of Parkour as well, with his various leaps and jumps overcoming various terrain and enemies constantly. Gyllenhaal may just cement his reputation as a summer film marquee star with enough chops to take on action, and does a pretty decent job as the hero with street smarts and a devil may care attitude. As mentioned, Gemma Arterton's star is growing, and finds herself comfortable in period roles, though she has not much to do here other than to banter with Gyllenhaal, and be that obligatory love interest in the sea of men.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia may be Jerry Bruckheimer's hope of a franchise to be spawned, emulating the success of The Pirates of the Caribbean, but frankly requires a lot more stars and a solid story to begin with. Then again, hey it's a summer popcorn movie, so cut it some slack you may add. Sure, if you park your brains at the door and approach this with low expectations, you may just enjoy the roller coaster ride from start to finish, but it's no crime to ask for a little bit more."

"conthesleepy1","Null","2","5","19 August 2010"," Gemma Arterton
",".... Ruined it<br/><br/>I'm sick to the back of my teeth of cr@p English actresses... it started not so recently with the massively overrated Keira Knightley from Pirates of the Caribbean, it went on and on, to loads of other useless semi-talented, mediocre, skinny English speaking actresses... and Gemma Arterton is no exception. Basically she is out of her league... not from lack of trying though... I can't complain about that... she does try... <br/><br/>... but you gotta wonder who picked her. The fault lies with them. I'm sure she's a nice polite girl who is lovely.. and I'm sure everyone has nice thing to say about her but that does not make her great. The fact is... is she's watchable... but not great.. such a shame... basically she's boring (I don't care what she looks like)... Imagine the the film with an 'unknown' and you'll see what i mean. There are better more interesting actresses out there...<br/><br/>I have to say the rest of the cast worked well.. however, I have a feeling no matter how hard Gemma Arterton will ever try in her career as an actress she will always be either okay or watchable.. never great.. or brilliant. <br/><br/>My advice is avoid her in all future films... unfair? I don't think so.<br/><br/>Do you?"
"echozdog","9","2","5","23 July 2010"," A lot of people missed out on a great flick.
","The trailer for this movie had me thinking ""Lot's of CGI & no story"" but the reverse is true. The CGI is there but not intrusive and I really liked the story. I know I like a movie when I care about the characters. I liked the brothers, I liked the female lead, I liked the dad. Jake G (too lazy to spell it) was way better as an action hero than I would have expected. He plays the orphan prince who has no throne aspirations down to a tee. The movie begins and end with his performance and he pulled it off swimmingly. The chemistry between Jake and female lead was well played and believable. The love between the brothers was critical to the story and I liked it. I took my two boys (11 and 8) and they loved it. I had to explain some the time travel stuff, but otherwise they followed along just fine.<br/><br/>I didn't go see this when it first came out because the trailer made it look like a poor mans cross between ""The Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"". This was better than the ""The Mummy"" (which I liked). It's no ""Raiders of the lost ark"", but it was worth the $2.50 I paid at the door.<br/><br/>I hope it made money and there is a sequel with the main actors all reprising. I'd take my boys when it's $7.50 (although I'm sure I'd be disappointed...rarely do sequels measure up).<br/><br/>9/10"
"denisvn93-1","8","2","5","10 July 2010"," Basically not another one of those mishandled video game adaptations
","Based on the popular game series by Jordan Mechner, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is the latest member to be adapted by Hollywood. Yes, yes, ""I told you so"" or ""God not again"" are right outside the door, but be assured that this is more or less the finest video game adaptation to be shown on a silver screen.<br/><br/>ACTING: I really don't get the deal with people criticizing, whining, moaning and going all emo about Jake Gyllenhaal's casting as the titular character (aren't we supposed to do these after we have seen the movie?). He appears on-screen with his characteristics, like being tough, mischievous and hurt, instead of letting his looks do the acting. As a result, we have a hero that is extremely likable, energetic and charismatic. With royal beauty and tough attitude, Gemma Arterton is a unique romantic interest as she doesn't appear weak, doesn't like to tag along with the male lead and has an extremely memorable moment. Yet, besides all that rare elements, this is just another posh role for her to be feisty and commanding. The best player however, is Alfred Molina's Sheik Amar. How he acts clearly spells every syllable of ""I enjoy my role"", one that you have to see to judge for yourself. He's a comic relief, which can be hammy at any moment, but with all that liveliness his welcome is never outstayed. <br/><br/>The villain essence in this film is timid, so Ben Kingsley and the Hassansin Leader are not menacing enough when they are very capable (hey Disney, think Barbossa!). The better supporting character out of the bunch though is Steve Touissant, a definite scene-stealer at first sight yet with so limited time for us to wholeheartedly care (the same goes for the brothers of the Prince). However, since all of them perform their roles very solid within their parameters, it makes up for the lack of audience involvement. <br/><br/>SCRIPT: This writing duo rewrote the ""Tale of Two Sisters"" remake very well and I'm glad Disney brought them in for adapting this. True, there is all the clichés and cheese to be expected like many epics or story lines about royal life, but it offers entertainment at its best effort. The writing is flexible enough for newcomers to absorb but apparently not that memorable or condensed (they take elements from 6 games) as many reviewers have stated. Oh, and there is this overuse of the word ""sacred"" that can cringe the strongest-minded of movie goers. This is a different entity to the game, but if you have this idea equipped before going in, you're in for an exhilarating time at the movies.<br/><br/>DIRECTION: Mike Newell's last attempt on the fantasy genre, Harry Potter 4, is not that much appreciated, being too drawn out like a drama more than what it is supposed to be. He redeems himself with PoP though. The action is great and the drama moments transfer their much needed information at an acceptable length, resulting in the audience always getting attached to the movie. He honors the characters, the scenery and plot over the special effects, letting the more desirable elements to grace the screen and wow the audience. This is the quality here and it gives the film more substance than the rest of its video game adaptation relatives. On the contrary, how he films the parkour/action sequences is Newell's downside. He opts for the frenetic editing instead of smoothing them out like Casino Royale or even closer to home, the Harry Potter episode that he helms. So, even though the characterization and the visual are spot- on, there is huge disappointment as action is the key aspect of PoP and it is, once again, going down the despicable recent Hollywood ""trend"". <br/><br/>MUSIC: Harry Gregson Williams does not disappoint. The score for PoP is amazing, for the lack of a better word. It is very fable-like in general, convincingly displays everything that is mystical and alluring about the nation Persia. When needed, the music leaps to a crescendo effortlessly and relentlessly or slides down into mystery and haunting territory when the Dagger is activated. The Hassansins have very jazzy brasses/techno strings to shout out on their arrival, Tamina has fast- paced and strong beats to introduce her, Sheik Amar appears with gleeful tunes to accompany him with the original ostrich racing etc. The music varies and fits to whatever it is on screen like pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, making it a definite treat for the ears.<br/><br/>CINEMATOGRAPHY: John Seale displays the desert scenery at the highest possible level of spectacular-ness and because they are always either packed with people or standout structures everything is very much alive. The man's work is consistently stylish even if the material he has to work with is limited in scope (see Poseidon). Sadly though, all that skill is almost marred by the editing with frenzy cutting and shoddy slo-mo work. In the end, only sequences involving the Dagger or when there is no action e.g. Tamina disguises as a servant in Avrat are evidence of this guy is at his best. <br/><br/>VISUAL EFFECTS: The most welcoming thing is that none (or few) are used in the stunts, so here your heart pounds for real. When called for, the effects are convincing - from the weirdly demonic snakes to the whole sequence in the secret chamber. It wouldn't hurt to hope that Hollywood can realize parkour as an example to prove that action can be done without CGI and not an exploitable ingredient so that all action from here onwards is parkour only.<br/><br/>Even though the reception and attention are at low levels, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is basically not another one of those mishandled video game adaptations. While there are flaws, but by any chance you have to see it. Instantly.<br/><br/>From Vietnam, Denisvn93-1"

","Went to see this movie in theaters today, and it is so amazing, its similar to Aladdin and Sinbad. This has became a great adventure-fantasy film in the Hollywood Motion Pictures made by Walt Disney Pictures. Jake Gyllenhaal did a great job playing the Prince of Persia and he is a great warrior like other Disney movies like Captain Jack Sparrow of PIRATES OF THE Caribbean films, CHRONICLES OF NARNIA films, and the new heroic movies of this year are coming out in theaters are SORCERCOUS' APPRENTICE and TRON: THE LEGACY.

","I'll make this real quick and short. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time seems to be just like other video game flick movies. But I've got to say this movie is much better than other video game flick movies.<br/><br/>The actors and actress are pretty good, especially Gyllenhaal(I think I saw him in 'The Day After Tomorrow' totally different) the intensity was kept up throughout the film and the action was excellent. great jumping sliding and running scenes, keeps the taste of Prince of Persia video game. **but there's one scene that reminds me of Assassins's Creed(video game) the scene that Dastan stands on that wooden thing and jump... never mind ***<br/><br/>the plot was so much better than Clash of the Titans. For COT, the story kept going just like the characters move up from one stage to another which you know what will happen for sure. But this, Price of Persia, it was a little bit of unpredictable, especially the feud between the brothers.(it was like ""awww.. why? he's your brother!"", you gotta see it.)<br/><br/>-one thing I want to say is, the concept of the dagger was interesting and I thought they are going to use it priceless throughout the film. But each time they use the sand in the dagger, it was superb, like 'wow'-<br/><br/>I thought it's gonna be terrible but no, its great<br/><br/>overall I think Price of Persia was much better than I expected.I thought it's gonna be terrible. But the excitement kept me on the seat throughout the scene, the dialog was not dry like other video game flick movies, and the action was not boring, overused.<br/><br/>8/10"
"cadillac20","7","2","5","7 June 2010"," A good Summer popcorn flick
","Prince of Persia has been one of the summer films I've been looking forward to since its first trailer impressed me. At the same time, I didn't expect much. After going through so many summer seasons with crappy blockbusters and over hyped garbage, I was kind of relieved to see a film that knew exactly what it was and didn't aim to be anything more. And it certainly turned out the way I expected: a fun popcorn flick that doesn't take itself too seriously. <br/><br/>What truly shines here is the action, fairly obviously I think. The story is decent, though nothing to be impressed with, and most of it contains fairly serviceable production values. It helps that the acting is of fairly high caliber. Jake is fun to watch as the Prince. He plays up the action and one liners well and proves his value as a potential action adventure star if given the right material. Gemma is serviceable and looks great doing it. Alfred Molina and Ben Kingsley are also great as supporting cast members, though their talents are definitely underplayed here, something that seems to be a continual pattern for Kingsley these days.<br/><br/>Persia is also an interesting choice of environment. It lends some personality to the film. Although it's mostly historically inaccurate, a fantasized version of the real Persia, it's still an interesting environment for the adventure. Much like the Caribbeans added to Pirates adventure story, Persia adds that much more to this film. <br/><br/>But, as I said, the action here is the real star and that's not too surprising. If you expect another Pirates, you'll be sorely mislead, but the film is definitely a lot of fun. The action is almost non stop and it's almost always big. The film recalls times when we didn't expect so much more from our films other than they be entertaining, and I enjoyed that aspect of Prince of Persia. It's a fun, old fashioned, swashbuckling adventure. For a popcorn flick, I couldn't ask for much more."

","If it's from Jerry Bruckheimer then we know it's good. However, I had some doubts when I knew that the lead role was played by Jake Gyllenhaal. I've seen his movies before and I thought he lacked energy and charisma. But when I went to see this movie with a friend, I thought I had to give him the benefit of the doubt. I was actually surprised to see his comic side, his fighting skills (which were graceful, by the way) and, for the first time, I noticed that he was a versatile actor. The cinematography was fantastic, the plot was not-so-original but still refreshing and the fight scenes, although not the usual CGI stuff, were entertaining and believable. Overall, the movie delivered!"

"mariianaa94","9","2","5","5 June 2010"," Not a fan of the game...
","...but I really liked this!<br/><br/>Now, let me please state that i am no expert movie critic nor am i familiar with the video game storyline (at all) and i am just stating my opinion. (used the word state two times in a sentence... hideous)<br/><br/>First of all i think Disney made a good job this time. Not perfect, nor near, but still really good. The story was very good, actually. When I saw it was based on a video game I did not know what to expect. I mean, Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer had done a good job in PotC, and it was based on an attraction at an amusement park. But video games have very complex story lines so i kind of expected it to be hard to follow. Not at all, it went fluently and it kept me entertained, yet i understood.<br/><br/>The character were very charismatic and i fell in love with them. With every one of them, I was almost in tears (yeah,...) when Seso gets injured and he had a very small role. Gyllenhaal and Arterton did a really good job, they had a lot of chemistry. You could feel the tension and (dear Disney: dare I say it?) sexual attraction between those two in every scene they had together. Ben Kingsley was also a blast to watch.<br/><br/>One thing I have to praise before going on is the CGI. It was very good and most of the scenes (because it did have a couple of moments where you roll your eyes and go ""Really? Please..."") were pretty believable. A con, though, is that it was very historically inaccurate (spelled wrong?). Persians were very advanced people, but it was still one of the first civilizations and in this movie they seem super advanced.<br/><br/>A thing I really liked about this movie is that the ending i did NOT expect! The outcome was what I expected it to be, partially, but the way to the end was very fun to watch. Specially because the movie makes you think it is going one way and then... not. Really fun.<br/><br/>The dialogue was so so. Not horrid, but very cheesy in some parts. Though I forgive them for that. The thing i liked though, kill me about this, was the humor. It actually had plenty of comic lines and I loved it had some very mature humor kids wouldn't understand. Nice.<br/><br/>In short, good movie in my opinion but if you really want to know what it is like, you have to go watch it since nobody's opinion is better than your own. I definitely recommend it, and will watch a sequel (if there is one, which i hope). It is active, it was funny, it was fun, it was a treat for the eyes (The CGI, the sets, Jake Gyllenhaal's looks don't hurt either, and Gemma Arterton is terribly beautiful.) 8/10. (Please excuse my horrid spelling and grammar, not a native English speaker.)"
"wafeys","8","2","5","5 June 2010"," Fantasy flick- worth a pick!
","After watching The clash of The Titans a couple of months back, and being very disappointed with a film that was predictably high on cgi, but totally lacked the magical feeling that the first one had (and that should be felt when watching films of this genre), I was sceptical but remained optimistic when I heard this character from fantasy folklore was making his debut on the big screen. I'm not an avid follower of the computer game, only loosely knowing the story so went into the cinema with an open mind and can say that 'Prince of Persia' is quite a good movie.<br/><br/>It has elements of the old Indiana Jones films in the love/hate cheeky banter between the leading actor/actress (Jake Gylenhall/Gemma Arterton), the search for treasure, which becomes more complicated when the co-stars bump into dodgy characters along the way and find themselves in compromising situations and the middle eastern settings of the film.<br/><br/>Gylenhall has never struck me as the typical action man and is a long way away from the nerdy kid in Donnie Darko, but he has bulked up a bit and does a good job as the adopted young prince (Dastan). While a credible cast including Ben Kingsley (Gandhi) as the unassuming Kings brother (Nizam), Alfred Molina (Dr Octopus- Spiderman 2) as Sheikh Amar, a wheeling-dealing, eccentric entrepreneur and other familiar actors put in a decent performance to make their characters believable enough to enjoy the movie for the fantasy adventure flick that it is.<br/><br/>Don't expect mythical creatures such as in Lord of the Rings, Sinbad etc, because you won't get it. There are however, a good use of special effects, but not to the detriment of the storyline/flow as I've felt with a lot of other big budget films in recent times.<br/><br/>What more can I say without giving too much away? It's a good popcorn movie, definitely worth a watch- go see it!"

Gemma Arterton as Princess Farah ( Tamina ) has been slightly modded into a more diplomatic role without the usual Bow and Arrow of her's .. the Prince looks sharp and still has the flamboyance of the Prince in 'Sands of Time' ... The Glow on his face, the Sarcasm and the appearance matched perfectly with Jake Gyllenhaal !<br/><br/>Over all As an Ardent Gamer and a big fan of the Saga I would rate this a 10 !!!

","Good thing I went yesterday when it was half price for each ticket. I was bored at home, I just wanted to do something with my friend. I wanted to put my brain to rest while remaining awake. Never expect much out of a big budget film that was based on a video game. Like Pirates of the Caribbean, you could expect randomness mixed with a moving plot. Some of the action sequences do pay homage to the video game but I can't help but think it also borrowed some sequences from Assassin's Creed, hmmm. Don't expect any historical accuracy, in fact I wanted to see some opening text that said ""In a time when the Persian empire was at its peak, there were mosques even though these Persians were pagan, and everyone spoke in an uppity British accent..."" instead there was something about ""destiny"". I had fun, me and my friend enjoyed some good laughs during some cheezy moments. Oh and it wasn't Jarhead that stood out it was Dr. Octopus. Alright. See Ya."

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is an epic action-adventure set in the mystical lands of Persia and based on the video game of the same name. A rogue prince reluctantly joins forces with a mysterious princess and together, they race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time—a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world. (Walt Disney Pictures)<br/><br/>PoP is one of the very few video games that I have actually played and enjoyed a lot, I must admit. As a video game adaptation of the same name, the film is probably the best video game adaptation ever made, although that's not saying much since most of them suck. Still, the film rises above the curse, providing the audience the fun and swashbuckling adventure that we all yearned for since the last PotC film or maybe it's just me.<br/><br/>Having played the game, I see that the filmmakers changed up the storyline from the game dramatically, although they stayed put with the dagger being able to turn back time. I wasn't much bothered by it, although it would have been cool to see those gnarly monsters that I loved stabbing in the game. The replaced storyline is much more grand and epic, how a film on this scale should be. For those who played the game, you'll be happy to notice the easter eggs lying throughout the film, from the awesome fighting moves to the turning backs of time. But those of you who haven't played the game shouldn't be alienated. You'll get as much entertainment from the film as anyone else because it's a stand alone film that is completely accessible.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays the main character really well with a realistic English accent. I wasn't much bothered that he is, in fact, not Persian, although some might be. He delivered some comedic lines perfectly. Gemma Arterton plays his on screen love interest and although she also isn't Persian, she has some great chemistry with Gyllenhaal. I also enjoyed Ben Kingsley as Gyllenhaal's uncle who may or may not be the villain and Alfred Molina has a fun time playing a quirky role.<br/><br/>The action scenes in here range from mediocre to impressive, especially in the climax, although both categories succeed in entertaining the audience. There are some things in here that you have never seen in any other film, mostly due to the source material being original and different. The production design is really fantastic along with the mix of old-fashioned tricks and CGI. Harry Gregson-Williams score also adds on to the epic feel of the film.<br/><br/>Overall, PoP is a solid popcorn flick that succeeds in entertaining the audience from beginning to end. If you enjoy old-fashioned movies with an epic story and a great cast like I do, you should give it a watch. For fans of the video game, you'd be surprise to find out that it's actually good! Let's hope the film does well enough for a sequel because I'm up for it."
"Jona1988","5","2","5","30 May 2010"," Perhaps the best video game movie I've ever seen.
","I had absolutely zero expectations on this film, knowing it based on a video game. Still the films crew such as director, actors and producer made me think this could be something more than the standard low budget B-movie video games usually evolved into. And I found it a mostly entertaining 2h. <br/><br/>Sure the plot lacks any ounce of substance, loosely based on the games even thiner story. The part in the beginning is an smart hint to modern day politics. Character development is none. The actors are alright so I think the script is to blame, though I must point out that there is absolutely no emotion between Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton. Sir Ben Kingsley works alright as the villain. The humor really falls flat, except for Alfred Molina who steals the show every scene his in. However it at least succeeds somewhat in the action department. The action scenes are good fun even though some were a a bit to fast to understand what was going on. The violence is quite soft but it didn't bother me. The film recreates the games parkour action quite well, though they should have used it more. One scene were a character tells the prince he must open a door to let some soldiers in made me smile and think this is level one of a video game. However I don't think this will turn in to another blockbuster franchise for Jerry Bruckheimer. This will not be another Pirates of the Caribbean.<br/><br/>Stupid but entertaining non the less. The flaws are many, far more the the good. Still this is the most entertaining and well made video game movie I've seen. 5/10 Hopefully one step further to finally a good video game adaptation."

I don't want to upset anyone, but sometimes it looks like Assassin's Creed game (if you played that game and saw this movie, you will understand... when Dastan jumped like the Leap of Fate, even the movement of the camera it's the Assassin's Creed idea... i don't think it is a spoiler, it's just a remark) Very cool the effects of reversing time and the idea, not like the game itself, it's something innovative and new. I love it. The actors did a great job, the comedy part it's very well played by everyone. Persia looked alive and well designed.

","As a die hard fan of the game I had to go to the movie even I knew it has Jack Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>Story: I expected to have at least 70% of the story of original game but what they did is took the twists and turns from the game and in between placed their own version of story. Which just sucks. Why can't they keep the original story, that has every potential to be made into a movie. The story they show here just sucks, scene to scene transitions are very loosely connected and the incidents that make the story go from one scene to another is just so clichéd. And what with the initial orphan story????<br/><br/>Acting: Who the hell casted Jack Gyllenhaal as prince. He just lags the charm. He seems more like a hero from a rom-com never ever a warrior. Every expression he showed in such casual manner that even the environment is tensed he alone makes u uninterested in whats happening around. Rest all are average. The prince character is not explored totally.<br/><br/>Cinematography: Good but not lavish. Being a story of ancient time and kings, magic it should have been beautiful to eyes but the sets are very poor (in terms of cheap). Camera angles are conventional and unnecessary close-ups used. What impact does a horse with shield do to u if its shown for a few seconds on screen. Nothing, it bores u.<br/><br/>Directing: Good not gr8. The director should have played the game himself b4 making it into a movie. He should have then caught the magic of POP properly.<br/><br/>Action/Spl. effects: Stunts are good if judged individually. But, u know why POP was so gr8, its only because of prince's awesome acrobatic skills and out of the world fight sequences. This movie tries to achieve it but just fails. I don't know why, they had the backing of Disney, could have easily spent more for special effects. The wall runs, the wall to wall jumps, two sword fights came and gone in a minute. The action kept me thirsty for more. But, I would admit, a few scenes are made very well. The chase scene after King dies, snake fight scene are good for eye.<br/><br/>Verdict: One time watch. Get the HD version, not very spectacular to be watched in theater."

","As soon as I saw the casting and the general vibe of the movie in production I sussed it would, at best, be a throwback to the ""Sinbad/Arabian Adventure"" style movies of the 1970s (of which I have very happy memories of rushing to see at my local flea pit as a child!) Seeing the movie last night that's exactly what we got with A) An American actor in lead wearing wig and dark make up B) The most English actress in England as exotic beauty also wearing wig and dark make up C) Very established serious character actor with vaguely foreign look hired as evil villain D) A sinister tall henchman in black who says very little to do all the dirty work E) Cheap cardboard looking generic Arab city sets filled with very few extras milling around F) Some tasty location work in Morrocco doubling for wherever it was meant to be G) Couple fall instantly in love after 2 seconds H) Rubbishy generic ""What Westerners think Middle Eastern music sounds like"" soundtrack I) Poorly defined quest plot centring on magical macguffin device J) Robust comic relief dirty brigand character with his easy to make laugh gang of smelly ruffians who start out evil but end up good K) Everyone speaks in English accents of varying types (Acceptable since the alternative of doing it all in funny fake Middle Eastern accents is worse - see ""Golden Voyage of Sinbad"") So I was pleasantly happy that my meagre expectations of this film were fulfilled, at least for the first hour and 10 minutes or so, when the movie turns very suddenly and very violently into some generic fantasy actioner from 2000-2002 with all the drop off that entails. Not only ""The Mummy"" and it's wonderful sequel, but also ""Tomb Raider"" (With VERY similar time travel turn around previous tragedy and battle result) ""Bulletproof Monk"" and many others, not to mention the Russian ""Daywatch"" (Again similar 'Wipe out previous disaster with magic time travel artifact' end) and even Jet Li's ""The One"". So we have a diverting little cut and paste movie capturing somewhat jarringly two separate stages in fantasy movie history. Of course as many have said there is not one single original molecule in the entire film, but then when was the last time we actually saw ANYTHING original in our cinemas, especially in summer? Dumb but fun and instantly forgettable, that is perhaps what fantasy cinema of this type is all about, so in that sense it is a triumph."
"blacklist-1","8","3","11","25 May 2010"," Terrific trashy fun, just what the doctor ordered!
","I was in the mood for a big action trashy fun blockbuster after studying hard and having exams and that's what Bruckheimer and Mike Newell delivered. Yes the story may have been weak with a bit of a dry and predictable script, but even in places it was surprisingly witty, this was due to the great romantic chemistry between Jake Gyllenhall and Gemma Arterton with witty banter that made it enjoyable. There was much more chemistry than between Arterton and Worthington in the Clash of the Titans. Newell I have to say in such a trashy fun Hollywood blockbuster, the romance is usually cheesy and pushed aside and I'm glad he instructed the script writers to put more witty banter in the dialogue, it worked.<br/><br/>I have to say I was also impressed with Gyllenhal's performance as Prince Dastan and he had not only the acting but physicality to pull off some amazing stunts, which were his own and I thought Arterton as Princess Tamina was surprisingly good (after her dismal performance in Clash of the Titans). She actually put effort into her voice. She has been criticised for her performance as some critics have stated that her acting is just as bad in the Titans, but I'm afraid they are at fault for misinterpreting, she deserves praise and looked pretty.<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley though as villain Nizam was excellent and stole the show for best performance whilst Alfred Molina (whom I didn't even recognise!) was superb as an ostrich racing money maker, he was hilarious. The special effects were stunning, the scenery was lovely and the action was exciting and plenty with inventive editing techniques and camera shots. This was terrific fun and it really made my day and is certainly better then Clash of the Titans. Keep your expectations low and you will have a blast."

","Gamers expect this film to do to video game movies, what Batman Begins did to comic movies, elevate it to a whole new respectable level. This film completely and utterly fails. The 2003 game is regarded to be one the best action game with a great time travel mechanic. The movie? Probably the worst time travel movie I've seen.<br/><br/>People say they should develop a new story for the film because the game's plot is too paper thin. In the end, the film's original plot is quite lame in comparison to the game. But hey, it's a video game movie, it doesn't have to have an Oscar worthy story to entertain. With a 200 million dollar budget they could at least offer us good actions? wrong. <br/><br/>In the game, the sands infect and turn people into monsters, you can forget about them in the movie, they're not in it. Also, in the game, the dagger can slow down, rewind and stop time, we get to use it in sword-fights and acrobatics. In the movie, we don't see the Prince use the dagger much, instead we get a largely forgettable sword-fights and badly framed acrobatics.<br/><br/>Both the lead have no on screen chemistry, this kind of antagonistic at first, love grows in the end relationship has been done a million times in films, and they couldn't get it right this time around. Ben Kingsley phoned in it, but he doesn't have much screen time. Alfred Molina steals the show as Sheik Amar, the tax evading, gambling promoter with ostrich fetish. <br/><br/>It's a missed opportunity this movie, it really has the potential to be the first truly good video game adaptation. I expected better from the makers of Pirates of the Caribbean, this is a lazy attempt from Bruckheimer and frankly a huge dishonor to the original source material."
"nogodnomasters","9","1","2","28 May 2019"," CLOSE, BUT NO CIGAR
","This movie has nearly all the makings of an Epic motion picture. It has an exotic setting, a new crisp plot, plenty of action, and a beautiful woman. Our hero starts out as a street orphan who champions goodness against the Persian army as he jumps around rooftops like the Phantom. However, once he becomes adopted by the king, he loses a lot of personality. He is not as colorful as other leading men in Epic films, mostly due to the writers who gave him lousy lines.<br/><br/>What was really missing in this movie outside of exceptional dialogue was humor. I don't mean turn the movie into a comedy, but when you want to be compared to Pirates..., Indian Jones, or other epics such as Star Wars or even the grand daddy of them all LOTR, they all had some comical element in them with leading men that were able to deliver those lines. This movie lacked that human element and it showed as it failed to hook me.<br/><br/>In spite of the inability of either the script writers or director to create great characters, the plot, action and scenery were enough to carry the film to where it would be enjoyable. There was one ""joke"" as the princess kept an amulet with the sands of time in it on a necklace located at her cleavage...the last place anyone would look, except maybe Prince Dustin who noticed it right off.<br/><br/>Yes, there is a time travel element to it, but it is not really a time travel movie, i.e. it is not bogged down with nerdy time travel paradoxes. Time travel was a gift from the unnamed god(s).<br/><br/>The movie has a happy ending with a message of hope as well as violence, killing, and snakes. I consider it better entertainment than Robin Hood, or Iron Man II."

","This movie seems to be based on a computer game, which I never tried and didn't know until I watched the movie. Past in the late period of the Persian Empire, with absolutely fictional characters, its not a historical film and has no relation with historical truth. It's all an invention, a fantasy. The script is interesting, promising entertainment and fulfilling this promise in a very positive way. Jake Gyllenhaal gives life to the film in the lead role, standing out in well-constructed action scenes. Ben Kingsley is a convincing and well-built villain, though it's a bit obvious he's, or will be, the film's big antagonist. Gemma Arterton was OK in her role, which mixes a bit of ""Xena, Warrior Princess"" and ""lady in distress"". The remaining actors are in supporting characters but they do their work well enough. The ending, however, is a bit sudden and unsettled from what was happening as if, in the middle of the movie, the protagonist became Indiana Jones and everything turned into a game of deadly, utterly boring, mazes and traps. Either way, this movie is good enough to entertain the audience, it's fun, it has very good action scenes, good CGI and a regular cinematography."
"dom-lerose-8","Null","1","2","30 November 2014"," ""Prince of Persia"" feels so lousy that it isn't even likable by visual means.
","The worst turn in the talented young actor Jake Gyllenhaal's career is a summer movie so lousy, so ridiculous, and so horribly acted that even the eye-popping visuals seem withdrawn. The Arab-like setting in ""Prince of Persia"" is very stereotypical and hardly shows a historic culture fused with fantasy. We've all seen stories like this before. This is like the live-action 'Aladdin"" with no heart and music. A young fugitive prince named Dastan (Gyllenhaal) and princess must stop a villain who unknowingly threatens to destroy the world with a special dagger that enables the magic sand inside to reverse time. Overboard on the fantasy? There have been legends like this in Persian history that make zero sense and are completely absurd. That shows you how foolish the filmmakers were in making this. ""Prince of Persia"" is your routine summer action film from a studio who produces some pretty big blockbusters. Mike Newell directs this with an overly-vibrant colors and sets that are so obviously CGI and look recycled from other films. Gyllenhaal needs to stay away from scum like this containing laughable dialogue and do more powerful dramas like he's best at. You live you learn there Jake. By the climax, we know how this film will play almost word for word taking out the fun from the action that barely comes and is barely exciting. Gee, I wonder if the protagonist is gonna make the huge jump in order to save the world? That's the question you'll have to ask yourself during the poorly edited and shot action sequences. You can see every farce coming miles away and there are no twists to add a sense of creativity. Behold a typical hero movie with a lame hero running through the streets of Morocco and jumping around everywhere for God knows why."
"thesar-2","2","1","2","7 December 2012"," Lara Would Kick Sand in This Prince's Face
","How Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time didn't end up as direct-to-DVD cartoon is beyond me.<br/><br/>It was, in fact, an all-but cartoon, with thousands, make that MILLIONS of CGI clips; it's almost like watching a cartoon. Now, that's so the (probably near-bankrupt) Disney can make a buck on something they probably weren't too sure of. Uh, like Mars Needs Moms? Too soon?<br/><br/>Now, it's not all bad. It's entertaining if you leave your brain on a magic carpet by the door, and know the source material. Only, I played thee original Prince of Persia – as early as 1989 and not the ho-hum remake of every other desert adventure that's out there. I've seen the previews – of the updated game that is – and a lot of shots of this movie version does look a lot like it. So, kudos to them for keeping with the (times and) video game.<br/><br/>But, it's also not all that good. What starts off with enormous plot elements thrown at us as well as what seems like 50 different locales that you're supposed to ""get"" up front, ends up with the age-old story, in an age-old Iran – formally Persia.<br/><br/>Oh, and before I go furthercan someone please remove the ""SIR"" before Ben Kingsley's name? Seriously, the ratio of bad movies to good outweighs the number of good Friday the 13th movies.<br/><br/>So Persia wants to rule the world and an ""Aladdin""-type Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) is the adopted son of the King and has two brothers and an Uncle (unsir Ben Kingsley.) Side note: I would like to call this Uncle after another ""Uncle"" from another Disney classicbut that would be too much of a spoiler. Though, if you don't see that coming, you have never, ever seen a movie before, let alone played a video game beyond the Super Nintendo. (Heck, let's say the Sega Genesis.)<br/><br/>Anyways, King Daddy dies and Dastan is destined to be accused. Meanwhile, he's in possession of a switchblade (of sorts) thatwait for itcontrols the sands of time. Well, for a minute at least. Meanwhile, Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) wants the cutting-through-time knife back. And it does, in fact, go back and forth between the two leads so many times, you'd think this was Groundhog Day.<br/><br/>Oh, and the evil one(s) also want the sharpy thing. (See how I'm not taking this seriously?) And neither should the audience. The movie's just an excuse to throw cheesy (and obvious) CGI-controlled scenes at you in both rabid and slooo-mo (Also see: The Matrixwait, aren't we 12 years past yet another Matrix-rip-off?)<br/><br/>I'll repeat (one part, at least): It's not all that bad. It's entertaining enough just as mindless action, but with zero depth, originality or creativity. You can just watch it because there hasn't been an Indiana Jones, Mummy or Lara Croft reboot in the works recently. Speaking of which, Prince of Persia doesn't even come close to those movies (okay, maybe Lara Croft: The Cradle of Life and Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull – it's certainly on par with those.) Heck, even the mostly-bland National Treasure movies are better.<br/><br/>And that's all too bad. You can tell Jake put his heart into this; I'm sure he worked out at the gym for more hours than he put in for Brokeback Mountain. But, sadly, he also put his time into a tired script with a truly foreseen finale that takes way too long to get to and yet another movie Kingsley phoned his performance in. Skip!"

","If you have seen enough Hollywood blockbusters then you have already seen this movie. Its full of the same old punch lines, comic relief characters, clichéd moments etc. If you are up for something like that, Prince of Persia isn't particularly a bad choice. The visuals are decent, acting is above average and the film manages to deliver a story in a watchable fashion.<br/><br/>For people like me who have already played the game and know the back story of the prince, this movie is nothing but a massive disappointment. The Prince in the games was such a unique and flawed character. These flaws and how the Prince overcomes them was the reason for the success of the game.<br/><br/>In short I felt that anyone could have taken any action video game and pump it through this formula for the same result. Its not particularly a bad result but nothing special either."
"bob the moo","Null","1","2","13 March 2011"," Solid matinée fare but needed more spark, comedy, thrills and build to make it more than that
","I never played this video game but as an Assassin's Creed fan I can see how it must have played and, although games are always best played rather than watched (ask my girlfriend – she knows), lots of films have made free-running related action into quite thrilling sequences or films (Casino Royale, District 13 come to mind). The plot here sees a Prince fleeing after being accused of the murder of his father the King. With him he takes the beautiful princess of the city they have just sacked, although her reasons for coming along are less to do with him and more to do with the supernatural dagger he has looted, unaware of its power. As he tries to clear his name, he comes to realise that the dagger was the target all along and that someone has been after it from the very start.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia was one of several blockbusters that I ignored in 2010, partly because of the poor word of mouth and reviews but also to do with my decreased appetite for overpriced cinema tickets just to watch rubbish marketed as gold. I cannot remember a lot of dislike for this film though, but it was just the lack of positive reviews that made me throw it to the back of my mind with a note to maybe check it out on DVD or happily wait 4 years for it to wash up for free on terrestrial television. Anyway, I watched it sooner than that but my attitude of apathy was the same as I was told it was the movie choice for the evening! However I quite enjoyed it for what it was. It has enough solid qualities to make it work and entertain for about two hours, even if it is entirely forgettable once you eject it from the player! The plot is clunky and obvious but it sets up frequent chases and action sequences that perhaps don't provide substance but at least provide distracting noise, which is good enough for a Friday night.<br/><br/>Well, perhaps not Friday night but this is a really good matinée for a wet Saturday or Sunday afternoon – which in years to come will be where it plays well to a family audience. The action is solid, providing lots of near misses and close escapes and lots of impressive free-running. It isn't ever really thrilling though and the danger never feels real – no matter who dies around them, one never feels like the lead two are ever in real peril. This sort of flattens things as it misses this quality and at the same time it can apply to other aspects as well because the film does generally seem to be close but still lacking something. A spark perhaps? It has it at times because it has the comedy, it has the potential thrills, it has some good chemistry but it never quite makes everything work as it should, which is why it didn't thrill.<br/><br/>I hate the franchise but the first Pirates of the Caribbean film got it right – fun, exciting and all just there to be enjoyed and not take too seriously; Prince of Persia has the same sort of feel but doesn't quite carry it off. I enjoyed Gyllenhaal even if his accent took a minute to get used to. He is fit enough to convince in the action and he gives us a bit of a cheeky swagger that constantly reminds us we are supposed to be enjoying the film. Arterton works reasonably well with him but never to the point where they had a real spark or energy from their pairing. Kingsley does his usual shtick without ever appearing to be working too hard but fortunately we have Alfred Molina bouncing around because he is consistently fun and adds an element of irreverent comedy into proceedings. The supporting cast are all decent enough as all they do is make sure and not be bad. Mike Newell was an odd choice for director and he doesn't really seem suited to it – his direction is solid but not thrilling, like the film as a whole really.<br/><br/>Overall Prince of Persia will be coming soon to a Saturday afternoon slot near you and it will fit in there perfectly. It is a solid family matinée with action without real peril, death without blood, romance without sex or nudity ad all set in a fantasy world that is safe and distant. I can see why audiences generally didn't fancy it when it was being pushed as the big movie of that weekend, but it is good enough and bland enough to do the job when under less of a spotlight."

","Think about Peter Jackson's ""The Lord of the Rings"". This is a high standard fantasy epic. ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" could have lived up to this, and built a cult fan base obsessed with merchandise and limited edition extra releases, poster covered bedrooms, to be remembered dearly; if it wasn't made so carelessly.<br/><br/>I went to see the film with my friends. We shared nostalgia: our stories from childhood with the Prince of Persia computer games. They were excellent games, that beautifully embodied the golden feeling and spiritual fantasy of ancient Persia. The games were so clever, so intriguing - so it was fair enough that our expectations for the film were pretty high.<br/><br/>And what a disappointment.<br/><br/>The film was soul destroyingly bad. I enjoyed, perhaps, the first scene; but it went mostly downhill from there. The legendary computer games we had once known had been Disney-fied - and their characters, turned into McDonalds Happy Meal toys. <br/><br/>Some of the acting was just shameful, and the casting of Jake Gyllenhaal was hugely foolish. The picture was filthily plagued with technical problems, like slow motion shots that were flickering like twitching flamingos, evidently shot at an inadequate frame rate; countless laughable, distracting errors in continuity (like in one scene, the same man displaced three metres back and forth between shots); and we could even see the label on the ancient Persian mans turban. Come on, seriously. Some of the visual effects, however, were stunning, and I greatly enjoyed some of the action scenes. These parts of the film were particularly well managed and showed some cleverness. I also enjoyed Ben Kingsleys performance.<br/><br/>Although at one point the film was so boring, I slowly walked out to go the toilet, smiling merrily with a skip in my step through what I could tell was supposed to be intriguing tension. But it wasn't, it was ridiculous.<br/><br/>But a good watch for the shallow-minded.<br/><br/>The computer games left us astounded - the film left us laughing at how awful it was. This has spoiled the Prince of Persia franchise, and I hope another instalment might redeem itself.<br/><br/>If I wrote this around the time I watched the film, I would have maybe given it a six as everything in the cinema was pretty poor at that time. But then out came ""Inception"", and I remembered again, ""The Lord Of The Rings"". And that's a review for another time.<br/><br/>Three, and I'm being generous. Awful, with some good bits. <br/><br/>But keep your money. Honestly."

","I have not played the video game, so I may have not appreciated the movie as much as a video gamer would. Overall the movie was OK. <br/><br/>Before seeing the movie I wasn't convinced that Jake Gyllenhaal was the perfect choice for the role, but after seeing it, he did better than I expected and actually fit the role of Dasten well. The role of Tamina was alright, she was a strong woman but lacked a bit of emotion. Maybe that's what they were going for in her character. Nizim (Ben Kingsley) was alright as the villain. I didn't pin point that he was the bad guy right away. What I mostly remember was his dark eyeliner... I really like Alfred Molina, his character was supposed to be comic relief I assume? But his lines weren't really that funny. His sidekick Seso was great though, and I actually enjoyed that he got his own fight scene, meeting his match at the end.<br/><br/>The story itself was good overall, but there were too many bad one liners in the script, that did nothing for me. For example: Tamina: There must be a reason why you can't take your eyes off me. Prince Dastan: You're... I... I don't trust you. And you're not my type. <br/><br/>LAME! He could have really insulted her or said something funny, but they went with something boring. If you want us to like your main character, wouldn't he have said something more witty??<br/><br/>Anyways so the story itself was OK, but how did they choose (at the end) how far back the story would go? I thought for sure it would restart at the scene of the murder king.<br/><br/>Visually most of the action, cgi, location was great. I did have an issue with the editing though. It seemed that there were some bad cuts. There wouldn't always be a great establishing shot and multiple times a few characters seemed to appear out of no where. <br/><br/>There was also a bad transition where it was the same scene. Dastan is holding up the fat king and says to Tamina ""couldn't you have found someone lighter"" (or something like that). She says something back, the king throws nut shells in Dastans face. It was a funny scene. Then they quickly cut to a wide and then go back to the same shot which is suddenly a serious conversation. It just didn't seem to work. I still had the feeling of comedy there.<br/><br/>There were also a few action sequences which seemed to miss a shot or two. There was an action scene where Dastan falls down a hole. suddenly he was falling down the hole, but it was like you had to figure out what exactly happened. They seemed to miss the shot of him actually going through the entrance. <br/><br/>The action overall was enjoyable. I didn't mind that they over used a few slow mo action shots.<br/><br/>There was one other scene that bugged me, where Dasten and Tamina where having a normal conversation under a tiny sheet tent in the middle of a sandstorm? <br/><br/>Overall I think the editing seemed to fail the most. Now you may not exactly blame the editor, maybe it was the storyboard guy who you blame, who ever puts the scenes together, I dunno. The actors overall were good and story/script was OK."

The dialogue consisted of either cheesy one-liners, or detailed but very fast-paced plot points (Why are they attacking that beautiful, peaceful city again?!) - neither ploys generated real interest to viewers. Each scene moved right into a choppy action sequence & clunky aerobic stunts by Gyllenhaal.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal could not hold his own as the lead role in this action movie. Could he be any less Persian-looking? Why the horrible English accent? Why so many cheesy, one-liners? His goofy face just didn't fit a serious action hero role. The fight scenes were so contrived, manipulated, edited & chopped up, that they lost any momentum or power. They also lacked continuity.<br/><br/>I gave this movie a shot because I wanted to see what Gyllenhaal could do in this lead action role. I was disappointed and almost embarrassed for him! Certainly that Disney Standard was just not there. The only positives I could find were in the elaborate costumes, city sets & effects -- and even those seemed too contrived in some parts. Ehh.

The story was very good and kept your attention all the way. The characters did their job and you felt how you were supposed to feel about them and the actors did a great job playing as their characters. I thought that Jake Gyllenhaal did a fantastic job as Dastan, the Prince of Persia as did Gemma Arterton who played Princess Tamina. The action sequences were brilliant to watch and the CGI was done rather well. The writing and the direction was great and it made for truly enjoyable viewing.<br/><br/>I absolutely love the Prince of Persia games and I very much enjoyed watching the movie. The most entertaining part of the movie for me was definitely the last forty-five minutes, it was brilliantly executed and action-packed. I have no idea how this got bad reviews, it was just great. Everybody would love this movie and if you aren't a fan of Pirates of the Caribbean and fear that it would be like it, then get those thoughts out of your head because you'll be pleased by this movie.

"nick_durron","5","1","2","17 September 2010"," An Unfortunate Missed Opportunity
","I began watching Prince of Persia with a pretty good idea of what to expect, having read some critical reviews of it and seen its dismal box office performance. Nonetheless, I really did want to like it. I immensely enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean and was hoping that this would be in a similar vein.<br/><br/>Alas, I fear I gave producer Jerry Bruckheimer too much credit. The film was a letdown, to say the least. First of all, I should point out that I liked many aspects of the production. Jake and Gemma are attractive leads. The production design and visual effects are top notch; it's quite obvious that 200 million was spent on this. I suppose that's what I enjoyed most. <br/><br/>However, none of this redeems the film. The leads, though capable performers, don't bring much to their characters. I suspect this problem lies mostly in the script, which gives them almost nothing but obligatory exposition-related topics to babble on about. The film seems sort of like I would imagine Pirates of the Caribbean without Johnny Depp. Imagine Orlando Bloom and Kiera Knightley anchoring that movie... ugh boring.<br/><br/>I've spent much time considering why this movie didn't do well at the box office. The lack of really interesting characters, I as a pointed out above, could be a factor. The real problem, though, seems to be the marketing. Trailers for the film didn't present a strong story and instead focused on the spectacle and CGI. Furthermore, no clear villain was presented in the marketing, which is perhaps one of the most essential elements in the plot for a movie like this. I'm fairly confident that with some better marketing this film could have made twice as much at the box office. It's a shame, really, since they won't be making any sequels now. I would have liked to see a sequel, despite the film's many shortcomings."

A title like Prince of Persia really could have done better.<br/><br/>Overall, the film had the typical adventure film score music, the typical adventure like fighting scenes, but without the comedy. Character transition are way too fast to the point is almost childish. This movie does not make you think, it doesn't make you laugh, it doesn't make you happy, sad, nor evoke any other emotions, and it definitely does not live up to my expectations."

","Saw this one from a IMAX screen in the multiplex cinema in Perugia, I was impressed not only by the grand scale of the cinema, also the impossibility to reach there unless I have a car. No buses or the SUPER-MINIMETRO are nearby (I walked for 20 minutes to reach the nearest minimetro station). What a pity, otherwise I would definitely visit it more often. <br/><br/>About this film, as I am definitely no video-game fan, I'm indifferent to the fact of where this film is adapted from. My interest is to see how Disney produces a summer-pop-corn- Hollywood-blockbuster. The outcome is that this film is just so-so, with the special effects (SFs) creating no surprises, even a little bit shabby, I have to say THAT DOESN'T IMPRESS ME MUCH.<br/><br/>Let's talk about actors, Jake is on his way to become a superstar, which is no doubt, so POP is his touchstone, but no personal charisma could be empathized from Prince Dastan if compared to Depp as Captain Jack (Ok, the muscular hot body is the only exception). Thus Jake still needs a little more patience and the deposits of time to show his unique charm. As For Gemma, I have nothing to say, the role is weak and unimpressive (although I think she is not so attractive with the bizarre costumes), Kingsley and Molina both do a good supporting roles in a blockbuster summer bomb. <br/><br/>Btw, I watched the whole film in Italian and without any subtitles, which caused a little bit trouble to understand what actually happened (but does it matter?), nevertheless the film is enjoyable with too many clichés, I could literally tell what will happen even without knowing the storyline (i.e. the death of the king, or the death of that poor black fighter, a look- familiar Steve Toussaint), one thing I don't quite comprehend is the technical usage of the dagger and the sands, which bothered me while watching the film (maybe BOTHER is a word too serious here). <br/><br/>With age-growing, I find myself more and more immune to the high-budget and eye- bombing Hollywood blockbusters, perhaps I am also excluded from their main targets (wow, what a relief). So come on! Here comes the next generation who can genuinely enjoy themselves from these films and I am officially retired!<br/><br/>http://xingshizuomeng.blogspot.com/"
"hahacyprus","4","1","2","25 July 2010"," One of the best video-game adaptations ever made; that's not saying much!
","Yes, I did realize going in that Prince of Persia is based on a video game of that same name, but I couldn't help but feel disappointed and unsatisfied! PoP is about Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal - who was miscast!) who becomes a fugitive after he is betrayed by one of his ""brothers"" and is determined to return the Dagger that allows him to go back in time to its rightful place in order to keep it away from the villain who is keen on becoming king. (How he wishes to do that: I won't dwell on it!) He is escorted by a Tamina, a lovely princess (Gemma Arterton - who was seductive in Clash of the Titans, yet I couldn't help but squirm in my seat in this one because of her!).<br/><br/>It is very predictable! I saw everything coming!Gyllenhaal , though he performs his stunts quite brilliantly, wasn't meant for this role! However, Ben Kingsley did a good job.<br/><br/>Some of the action scenes are quite fun, I must admit! The run over the rooftop was captivating and the big finale was heart-pounding! (Though, some of the special effects looked really fake!) I tend to enjoy Jerry Bruckheimer's films, and , even though it had its fun moments,this is a disappointing outing from him. Don't see it, it can wait.<br/><br/>(This is probably one of the best video game adaptation ever made, that's not saying much.)"
"TheUnknown837-1","6","1","2","26 June 2010"," maybe it works as a video game (I cannot say, for I've never played it), but ""Prince of Persia"" doesn't quite work as a movie
","Maybe the reason why I didn't quite get into ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is because I am completely unfamiliar with the video game upon which it is based. Confession: it was not until after I saw the movie that I even learned of the game's existence. Perhaps if I had been, and I took the time to play the game, I might have gotten a little more involved in this incredibly hokey story. But I didn't, and did not.<br/><br/>But one can assess that the movie was based on a video game since it has a very videogamey quality. Let's begin by examining the physical presence of the movie. ""Prince of Persia"" is crammed end-to-end with digital and CGI effects. Heck, half of the action scenes in this movie, even physical fights that could have been easily accomplished (and with more conviction) with stunt doubles and actors are full of CGI characters. There are numerous eye-rolling moments such as a repeated effects shot of a CGI double of star Jake Gyllenhaal jumping more than fifty feet through the air, jumping bounds that exceed human capacity, and the slow-motion is so crisp and clear that it reveals the shoddiness of the graphics. The movie is also full of CGI cities and landscapes, some of which are credible, others a little dicey.<br/><br/>But let's delve into the videogamey part that really bugged me in ""Prince of Persia"": the hokey quality of the story. Jake Gyllenhaal is the titular character, an adopted son of the Persian tyrant, who is framed for his father's murder, and is hunted down by his brothers and people. Gyllenhaal escapes with help from the princess (Gemma Atherton) of a city he just recently conquered. During their fight-ladened trek through the desert, Gyllenhaal discovers that the mysterious dagger stolen from the city is actually a mystical weapon used to change time. In essence, it's a medieval time machine. Imagine the Flux Capicator inside a priceless gem of a blade and you've got the central figure of the story.<br/><br/>I guess it was just the story that didn't grab me. I didn't find the blend of science-fiction and medieval settings appealing or interesting. Nor did I find either genre particularly compelling when one was strictly being played and the other ignored except in ostensible terms. Another problem I had was the same problem I had with the remake of ""Clash of the Titans."" It is storyboarded like a video game. There is no bond or connection between characters, there isn't very much motivation behind their actions (it's all very primitive), and the only purpose of the journey to get from point A to point B. Thus, I found it very hard to get involved and to follow Gyllenhaal, who hilariously doesn't try to shave his accent and who didn't stress the makeup department in trying to make him look like a Persian. But Gyllenhaal's performance is good enough in its own right. In regard to other performances, Gemma Atherton is once again compelling as the tough spitfire, although it's basically the same character she played in the remake of ""Clash of the Titans"" and just as shallow. She's a competent and charming actress and I look forward to seeing her in a good movie. But the two best performances come from Alfred Molina as a comical, tax-hating Arab trader and Ben Kingsley as the prince's uncle.<br/><br/>The movie had me sighing and looking constantly at my watch through the first two-thirds of its running time. But I will admit when the third act came around, along with more action sequences, the tempo did pick up a bit. The action sequences were hokey, but uplifting from the previous hour of tedium that I had to suffer through. Still, it was not quite enough to save the picture as a whole. But in the end, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is rather forgettable and it will not be remembered a year from today. Make that six months from today.<br/><br/>Nah, make that next week. Or, heck, how about tomorrow?"

","In ancient Persia a young orphan boy named Dastan is rewarded for a courageous act and finds himself invited into the King's family. The adult Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) has grown up to be a nimble footed and somewhat reckless warrior. During an attack on a city that is believed to be selling weapons to the enemies of the King, Dastan proves his courage once more and seems to be destined to inherit the throne. As an initial reward he is given a dagger from the captured princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). When it is revealed that the invaded city did not hold any real weapons, questions of leadership are raised, particularly by the Kings brother Nizam (Ben Kingsley). Simultaneously, the King is mortally wounded by a gift that Dastan presents. Realising the danger to himself and Tamina, they escape together, both hoping to claim the dagger. They must discover who was really responsible for the death of the King and come to terms with the daggers time travelling powers as well.<br/><br/>Hollywood has continually failed to discover a winning formula for translating video games into screen adaptations. Almost all of the conversions have begged to ask how much fun can you have watching someone else play the game. Prince of Persia is based on the 1989 video game of the same name, a title so popular that it has generated numerous modern spin-offs and remakes over the years. The film, directed by Mike Newell, is not an outstanding piece of cinema but what elevates itself above the majority of video game film adaptations is its ability to balance the essence of the games, with a highly formulaic but relatively enjoyable narrative. The invasion of a city for holding weapons that do not actually exist might remind one of recent global events but more pleasing for fans will be the nods to various elements of the games themselves. This can largely be attributed to not only the three screenwriters but also the involvement of Jordan Mechner, the creator of the original ""Prince of Persia"" game. He wrote the film's story and was also one of the producers on the film as well. As such the action here might be surprisingly exciting, but it is the sight of Dastan leaping elegantly over rooftops and squabbling with Tamina which will indeed bring back fond memories of some of the games. Even minor touches like the way the camera cuts to reveal the gate that Dastan needs to open, echoes similar cinematic techniques that have been used in some of the modern versions of the game. There really is a nice sense of nostalgia to be found here.<br/><br/>Those that are not fans of the game will still be able to appreciate some of the more glossy elements too. Few game adaptations have received a budget like Prince of Persia, which apparently edged close to two hundred million dollars. It is because of this that the film is sparked by impressive production values, including exciting visual effects, exotic locations with the majority of the film being shot in Morroco and elaborate costumes as well. For all of these qualities however, the film never knows when to quit and at two hours it still feels far too long, climaxing at least once too often. There are also uneven performances and a script that for many might tick too many predictable boxes, with obvious romances and betrayals abound. Leading up to the film's release has been the discussion about the choice of an American actor to play a Persian but Gyllenhaal is undoubtedly a talented actor of his generation and he pulls off the action scenes surprisingly well, thankfully never embarrassed by long slow-motion shots. He brings a relative amount of charisma and charm to this role, even if the dialogue is not exactly sparkling. His accent is completely wayward though, sounding almost English at times. The characterisation of Tamina is fairly one-note, that is to make her stubborn and feisty but she is still stunningly beautiful and where most female roles in action films are treated like wallpaper, she is thankfully active in many of the action scenes as well. Alfred Molina has a small but funny role as an Arab who complains about taxes but Ben Kingsley is largely wasted as the uncle with his own motives. He does not have a great deal of time in the film to be truly menacing.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is one of the better video game to movie adaptations because it caters for both types of audiences. Those that are not interested in the game can still appreciate the production values of a highly formulaic but fun adventure, while those who are more devoted fans will relish the traits of the game that have been placed into numerous scenes throughout the film. The familiarity of the script here might make this a better rental than anything else but at least this is a significant improvement of some of the more recent disastrous adaptations. Uwe Boll would be proud."
"Nuss826","6","1","2","4 June 2010"," Disney's Middle Eastern Orphan Boy Take Two
","When I saw the first trailer for Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time I was conflicted. I was intrigued by the pairing of producing great Jerry Bruckheimer (C.S.I., Pirates of the Caribbean, National Treasure etc.) and the Disney corporation. , but the idea of Jake Gyllenhaal playing in a plot designed originally for a video game worried me. To date, I had not seen a Gyllenhaal movie that I had liked and because of cinematic endeavors such as Htiman, Max Payne, and Doom, I am leery about video game based plots. Yet, most likely because of an unhindered brand loyalty I found myself Trying to convince others to see Prince of Persia (POP) with me in theaters.<br/><br/>POP opens in a Middle-Eastern marketplace and thoughts of Aladdin come to mind faster than you can say ""street rat."" The young Dastan (Gyllenhaal) is an orphan boy chosen by the King himself to be a prince. Had there been a vest-donned monkey déjà vu would have been an understatement.<br/><br/>The movie is true to Bruckheimer's traditional style and majors in spectacle. The vast desert landscapes, stunning ancient castles, and over the top CGI effects are create a sort of visual overload, a typical Bruckheimer tool. Unfortunately, at times rather than being awe- inspiring, the effects can be distracting and even unbelievable.<br/><br/>The storyline actually pleasantly surprised me. The plot has depth that is not expected of a video game based film, and its central conflict is multi-dimensional. While certain parts of the plot are forced upon the viewer by character explanation, for the most part it progresses along quite smoothly.<br/><br/>There is no doubt who Disney is targeting with this film. As Tinker Bell movies grow in popularity and announcements have been made regarding the WDW Fantasyland expansion, many are criticizing Disney for alienating the elementary to middle school boy demographic. This PG-13 movie has plenty of action without the gore of similar films and its hero is one that young boys will undoubtedly pretend to be. I found myself disliking some of the shallow humor, but must be reminded that ten years ago, I probably would have found the jokes rather funny.<br/><br/>When the sands of time settle, the movie is entertaining. The ancient cultures may not be historically accurate, but they fit well into the story. Gyllenhaal was OK, but didn't seem like the right fit for the role. Gemma Arterton plays the female role well, and this could be her breakout film as her only other movie of note was a small role as Strawberry Fields in the lackluster Quantum of Solace. Both were clearly cast for their looks rather than acting persona. I don't see Disney basing a ride off of this one soon, but if you are a parent of young boys or are just a Disney loyalist this is one you should see. Disney proves it can tell a story well even if it is from a video game. I just hope that they don't get to ambitious and try Call of Duty.<br/><br/>Check out my other reviews!<br/><br/>http://clawandnussmoviereviews.blogspot.com/2010/06/disneys-middle- eastern-orphan-boy-take.html"

","A popcorn epic blockbuster fits for a prince (or princess). PoP has Jerry Bruckheimer's signature all over it. BIG FUN! For me it's ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" part 1 all over again, only without Johnny Depp in it. <br/><br/>Jack Gyllenhaal more than makes up for it! Rogue and buff but agile and versatile, he looks and acts the part of a dashing prince, romantic hero, Dastan. As Dastan, he dexterously climbs up castle walls, leaps through rooftops, squeezes into tight spaces, gallops on horses through the desert, bungee-jumps, sword-fights with the best of them, not to mention outwits and outcharms the rest. He is the quintessential ""good guy"" and a parkour master to boot (for those of you who are not familiar with parkour, I'd suggest watching ""District B:13"" starring real-life parkour founders).<br/><br/>As a street kid, he was adopted by the King of Persia, who was impressed by his good heart and bravery. After deftly devising a strategy to conquer Alamut, a staggered village-city suspected for harboring a ""weapon of mass destruction"" (a jab at the previous administration), the king ends up dead and he's accused for the murder and going after the crown. <br/><br/>On the run for his life from his royal brothers and the Persian army and trying to clear his name, he and Princess Tamina (Gemma Arteton), the ruler of the conquered city and protector of the magical dagger, reluctantly end up on the rides of their lives together. Anybody who possesses the dagger has the potential to rule the world because it could reverse time if the jewel atop the dagger is pressed. <br/><br/>Honestly, I was surprised that the movie was an adaptation of a video game. The story works because all the elements are there. Fantasy. Action. Adventure. Humor. Romance. It's a ""logical"" fantasy with a sense of realism in a sublime set pieces and complemented with spectacular special effects. A heroic, dashing prince with a beautiful heroine, spirited princess working together for the greater good. A villain with a familiar face and familial ties to the prince (Ben Kingsley), along with snake-equipped dark forces. A sarcastic, shady sheik (Alfred Molina) in the business of ostrich racing as a sidekick with his knife-thrower sidekick. The chemistry between Gyllenhaal and Arteton is incredible that the romantic banters look so believable. The way they challenge each other, fight with one another, and join forces together come out as natural as their mutual attraction. <br/><br/>Exhilaratingly entertaining, PoP earns a fan who will be one of the first in line for (hopefully) the next installments of a trilogy!<br/><br/>The MovieMaven http://themoviemaven.posterous.com"

","Before i go to the nearest cinema to watch this, I thought that this is the worst movie of 2010. As the movie reviews from newspaper gives such a bad critics. I thought I would sleep in the cinema. But as soon as the movie starts, this movie is full of action. The intro also impressed me the way Dastan get to be in the royal family. I'm not quite a fan of the game, but now I'm just gonna run to the nearest store to buy one.<br/><br/>I've been thinking why many people give such a bad critics. In my opinion, the CGI's were great, this movie also filled with laughters, the actors and actresses were great, the solution of this movie unexpected either. I never get my eyes closed for even 1 second as each second is the pearl of this movie. For me, this movie has a perfect package.<br/><br/>I would suggest each one of you run to get a ticket of Prince Of Persia as it is a great movie. I never thought that I would like it but its one of my favorite movies. Ignore bad critics for this movie. I never played the game before, but now I understand completely what is the game about. If you have no time to go cinema, wait for the DVD. It is a must for you to watch."
"ruffinelli_ro","9","2","7","1 June 2010"," Extremely enjoyable!
","I really did not know what I expected from this movie when I first heard about it. But once the credits rolled I knew that almost everything I wanted was in there.<br/><br/>I am a big fan of the games (I haven't played Prince of Persia from 2008 and the Forgotten Sands though), so my first reaction about this action flick was excitement. But deep down I thought that the directors, actors, etc. will ruin this legendary saga. The only thing that let me calmed was the fact that Jerry Bruckheimer was producing it.<br/><br/>As everybody knows he produced Pirates of the Caribbean working alongside with Disney like in this film and guided by the fact that PotC was great, I thought that he might help enhance this one.<br/><br/>Now I am pleased to say that his movie is great as well. They included many elements from the Sand's Trilogy. For example, clothing, moves, even some enemies and of course an unique soundtrack. The songs that played during the movie might be a little forgettable, but in my opinion they had that ""persian"" sound and contributed a lot to create the atmosphere.<br/><br/>As for the acting, it could be better. It wasn't bad but it wasn't great also. The actors did their job and nothing else. It turned out fine but with a little effort it might have been great. I think that Jake was a lot like the Prince though.<br/><br/>On the other hand, the plot was great. They took elements from the first game and put them together to create a better story. It is quite an achievement considering that most video game based movies changed the plot for bad. So that is in my opinion one of the strongest arguments from this flick. Stil there were lots of clichés but they are somewhat disguised so the final product still feels authentic.<br/><br/>Even if the film is this good, I still read a lot of comments complaining about every single detail (and those details made them hate this movie). Nobody said this would be a masterpiece, it is just a really fun movie that was adapted from a video game.I mean, have you ever seen a movie adaptation of something, that is extremely faithful to the source material? Perhaps you have, but those movies can be counted with fingers. I felt that some things were missing as most fans, like more use of the dagger, but I knew that the director wasn't able to put every single detail from the game.<br/><br/>What is beyond me is that most people loved Iron Man, and some of those are complaining about this title. Iron man was far worse than this movie and it contained a lot more of clichés and bad acting. But it is a matter of subjectivity <br/><br/>To sum it all up. This movie will not disappoint the fans because it has a lot of references, and it will be really enjoyable for casual goers as well."

"Diversia","9","2","7","30 May 2010"," Give me a dessert and action and I'm in;-)
","My biggest doubt before was the casting of Jake as the Prince of Persia. I've seen the movie for the 1st time, 1 week and a half ago. Against my expectations, it had me almost straight from the beginning. From the narrative and the complete way or the following style of 'simple' story telling. Was happy to see this kind of film again on the big screen. Liked the storyline that binds all the scenes together. The dialogue I found original and refreshing. The action in this movie is spectacular. Not just because of the special prince's way of moving. Good direction. I think this movie has an perfect balance between action and storytelling. Rather have those 2 spread occasionally over a movie then for example: 1hour story and 1hour action. That always feels forced. This felt natural. Loved the music. Give me a dessert and action and I'm in;-) <br/><br/>When I first heard Jake was going to play the prince, I admit I laughed (2years ago). I just couldn't see it then... But he completely amazed me! His accent was always was so incredibly good and always there. He never let's go of it. That's what I myself most remember about the game. There's been much 'talk' of the casting of this movie. I only thought of it once at the beginning. But when I saw how GOOD Jake was doing, I let it go! They had to find someone that can act (and do the perfect British accent at all times = nothing worse than an actor forgetting his accent somewhere in the movie = breaks the spell), look like the prince, has blue eyes and is known with people. So they chose good in my opinion. All the actors did a great job btw! I don't mind saying that.. Despite the horrible word one of my friends called me afterwards, after me saying I loved this movie and cast, which is so unjust since I myself am of mixed white and arabic offspring! Can you believe this?! I couldn't!! <br/><br/>At the end of the day it is just make-believe and I BELIEVED I was in, right along there with all those characters (Dastan, Tamina,etc), in their Persia (based on a game). And I did so again, when I went to see it a 2nd time without my horrible friend to be sure! I BELIEVED it again so! It also made me think of the movie Mortal Kombat (I love that movie!). Especially the part that they cast Christopher Lambert to play (superbly by the way!) Rayden, originally in the game an old Asian dude. No one then mentioned anything about it then. So we shouldn't do so in this case either.<br/><br/>I thinks this movie is a nice and worthy follow up (if you let it be) in the few successful movie successes of filmed video games before (Mortal Kombat,Tomb Raider 1&2)! It's good!!! The movie has it all, a hero you care for, a story that's interesting, good action scenes, etc.<br/><br/>It had me interested, thrilled, amazed, astounded from beginning until the very end. Very important=one of my signs a movie is REALLY GOOD=it completely made me forget that I was in a cinema!!! That's all I want, to be entertained!!! With enough story to make me care and feel for the characters in it. I love(d) it!!! It's a true blockbuster to me so a 9!"
"sheeleyb","9","2","7","28 May 2010"," A damn fun film.
","To summarize where I'm coming from: (1) I've never played the 'Prince of Persia' games, (2) I had no idea what they were about, (3) I've never read any promotional side product of the video games, (4) I've never even read a summary of one of the game's plot off of Wikipedia. The most was maybe I read one back-of-the-box blurb in a Blockbuster 3 or 4 years ago, and I can't even remember what it said. So, other than seeing the trailers and the knowledge that this did come from a video game, and that this was coming from Disney. So, in the end – or at least when I was heading in to see the movie – I was hoping for an exciting PG-13ish popcorn flick.<br/><br/>My hopes were well met.<br/><br/>'Prince of Persia' was as good if not better than many other fun flicks I have seen. The characters were entertaining and neat. The quips and banter between Dastan and Tamina was good. The special effects were well done for a movie where you knew walking in that realism wasn't a major factor. Many details of plot were predictable, but enough was going on to have me hooked in so that I didn't care. The relation Dastan had with his father and brothers was very interesting and wasn't as cookie-cutter as I expected. In fact, it was better handled that in many ""serious"" movies I've come across.<br/><br/>The only other criticism I had was the overuse of bullet-time and ordinary slow-motion shots. The bullet-time was good a few times, since normal speed would had just been quarter-second and gone instead of adding a little bit of tension. But the slow-mo during some jump scenes or dramatic moments looked force. Plus the choppiness was took much (Dastan in front of the fire, for example). They should had planned that shot in advance and sped up the film during recording to get a smoother slow-mo image instead of dropping the frame rate in playback.<br/><br/>Eh. So it wasn't perfect. The humor, banter, and tension was well done, and the movie never felt like it was going on too long or too boring. Dastan's acrobatic tricks might had felt forced if it wasn't for the fact the talent was well established at the beginning, and if anything it made sense for him to use his talents throughout the film. And it 'was' entertaining to watch.<br/><br/>To repeat myself in summary, it was fun. This is the first time I've walked out of a movie not only feeling the possibility of a sequel looming but also very much looking forward to it. I also can't wait for the Blu-Ray release.<br/><br/>Sit back, grab the popcorn (or nachos or pretzel-bites), and enjoy."
"StartingAllOver14","7","2","9","26 May 2010"," Decent and entertaining enough
","The video game genre isn't the most compelling genre to transfer into the big screen, considering mostly that most of the video games adaptations has turned out as mediocre movies. With ""Prince of Persia"", on the other hand, it looked like something more spectacular, mostly because of it's visuals and stunning effects and also considering that this was a Jerry Bruckheimer film. So this film looked a bit promising.<br/><br/>Most of the time, ""Prince of Persia"" does what its supposed to do; Delivering some action-filled, fast paced entertainment, to keep the attention of the audience during 116 minutes. While it doesn't becomes something beyond that, it makes a nice watch. But the story starts off as a little monotonic and doesn't take off after twenty minutes or so. But the rest of the film does makes up for that, with some exciting fights and a exciting plot with some clever twists, in spite of a bit frenetic screenplay.<br/><br/>I've never quite pictured Jake Gyllenhall as a sword fighting Persian hero, but he does comes across as passable enough in his part. Although this is far from his most complex role, he has enough charm and screen presence to pass himself during 116 minutes. Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), the obligatory love interest, is fiery and intelligent, but doesn't comes off as a memorable character - although the obligatory love plot starts off in a unconventional way. The rest of the cast are decent in their parts, but none of them stands particularly out.<br/><br/>I shall honestly confess that I don't have much knowledge about the original video game, but I still saw a few references to a video game during the film; the way Prince Dastan fought, jumping from rooftop to rooftop and twirling on sticks, which was noteworthy (and funny) at first, but not particularly distracting. While the fast-paced closeups and slow motions comes off as unnecessary, the film does however have some nice visuals, a solid, Arabic-inspired score by Harry Gregson-Williams (though this isn't his very best score) and some nice special effects, which makes up for it.<br/><br/>Otherwise, this adaptation of ""Prince of Persia"" may not be a unforgettable motion picture experience, but it's still a watchable and entertaining way to pass 116 minutes with."

","Disney's The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a film clearly designed to appeal to the entire family: for the mums to drool over, we have a buffed up Jake Gyllenhaal; for the dads there is the beautiful (but incredibly wooden) Gemma Arterton; and for the kids there is plenty of video game style action. Oh, and there's an ostrich race, and who doesn't like an ostrich race?<br/><br/>Shame that they forgot all about a decent plot.<br/><br/>The 'scribbled on the back of a napkin during a power lunch' story that has been built around the popular video game series sees Gyllenhaal's Prince Dastan trying to prevent a magical dagger that can reverse time from falling into the wrong hands. This allows for tons of ridiculous stunt-filled action in which Gyllenhaal's character performs impressive, nay impossible, feats of physicality, a fair amount of mild violence, and a little romance (although Gyllenhaal and Arterton share zero chemistry). Sadly any sense of genuine excitement or fun is swamped by the sheer predictability of proceedings (Ben Kingsley is the real villain? You don't say!) and the glut of CGI enhanced action set-pieces that only serve to bore."

","Once again we have been given what can only be described a terrible video game adaptation, the story makes little to no sense, the dialog is laughable and the acting is some of the worst performances I've seen from good actors. The director seems to think that if there's a tough situation in the movie for the characters to get out of he should just cut to the next scene and we wont worry about it. The almost 2 hour run time had me looking at my watch just wishing time would go faster so this horrible thing called a movie would finish. Don't waste your time, i cant think of a worse video game movie and thats including super mario brothers."

","I enjoyed this film. Had a decent story, good action, slight humor, and it flowed nicely so it kept your attention till the end.<br/><br/>But, it should be said that Gemma Arterton cannot act. She appears to have 2 faces; one, that requires her to leave her mouth open with an expression of ""Where am I?"", the second I guess would be a more serious face with, yes, a closed mouth and the expression of ""I'm seriously listening to you"". I could post some examples but I'm not sure I can upload entire movies on this site. Besides her bad acting she has a great voice for narrating I could see her as the female equivalent to Morgan Freeman great for story telling or intros.<br/><br/>Refreshing, does have a feel similar to Pirates so, ""Yes, Disney I can tell."" With the quality of movies that have been released lately, this will be one of the best."
"Ozkanerd","10","1","3","11 March 2011"," A very good adaptation with no flaws
","Any one who spend a decent time playing sands of time (and the warrior within) will watch it with a slime on their faces. Just to be on the safe side, I'm very harsh on adaptations(ie Eragorn: very bad plot no consistency at all) and films with simple childish dialogs and characters(ie Spiderman 3). So I am reviewing this movie with this thought in mind and asking myself is this a good adaptation? did the characters is compatible? did the screenplay, art, clothes matches the game?(Harry Potter 5 was a victim of this*), is the story arranged such that minimal changes has made in the film(since it is a film there will be times to fill the gaps that are not covered in the game story line, but are this new plots suit the story and the character behaviour.) From my side the movie has no major flow in adaptation. Everything is a possible scenario, and more the more imported thing is that the wasn't a single time where a scene conflict with the game mechanics or concepts. All was in order. Your expectation of this film will not fail you.As I was hoping some good action and effects that will capture your heart and the drama that resides in the game. (Game has a beautiful ending with a beautiful song) All was there and some more. The filler parts was more of a comedy action type and it was good too.(Remind me of the film The Mummy and the dialog :His neck did not break).Well you will find some parts that yours imagination and film wont match but as long as it is a possibility you find yourself saying ,ok this could happen too. Then you will no longer wondering or thinking about it but enjoying the show. This was the crucial part that allow myself to enjoy the film to the fullest. Since it is not easy to find a good conversion which won't make you angry or disappointed, I will just say have a good watching.<br/><br/>*Very bad screenplay. All early sequels are done by the same person (Steve Kloves)even though the directors changed."

","(Credit IMDb) Set in the mystical lands of Persia, a rogue prince and a mysterious princess race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time -- a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is far from a classic, but I still enjoyed myself with it. It's got plenty of humor, lots of effective, exciting action sequences, and fun characters to pass the time perfectly. I look at this film along the lines of The Mummy movies (Brendan Fraser ones) Loud, exciting, and they don't make me think too much. That's exactly what I received here. I didn't really perceive Jake Gyllenhall as the action-hero type, but he surprised me with his witty, entertaining performance. Plot isn't original in the slightest as far as I'm concerned, but it entertained me, and these days that's all I ask for.<br/><br/>Performances. Jake Gyllenhall is surprisingly an effective action-hero as stated earlier. He's comical, likable and totally entertaining. I've always liked him, but I didn't think he had this in him. Gemma Arterton is decent as the love interest, and had good enough chemistry with Gyllenhall. She got on my nerves once or twice, but remained fairly likable most of the time. Ben Kingsley is as reliable as ever here. His class was clearly apparent, and I loved every minute of his screen time.<br/><br/>Bottom line. Far from original, far from a classic, but it didn't matter. Prince of Persia is an entertaining adventure, which I was delighted to have seen.

"phoenix_100","8","1","3","3 January 2011"," Review of 'Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time' 2010
","Prince of Persia is definitely a decent flick. Based on the popular Sands of Time trilogy, this movie really stands out as a film adaption from a game. The film follows Dastan, an orphan boy who was, by chance, met upon by the King, who adopted him. Dastan, sets to capture the sacred town of Alamat, after a cart is intercepted carrying weapons to the enemy. Dastan breaks into the sacred town, and after his men have taken over the city, he stumbles unknowingly upon the 'Dagger of Time.'<br/><br/>After the celebrations, Tus (the eldest son of the King) gives Dastan a clock to present to his father as a gift for winning the city - the cloak however is cursed, forcing the King to erupt in flames and subsequently die. Dastan is then pursued by his own soldiers, and unwittingly is forced to escape with the stunning Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton - 'Tess of the D'Urbervilles', 'Clash of the Titans') - Dastan (jake Gyllenhaal) then discovers, albeit slowly, that the dagger is in danger.<br/><br/>Anyone who likes a decent action movie, with a decent plot, should look no further - this movie is perfect. The movie however did have a slight disappointment, which was the ending (all the memories gone), but strangely enough, it was a very satisfying ending - so I guess its however you view it. This film is solid on its plot, action and acting, it deserves a 8/10."
"behnam_kho","9","1","3","2 January 2011"," The first movie which does not rage to Iranian in Hollywood after some years!
","First I must tell that I completely shocked when I heard that Hollywood decided to produce a movie about Iran and its old culture with positive view and without changing the real history! As you may guess, I am an Iranian and I am really proud of it. I enjoyed watching the movie but I need to remind few points. The clothes, swords, castles and the air of the movie is not absolutely similar to ancient Persia however I feel these mistakes are not movie producer's ones and in fact it comes from the source of these stories in Persian language. So let me explain something as a defense of the producers. There is a well-known book about these legends in Persian called ""Hezar o yek shab"" (means: one thousand and one nights) which is the source of all of the stories like this in Iran. This book is a Persian book but after some years it was translated to Arabic and it is called ""Alfa leilatan va leila"" which is the exact translation of the name of the original book. Finally when Persian was survived after Arabians attack to Iran, this book was translated from Arabian to Persian. This process caused that someone wrongfully think that this book is Arabian. The Arabian space of the stories in many of the movies come from this book is the result of this process. However this mistakes must be finished one day! With whole respect to Arabians, Persian culture is completely independent and is older and deeper than Arabian culture."
"oneguyrambling","7","1","3","17 December 2010"," Not the total lazy cash in they'd have you believe.
","Young Dastan, an orphan rascal is taken in by the king of the land and adopted at the start of the film, despite the fact that the dude already has two functioning sons already in Seso and Garsiv. Why does he take a shine to the kid? Because the kid stuck up for one of his similarly hard done by mates, that's why.<br/><br/>That kid grew up to be Jake Gyllenhall, which is lucky as he is the star of this film where he is called Dastan. Dastan and his two brothers, now adults are on a bit of a ""flex our muscles"" mission with the King's brother Nizam in tow in an advisory capacity. Upon intelligence received that the city they are outside has weapons they devise a plan: attack the city and take it over.<br/><br/>I said they were princes, not master strategists.<br/><br/>Dastan thinks that by flanking the city and taking the army by surprise they can minimise casualties on both sides. His brothers don't agree. He does it anyway. Success.<br/><br/>Near the end of the battle Dastan picks up a strange dagger and tucks it away, you better believe this is an important coincidence.<br/><br/>As a prize of victory the eldest brother takes the cities' Princess Tamina for himself (fair enough too, it's hard toppling peaceful neutral cities), once they arrive home to inform the King of their success he turns out to be a fair bloke and re-gifts the Princess to Dastan, thinking the eldest brother already has enough wives.<br/><br/>Unfortunately a present provided to Dastan for him to give to the King at a celebratory feast turns out to be poisoned, killing him instantly. All present instantly blame Dastan and want him dead. He scarpers, taking the Princess along with him.<br/><br/>This is where things get interesting, Princess Tamina has had her eye firmly fixed on the dagger since Dastan showed - normally chicks looking hard at Jake's beltline is commonplace - but not at a stabbing weapon. Dastan discovers that the dagger is magical, and at the press of a button rewinds time by a few moments enabling the carrier to alter events. The drawback is that the dagger is fueled by special sands in the hilt, and supplies are low.<br/><br/>Dastan is unsure who killed his Father and is determined to get to the bottom of the issue and clear his name. After considering his options he decides he has no alternative but to go back to the city and sort this all out. Along the way he makes enemies with an ostrich wrangler (Alfred Molina) and his knife throwing henchman.<br/><br/>Back in the city Dastan discovers who was really behind his Father's murder and why. He also learns that the dagger is actually a key element in the fiendish plot, this is further complicated when the Princess poaches the dagger and does a bolt.<br/><br/>The next hour or so sees Dastan and the Princess playing hot potato with the magical weapon, pursued at times by otherworldly assassins recruited by the bad guy, the ""ostrich racing gang"", and his brothers.<br/><br/>Dastan eventually comes to realise that in order to make things right he must save the future from happening to itself.<br/><br/>Enemies turn to allies and vice versa along the way, Dastan and the Princess share a series of longing glances and lingering touches and everything finishes with some pretty PG 13 action.<br/><br/>Before I continue in this vein, making the film sound ordinary and clichéd I must point out that all the PG action is done in quite an entertaining way, nothing is too racy or violent but the action moves along at a nice pace and Jake gets to show off the results of 3 months of personal training and watching his diet carefully.<br/><br/>In homage to the video game series Dastan gets to scale walls that LeBron James couldn't get up, can jump gaps and crevasses Carl Lewis wouldn't attempt even with Ben Johnson's steroids, and can kill dozens of assailants without spilling a drop of their blood, let alone his own. (Take that Kevorkian!) The plot revolves around identifying the bad guy and defeating him, with the side issues being the romantic parts and transforming doubters to allies. It is after all a Disney movie, there can only be one main bad guy and his minions, everyone else is a good guy or a confused guy; one who will eventually realise they were wrong and become a good guy.<br/><br/>Exactly how it came to pass that every guy with a tan is Persian and not being American means you must speak with a clipped British accent I'll never know. Suffice to say I didn't see many actors, even extras who would satisfy the visual criteria of being of Middle Eastern extraction, and the fact that everyone speaks with the same English accent is disturbing.<br/><br/>I guess there will be a generation of Americans that is positive that being from any other country means enunciating your words well and sounding like James Bond. No wonder they get frustrated when people have the hide to speak another language even when in their home country.<br/><br/>The Prince of Persia is slickly made, fairly entertaining fare with solid set pieces and a sequel ready plot It has no real (at least graphic) violence, no sex or even potty talk and innuendo.<br/><br/>That doesn't make it a bad movie, in fact this time it makes it a pretty good one.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. Congrats Jake, all the exercise paid off, now if you can only get anyone to watch this thing instead of the next Saw sequel or moronic spoof film."

","What can be said about Jake Gyllenhaal in Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time – just one word – INCREDIBLE. Since his Brokeback days, Gyllenhaal is a man of many talents – he does his own stunt work. In this movie, Jake Gyllenhaal, best friend and brother to the late great Heath Ledger, lives up to his name. With an incredible cast Sir Ben Kingsley and Alfred Molina and the director who brought us Harry Potter & The Goblet of Fire Mike Newell, this movie beats all other Walt Disney films by a landslide.

","Prince of Persia was always a set of games I thought about playing but never got around too, it was pretty similar with the film because when I saw a trailer I really wanted to watch it but once again never got round to it until this past weekend.<br/><br/>I didn't know quite what to expect from it in all honesty but hand on heart I can say I thoroughly enjoyed it, it's got a good plot with believable characters and some decent action scenes. I've never been a massive fan of Jake Gyllenhaal but I thought he was well suited to the role of the Prince, Gemma Arterton was smoking hot as ever! That probably won't change your opinion whatsoever but I thought I'd add it anyway. I was surprised to see Richard Coyle in there and only realised it was him when the credits were rolling.<br/><br/>If there was one thing that slightly bugged me it was the near the end when Dastan uses the dagger and pretty much brings it all back to the start of the film, whilst it made sense and if such a thing happened it's what most of us would've done(hopefully), it felt a little bit cheap and nothing that had happened in the story seemed to matter.<br/><br/>To sum it up I really enjoyed Sands of Time, it's one of those easy to watch movies that don't require much thought and is perfect for a Sunday afternoon. Hopefully the sequel will be just as good! Thanks for reading."

","Being a hardcore PoP fan I could have found many flaws, but judging the movie on its own merit I guess its very much recommendable. So 8.<br/><br/>The movie scores home run with the sets and costumes. As any one familiar with the series will tell you the movie makers have incorporated elements from almost all the games in the series. 1.Nizam was the villain in the very first 3d plat-former. 2.The name of course is taken of from the first installment of the Sands of Time trilogy. 3.Dastan's battle armor is from Warrior Within. 4.Dastan's later wardrobe (white shirt, blue and red scarf) is inspired from the 2008's non-canon game. 5.Almut's look is based upon that of Babylon in The Two Thrones.<br/><br/>Easily the best video game adaptation.<br/><br/>The only problem with it is the saccharine sweet ending. There's no loss , no difficult choices, no trade offs. No body is killed. Only the villain dies and guy gets the girl. The games were about triumph which always came at a price. The games had more layers to it. And there's no tangible tail left for a sequel."

","Have you ever played any of the Prince of Persia games? If u did, I'm sure you would like the companion movie ""Prince of Persia: The Sand of Time"". The Sand of Time was released on May 28th, 2010 starring, Jake Gyllenhaal, as the film protagonist, Prince Dastan. The movie starts out with a kid named Dastan whose life has changed ever since, a royal king took him in and later he became a Prince of Persia. Despite being a prince, he later discovers a dragger, containing a secret power. Dastan, a brave orphan, wandering in the streets of Persia, stands up to the army of Persia to save his best friend from getting beaten. After showing courage on the streets of Nasaf, King Sharaman took him in as his own son. Years later, his two older brothers Garsiv and Tus attacked the Holy City of Alamut. Dastan successfully broke through the front doors and soon Persian army quickly moved in. The evasion ended, Princess Tamina was captured, and was offered a choice of being Tus's wife, or her people will be hurt.<br/><br/>In spite of winning the new land, King Sharaman dies at the celebration, thinking that it was Dastan who killed him. Dastan was accused of his father's murder. He escapes with Princess Tamina and goes on a journey to find out the truth. Before Princess Tamina got captured, she ordered one of her soldiers to deliver the dragger to safe keeping. But on the way, Prince Dastan attacks him, thinking that the soldier was escaping. After killing him, he takes the dragger with him. Dastan soon discovers the power behind the Mythical Dragger. He then goes on a quest to stop the person who murdered his father from getting the Mythical Dragger that could control time.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was amazing and I would recommend everyone to watch it. The movie is combined with romance, action and adventure that take you into a world of fighting and war. I would rate this movie 5 out of 5 stars because the motion pictures is so realistic that it makes me feel as if I was in the movie. In the sense that this movie is rated P.G 13 the audience shouldn't be any younger than 10 years of age."
"zakfar2000","8","1","3","20 August 2010"," Good for Prince of Persia Fans!
","Good Movie! Then why 6/10? Well, I'm one of great lovers of Prince of Persia Game Series. I have even played the original Trilogy (Mainly the first one of 1989), then the next 3 by Ubisoft (and mainly The Two Thrones). It is natural for me to enjoy this movie. But from a general point of view, it lacks many things.<br/><br/>First of all, Prince of Persia is about Magic + Persia. Ubisoft in later versions attached this with Time Traveling and Mystical Creatures. This movie seems to try to explain things in realistic way, which was a bad idea. If you have to use a Fantasy World, let them stay as fantasy. Sometimes, I will say ridiculously, the scenarios are changed to make them appear DIFFERENT.<br/><br/>It always happens when you make a movie based on games. Normally, the games lack much story but focus more on the game-play. In the movies, we need a story. And this movie really lacked a good one. For the Non-PoP fans, it is all like going nowhere. And for PoP fans, it's way too simple. OK! Everyone is saying that it is made on 'Sands of Time' game, but this movie has nothing to do with any of the game franchise. Only the concept of 'Dagger of Time' is here. The original 'Sands of Time' concept of the game has been revised as well. None of the characters in the movie are based on the game. But yes, the appeal is similar, and it feels good.<br/><br/>The best thing is Stunt Aerobic. This is what the game is all about. So, if you have played the game, you enjoy those moments. In fact, I wanted to see even more. They really handled it very well. There is just one thing that the developers need to realize. If they make the movie based on the games, they need to understand that most of the audience would be the game players themselves. They would love to see those actions... in action.<br/><br/>Overall, I will recommend you to watch this movie. Although not great, it will give you a good time."

","The trailer for this movie had me thinking ""Lot's of CGI & no story"" but the reverse is true. The CGI is there but not intrusive and I really liked the story. I know I like a movie when I care about the characters. I liked the brothers, I liked the female lead, I liked the dad. Jake G (too lazy to spell it) was way better as an action hero than I would have expected. He plays the orphan prince who has no throne aspirations down to a tee. The movie begins and end with his performance and he pulled it off swimmingly. The chemistry between Jake and female lead was well played and believable. The love between the brothers was critical to the story and I liked it. I took my two boys (11 and 8) and they loved it. I had to explain some the time travel stuff, but otherwise they followed along just fine.<br/><br/>I didn't go see this when it first came out because the trailer made it look like a poor mans cross between ""The Mummy"" and ""Indiana Jones"". This was better than the ""The Mummy"" (which I liked). It's no ""Raiders of the lost ark"", but it was worth the $2.50 I paid at the door.<br/><br/>I hope it made money and there is a sequel with the main actors all reprising. I'd take my boys when it's $7.50 (although I'm sure I'd be disappointed...rarely do sequels measure up).<br/><br/>9/10"
"elegantenlightenments","8","1","3","5 July 2010"," Great Summer Movie, Unfortunately the Sufi's got Smeared
","Prince of Persia was a fun video-based movie. A little too much CGI in a few places and not enough kissing in others. Lol! But the concepts flowed. If anything, the vagueness of the ""Gods"" was just weird and the prince's reference to the One Creator not strong enough. So, obviously some scriptwriter just plain chickened out BIG TIME.<br/><br/>Like I always tell people, ""Be very, VERY good or be very, VERY bad."" Don't sit in the middle; it's a pretty ugly place to be.<br/><br/>Future scriptwriters, when writing about the Persian Empire, remember to put in that they were Muslim and it was a common practice to take orphans, especially Christian orphans, into the palace. Christians are viewed as dependable and worthy of equality in the Qur'an. (Infidels are people that don't believe in Judgment Day; and thus live their lives without consequences) That's why the bad guy, a Muslim, is justly and rightly killed by the Christian orphan. That's right, the Christian saves the day! Whoo Hoo! <br/><br/>It's interesting and beautiful when you watch a movie like ""The Kingdom of Heaven"" which didn't sugar coat anything. I think people appreciated it more and the Box Office Tickets showed it. However, despite the sugar coating in the ""Prince of Persia"", it was still very good and the gray, ""Chicken Out"" area was only two lines in the whole movie.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, their use of Sufi meditation was just vulgar and sadly misinformed to the point of being incredibly stupid. The spin is a re-enactment of the earth's lopsided spin and a form of prayer. It is not about visions and certainly Not about fortune-telling.<br/><br/>I guess the only consolation is that they used a dancer for the Sufi. The man was both upright and ""spotting"" which means that he was keeping track of one point in front of him to keep from getting dizzy. This means the whole scene was fake from the inside out.<br/><br/>I am grateful for such kindness. If they had used a real Sufi, I would have completely lost my joy of watching the movie. But misrepresentation happens all the time in Hollywood. AS LONG AS NO ONE THINKS ITS REAL, then everything will be fine.<br/><br/>Fortunately, Fasting and sleep deprivation is the only form of vision questing known to man and it is done in every religion: Buddhism, Christianity, Shintoism, most native people etc...meaning ANYONE can do it.<br/><br/>So, in the future, do your homework both historically and religiously and next time you'll get A's from everyone! Certainly, the Ostrich races were a Hoot!!! I Loved the end and thought it was quite inventive, thus making the Film completely enjoyable - the whole point! Thank you Walt Disney for a fun-filled effort!"

However my friend and I went to see the movie and I thoroughly enjoyed it. <br/><br/>The movie does have its downsides though. Some of the jokes and puns just didn't make people laugh, however some were very funny! Also, Ben Kingsley should have been in it more. I am a big fan of his and would love an extended version with an additional 2 hours of Nizam lol.<br/><br/>Other than that the movie is great. I understand that it doesn't follow the games storyline but it is very interesting. Since watching this film I have become interested with the Persian Empire. And also a lot of people have been comparing this movie to Pirates of the Caribbean or Lord of the rings but this movie should never be compared to them because this film is so different which is refreshing.<br/><br/>Overall: If you didn't like the game you probably wont like this. Also don't go into the cinema expecting the world because a lot of people do that with every film they go to see and consequentially rate it down. <br/><br/>The film was a good opening to possible sequels but there is a lot of room to improve.

"JamesHitchcock","7","1","3","24 June 2010"," The Best of Everything Else
","Sword-and-sorcery films can be divided into two categories. There's Peter Jackson's masterly ""Lord of the Rings"" trilogy. And then there's everything else, a category which contains some of the cheesiest movies ever made, such as ""Conan the Barbarian"", ""Red Sonja"" and the more recent ""The Scorpion King"". Even the better films in this category, such as Ron Howard's ""Willow"", achieve little distinction other than that of being mediocre films rather than truly bad ones.<br/><br/>With ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" producer Jerry Bruckheimer, king of the effects-laden blockbuster, turns his hand to sword-and-sorcery (although there were elements of this genre in some of his earlier films, such as the ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" franchise). The film is supposedly set in the pre-Islamic Persian Empire, although there is little concern for historical accuracy; it would perhaps be truer to say that the action takes place in an Arabian Nights fairy-tale world. It was directed by Mike Newell, clearly a versatile director; I know him best for ""Four Weddings and a Funeral"".<br/><br/>The title character is Prince Dastan, an orphan adopted as a son by the King of Persia. Fifteen years later Dastan and his two foster brothers, the King's own sons, are leading the royal army against the city of Alamut, which they suspect of selling weapons to Persia's enemies. (The real Alamut is in Iran itself, although here its architecture suggests somewhere in India). Dastan leads the assault on the city, which falls to the Persians who capture its ruler, the Princess Tamina. Despite extensive searches, however, the supposed weapons are not to be found. (The phrase ""weapons of mass destruction"" is never actually used in the film, although I did wonder if there was an intention to satirise President Bush's war in Iraq).<br/><br/>The plot, as it develops from this point, becomes very complex, but it concerns a plot to murder the King and seize power, a mystical dagger with the power to turn back time, and a growing romance between Dastan and Tamina, who alone are able to thwart the villains' evil schemes.<br/><br/>The film is, apparently, based on a video game. Now what I know about video games could be written on the back of a very small envelope, but I do know that films based on them are generally rubbish, so I did not have any very high hopes of ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"". Rather surprisingly, I found it considerably better than any sword-and-sorcery film based on a video game has any right to be.<br/><br/>There is a better attempt at characterisation than is normal in films of this type. Jake Gyllenhaal as the hero Dastan has his tongue just far enough into his cheek to avoid any accusation that he is taking himself too seriously, although not so far that he loses all credibility. Gemma Arterton, as the lovely Tamina, makes a suitably feisty, if sometimes arrogant, heroine, showing that there is sometimes life after Bond. (Gemma played Strawberry Fields in the most recent, none-too-successful, Bond title ""Quantum of Solace""). Ben Kingsley makes a splendidly hypocritical villain, although I could, perhaps, have done without Alfred Molina's curiously 21st century comic relief, a dodgy small businessman forever whingeing about his tax burden.<br/><br/>The story, although complicated, is never too complicated to understand, and Newell keeps the action moving along at a good pace. Those looking for an enjoyable family adventure story could do a lot worse than ""Prince of Persia"". It lacks the silliness which has marred so many other sword-and-sorcery sagas. Certainly, there is nothing very deep about it and it is a long way from being ""Lord of the Rings"". Nevertheless, it might just be the best of everything else. 7/10"
"ScroNash","7","1","3","8 June 2010"," Prince of Persia: Well Above Average Video Game Movie
","I went in with kind of low expectations for this movie (since it is based off of a video game). It well surpassed those expectations too. I wouldn't scoff if someone said this was the best video adaptation to date. In my opinion, though, it isn't because I'm a sucker for the Resident Evil films. I think this is the best besides the first and third RE movies. The scenery in the movie is awesome. I've never played a Prince of Persia game, but by the way it looks it reminds me of Assassin's Creed. The film also has good performances by Jake Gyllenhaal (a newly found Persian actor) and Gemma Arterton. But Alfred Molina, in my opinion, gave the best performance. Though for some reason, this still isn't the breakout video game movie we've been waiting for. It doesn't have that ""it"" factor.

","Most movies based off of video games, don't always do so well, the only two films based off of video games that were surprised hits, are Mortal Kombat(1995), and Resisdent Evil(2002).<br/><br/>The movie is about Dastan(Jake Gyllenhaal) the adopted son of the king, and a cunning young warrior, who him and his crew successfully take down a whole army of Queen Tamina(Gemma Arterton) and overthrow her kingdom. But Dastan soon gets his hands on a dagger, but soon comes to discover it's no ordinary dagger, but trouble soon ensues when Dastan is framed for killing the king, and soon goes on the run with Tamina, not knowing who to trust, or trust each other.<br/><br/>It was not great, but not bad either. The action scenes are incredibly good, really keeping you on the edge of your seat at times. Jake Gyllenhaal was alright as Dastan, one part he really seemed to be into his role, the other part it seemed to be winking at the camera. And he and Gemma Arterton have very little chemistry. Ben Kingsly and Alfred Molina are good in there supporting roles. It brings elements of what we loved about the game."
"adrianedler","7","1","3","7 June 2010"," What else do you expect from Disney?
","Interestingly people have very high expectations of movies these days, to come up with stuff against this movie. On the way into the film my wife said to me, this is a Disney movie. It sort of set me at ease, since I would have hated it to be full of things I would not really feel good about spending the 16 Euros to watch. We went into the movie expecting some sort of family entertainment, with a good story, fun action, and a sort of mysterious overall feeling, which the previews hinted. And the fact that it was made by Disney calmed any fears that it would be too intense, violent, for a lady, like my life, who does not need to hear swearing and see blood splatter to like a movie. We go to the movies too little to risk seeing a horrible one...<br/><br/>I think people often would like every movie be absolutely stunning and life changing, and surpass all other movies, and only then, can they say that it was any good. Media oversensitivity. What if those people just did not go to the movies for say six months for a while, and then see how much they liked movies? I think this is one of the reasons why people cannot appreciate family movies. There is a huge numbness to the idea of an innocent story without a lot of stuff behind it, and a lot of the extra stuff which is only for adults (profanity, violence, sex, and gore). <br/><br/>Having said all of that, speaking of the opinion of the Prince of Persia is easy. The story was not too full of twists and turns, so as to be understandable by the common man. The stunts were great, and enough to keep the suspense going to the end. It was rather unpredictable, for those of us who are unacquainted with the game. And in any case the themes of virtue, integrity, trust, and standing together were all well maintained. Not a bedtime story for a 5 year old, but a movie which an adolescent should be able to appreciate. Keeping with this assessment, I noticed, that the under 18 age bracket rated this movie very well, whereas every age bracket older rated it a bit worse.<br/><br/>Furthermore, who produced Cinderella? Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs? Who brought us Sleeping Beauty? Disney is a producer of predominantly family entertainment, and has relatively high content standards in terms of gore, types of violence, profanity, and sex. Nowadays it seems some people can only appreciate movies which have loads of all four. But putting the question of the movie in perspective, as an adventure/fantasy/family movie, adapted from a video game (which excuse me, if this is extreme, but aren't video games for young people?), what else would you expect?"
"eschetic-2","8","1","3","6 June 2010"," Big, pretty fun. A music-free WIZARD OF OZ for the 21st Century
","PRINCE OF PERSIA; forget the well publicized video-game inspiration (only in the afterglow does the final romantic resolution feel like the artificial balance of a successfully played ""video-game"" - it's also romantically right); I'd never heard of the video games and was far more aware of the semi-literate time travel, royal conspiracy and fairy tale sources those games were apparently cribbed from. While the final literal flashback just barely passes the credibility test under the ""world rules"" the film makers have set up, the plot basically works as a framework to hang the ample action and beautifully crafted fantasy on.<br/><br/>OK, I'm a sucker for Jake Gyllenhaal's smile (if you aren't, you probably shouldn't go - it's used a lot) but the film also has Sir Ben Kingsley and a uniformly talented supporting cast (Gyllenhaal's chemistry with leading lady Gemma Arterton is on a par with Tracy & Hepburn and based on the same kind of sparing), surprisingly decent production values and, as stated, a plot pretty well plagiarized from several relatively literate sources and recent front page searches for non-existent ""weapons of mass destruction."" If ""G FORCE"" - that ghastly gopher-spies-meet-evil-household-appliance-transformers kiddie film - was just what you'd expect from a Disney/Jerry Bruckheimer collaboration, this was probably as good as the unlikely ill-matched species mating could produce.<br/><br/>I'm a passionate believer in historical accuracy in theatrical story telling BASED on history (we LEARN much of our history from popular entertainment), but when your sources are as close to Andrew Lang's classic books of Fairy Tales as to Gibbon's or even McCullough's historical literature, the impossibility of placing this Persian ""prince"" or any details of his story in any actual chronology or even ""real"" historical legends can easily be excused.<br/><br/>PRINCE OF PERSIA is big, pretty and satisfying for at least as long afterward as it took to see it. It probably doesn't try to be more than fun, but it certainly succeeds at that. Is it worth the prices they're charging for movie-house films today? At least you see where the money went. I think I'll want to see it again - probably more than once - when the DVD comes out."
"mredude411","8","1","3","4 June 2010"," In my opinion, first good video game to movie transition
","I am a big video game nerd, so when a good game or game series get made into a movie or movies, I get excited, and nervous. Turning a video game into a movie is a hard process, because so much of what makes a good video game good, is the interaction between the storyline and the user control. Without a movie theater that lets us vote on what we want to happen or what we want the main character to do, the whole thing loses that decision aspect. So it is hard to make a good video movie.<br/><br/>I have seen many other movies based off of video games. The Super Mario Bros movie... awful. The Bloodrayne series, and any other movie done by Uwe Boll is just terrible (he has turned a lot of video games into ""movies""), Silent Hill was a decent movie, but compared to the original game, it wasn't that respectable. The Resident Evil movies had hardly anything to do with the original games so I can't even compare them. That is all I can think of off the top of my head.<br/><br/>Other GOOD directors such as Peter Jackson, want to try and tackle such an idea, specifically with Jackson, the Halo games. He and others involved in that project realized it would be too hard, too costly, and too problematic to make such a highly rated game series into a movie, so it got put an indefinite hold. So even good directors like Peter Jackson take their time with the idea.<br/><br/>So going into this movie, I was expecting to be disappointed. The Sands of Time was one of my favorite games for the gamecube/PS2/xbox console. When I was done with the movie, I was throughly impressed. It wasn't groundbreaking in cinematography or anything of the sort, but for the type of movie director Jerry Bruckheimer had to deal with, he did a great job.<br/><br/>The movie itself didn't mirror the actual game, because if so, it would have been a crazy movie, but it did keep the major key elements that was in the original story. There was even some homages paid in the movie, that normally wouldn't have been smart film shots, but referenced to the cinematic in the game. It was small things like that that made me appreciate the movie more. The movie had great action, thoughtful dialog and really interesting CG that complemented the key story concepts I mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>The only complaints I had were: - There were some cheesy lines from time to time, but I was kind of expecting that since it is a Disney movie. - The fight style of the game, of Dastan, was unique and is one of the main reason the game was so much fun to play. He was a fast, acrobatic fighting machine. He would jump and flip off walls, slide, turn, dive off anything and everything in the game, making the obstacles an interesting play through. In the movie, they do have some scenes where he has to show those skills, but it is only for a short time. He does do a good amount of fighting, but less of the acrobatics. I really wish they did a little more of that in the movie.<br/><br/>Besides that, I thought it was a great movie, and anyone else that likes a good action movie, or anyone that was a big fan of the games should go see it!"

","This movie was much better than the poor reviews it got, and actually better than I hoped, and I'm no softy when it comes to reviewing movies but I think both this and Robin Hood got a bad rap by the critics, both movies while flawed were still quite enjoyable. I think this movie fell victim to a bad ad campaign that actually made the movie seem LESS interesting than it really is. Gemma Arterton shines in this, her most verbose role to date, and Gylenhaal is actually pretty damn good as well, though outdone by his co-star, and Alfred Molina puts in a great performance as ""comic relief"" for the movie. I think the most ridiculous part of the whole movie is the damn British accents (WHY !???). To compare it to Bruckheimers' other famous franchise I would say it is faaar better than ""Pirates 3"", slightly better than ""Pirates 2"" and not as good as the original ""Pirates"", that should give you a good idea of what to expect."

","I've been waiting for this movie with such a great anticipation. At first, it really met my expectations. Dastan's moves are cool, the Princess is beautiful (and hot!), and the storyline is great. But I must say, the effects are so-so, and the story itself is very predictable.<br/><br/>When I found out what ""Sands of Time"" in the title really means, I started to worry that the ending will be some kind of time-looping. My worries went down as the story went on; there is a scene when Princess Tamina explains Dastan the consequences of turning back time.<br/><br/>But my worries were really proved, the ending was ""too easy"". Many characters died, and the hero turned back time. This really turned my excitement down of the movie. But it was kind of expected, Disney movies never have a sad ending, aren't they?"
"avi_abz","5","1","3","2 June 2010"," So Disneyish!!!!
","well this is my first review and i hate to make it hateful, but i have to say i was disappointed. i just saw this movie at a multiscreen theater and it was not what i expected at all! i think Disney missed the point... they devoted so much to the ""feel-good"" aspect, they forgot that the Prince is actually an ass-kicking ,bad-guy decapitating, no-mercy warrior, who is anything but chocolatey!! well i was'nt exactly looking for a Dark-Knight here but to tell the truth... i brought no memory of the movie back with me!!! it is based on a video game all right' but all characters were literally one dimensional! The movie played out like a long drawn out trailer with crappy clichéd acting. The only guy who was in his elements was Alfred Molina, he got a few crispy dialogues... Gylenhall was totally underutilised... he couldn't have done much here given the script. And Ben Kingsley, well this is one role he wouldn't be proud of! Gemma doesn't have the charisma but does her job OK i guess. The saddest part is the action -well we all have seen some pretty cool moves which the Prince uses to execute his foes in the games.... the action director could have used some imagination in the swordplay sequences in the movie!! or maybe they wanted to make it more ""realistic""?? All the CGI stuff is 'been there seen that' stuff at best!! I would like to know Mr Jordan Mechner's take on this ho-hum adaptation of an exciting franchise.....or maybe some games oughtta remain just games!! Bottomline- if you got nothing else to do and if you liked the last instalment of Pirates of the Caribbean, or you have kids who wanna watch it you may go and give it a dekko!! 5.5/10"
"dino_saur333","6","1","3","2 June 2010"," Amazing locale with good characters and a good story
","I remember that when I first watched ""Pirates of the Caribbean"" series, what really impressed me with that movie was the amazing sets and locales when they filmed it.<br/><br/>That feeling is repeated in this movie. The sets and the locations are simply amazing in this movie. If you're gonna praise somebody, big props to the set designers and production team. Just like in POTC they managed to take me to a far off rich fantasy world.<br/><br/>If you've played the games, you'll know that the stories are usually straight-forward (In some cases like the Dreamcast version there was no story at all!) and the focus of the games was all about action and running around in a big world full of things that just about anybody can grab/climb/swing/shimmy/jump off of.<br/><br/>So my first thought when I heard about this movie was ""How the heck are they gonna come up with a decent story for the script based of the source material?"" Wonder of wonders, the writers managed to come up with something pretty engaging...if not totally predictable. Anything with time travel, you know what the hero's gonna do at the end. Time travel solves everything.<br/><br/>But I'm getting ahead. The main story deals with the Prince, fallen from grace after being framed for murdering the King, running around all over the middle east to find proof of his innocence. And on his way there's lot's of running, sword-fighting, more running, sneaking around, free-running, and a really hard-to-believe-but-you-still-go-with-it-anyway romantic subplot that appears out of nowhere (It's Disney so you probably saw that coming)<br/><br/>And while this is from the producers of POTC, don't expect any over the top character acting like with Jhonny Depp/Jack Sparrow. Jake Gyllenhaal plays a pretty good Prince, though not exactly matching the character from the games. Jake's prince is a lot nicer, which does take away a bit of the Prince's bad-ass aura. Gemma Arterton plays the spoiled princess Tamina rather convincingly. Ben Kingsley's evil uncle Nizam is a note from James Bond book of Villainy but still somehow works for the movie.<br/><br/>Some characters I can live without, like Dastan's other brother, Garsiv. I don't know where the film-makers got him from but I felt that this guy was rather inconsistent. It's not the actor's fault though, Toby Kebbell did as good a job as he could do. The character is just badly written in the script and the movie would've been fine without him.<br/><br/>Overall, an enjoyable movie that must be seen in the theaters. Fans of the game may find a few things missing from the overall experience but in my opinion the film-makers did a decent enough job. While the story and acting are above-average at best, those visuals were simply meant to be seen on the big screen."
"Seventy7","8","1","3","1 June 2010"," As someone who's played the video games... I'M IMPRESSED!!!
","I must say, as a video game to movie adaption, they actually did Better with the plot than the actual video game.... It was less cliché on how it was wrapped up, and when it comes to chain-of-events... It's actually slightly more drawn out and complicated than it was in the video game, but more enticing. Though it was so disgustingly disneyfied that I wish Lionsgate films would have picked it up. For some reason, it was like.... Lion King meets Aladdin with ""There were no weapons of mass destruction"" undertones with a hint of Matrix. You have to see it to believe that one.<br/><br/>They tried so unbearably hard to get as bloodless as they could get. (Funny with a video game to movie involving decapitations, hacking off limbs, and slicing people in half + throat slitting) But if they went to the strict route of the video game, it would have been easier for bloodless violence... But how they would have thrown their own spin into it... I don't know. It would have also made for a longer, and much faster paced movie. It would have lost a whole lot of people. However, the execution of plot was... decent at best. They had thrown things in there that seemed convenient at the time, and they were great macguffins. But they worked. It's one of those ""WHY DIDN'T YOU MENTION THAT 30 MINUTES AGO!?"" kind of things. But I'll let it slide... Knowing the princess' personality. No, she wasn't dunderheaded, she was just cunning. I'm not going to give away what she had said to lead to certain events, that would be giving away too much.<br/><br/>But whatever, that isn't my problem. I don't have any problem with this movie. The acting was great, the plot execution was between mediocre and good, the ending was... well... an ending you'd expect from Disney, and the special effects weren't overbearing. What they did with the plot was amazing. My mind is actually blown. I give this movie an 7.5/10.<br/><br/>Don't expect a sequel. It doesn't need a sequel... Unless the sands made a comeback and haunted Dastan like it did throughout the entire video game trilogy. But with the way they have things now...it's going to be difficult. I'd like to see how they pull it off. That is IF there is a sequel."
"ben-690-743945","8","1","3","1 June 2010"," Immerse yourself into this movie.
","It perplexes me how people rush to criticize the script of this film; citing historical inaccuracies or improbabilities. This film is a work of FICTION and is based on the games' MYTHOLOGY. People who criticized elements such as the editing, probably weren't aware that it was a homage to the recent Prince of Persia games, which allows the manipulation of time, hence the slow motion. I only dabbled playing the original Prince of Persia with friends as a kid or later on my mobile phone, but after seeing this, I'll definitely be playing the later games and subsequent movies. It's interesting that some people have proclaimed that this film is too saturated in action - If anything, more parkour and more dramatic sword fighting would have been sweetened the appeal of this movie. The sets were mostly good, but sometimes they felt fake or contrived. If you're reading this before watching this film - go in expecting action and energy, not deep emotional attachment you rarely can obtain in a two hour film. Enjoy the film for what it is. 7.5/10"
"nikpathak","6","1","3","1 June 2010"," Somewhere in between
","I am not a big fan of the Sands of Time trilogy, and the only thing exciting enough for me to catch the movie was the game theme (Prince of Persia was a PC game which I enjoyed thoroughly). Movies based on video games do not have a good track record - Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, Tomb Raider (minus the AJ factor).... Prince of Persia had a mighty big hurdle to clear with this, and they found the perfect team to tackle it. Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney (they had already accomplished a similar feat when they brought Pirates of the Caribbean to the big screen). <br/><br/>The biggest plus for the movie is the strategy - only some borrowed elements from the game; but not strictly follow it. The film stands alone, and does not require it's audience to be intimately familiar with the source material. For gaming fans, they would enjoy the 'nods' in relation to the game, but will be able to enjoy this film for what it was, rather than constantly looking for where it deviated from the game. What Iron Man 2 missed and this movie excelled at, is the fast action pace without being over the edge big bang explosions. Also as compared to the latest 'clash of the titans'movie, the makers didn't go overboard to make the sand and desert shots glossy with artificially induced 3D which was a big welcome. A big surprise though is Gemma Arterton's performance as Princess Tamina; it is an improvement from her blunder in ""Quantum Of Solace"" and ""Clash Of The Titans"". Ben Kingsley's performance though just didn't match to his standards.<br/><br/>On the down side, the movie feels like typical ""sword fight"" action flick. Its 'Arabian Nights', Ali Baba and the 40 Thieves, Aladdin, all mixed up. And whereas, the ending is supposed to have a 'Deja-vu' feel to it, in the game it is much more explained, whereas in the movie you're just expected to roll with it. There are too many slow-motion sequences, which (although gorgeous to look at in silos) distract too much. The humor was lame and over-used. Whoever will die and whatever will happen later on, you know that it may all be turned around when our hero will push a ""button"" on a dagger. And there is a lot of pushing button in the movie. <br/><br/>If there's one thing critics and lovers of this movie can agree on, its that the movie is based on borrowing elements from plenty of epics based in the Middle East and fantasy alike, and that it's loads of fun. Another thing no one can agree on is whether that's good or bad – so I guess the movie will never be rated as an 8 nor will it go below 5. In short, a blockbuster video game was only marginally made alive if not insulted by the movie"
"FordPrefect-42","6","1","3","31 May 2010"," Fun adventure, bad editing
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is a light, highly entertaining popcorn flick with enough spectacle and imagination to keep you on a movie-sugar high for two hours. It's got the pace of a Pirates of the Caribbean flick, a plot that plays like Indiana Jones crossed with Aladdin, and some pretty nifty time travel. My biggest complaint is the action and editing. Newell and his editor could learn to sit back and let their action scenes breath; audiences WANT to see the skill/precision/choreography of a good sword or fist fight. Cutting so rapidly not only takes away from enjoying the action, but unnecessarily complicates the visual flow of the story. It might be to cover up Gyllenhaal's abilities, but surely a stunt double and some CG work could fix that?<br/><br/>No matter, Prince of Persia may not be high art, but it's a really fun guilty pleasure, and satisfied my fix for Indiana Jones-pulp adventure and time travel."
"KillerLord","6","1","3","31 May 2010"," Jordan Mechner disappoints. So does Mike Newell.
","When the announcement was made on the Internet that a movie was going to be made based on the superb and incredibly well done game called Prince of Persia - Sands of Time, it was also announced that none other than Jordan Mechner was roped in to write the script and screenplay. Jordan Mechner is, for those who are not too sure, the inventor of the concept of Prince of Persia. Prince of Persia is a game franchise that started out with the DOS based 1989 version. A couple of years later, another very beautifully designed game called the ""The Shadow and the Flame"" was released. Several years later, when gaming technology had reached a whole new level, Ubisoft joined Mechner and rebooted the series with game of the same name. This game was a hit and received critical acclaim.<br/><br/>Now, the Sands of Time was followed by Warrior Within. Mind you, without Jordan Mechner in the team this time around! This second game was criticized for 1) Being too violent and containing mature material 2) Being opposite in its mood compared to the first game. I never understood this criticism except maybe the first one. The game was no longer meant for the younger audience. But the theme of the game demands it. If you want to show a man face to face with death, would you be a cheerful guy who makes jokes and sees the funny side of the story? Or would you elevate yourself to be a hard-hearted man who wants to change his destiny? Why am I typing all this? One point - this game was good in my opinion and I don't care what the critics say. Then comes the third part and this time Mechner is back. And let me tell you - he brought the cheesy romance back with him.<br/><br/>Jordan Mechner declared about Warrior Within, ""I'm not a fan of the artistic direction, or the violence that earned it an M rating. The story, character, dialog, voice acting, and visual style were not to my taste."" Your taste? If part three is what you taste is like, it means what you like is precisely what many gamers do not like (about The Two Thrones, the third installment) - 1) Pre-programmed fight sequences 2) Cheesy romantic dialogs between male and female leads while the world is ending 3) Completely linear game flow and other issues.<br/><br/>You can get away with enforcing your taste, maybe in the world of video games but you can't do that in a movie. You have to make the audience (and critics) believe and get involved in the story. You like a couple to have love-like-tension in the middle of the desert faced with danger, not many digest that these days. Why Jordan Mechner? Why can't you keep your taste aside for a moment and understand that you are making a movie about a Persian warrior who holds the key to saving the world in his hand? Why don't you understand that in a movie you need to convince people what is happening? What I did not like about the movie and I believe I must blame the director and the writer for it is this - the comfort a man and a woman can seek from each other when they are faced with the grave danger they are faced is definitely not the cheesy kind of love tension shown in this movie. And, a movie based on sword fighting game not having one clear shot of a sword fight. Yes, those typical shaky cam like sequences where only at the end of the fight you realize who hit whom with what. Humor is good but not when it takes away all the tension the danger is suppose to cause. In other words, the humor in this movie is weird and improperly placed.<br/><br/>What I did like about the movie is the desert landscape and the city they ""made"" in which the story is set. That is a job well done indeed. I have no problem with the cast as well. I am positive that the cast is talented indeed but of what use is the talent without the two important people who do the direction and the writing part? The story was suitably modified by Mechner for a movie but the script is not satisfying at all. Mechner should understand that the audience today has grown. If the thinks he can still fascinate an audience with a script that worked in 1989, sorry, that is not going to work today. Any seasoned movie watcher will realize that this movie had a lot of potential with the right tweaks in the direction and script.<br/><br/>The CGI is really well done. They could have easily shown some impressive sword fighting with subtle slow motion sword shots but they choose an option which seems to be gaining increasing favor in the last couple of years i.e. the rapid shaky cam approach. But still, okay, the CGI is really well done. Kudos to the CGI team. Whoever designed the sets of the movie, kudos to you too. That too is a job well done. Costumes seemed okay. I am not in a position to comment on the cultural accuracy of the costume but for a fiction history, I don't think I am too bothered with that intricate detail (as long as Persian warriors don't wear Rolex watches). <br/><br/>Overall, this movie is watchable. But this movie had so much in it to make it really big. I give it a 6 - an enjoyable experience with no moments to remember for a long time. Thanks."

The rest of the film I'm not so certain of. There was really nothing new here, at least new enough to burn it indelibly into people's minds. The things I didn't like left me feeling a bad taste in my mouth. First, the good parts: I was surprised that the lead actor, Jake Gyllenhaal, played so well as the adopted Persian Prince; although I'm not so sure one would have found a blue-eyed Dutchman in ancient Persia. I was puzzled by the affected British Accent. Maybe he was trying to be the gentleman to his leading lady. I found myself thinking, ""Why did the producers and director want their Persians to speak with British accents."" I still wonder. The usual formula would be for the actors to affect a bad Middle-Eastern accent while still speaking English. At least Gyllenhaal's effort in that regard didn't sound too bad.<br/><br/>The lead actress, Gemma Arterton, did well against Gyllenhaal. Although a real chemistry didn't seem to ignite between them, at least there wasn't a blatantly noticeable fizzle.<br/><br/>The masterful Anglo-Spanish actor Alfred Molina added a nice balance as an oddball who seemed not to be able to decide whether he was a bad guy or a good guy. He also supplied the biggest disappointment, which I'll get to later. It wasn't his fault. He was making a great effort around what he was given to do.<br/><br/>The great Anglo-Indian actor Sir Ben Kingsley gave an excellent performance. He's always great to watch, although the role didn't have much to offer the viewer.<br/><br/>Rounding out the performances were two fine efforts by Richard Coyle and Toby Kebbell, both also British, as the brother-Princes of Gyllenhaal's character. Of the two I liked Coyle the better although I'm not sure why.<br/><br/>On the negative side is the story. I've seen a lot of examples of late where computer generated special effects extravaganza came up very short in the story/plot department. It was definitely not inspired, let alone taking itself seriously.<br/><br/>The really great thing about all of the old films of this type, like Sinbad the Sailor with Douglas Fairbanks Jr., was that they played it pretty much straight. It was very disappointing to see fumbling attempts at tongue-in-cheek references to modern political issues injected into what might have been a much better story without them. They were not clever at all. They felt disingenuous and stilted. This one fell flat to me because of that and they dumped the majority of that garbage in Molina's lap, poor guy. At least he carried it off smiling.<br/><br/>If they are going to make a costume adventure/drama I wish they'd play it to the hilt, and at least let the kids at least enjoy it. In days of yore, kids could buy a solid ticket to a wondrous dream world on a Saturday afternoon. This one wouldn't measure up.<br/><br/>For my money, far better stories were written in the tenth century in the famous work, ""The Thousand and One Nights."" They should have stolen more from them and it might have been a lot better story.<br/><br/>In the end, there is some entertainment here; the special effects, some of the sets and costuming, Gyllenhaal's acrobatics and Arterton's curves and enchanting smile. But then, the film was based on a video game, most of which are horrible stories anyway, so one shouldn't be surprised at the shortfall.<br/><br/>Finally, I mentioned the general nationalities of the principle players as I was at least a little surprised that no one Middle Eastern seemed to be visible on screen."

","Prince of Persia does a decent job of adapting video game to movie, a task previously known to be extremely difficult (see Doom). Gyllenhaal surprises with a solid acting job. Gemma Arterton dazzles the screen with her looks and performs well alongside the abundantly muscular Gyllenhaal playing the orphan Prince Dastan. Richard Croyle, playing Tus, delivers a striking performance that cuts away from his best known role as Jeff in the British sitcom ""Coupling"". The film doesn't disappoint in bringing plenty of action and parkour-like acrobatics. Don't expect it to win an awards but does entertain for an afternoon. Fans of the game will be pleased with the result of the movie but the large-scale audience will soon lose interest."

","It would be easy for a cynical person to ask why if Hollywood is supposedly not racist and politically correct do they make films like Prince of Persia. The casting of Jake Gyllenhaal as a Persian is definitely not politically correct. It is funny how everyone has brought that up, yet nobody has ever bothered to mention that the image of Jesus (which has been worshipped for 2000 years) is ten fold more racist. Jesus of Nazareth would have been tanned skinned and Dark haired like all Isrealites, not the Caucasian, brown haired fella we know so well. It is a crazy world, and Prince of Persia is a crazy movie, but the summer of 2010 has just begun and as far as blockbusters are concerned, this may be the first good one, (if you don't go for Iron Man 2)<br/><br/>Even though it takes itself seriously, there are times when Prince of Persia can be looked at as partial satire. Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton, make a fun screen couple, and they get to exchange one liners frequently. We also have Alfred Molina, in a scene stealing performance as a kind of 20th century figure in Persian robes. He reminds me of the surf in Monty Python's Holy Grail who tells the king that he did'nt 'vote' for him.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia also reminds me a bit of last month's Clash of the Titans, only less rushed, much looser and more enjoyable. The fight scenes (while they don't offer anything new) are well done, maintaining enough visual coherency and good choreography to deserve some credit. These scenes take up about 70% of screen time. The plot beneath it, is gimmicky but actually a bit more convoluted than I am used to seeing. There are a lot of names and faces to remember for anyone with a short attention span. It turns out not to be such a big deal. The story does, go somewhere, and we the viewers go with it for a fairly engaging two hours. <br/><br/>Prince of Persia, though far from being great like the empire was, proves to be good weekend time investment."

","I'd been hearing about this film for what feels like years, hoping it would be the one of overturn the curse of the video game based movie. With Disney throwing $150 million USD into Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time would seem a contender. For my money Lara Croft: Tomb Raider retains the title with Mortal Kombat being first runner-up.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is based on the popular Prince of Persia video games series with a history that goes back over 2 decades, but more notably it ties in with recent entries. Jake Gyllenhaal stars as Dastan the adopted prince of Persia. After evidence is present of dealing arms with enemies, the Persian army attacks the sacred city responsible. Prince Dastan leads the siege and becomes a hero, but not in the eyes of the conquered Princess Tamina, played by Gemma Arterton. It turns out that the actual cause of the siege was to gain possession of a dagger that grants its wielder the power to travel back in time. Tamina is the guardian of this special item, and she alerts us to this fact by reciting it's instruction manual throughout the movie. Reluctantly Dastan and Tamina team up to expose the truth and protect the dagger.<br/><br/>Without exposing too much, I do like the bad guys's evil scheme at its heart. However, that alone can't save the plot. They try to explain in details the dos and don'ts of how this dagger functions, and it's as confusing as the National Health Care Act. The fundamental problem I see is the user may travel back to a point where he or she isn't even holding it, but it still manages to lose the sand that powers it.<br/><br/>I didn't recognize Alfred Molina at all as Sheik Amar, the only character to attempt to be humorous (very odd for a Disney film). And I don't have any problem with the performances of Gyllenhaal or Arterton as our leads; in fact I like them very much as an on screen couple, but their casting raises eyebrows. Where are the Persians? Ben Kingsley is the only actor in the cast who they tried to make look Persian. For me it's a disconnect.<br/><br/>Everything is thrown at the audience. I couldn't keep it straight, often times questioning what I was looking at, and how the bad guys could have been waiting for Dastan inside a secret passageway he just discovered. The dialogue is dagger this dagger that and anyone can be easily located in the middle of the desert. The latter is a necessary convenience to keep the pace in top form.<br/><br/>Everything wraps up in a way that may not satisfy everyone, but it doesn't completely cheat the audience. I have say though that luck had a big role in determining how this movie ends. The sands of time don't exactly have a graphic user interface, so our Prince of Persia really catches a break.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is directed by Mike Newell, a veteran of the industry with a diverse history. Of his recent work, the most recognizable is Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. But lets be honest, this is a studio film through and through and it's billed as another collaboration between Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time feels very much like an attempt to pass the torch that was lit with Pirates of the Caribbean. The problem is that the story is unnecessarily convoluted, and without a Jack Sparrow role, we find out exactly what Pirates of the Arabian Desert would have been like assuming Will Turner is the clear lead. There's a lot of noise, the visuals are well polished, and the sense of adventure is admirable."

The story in the game was so clever and well written the film should have used it more instead of coming up with its own terrible story, even more disappointing seeing the man behind the screen story was the very man who wrote the game.

"jboothmillard","5","1","4","10 August 2013"," Prince of Persia: the Sands of Time
","I knew this film was made by Disney studios, but I had perhaps forgotten that the film was based on a popular video games series, but I was always willing to try this film because of the concept and cast, from director Mike Newell (Four Weddings and a Funeral, Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire). Basically, in the land of Persia, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was adopted from the streets by King Sharaman (Ronald Pickup) after displaying great resilience as a young boy, and he has become a prince, a mighty warrior, and potential heir to the throne. While his stepbrothers Garsiv (Toby Kebbell) and Tus (Richard Coyle) plan strategies of battle, the Holy City of Alamut has been supplying enemies of the kingdom with weapons, according to a spy, so the sacred city faces attack on the order of Tus. Upon the city falling Dastan meets beautiful Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), she joins him to become part of the kingdom, but King Sharaman is murdered in mysterious circumstances, and the adopted prince is accused of the crime, so he flees to avoid capture and false punishment. He is determined to somehow prove his innocence, and he discovers from Tamina of the existence of a powerful device on the handle of a magic dagger, the sands inside it have the ability to transport a person back in time to change events before they happen. With this power Dastan sets on the journey to clear his name and bring justice to the true villain of the piece, he eventually reaches his closer brother Gastiv and makes him believe he is innocent, the corrupt uncle Nizam (Sir Ben Kingsley) is the true villain, and in the end he is defeated, Persia returns to normal, and Dastan and Tamina who have fallen in love happily marry. Also starring Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, Reece Ritchie as Bis, Gísli Örn Garðarsson as Hassansin Leader and Steve Toussaint as Seso. Gyllenhaal is alright being heroic with an English accent, Arterton looks gorgeous in her gowns but is also feisty, and Kingsley isn't on much and is a bit pantomime villain, it is a little long, and the story is a little over thought that you can't concentrate sometimes, but the special effects, fights and set pieces are good enough to keep you going with it, an alright fantasy action adventure. Worth watching!"
"rfbeaver93","8","1","4","7 June 2010"," Sands of Time strikes a high note!
","Before I went to go see this film I was disappointed seeing a lot of negative reviews from professional critics. It scared me just for the fact that I was hoping for a good video game to movie. Well I ignored them and went and saw it...my god they were completely wrong...<br/><br/>Before I go into the review I would like to point out some things: 1. On average from the critics I have seen them complain about this movie being historicaly inaccurate. Really? you are going to nit pick that much? It was not intended for being a history lesson. ITS FICTION! Who really cares? I didn't, and even the video game was not intended for being a history lesson. So stop your complaining! 2. This is by far the best video game to movie I have seen ever put on the big screen. Let me tell you why... First off is the characters- Lets start off with Dastan(Jake Gyllenhaal). Out of all the actors in the world to pick for Dastan the prince, he was to me the very best pick. He didn't just look the part, but he was the part!(with alittle help from the script but Ill get to that later). Just the way he portrayed the prince made me really happy. He felt exaclty like the one from the video game. He was arrogant, but in a smart way. Never going too over the top with one-liners but when he said them they were witty. Although, some of them were at random when he said them to the princess, but its not exactly his fault. Next is princess Tamina(Gemma Arterton) Why what a quite interesting character. She was smart, also very cocky and arrogant like Dastan. The way there relationship went through out the movie was genius! They just had good chemistry, though it seemed like they did not get enough time to really get into it. The relationship between Dastan and Tamina was sorta rushed, thus not taking full potential of it. But the way she changed over the movie was good, she starts off disliking Dastan for just one reason really. He was a Persian who attacked there city. But as the movie progressed and Dastan learned of what was really going on they both changed. Making there characters completely opposite of what they were at the beginning. My only complaint with Tamina was that she fell into the category of ""damsel in distress"". Which is not that bad, but in the game she fought along side of the prince instead of waiting for him to do everything. The next character is Nizam(Ben Kingsley). He is the evil guy or the antagonist. I don't have much to say about him. Just a predictable villain wanting the royal chair. Kingsley was not amazing but he was not bad.<br/><br/>Moving on to plot: Ahh the juice of the movie. The plot. I just want to go on and thank director Mike Newell and producer Jerry Bruckheimer for taking this movie in a very serious matter. When I first saw the trailer I had the intention of thinking it was going to be like Pirates of The Caribbean. What I mean by that is more jokes, less serious attitude. But boy was I wrong. They did it serious and there was not as much jokes as I thought there was going to be. and to there credit most of them were well placed and funny. The plot is pretty much the plot to Prince of Persia: Sands of Time(video game). but the thing is they added different things to it to make it not an exact copy of the games plot. I don't want to spill the beans on the plot but its not as predictable unless you have played the game...Well OK I will spoil one thing about the movie, and that is the Hassassins. Oh babogies these guys rocked!!! They were swift cold-blooded assassins out to kill Dastan and Tamina. They also reminded me of Assassins Creed by the way they killed, except when they used the sand vipers. In all the plot was well written, action packed, and very different from your average action/adventure flick.<br/><br/>Next is a subcategory: The action- This was the one thing that really got my attention and liking the film. The action was nicely crafted and very acrobatic. Not much CG was used(thank god! I have seen enough of that CG crap from Avatar -.-)Well yes there was CG in the movie but not even that much. Most of it was stunt acting. The thing that stole the show though was the parkor scenes. Parkor is the stlye of fighting that the prince used in the game like wall climbing, wall running, swinging from polls etc. But while that was the highlight of the movie, it disappointed me to see that they under used the parkor.But in the scenes that it was in, it was awesome!! Lastly is the tone and attitude and look of the movie: This movie was gorgeous, the bright and huge city of Persia looked oh-so-real and the desert was and mountains looked great! The attitude was again very serious which just so happens to play to the movies advantage. Not many jokes the fights were brutal. the movie was also not afraid of killing people and showing it. which I liked a lot! The costumes looked believable and all and all it just looked great!(thank you again Jerry Bruckheimer!) To conclude, Prince of Persia is what a video game movie SHOULD BE LIKE! It was very serious the acting was superb and the fight scenes were great! My biggest complaint was less parkor and more traveling. I would definitely check this movie out. Fans will love it too! 8/10"

","This is a good movie. You have to see it all and know about the game to better understand the movie but still good. I knew about the game and the idea behind it prior to watching the movie however my wife did not and she still enjoyed it. The acting is not top notch. Ben Kingsley is a fine actor but he doesn't do many movies and often the lesser known movies but he does nicely here. I know critics were not happy with the choice of Jake as he is not Persian but he does fine. Gemma Arterton is supposed to be some drop dead gorgeous woman well I've never felt this way but for once she lives up to the title. The action scenes are fast and maybe too fast. I've notice in recent years that action scenes are all going the same route: make the action so fast that it's blurry at times and hard to follow whose who. Good fight scenes and acrobatics through out. I would recommend watching the movie."

","This film is about a Persian boy who becomes a prince in the most unlikely way, and his epic adventure to save the world from a mysterious dagger that unleashes the wrath of Gods.<br/><br/>""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" has a great story that makes sense. There is a lot of action, in fact it is so action and adventure packed that sometimes I wish they would slow down and put some quieter scenes in between the action.<br/><br/>I also liked the bond between brothers theme getting highlighted many times. It subtly instills family values, and enhances emotional bond for the viewers. One minor drawback of the film though, is that Gemma Arterton does not appear enchanting or noble enough for her role. She just does not look convincing as a princess who just lost her empire.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" is adequate entertainment for an evening."
"faisal_khatib","6","1","4","29 May 2010"," What really make this movie stand out are the stunning visuals.
","As a kid, I remember playing the original Prince of Persia game in the early 90's. I never got around playing the other versions because by the time the new ones were released, I had stopped playing games due to having a poorly built computer.<br/><br/>When I saw the movie trailer for the first time, I thought the lead actor Jake Gyllenhaal (who plays Prince Dastan) looked gay. I don't know how the character had developed over the years in the game but this is not how I wanted the character to look like and I decided I didn't want to watch the movie anymore. But then I got passes to the press screening and I couldn't say no to this opportunity. Went there with minimal expectations and in all honestly, I enjoyed it in parts.<br/><br/>The story revolves around Prince Dastan who was adopted as a kid from the streets by King Sharaman (played by Ronald Pickup) of Persia and Princess Tamina (played by Gemma Arterton) of the Holy City of Alamut, who are trying to keep an ancient dagger away from the dark side who might abuse its capabilities of releasing the Sands of Time which basically means you can reverse time and allow its possessor to alter the past as per his/her wish.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal surprised me. I loved the parkour based action scenes that were executed to perfection and his acting overall was quite impressive for a game based action hero. Gemma Arterton in simple words was not as beautiful as she was made to be and her acting was dismal in places. The chemistry between them was about average while the short romantic scenes between them where they almost kissed were pointless and slowed the pace of the movie.<br/><br/>The dark side is the evil uncle (how cliché) Nizam (played by Ben Kingsley) and the Hassansins. Ben Kingsley looked out of place and he was a shadow of the villain he could have been as I felt his character was poorly written giving him very little to work with. The Hassansins lead by their snake charmer pale looking leader (played by Gísli Örn Garðarsson) looked promising but a few of their scenes looked like a cheap rip-off of the Nazgul scenes from The Lord of the Rings which was kind of annoying. The Hassasins could have been given a better role but they just end up looking like a bunch of goons.<br/><br/>The support cast was a mixed bag. Sheik Amar (played by Alfred Molina) was a delight to watch with good comic timing and his acting does stand out from the rest. He was supported adequately by Seso (played by Steve Toussaint) who was the typical African dude who could kill you with his eyes closed but has a heart and conscious. Then we had two brothers; Prince Garsiv (played by Toby Kebbell) and Prince Tus (played by Richard Coyle) who were like 3 year old kids with no brains of their own being manipulated by the other characters..<br/><br/>In the end, what really make this movie stand out are the stunning visuals. The world that unravels in front of us through graphics and well made sets is brilliant. The cinematography was top notch in every sense i.e. from the beautiful desert landscapes to the magnificent cities created. The story overall was also well laid out but some things could have been avoided to make the movie shorter (movie runtime: 116mins). As I said at the beginning of this review, I liked the movie in parts."

","I went to see this film (based on a popular XBox game), and I thought it was AWESOME! Though admittedly I never played the game. I am no good at XBox games, but that's OK.<br/><br/>The film is about Dastan, adopted prince of Persia, whom (after conquering the holy city of Alamut) was framed for the king's murder by a poisoned robe. Alamut's Princess Tamina helped Dastan escape from the soldiers. Of course, she didn't care about him, she wanted the dagger he stole during the attack. It is not an ordinary dagger. It is a dagger that when you press the jewel on the hilt, controls the flow of time! Dastan found out the dagger's power after a ""slight skirmish"" from Tamina. After some thinking, Dastan knew that the murder had to be his brother Tus, who wanted to be king and the dagger. Thus becoming the most powerful ruler of Persia. And with a little cooperation, Dastan and Tamina decide to work together to clear his name and keep the Dagger of Time safe.<br/><br/>So anyway, I really love this film."

","This is a half of a beat off from beginning to end. The timing is off, but so is the cadence, the pace, and the plot. It feels behind itself by a half of a step throughout.<br/><br/>Based on a video game, sometimes it is difficult to ink a believable storyline from the mindless game play, which seems to be one of the more serious issues herein.<br/><br/>While Jake Gyllenhaal is made to closely resemble the game character he attempts to portray, he seems wholly out of place in his environ. Actually, I could not imagine where this interpretation of the character would belong. He is obviously not of Persian blood or descent, but moreover, his (clearly) Roman features stand out even more once he dons longer hair and infinite profile (and 2/3 and 3/4 profile) shots.<br/><br/>The main problem I have with this film, I think, is Jake Gyllenhaal's presence as the lead character. I like his acting, and have no problem with him in general, but he was clearly not the one for this part.<br/><br/>All in all?

","To those who complained that PoP wasn't very good, I have to ask -- what movie did you see, and what were you expecting? It's a Bruckheimer production, so one could reasonably expect lots of action, a true blue hero or two, some twists and turns that you may or may not see coming, and in general a rollicking good time. You are NOT going to get Shakespeare! The previews, which were all I had to go on as I know nothing about the video game, promised PoP be a fun two hours of escapism. It promised, and as far as this reviewer is concerned, it delivered admirably on that promise. (Please note -- there may be spoilers from this point on) It gave me a stalwart hero and a lovely heroine, played believably and with good chemistry by Mr. Gyllenhaal and Ms. Arterton. Jake was very impressive with all the physicality of the role (yes, I know wires were involved, but ask any stunt person how tough those can be to work with), and shows his usual excellent range of emotion, going from grinning wisecracks to tongue-tied stammering to broken hearted bereavement without batting an eye. Comic relief came from the ever wonderful Alfred Molina (watch out for those ostriches ...) Sir Ben Kingsley was an excellent choice for the prince who may not be what he seems, and a delightful surprise for me was finding Richard Coyle (Jeff from Coupling, John Ridd from Lorna Doone) in the role of the crown prince, who also may not be quite what he seems. The plot moves along at a decent pace, and my only quibble is that we've seen it before in various forms. This is the only reason I knock off a point. I had a good time, I'd gladly see it again and will be recommending it to my friends -- I can't say that about too many of the 'better' films I've seen lately.

Some may pass the movie off as another CGI drivel, but I say that the CGI effects proved beneficial in keeping the story going. <br/><br/>As the story goes, it's all about a rogue prince (Jake Gyllenhaal) who is framed for the murder of his adoptive father. With the help of a princess (Gemma Arterton) and a mystical dagger that can turn back time, he must right a few wrongs that have been put onto him.<br/><br/>What I have to say about this video game-based movie is that it could have been slightly improved in terms of character development and that the movie should have been a little longer in terms of adding a little more detail of each essential character and setting. The film doesn't necessarily need to borrow every element of the original video game, what really matters is how well those elements can be interpreted in the form of film.<br/><br/>I may have never played the video games, but I must say actor Jake Gyllenhaal's portrayal of Prince Dastan is starting to follow in the same steps (i.e. an adventurous persona with a hint of comedic moments) as what Johnny Depp did as Captain Jack Sparrow and Tobey Maguire for Spider-Man. If you're into action-adventure, here's a film that's NO exception."

True in the case of this year's Hot Tub Time Machine and less so but still mindless is producer Jerry Bruckheimer's Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time. Medieval Prince Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) and a Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) team up to return sand to the handle of a magic knife that will save the world.<br/><br/>You don't need to know more because little else makes sense except the ability of editing to cut so quickly to action that anything can happen as long as someone says it was so; you can't tell from what you see, generally a blur. But then you've seen it all already: Jake mimicking Harrison Ford, Douglas Fairbanks, William Powell, and Errol Flynn with flying leaps and blinding sword play.<br/><br/>The princess is, of course, patterned after Princess Leia, and bad Uncle Nazim by Sir Ben Kingsley, whose role as adviser recommending conquering an innocent kingdom under the ruse that it sells weapons to the Persian's enemies channels very nicely Dick Cheney and his Iraq War supporters.<br/><br/>More than interest in the veiled allusion to the 21st century is the ironic humor, lame as it is, especially between Dastan and Tamina. Somehow Indiana Jones had better lines in his worst films, and these two can't come close to Han Solo and Princess Leia. (For example: Prince Dastan: You really enjoy telling me what to do, don't you? Tamina: Only because you are so good at following orders. Prince Dastan: Don't press your luck.)<br/><br/>My advice for the beginning of summer: Don't take a safari; just order a cool gin and tonic, and if it comes with Prince of Persia or Sex and the City 2, enjoy the sand without heat or wit."

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is another jewel from Jerry Bruckheimer's production company. If you enjoyed Pirates of the Caribbean, National Treasure, Deja Vu, or the rom-com Confessions of a Shopaholic, you'll love this movie. There is enough action in this movie to satisfy the men, and enough romance to satisfy the women. <br/><br/>The characters are unique and lovable. The quirky business entrepreneur, Sheik Almar(Alfred Molina), adds a comedic addition to Price of Persia. When I saw the movie Saturday night, the entire audience burst in laughter at his witty humor. The knife thrower, Seso(Steve Toussaint) is an interesting addition. Dastan's uncle, Nizam (Ben Kingsley) is powerful and intense in the scenes he is in. The back- flipping champion, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), isn't a typical prince. The feisty princess, Tamina (Gemma Arterton), is not what she appears to be.<br/><br/>The plot is simple, but the twists are unexpected. Often I thought something was going to happen, but I was wrong in each case. If you've never played the Prince of Persia games like me, you'll love the unexpected events in this movie.<br/><br/>The sets are delicious eye candy. The buildings of Morocco are intricate, and most extras authentic to the region. The animals, flying knives, and objects in the film looked real. Although I knew there were special effects for safety reasons, but I could not tell the difference. Hundreds, if not a thousand, people worked on the special and visual effects.<br/><br/>The action, editing, and camera-work was fast and fantastic. 105 stunt doubles, stunt performers, and coordinators worked on Prince of Persia. There were thousands of different camera shots. Within a single action scene there was a shot on the ground, one above, one on the side, one on the face, all seconds long. Being a novice camera operator, I was in awe. This movie was difficult to create.<br/><br/>There are few cons to Prince of Persia. The plot is simple, but it is entertaining. Not all was authentic, but it is not a documentary. I suggest you add it to your list of movies to watch, as it is well-made and the actors are brilliant. You'll be on the edge of your seat."

The actors were great, I especially liked Ben Kingsley as the Evil uncle and Alfred Molina as the ""Ostrich racing"" entrepreneur Jake Gyllenhaal was perfectly cast as the prince. (especially in the way he looked, which was close to the look of the prince in the latest prince of Persia games.) and Gemma Aterton was good. (She has a natural beauty.) if there was anything I could say that may have been wrong with the production it would be that they tended to have more British accents in there than Persian. apart from that I would definitely recommend it for those who loved the game."

"darth-tobe","5","0","2","19 November 2016"," Generic fantasy film seen through the ""popular game franchise""-glasses
","I had such high hopes for this film. The computer game it was made after is awesome, so I guess I was expecting something along those lines. But as always films after video games rarely live up to expectations (well, the expectations of gamers anyway). Maybe that is really the problem: you play a game that you really enjoy and you expect the film to be just like that. However, they won't just take story and characters and make them into a film one to one. They want to produce something new. That's how misfortune usually takes its course.<br/><br/>I would even concede that for someone who doesn't know the game this may be a decent film. It has flawless visuals and a high calibre cast. I do strongly disagree with casting Gyllenhaal and Arterton as male and female leads. I know especially Gyllenhaal was a hot name at the time and I know this is common practice in Hollywood - but what would have been wrong with casting young actors from a Middle-Eastern background to be *Persians*?<br/><br/>Casting choice aside there are several things that I miss in the film. These are things that I say in comparison to the game. I do, however, also believe that any viewer (familiar with the game or not) would have benefited from them. The plot is one. In the game the prince feels responsible for unleashing the power of the Sands of Time and he sets about fixing things. In the movie we also get a generic ""usurper to the throne"" plot line - or was that a hint at the plot of the original Prince of Persia? Next up are the stunts. Why did the sleek parcours style moves from the game not feature much more prominently in the film? The only hint at them is at the very beginning but they are not seen again. That would have made for some epic fights! What else? What about the eerie time monsters that made the game memorable? Were they considered too scary for the target audience? They were certainly not too scary for teenage gamers. Finally, what happened to the game's strong female lead? She could hold her own and even saved the prince more than once while at the same time becoming his love interest part of his motivation to succeed. The relationship felt equal with some funny banter between them. Pretty as Arterton is I don't remember that kind chemistry in the film.<br/><br/>So, if seen as an independent film Prince of Persia is probably an only slightly generic and entertaining enough fantasy epic. But then why even name it after the game if the ties are loose at best? I know the answer, of course: hot, young actors + popular game franchise = $$$."

Ben Kingsley, Richard Coyle, Toby Kebbell, Alfred Molina and Steve Toussaint have supporting roles.<br/><br/>Based on the video game, this was supposed to be the start of a franchise in the mold of the Pirates of the Caribbean flicks, but it was not to be due to disappointing box office results. The first 45-50 minutes are great, reminiscent of the various Sinbad movies but with no-seafaring, way more action and all-around superior production values. It's like the Conan the Barbarian films, but less dour and brooding; sorta akin to ""The Mummy"" (1999) and ""The Mummy Returns"" (2001). <br/><br/>Like my title blurb says, ""Prince of Persia"" is spectacular as far as production quality goes, but after the first 50 minutes it goes downhill with a needlessly convoluted plot and one action scene after another. There are a lot of amusing and 'exciting' things going on, but the story fails to hook; everything morphs into a tedious blur.

","The story reminds me something about Aladdin, Paulo Coelho's ""The Alchemist"", Alibaba or anything that has something to do with Arabia. Probably because the movie has something to do with sand, lots of sand. We have sand in an hourglass, and literally, those are the ""sands of time"". In this movie, arguably, the source of the conflict is the mysterious dagger in which the fate of the whole human race depends. If this falls into the wrong hands, disaster for the whole world is imminent. The dagger has something to do with the so-called ""sands of time"", which in turn, has something to do with time travel. However, this time travel is only towards the past, towards the very beginning of an ancient legend involving the wrath of the gods against the human race. It's an interesting legend. And for most children, this story will be enjoyable as a bed-time story from Persia. This is not the most interesting part of the movie though because there is a more compelling story about trust and betrayal, told through the household of the Persian royalty. There is really nothing special about the movie, but it has a story that was entertainingly told under the twist of an ancient legend. If you like adventures set in the desert involving interesting characters and funny encounters, then this film serves as an entertaining popcorn flick."

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time (2010): Dir: Mike Newell / Cast: Jake Gyllenhaal, Gemma Arterton, Ben Kingsley, Alfred Molina, Toby Kebbell: Entertaining video game based movie about progression. Jake Gyllenhaal plays the King's adopted son whom is framed for his murder. He is on the run to clear his name and accompanied by a Princess whom was taken from a kingdom for which they invaded for weapons. He possesses a magical dagger that can turn back time. Director Mike Newell is backed with impressive sets and visuals that are a delight to the eye. He previously made such superb entertainment as Pushing Tin and Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. This is no Harry Potter but it combines elements that worked for that franchise. Gyllenhaal brings a slight comic edge to the determined warrior who learns that many people he thought he knew, are concealing other motives. Gemma Arterton plays the Princess who is captured but will also become a fugitive. They bicker but viewers know how this will turn out. Ben Kingsley plays the villain whom frames him. He has known the Prince since his childhood but now alternate motives become clear. Alfred Molina steals scenes as an outcast whom arranges illegal ostrich races. Upon his introduction he comes off as ruthless but in reality he is peaceful. Unfortunately he kind of fades within the concluding battle as the climax gives way to standard action clichés. Ending makes little sense with its time changing but film is visually stunning and should pass the sands of time in entertaining its target audience. Score: 6 / 10"

","Video games being adapted to films have a short and ignoble history. The Lara Croft films managed to have some degree of box office success and mild critical acclaim.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia underperformed at the US box office and got mixed reviews. In a sense the film is rather mixed. Mike Newell who directed one of the Harry Potter films and has previously specialised in some small scale films is a steady hand but even a skilled director such as him can do little with a dodgy script.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays a street urchin Dastan adopted by the King Of Persia. He is treated like one of the family and another brother to two of the King's sons. Ben Kingsley plays Nizam the King's brother and family adviser.<br/><br/>However before you can say the Lion King the sons of Persia invades a holy city in the pretext that they supply arms to their enemies but before long the King is murdered, Dastan gets the blame and it seems the war was just an excuse to get hold of a magical dagger that could turn back time.<br/><br/>The film has plenty of acrobatics and action which ties in nicely with the video game character, some good CGI but Gyllenhaal is not dynamic enough nor has the lightness of touch to make his Prince of Persia appealing. I also felt that there was little chemistry between him and Gemma Arterton or maybe that is the fault of the script as they are always in conflict.<br/><br/>Its a mildly entertaining romp and yet quickly forgettable."

","Super Mario Bros. (1993). Street Fighter (1994). Lara Croft: Tomb Raider (2001). Resident Evil (2002). The list of movies adapted from video games that make you want to tear the skin from your own face goes on and on. Still, without a notable exception to the rule, producers keep greenlighting these films, and stars still line up to appear in them. If any producer was capable of bucking the trend, it's action connoisseur Jerry Bruckheimer, who somehow managed to turn a theme park ride that centred around cinema's most floppable subject (pirates), and turned it into a billion-dollar, Oscar- nominated franchise.<br/><br/>While Prince of Persia underperformed commercially and didn't end up on any critics' annual top 10 lists, it's the best video game adaptation I've seen (although that isn't saying much). The plot centres around prince Dastan (a six-packed Jake Gyllenhaal), who after being plucked from the street as a child after the King (Ronald Pickup) was impressed by his moxie, now fights and laughs alongside his adopted father's blood sons, Tus (Richard Coyle) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell). He is at the front of an attack on Alamut, who Dastan's uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley) has accused of selling weapons to their enemies. After taking the city, he meets the beautiful princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton), but soon finds himself on the run, wrongly accused of his father's murder and in possession of a magic dagger able to control time.<br/><br/>Director Mike Newell is quite the opposite of what you would call an auteur. He's a sort of jack-of-all-trades, directing movies of all genres and of varying quality, from the awful, foppish comedy Four Weddings and a Funeral (1994), to the impressive gangster flick Donnie Brasco (1997), and he even had a dabble in the most successful film series of all time with Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire (2005), one of the best of the franchise. His erratic's rub off on Prince of Persia. Writers Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro and Carlo Bernard are wise enough to deliver an actual story rather than simply trying to replicate the charms of the video game, and the chest-pumping antics of the brothers' strained relationship keep things intriguing enough, even though we're stuck with the drippy (but undeniably sexy) Tamina for the most part.<br/><br/>It suffers when trying to deliver a breakneck, or even fathomable, action scene. Though Gyllenhaal nails the part - he brings a cocky, Errol Flynn-esque charm to the role - his dust-up's are confusing and messy. The sandy streets of Persia and the scorched deserts surrounding it are lavish, and touches of CGI can make the screen light up. It sometimes it achieves this, but overuses it to the point where the visuals become bloated and unreal. I've only seen the game played once or twice, but I could see why the series is so popular, and while the film certainly catches the look of the game and provides a few wink-wink in-jokes for the gamers, it lacks the games breathlessness. Things picks up slightly when comic relief Alfred Molina and his racing ostrich's show up, and it often feels swashbuckling in the old-fashioned sense, but this is formulaic, instantly forgettable stuff.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"

The action is all nicely placed and plotted, but the reliance on mediocre CGI does let it down a few times. The supporting cast are the best of the bunch. Kingsley is both comforting and sinister, Kebbell is hot-headed and angry, Coyle is regal but naive and Molina provides some excellent comic relief. Gyllenhaal and Arterton are both likable and fit for their roles, but without those surrounding them, this would be a bit of boring.

","Having read the generally bad press this film had I was willing to give it a chance. I mean, I like a good swashbuckler of a movie and the cast was certainly a draw. However even two old masters (Kingsley and Molina) and two normally very capable relative newbies (Gyllenhal and Arterton) couldn't save this mess of a film. The plot is thin, hackneyed and boring; the jokes are at best out of place and at worst really unfunny; and the action is far too repetitive – there's only so much jumping across building tops an action movie fan can tolerate these days, even if you are trying to recreate the look of the game on which a film is based.<br/><br/>The most appalling offence, however, is the writing. Why do the makers of these kinds of films (Bruckheimer and Disney both to blame here, I expect) think that the audience are so dense that they have to explain every plot point through the dialogue? Have a bit of respect for the intelligence your customer base. This is relentless in Prince of Persia, from the opening narration to the dialogue throughout. Anyone with any decent story sense knows that the emphasis should be on showing not telling. If we need to know that outcome A won't happen unless character B does thing C then this should come across in the action and through natural dialogue. Don't tell us this as if you're reading from a recipe book for pity's sake! This is film-making by numbers and they should be ashamed. It smacks to me of the filmmakers only having a general plot outline and no script when they got to the production stage. I don't care what the film is, how big a budget and how much or little action it has, this approach to film making (unless you're deliberately setting out to improvise the dialogue) is always the wrong one. The writing has to be the most important part of the pre-production. Get that wrong, be complacent with it or ignore it entirely and the film just won't work. Sort it out and don't inflict this kind of mess on us again."

","Gemma Arteton as the princess Tamina killed the movie, in a horrible way. Every young British actress today feels like she has to shape her acting ability around the acting styles of Kate Winslet, Catherine Zeta Jones and/or Rachel Weisz. Be yourselves people!!!! I cannot stress that enough. I couldn't even buy this girl as the princess because she just looked like she was doing a confused job at aping Rachel Weisz from the Mummy movies, Kate Winslet's Rose Dewitt Bukater with a hint of Catherine Zeta Jones from the Mask of Zorro. It didn't help that the hair and makeup people seemed to share Arteton's dream of wanting to resemble CZJ. That said, I thought Jake Gyllenhaal did a fantastic job as the agile prince Dastan and his British accent was so spot on that I was beginning to think they'd dubbed it. Fortunately enough for Gyllenhaal, he has such good looks that when shown against Arteton, their chemistry just bounces of the screen and adds to their rapport. Alfred Molina is amazing as cunning Sheik Amar as is Sir Ben Kingsley in his villainous uncle Nizam role. I appreciated the nod to the video game from which the film was inspired, especially with the action sequences and scenic adventures. All in all the film is watchable (a one time watch for me because I do not think I could stomache Arteton a second time around) but there have been better films. See 'The Mummy' or even 'The Time Machine' instead."

Soon Dastan is facing dangerous assassins, knife throwers and time itself to set things right.<br/><br/>The movie has a nice emotional impact, particularly when u realize Dastan will do anything to save his family. That scene with his older brother Tus, got some reaction in the theatre, let me tell ya! The action is pretty intense, but I still saw nor heard any reason this couldn't be ""PG"" it's fine for ten and up. A really enjoyable movie that u and your whole family can enjoy again and again.!"

I thought that it had a good story-line and as usual Gyllenhaal delivered a great performance, as did Arterton. I thought that it was going to be typical cheesy adventure, with stupid violence but I was wrong. Overall I would say that Prince of Persia: Sands of Time is a good family film with some good actors.

","Finished watching Prince of Persia - SOT... With much spent on sets, special FX and action sequences, film fails to deliver with wafer thin plot and abrupt ending. Climax with its blatant hole in continuity and obvious contradiction to stated facts makes you wonder if the makers were taking viewers for granted. Action sequences are quick and makers have made the effort to include all in-game moves except that they are too short to notice for someone who has never played POP 3D or later. Coolest moves like wall run are too brief to notice even for an avid gamer. Action sequences are so scripted and predictable that you wonder if you are watching the Persian version of Mortal Kombat. Overall, Disney tried to do in one movie what game makers couldn't do in 8 game versions...complete and finish the story....And Disney failed badly this time...."

","This was a thoroughly entertaining movie with great cinematography. There were no dead spots throughout the entire movie, and the action was just enough without overdoing (which so many movies are guilty of in my opinion).<br/><br/>The characters were well developed, the casting was well done, and the acting was quite good.<br/><br/>The mysticism in the movie played to my sense of wonder, and the movie played well on ancient myths.<br/><br/>Producing a movie that takes us back to a time when Persia was dominant and a huge empire in the middle east during this time of current unrest in the same region was a good reminder of a nobler time.<br/><br/>I will watch it again, and again."

","Gemma Arterton is lovely and Jake Gyllenhaal is loads of fun as the prince. I was left with the impression that the film could have been really excellent, certainly the actors are all superb. I think at the end of the day if anything the film was let down in the direction department - too much going on, too many improbable events leading into each other.<br/><br/>The principle cast is mainly British and so, much to his credit, Jake Gyllenhaal adopted a British accent for his part and made a fine job doing so. There is one point though that has left me absolutely perplexed. Richard Coyle who plays Prince Tus, what was he thinking? On the morning of the invasion of Alemut he remarks about Dastan, 'He's 'gotten' in'. I beg your pardon? There is no such past participle in British English - we would never use that word in a million years. Now why on earth didn't Richard Coyle simply mention that fact to the script writer changing it to something like, 'Dastan has succeeded in entering the city'? There's a second blatant error later on when Dastan says to Tamina, 'You know, you've got quick hands, but so do I'. But so HAVE I not DO I. It's not sufficient to garnish a film with British accents you have to employ British grammar as well otherwise it just sounds stupid. <br/><br/>However, to end on a positive note, the sound-track is superb, the actors are believable and visually the film is stunning. Well worth a view."

Nizam murders the king and frames Dastan for it who escapes with Tamina. Dastan has to clear his name and learns about the dagger its history and his uncles treachery.

","I was all set to see this film at cinemas but many critics said the film was poor but recently I saw this at a friends house and realized this is one of the most Underrated films ever. Prince of Persia The Sands of Time has everything a movie needs Action Romance Comedy and a good plot. Jake Gyellenhaal is great as Prince Dastan a boy who lived on the streets before been adopted by the King, Jake does the action scenes very well and makes Dastan a likable character someone you get to really care about as the film progresses. Gemma Arterton is fantastic as the very beautiful feisty Princess Tamina the guardian of the dagger of time. Jake and Gemma have brilliant chemistry in a relationship that starts off with hatred which turns to friendship and then to love. Sir Ben Kingsly delivers another excellent performance as Nizam the scheming Uncle of Dastan who will do anything to get hold of the dagger. The best performance in the entire film in my opinion falls to Alfred Molina as the scene stealing Shiek Amar, Molina brings all the comedy to the film as the greeding tax evading Shiek who has a love of Ostriches and has Ostrich races hilarious.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this film and don't understand why it got so much criticism. Most of the criticism came from the film differed from the game well I have never played the game so I cannot compare the two but most of my friends who have played it and seen the film tell me it did not change that much. Also the fact that most of the cast were English and American and not Persian bugged them well the cast was perfect in my opinion you have to remember this is a film and wont be perfect but this is very close to it.<br/><br/>I really hope they make a Sequel at the moment the chances of it are slim as the film did not do as well at the Box Office as expected it would be disappointing as the end of the film seemed to hint there was more to come."
"freemantle_uk","7","0","1","1 April 2011"," Pure Summer Blockbuster Action
","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is easily one of the best computer game adaptations made so far, but considering the competition that was not hard: Tomb Raider, Super Mario Brothers, Street Fighter, Mortal Kombat and the continuous works of Uwe Boll to name a few. Uber-producer Jerry Bruckheimer was able to turn a theme park ride into one of the most successful film series in recent years, so a computer should not be that hard.<br/><br/>In the 9th Century, the Persian Empire is one of the mightiest superpowers, spanning from India to Turkey, Egypt and Sudan. Dastan (Jake Gyllenhall) was an orphan who was adopted by the king (Ronald Pickup) and raised as his son with his biological children Tus (Richard Coyle) and Garsiv (Toby Kebbell). Years later the Persian Empire invade the holy city Alamut after receiving intelligence that they were making weapons and selling the Persia's enemies. But after the city is conquered Dastan is framed for assassinating the king and Dastan has to go on the run with the city's ruler Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who wants to kill him. Dastan discovers that the Princess has a knife that could reserve time by a minute and puts two to two together that the real target was the knife. Dastan sets to prove his innocents to the only man he can trust, his uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley).<br/><br/>I have not played the games the film is based on so I can only judge it as a film. It is clear that some elements were taken from the game, with Dastan running on walls and using wooden pillars pointing out the walls. But many computer game films fall because they are either not loyal enough to the games they are based or not having a strong story or even throwing too many elements of the game in the film (Street Fighter was criticised on all three fronts). At least Prince of Persia attempted to tell a story about a Prince proving his innocents and stopping people using a magical item (a simple story but at least it is trying to create a narrative).<br/><br/>The style and tone of the film is very much like Pirates of the Caribbean, a light-hearted big-budget action film. The comedy through the main character is much like Jack Sparrow and it is basically a fast paced action film with many different factions and characters. The casting of Arterton reminded me of the casting of Keira Knightley, an up and coming British actress who is strong and feisty. The Alfred Molina character was there to add comic relief and there are many factors in this world. Some scenes reminded me of other films, like when the princes ask where Dastan is and he is fighting with his men, a little like in Troy where Achilles was sleeping with a woman instead of the battlefield. The battle scenes felt like the film was trying to be like Lord of the Rings and Troy and it was decent. But this is a film that is unlikely to match Lord of the Rings for great fantasy.<br/><br/>The acting was find for the most part, Gyllenhall was able to provide a good English accent and shows he can be an action star. But for a film set in the Middle East Gyllenhall is remarkably pale, which is made even worst when at least the rest cast at least got a tan. But obviously Hollywood believes that people are not ready to have a Arab, Indian or Persian hero in a film and with the state of Islamophobia in the States at the moment it is unlikely to change. Also whilst Gyllenhall is good as a dramatic actor, he does not have the great comic ability Johnny Depp. But the comic material was not as pronounced as in Pirates. Arterton acting was very much like Knightley's in Pirates, posh, stiff and not very good. She has had good rolls but this is not her breakout role. Most of the comedy revolved around Gyllenhall and Arterton, as well as Molina. Kingsley was clearly the antagonist but in movie canon you should never trust a bold man with a beard and never trust a man who has eyeliner.<br/><br/>Mike Newell direction was workmanlike, which does not have to a bad things sometimes. He had experience with fantasy filmmaking, directing Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. Prince of Persia was certainly a fast paced film. The action scenes well handled, but a little too clear considering there were pitch battles in a city. There is a good scene involving a knife throwing fight. The CGI was also of a good level and the usual things like costumes and the scenery was well done. The Middle Eastern style score was also fitting for the film.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia disappointed at the box-office and a big flop in 2010. There is not much likelihood of a sequel being made but the way the film ended meant that everything was rounded up. Overall it is a fun enough film and a 6.7/10 that Prince of Persia currently has is a fair score."

","I was somewhat surprised that Jake Gyllenhaal made a good action here. At least for this film but he had a odd off-putting accent. I have no idea who he thought he was channeling. Gemma Arteton was adequate but just. There really wasn't much of a plot to this film and it basically drifted back and forth between blood and guts and humor. At least what I assume was to pass for humor. Maybe it is just better to stick with some of the old films like The Golden Voyage of Sinbad or The Thief of Bagdad or even The 7th Voyage of Sinbad. For 200,000,000 they don't make them like they used to and for a lot cheaper. But if you are really bored you might find yourself watching this. But why?"
"cherold","5","0","1","10 February 2011"," blandly generic
","I only made it through the first half hour of this tedious action picture, so I can't say whether it picks up later on. But the characters were clichés, the story familiar, the action underwhelming (in spite of a couple of cool stunts).<br/><br/>What this is definitely not is the story from the video game. Those who say this is typical of what happens when you adapt a game don't realize exactly how well the Sands of Time game told its story. The game had a wonderful, Arabian Knights quality and a wonderful ending.<br/><br/>Of course, you can't just take the story from the game and make it into a movie. It's a very slight story filled out with a lot of action and puzzle solving, so the story would certainly have to be expanded. But rather than expanding the story, it was tossed out altogether, with nothing remaining except a few characters and locations and the time rewind gimmick. That in itself wouldn't be so bad if it had been replaced by something moderately interesting and original, but there doesn't seem to have been any good reason to toss out the original story in favor of this one.<br/><br/>I can't say the half hour I spent watching this was agonizing. It was just dull, and felt like it was going to keep on being dull. Maybe I'm wrong, but it just wasn't worth wasting my time to find out."
"garyvanhorn","5","0","1","10 January 2011"," Another failed video game movie.
","Prince of Persia is filled with epic scenery and exciting action sequences, wrapped in a mediocre story and second-rate acting. I'm not really surprised by this, I have yet to see a movie based on a video game that was anything better. Disney was obviously looking for another Pirates of the Caribbean but fell well short.<br/><br/>Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was a poor orphan kid that was adopted by the King of Persia who grew up to become one of three Princes of Persia. Dastan and his brothers are tricked into attacking a holy city so that the villain can take a magical dagger and use it to rewrite history. The dagger has a very video game feel to it, you can use it to go back in time a few moments to correct a mistake, but the supply of sand contained in the hilt of the dagger is limited and it can only be used a few times before it needs to be refilled. After the dagger is discovered the rest of the movie centers around everyone and their brother trying to get it for themselves, with a great deal of clunky dialog explaining the properties of the dagger and the grand master plan of the villain.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time isn't a terrible movie, but it's not that great either. The action and special effects are very well done, but the characters and plot leave something to be desired. The reason Pirates of the Caribbean was such an entertaining film was due almost entirely to the superb cast, thrust into what was essentially a b-movie with expensive special effects to back them up. Prince of Persia has the same b-movie feel to it as well as the expansive effects budget, but without a superior cast to bring the second-rate script to life the movie fails to truly come to life."

Suddenly we end up with Hashshashins/Assassins (renamed to Hassasins in the movie), an order which was established like 1500 years later at around 1100 AD in completely different times. In those days Persia was already Islamic. Islam in the movie? You must be kidding me. Just to spell out all things: Ancient Persian empire ceased to exist with Alexander the Great (Macedonian) 300 BC.<br/><br/>Indeed, Alamut as such existed and was an important Hashshashin fortress at the time mentioned earlier, i.e., 1100 AD.<br/><br/>What is the budget for the movie? 200 millions dollars? I bet a history grad student could put things to their places for an extra couple of thousand dollars.

When I plan to watch a movie, I based on the Ad and a little on others. Hearing reviews based from a past endeavor, won't stop me from viewing it. I admit of doing that myself, but it's a different movie with different people. <br/><br/>I recently just bought the DVD of the movie. And the first night I saw it, I wasn't able to get into it. But the second time I viewed it, I was able to get in to it and who cares if it's inaccurate with time lines. The storyline was well executed and presented. Though at moments, Jake's hair didn't look right. But that's what you get for some close ups. lol. Agreed that it does follow the game to a point, but it wouldn't have worked if they didn't something to work on. It is based on the game. When you have the creator working with you, one can't help it but show some of the games' quirks. The Action is soo fantastic. Watch Jake jumping and flying about, one gets caught up on the action that will fuel the kids to follow. lol. <br/><br/>The Scenery is breath-taking and fresh. Morrocan influences mixed with the Persian history provides us with what could have been the life of the times. The atmosphere placed before us along with the props pull us into the world and makes us a part of the country. Costumes were well done. The flowing of material add to the atmosphere of the cities. <br/><br/>The elements of story and location throw us in to a representational world of the actual time period. There will always be some things that won't be right. It's a movie. Whether it is based on a game or real life, the way it is done is to entertain and/or inform us to what a world has in store.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 10 on a basis of it's own merits. Story, location and direction are looked at and thought about. If I'm pulled in by all these elements, I will like the movie. But giving it a rating will not influence everyone into seeing or not seeing it."

","This movie though had a very prominent production house and very big advantage of being out from a popular video series which had captivated so many minds and thoughts, did not seem to have done any justice to whatever it had hold as a credit. I had a bit of real good expectation that this movie could be another adventurous story where you could see a lot and which might prove to be an experience. However, I found that kind of sense being supported by any of the elements in the movie. The story was ordinary and with full void of any twists and turns, so hardly could I feel any being-caught-in-the-movie factor. However, I should accept the fact that the movie could have been a different experience altogether, had I not really expected much out of it. Though, a bit disappointed I might be, but I would recommend all out there giving a chance to this movie without expecting much. Without expectation, the movie might just come in flying colours."

","Ya know it's a little confusing with the Prince of Persia franchise. Well here's the timeline of the franchise.

Now in 2010 the new movie has come out. Now they took the poster of the movie and made it the cover for the new prince of Persia video game. So it's a little confusing. Now heres my review of the movie, Jake Gyllenhaal has made another great performance but it isn't as great as ""Jarhead"" or ""Brothers"". I was very skeptical of this movie because many video game movies are very bad. Like the ""teenage mutant ninja turtles"" movie, that was the worst, but this movie was good for a video game movie. Although the princess in the movie (Gemma Arterton) was not great in this movie, I think hey could have picked a better actress.

Spies tell the princes that Alamut is producing weapons for Persia's enemies, and the princes decide to attack.

Something seems amiss, and when the king is assassinated and Dastan set up as the murderer, he must flee and find what secrets lie behind the walls of Alamut.<br/><br/>Comments: Based more or less on the computer game with the same title, this is an action adventure set in the legends. As such, I almost instantly and automatically, likes it. But with that also comes high expectations, and Prince of Persia doesn't quite live up to my hopes. For example the filmmakers seem to have decided to include a little too much from the games, which means a lot of jumping, climbing and balancing on perches. While that can be quite thrilling it can also become boring and repetitive if used again and again in the movie.<br/><br/>Also, while I like both Gemma and Jake, they don't seem to have any special chemistry between them, and quite a lot actually depends on the attraction between them. It is what should bind the action together to a whole, and it does not. Now it seemed like a string of action scenes, one after another.

He truly makes you want to hate him as every good villain does. Alfred Molina makes a good cameo as a shady but good hearted ostrich racer.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is a very good movie. It has a very compelling storyline. The story's main theme is the importance of family especially brotherhood. The central focus of the film is the bond between Dustan and his brothers. It showcases their differences but it also demonstrates how in spite of their differences that the bond among brothers is the greatest treasure and the real strength of the kingdom. It also tells how that you don't have to born into a family to become a family. A very important message that is very universal.<br/><br/>The cinematography is very well done. It is one of the best parts of Prince of Persia. The landscape scenes are bold and well shot. They camera really draws you into the land of Persia, you almost feel as though you are right there.

","We are talking about a Disney movie made after a 2D platform running video game that I used to play when I was a kid and starring Jake Gyllenhaal, so I started up with very low expectations. I did expect, though, great special effects and the usual wall spikes and some ridiculous story.<br/><br/>Well, I am glad to say that there were no wall spikes, the story actually made sense and the actor play redeemed any kitschy background music or the silly ""wise"" text appearing at the start and end of the movie. The effects were not so prevalent, instead the focus being on the acrobatics of the main character, a true free-running extravaganza.<br/><br/>So, my bottom line is that is one of those easy to watch movies which you can have fun following, but a lot better than the vast majority of the movies in this category. It is a bit too soft, but then again, it is a Disney movie. All actors played well and they were clearly happy doing the movie, which is rare for such block buster franchises. The acting and physical performance took precedence over special effects. I liked that."

","I understand that this movie is based on (or inspired by) the video game of the same name. I am not familiar with the video game so I take the movie on its own merits.<br/><br/>The story is set in the 4th or 5th century, according to the producers, when Persia stretched from the Mediterranian Sea to the Steppe of China. Today relatively small Iran is a remnant of Persia. <br/><br/>However the movie was filmed in French Morroco and on very large sets inside the sound stages of Pinewood studios, with features faithfully reproduced to match the exterior scenes in Morocco.<br/><br/>The King of Persia is a wise king, with two young sons. But one day in a crowded marketplace witnesses a small boy, an orphan of about 10, come to the aid of another young boy by throwing an apple at the aggressive soldier, and running to safety. Impressed, the King adopts the young boy, Dastan, who grows up as one of his sons, a Prince of Persia.<br/><br/>Cut to 15 years later and Jake Gyllenhaal is Dastan. When they raid a walled city, suspected of making knives for the enemies of Persia, Dastan is the hero, and he is attracted to the Princess, Gemma Arterton as Tamina. Ben Kingsley is Nizam, the brother of the King, and the one who reported the weapons suspicion.<br/><br/>The ""Sands of Time"" part of the title refers to a special dagger, with a special ""sand of time"" in its handle, and when the ruby on the butt of the knife is pressed, it can reverse time for a short period. With unlimited sand, it could reverse time for an unlimited period, and this become the central theme of the entire story.<br/><br/>Dastan finds himself in trouble, and must flee. One place he goes he meets Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, who among other things is a promoter of Ostrich races. (Real jockeys were hired to ride the Ostriches, and the DVD extras has funny scenes of them falling off.) When Dastan has to release all the Ostriches as diversion, when he later encounters Amar, with only one Ostrich left, he is told, ""You can't organize an Ostrich race with just one Ostrich!""<br/><br/>Overall I enjoyed this movie very much. There are a number of interesting situations that are handled well and Gyllenhaal turns out to be quite good as an action hero. <br/><br/>SPOILERS: It turns out that Nizam, who appears to be loyal, has actually been envious of his brother. His report of weapons was false, a ruse to allow him to steal the dagger, to turn back time so that his brother would die, none of the sons would be born, and Nizam would have been the King. But Dastan finally figures it all out and makes things right in the inventive and exciting last scenes. Then he turns back time to when they raided the walled city and instead of defeating the inhabitants, he made everyone aware of Nizam's lie and prevented the battle. His brother, killed in a fight, no longer was dead. And Dastan gets the Princess."

Besides the fact it has a less than subtle political metaphor - a war started on the premise of weapons that didn't exist. Was Ben Kingsley playing Ancient Dick Cheney? On top of that, it didn't make any sense. If the master plan was to get the dagger to plunge into the sands of time, why go through this whole rigamaroll of killing the king if your plan was to go back in time and kill him anyway? Why not just get the Hassansins to steal the dagger for you, and then infiltrate the city yourself when no one was watching. Why do a war and a whole complicated kill the king and frame his son who happens to have the one thing you need to make your plot work?"

","Another loud, brainless CGI summer flick to dull the senses. I realize that people want to shut off their brains during the summer holidays, but this is ridiculous. The fact that Jake Gyllenhal was cast as a 'Persion Prince' makes it obvious from the beginning, that this is nothing to be taken seriously. In fact, ALL the leads were white, in this very Arabic tale. I wonder why.. Strangely enough the the extras standing in the background all looked very Arabic/middle Eastern. They were being used as props it would seem. Anyone who doesn't feel like their intelligence is being insulted needs to pay a bit more attention. The story itself is lame and mind-numbingly repetitive, kind of like a video game. Oh yeah, this WAS based on a video game... and it shows; The whole film deals with people stealing a magical dagger from the other side, just to have it taken back again. The corrupt royal family steals the dagger from the Rogue (White) Prince, who looks like a surfer who wandered onto the set of ""The Arabian Nights."" Gyllenhal gets angry and he and his Princess, who looks a bit like Xena Warrior Princess, (really mid eastern looking too, huh.. especially with her freckles) take the dagger back. They exchange some witty (by idiot standards) banter before they are set upon again by the evil royals. The whole film goes on like this, and it is as enjoyable as watching someone else play a video game. I find it amazing that the same people who criticized ""The Last Airbender"" actually like this tripe; 'Airbender' looks like ""Lawrence of Arabia"" compared to this; it is a much better film, actually. The most unfortunate thing about ""Prince of Persia"" is that it had real potential. The score was quite beautiful, and the costumes and set design were very good, (although not as great as ""The Last Airbender."" It seems Disney was afraid that if they cast real Middle Eastern types for the leads then this thing would not have had success. The sad thing is, they might be right. And the film could not be more inaccurate, historically; people swilling wine while two feet away women are wearing veils. Is this before the existence of Islam, or after? How come some women (in the background of course) must wear veils, while other women can walk around half naked, looking like Las Vegas showgirls? In the 30's and 40's, Hollywood would paint white people's skin, to pass them off as Asian, or Negro. It is sad that we haven't come very far, 80 years later. Maybe Hollywood doesn't realize that Asian actors do exist; they aren't all working in kitchen's or dealing drugs. But if you go into this noisy, tacky film, with the knowledge that it is based on a video game, then you shouldn't be too disappointed. set your standards low, just be glad that it isn't in 3-D."

For someone like me, who grew up playing Prince of Persia, the integration of the jump & run game play in the movie is an absolute highlight. All in all it's a solid, flawless movie with great acting performances. Just don't take it too seriously, it's not meant to be a historical documentary, nor a realistic epic movie. Historical accuracy is not given, naming some of the inconsistencies with actual history: -The time in which the movie takes place has to be around 350 BC, considering the facts that the map in the movie shows an extend of ""Persia"" that roughly applies only to the immediate pre-Alexander period; as well the mentioning of ""gods"" and not ""god"" shows, that it can neither be the Sassanid Empire nor the Caliphate, as both were monotheistic.<br/><br/>-The Hassansin (or correctly Hashshashin): Existed from 1100-1300 AD<br/><br/>-Alamut: Wasn't build till 840 AD<br/><br/>-Greek fire: The only plausible explanation for the hand grenades the assassins used; invented 670 AD<br/><br/>-Mughal Empire (Where the fat guy eating walnuts was from): Not established until the 16th century.

The one thing about this movie though is that it's clear why Disney produced it. Some of the characters are really cheesy like Sheik Amar. There was also a good bit of cheesy dialogue. As I said though, this is a Disney movie which should appeal to a younger audience and in that sense it accomplishes it well.

"gradyharp","8","0","1","16 September 2010"," Video Games as Films? The concept sets a low standard
","Video games. Since when did the art of film neglect fine screenplays, theatrical works, novels, and short stories as resources for cinema and settle for making kids' games movie material? It makes a statement about priorities, right? But given the fact that pure video game entertainment is that important (having never played, this viewer is at a disadvantage), PRINCE OF PERSIA is a surprisingly sound film produced with extravagance and vigor and a wealth of CGI effects, and whatever happens with the little machine held gismo for the video game manipulation to make the experience exciting, that experience has been very well transformed by writers Boaz Yakin, Doug Miro, Carlo Bernard, and game inventor/screen story creator Jordan Mechner. Disney joins Jerry Bruckheimer (with the fine help of director Mike Newell) in creating what should have been a resounding success at the box office extravaganza. But alas, this one fizzled. Why that happened is not apparent from the DVD. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal hits that happy medium as a daredevil Prince Dastan with just the right dose of derring-do stunts, charisma, and finely tuned comedy timing: he makes a great hero on screen, but the costumers should have allowed him to feature his well-developed physique he worked on for this role. But he makes the little orphan boy turned royal family believable and lovable. His adopted father, the king of Persia (Ronald Pickup), his 'brothers' (Toby Kebbell and Richard Coyle), his sidekick Bis (Reece Ritchie - keep an eye on this actor), and his evil uncle (Ben Kingsley) all contribute solid roles with quite a bit of philosophy about family ties and loyalty. The key to the story is the siege of a borderline rival kingdom ruled by the smart and sassy Rachel Weisz-type Tamina (Gemma Arterton) who guards the dagger that has the ability to manipulate time. Throw in a group of evil Hassasins (like that play on terms?) lead by Gísli Örn Garðarsson, some nearly unconquerable situations such as the world becoming a quicksand disaster, some wildly hilarious comedy (on the dark side) by tax evader Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina), and some changes that the time manipulating dagger can effect and the story spins to a conclusion. This viewer would be ready for a sequel, so entertaining is this diversion of a film, but the apparent box office failure of expectations make that an outside possibility. <br/><br/>Though it is always difficult to tell where a Director of Photography and the CGI engineers meet, John Seale does provide some gorgeous desert effects. The music by Henry Gregson- Williams is appropriate if forgettable. Coming away from the DVD experience leaves this viewer even more impressed with the spectrum of acting skills of Jake Gyllenhaal. And that is really enough. The script makes some strange errors - beginning the film with statements as to how Persia was a vast country that covered the entire Middle East, and then throwing in references in the dialogue to Iraq, Turkey and other countries that makes the research sound shaky at best. It is a great popcorn movie - if popcorn at home weren't such a dietary no-no. <br/><br/>Grady Harp"

","I really enjoyed this movie. It is so very unique and the story is intriguing. The script is original and the humor kept the theater chuckling. The fight scenes in this movie are now by far some of my favorites and there are plenty of times when you feel your heart pumping. I thought the acting by Gemma Arterton was absolutely brilliant and while I tend to not like Jake Gylenhaal, I have to admit he did a stellar job as Prince Dastan and REALLY added a very real and personable action hero. The scenery was beautiful, the attention to detail refreshing, and the specially effects blended wonderfully. I will most definitely buy this movie when it comes out in Blu-ray. While many have criticized this movie for having a poor story line I could not disagree more. The producers took a video game and added suspense, action, intrigue, story twists, and a wonderful script and characters. It was soooooo nice to not have to roll my eyes at a cheesy punch line or attempt of a romantic moment. I am sooo exceedingly tired of the typical one night stance romance and while the love in Prince of Persia is not necessarily unique, it is done extremely well. I cannot say more without adding spoilers, but I think that the story (unlike many, many movies coming out) is NOT predictable and it kept me holding my breath. In my opinion, this movie is extremely under rated and I wish that others would give the producers, directors, and actors the pat on the back they so richly deserve."

","The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time<br/><br/>When Iran inspires a video game it's assumed that its genre is some type of FPS (First-Person Stoning). <br/><br/>Fortunately, this movie based on a game set in the former Persia doesn't involve any barbaric form of capital punishment.<br/><br/>After leading a raid on Alamut, Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), the adopted son of the king, obtains a magical dagger belonging to Alamut's princess (Gemma Arterton). <br/><br/>The victory, however, is short lived, when Dastan hands his father a poisoned robe and is accused of regicide.

","""But perhaps there was something else at work that day, something beyond simple understanding. The day a boy from the unlikeliest of places became a prince of Persia.""<br/><br/>When a video game movie meets a big summer event movie, it's not unreasonable to expect a disaster to result. Prince of Persia isn't a disaster, thankfully, but it also doesn't go beyond disposable entertainment. <br/><br/>I won't go much into the plot, because there's not much of a plot to go into. Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal) was a lowly street urchin who was adopted into the royal family of Persia as a child after performing a heroic deed before the king. After he's framed for the death of his adopted father, he goes on the run with a princess of a conquered city to keep a magical dagger out of the hands of those who set him up. Along the way, there's ostrich racing. sword fights, and lots and lots of sand.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is at its best during the numerous fun action sequences, which include lots of the impressive feats of free running, climbing, and acrobatics that make the games so popular. It never quite achieves the sense of epicness that it occasionally reaches for, and there's really no memorable parts that stick out after the movie is done. Which means no real reason to watch it again after the first viewing. <br/><br/>As for the cast, I thought they were okay. This wasn't a movie that was exactly demanding when it came to acting, but everyone did what they could with the merely adequate writing. The special effects were decent, the sand-swept vistas were eye- catching, and there weren't any huge flaws to point out...but there wasn't anything that the movie did particularly well, either. Prince of Persia is worth watching one time if you just want some mindless entertainment for a few hours, but don't expect the charm and excitement of the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie (which Bruckheimer was obviously going for)."

","Like watching the video game for the most part and stays somewhat true to the video game, with the prince doing pakour and stuff. But despite that it really isn't a good movie, and I can see how some kids may enjoy this movie though. So yeah for kids it's worth checking out and some adults may somewhat like it as well or at least try to enjoy it. I just thought it was a boring movie, sure the film had a high budget and there are a lot of good special effects and stuff happening constantly but didn't grab my attention or compelling in anyway. Although some kids won't catch on but most adults will know who is trying to back stab who and so on, and just about everything is predictable. There is a lot of action happening in the trailer as well and I even found the trailer to be boring and the movie is even more boring. And if you see the trailer, you basically seen the whole movie. Sure it don't show all the action sequences since it's trailer, but nothing about it sticks with you. The movie is even called ""Prince of Persia"" and you can't even see a single Persian in this or at least when it comes to the main characters. Jake Gyllenhaal did a pretty good job portraying the prince and his accent in this wasn't so bad.

"wryterz","7","0","1","1 September 2010"," Entertaining even if a little clichéd.
","In the past we've seen far too many video games made into films, a majority of which are not very good, though this does come down to individual opinion. I for one thought that Tomb Raider and its sequel were quite good and was not impressed with either Silent Hill or Street Fighter.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia is based loosely on the Playstation 2 game of the same name. The game was excellent with very good game play, fantastic graphics and a good story. The film follows the basics of the game but ends up being entirely different.<br/><br/>As you may have already guessed from the trailer, or even the poster, this is an action film with mouth-watering special effects and lots of fight sequences. Then again, what else can we expect from Jerry Bruckheimer, the man behind Bad Boys, Pirates of the Caribbean, Con Air and Armageddon, to name but a very few?<br/><br/>To say the film is filled with clichés and stereotypes is an understatement but that in itself is not a bad thing at all. Set in the sixth century, the film follows Dastan (Gyllenhaal) a street urchin who wins the Persian kings heart and a place in his family, as his youngest son. Dastan grows up to be a rebel with all the qualities of a noble man and no yearning for the thrown. It is also thanks to Dastan that the Persian's are able to take down the holy city of Alamut, though the king himself is unaware of this. Things seem to be going from good to fantastic when suddenly the king is murdered and the blame placed upon Dastan. Fleeing for his life, Dastan takes with him the rival Princess Tamina (Arterton) and a small dagger that possesses extraordinary powers.<br/><br/>From here you get wonderful scenic views, wacky characters and Arabian music with some creepy villains to follow.<br/><br/>Cliché's and some cheesy lines aside, Prince of Persia is like a yo-yo. It fails, delivers, fails and delivers and before long you throw logic and consistency to one side and try and enjoy this without too much thought.<br/><br/>The downfall in this film is its predictability. You can smell the antagonist from a mile off, though at times the film does try to throw your mind off track, which it manages to do, but only briefly. Jake as the Prince is quite inconsistent. His English accent is good but it changes from posh English to chav English and therefore it takes the shine away from his performance, which to be honest isn't too bad. Obviously he's trained for the role and seems to fit the build and agility required. Gemma Arterton will blow you away with her looks alone. Though she is tanned beyond belief, she looks wonderful and her acting is good too, as I remember her terrible little Cameo in the last James Bond film. Alfred Molina is clichéd but fun and Ben Kinglsey is just Ben Kingsley. The rest of the cast aren't anything to rave on about and supply ample support.<br/><br/>There are a couple of really bad things about this film and the first is pronunciation. When Hollywood decides to make a film based on middle-eastern culture, it pains me when every character in the film cannot pronounce the names of either cities or people in the correct manner, and this has been done a million times throughout the years. You'd think that Hollywood, with all its millions and researches would get the small details correct.<br/><br/>Also, there are many situations in this that make you cringe; for example, the bad guy who has a change of heart and does a good deed just before sacrificing his life in the name of redemption. Pulease, boring, and so been there before. <br/><br/>There is a certain Pirates of the Caribbean/Jewel of the Nile feel to the movie and if you liked those films, then this one will fit in nicely. Adventure, villains (many different types) action, bloodshed and CGI (which I have to admit is amazing) are all packed in and work wonderfully alongside each other. The final battle is a little short but epic in more ways than one and I have to admit I was satisfied with the end result of the film.<br/><br/>BEST SCENE: Every time Dastan uses the dagger, it does not fail to impress me. The special effects have really improved over the last decade and it definitely shows here. Some of the battle sequences are breathtaking too. <br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT:<br/><br/>A lot of fun, yet flawed throughout. This film is definitely one to watch but the younger generation will love this and the older will yearn for something slightly original, which unfortunately they will not get.<br/><br/>7/10 – Very Good"

Female audiences will be pleased - no matter how bad the movie. Men won't be all that disappointed with Gemma Arteton as Princess Tamina, Dastan's love-hate affair. Add to that some outworldly action sequences, a big-ass Nubian dagger-thrower (Steve Toussaint), Ben Kingsley and horde of snake-charming dart-shooting hassassins. Oh... and there is a time dagger, sands of time and a decent script to boot.<br/><br/>Basically your typical summer blockbuster. But done right. With a great mix of nice acting, a pinch of humour, impressive fights and some superb acrobatics by Gyllenhaal's character this movie did not go wrong. It may be ultimately purely popcorn, but if you need a mind relaxing break this is a superb choice. Yes, it may be generic, essentially uninventive, maybe even redundant and very typical storywise, but at least the story more or less makes sense and the action is unrelenting, but never tiresome.<br/><br/>The only main issue I have is the overly forced character of Sheik Amar (Alfred Molina) brought in purely as comic relief. Given however the adequate chemistry between Dastan and Tamina filled with comedic moments the character of Amar seemed unnecessary. He also grew tiresome very fast (something in the vein of Jar Jar Binks irritating) and felt more like something taken out of a ""Hercules"" episode (yes, the Kevin Sorbo one)."

On the other hand, if you were looking for a highly visual and fun film then in general, you probably will enjoy this film. Prince of Persia keeps the audience interested with lots of action and fight sequences. In fact, if you took those out you would be left with just about half of the film. This much I can say about the fight sequences, they are well choreographed and incorporate CGI effects very well. The special effects do not overwhelm the excitement of the sword and fist fights.

Every single mimic is an anxious and unconvincing copy of Harrison Ford's ""Indiana Jones"" and Gyllenhaals impressive physique only makes it more obvious that every bit of muscle was packed on to disguise a sensitive, shy and slightly awkward person as an action hero. It does not work, at all.<br/><br/>The script feels like it went through multiple re-writes of multiple authors. The bumpy story-telling and the many plot-holes suggest that either the film was changed (most probably shortened) significantly in post-production to put more focus on the action sequences or that whatever the story arcs had been originally was lost during extensive and multiple rewrite-sessions. Not only is there no character-development in either of the two main characters, their motivation and emotional status changes so rapidly and often between two scenes that the audience is most likely to give up caring about the people in the movie and concentrate on the beautiful set-pieces and well-choreographed stunts. One moment Gemma Artetons ""Tamina"" wants to kill Prince Dastan, 20 seconds later she is angry about him leaving her in the desert. One moment Tamina hates Dastan and his family for invading Alamut, a few seconds later she helps him to escape. It is confusing. And one more word to the premise of the story: whoever felt it necessary to include an end-of-the-world scenario into the story should be severely punished. It feels so horribly constructed and out of place that anybody with a talent for writing should have noticed it as soon as was written down.<br/><br/>All in all director Mike Newell was incapable to create a ""whole"" from the mix between an Arabian Nights story, well crafted action, romance and the occasional funny moments and one liners. The film is flawed on so many levels that the albeit properly worked out bits and pieces almost never connect to what could have been so much better.<br/><br/>Seldom did 200 million dollars feel more boring on a big screen."

Moreover, Arterton's overacting is more suited for a children's movie and is out of place and somewhat annoying.<br/><br/>The supporting roles are played fully acceptably, although the characters and the story in general are somewhat cliché and predictable.<br/><br/>The action and effects makes it worth watching if you find it in a bargain bin or if they show it on TV but don't waste your money on a movie ticket or a full-priced DVD/BD."

","Well, having grown up with these games, I had so see the movie, of course. And it wasn't a disappointment, quite the contrary actually.<br/><br/>""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" proved to be one heck of an adventure and ride. The story was good and captivating and it moved forward at a good pace.<br/><br/>There were lots of nice fighting scenes and lots of nice action as well. And, of course, lots of jumping and running around, just like the games. In that aspect, the movie managed to deliver the goods. And it was all great.<br/><br/>As for the cast and acting, well I found the cast to be great, good performances in every role, and the actors/actresses were believable and did well. However, one thing that sort of didn't really work was the fact that they spoke English. But, being a major Hollywood movie, what is to be expected.<br/><br/>The movie was a dazzling sight of wonderful locations, marvelous sets and really nice images. You totally believe that you are back in time and back in Persia.<br/><br/>There was a really nice twist to the movie somewhat towards the end, I am not saying what it is, but it really worked well for the movie. The one thing that I didn't like, beside the fact that everyone spoke English, was the sappy Hollywood ending. But hey, Hollywood movies JUST have to end that way...<br/><br/>""Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time"" had elements similar to those found in movies like ""Star Wars IV: A New Hope"", ""Indiana Jones"", and ""The Mummy"". And somehow they all came together very well for a very fast paced, dazzling, in-your-face action movie.<br/><br/>If you are in for an evening and want to watch an action adventure movie, why not toss back and go back to ancient Persia? This movie is an adventurous ride. Definitely worth checking out."

","PRINCE OF PERSIA-the sands of TIMES – CATCH IT ( B- ) I was really excited when the movie was in the making; it had everything a 200 million dollar budget, Jake Gyllenhaal and Jerry Bruckheimer's touch. But when the 1st promo came online I was disappointed as the CGI graphics were cheap and it didn't looked appealing at all. Now finally I saw the movie and I found it really sloppy as far as the story goes and premise yet entertaining. It's just when you know that it isn't worth it and don't have much expectations anymore and watching just for the sack of watching Prince Of Persia, it happens! Jake Gyllenhaal, well physically he looked the part but with fake British accent he didn't quite nailed it (I am confused why director thought that Persians have British accent) anyways you can see he has put lot of effort in the movie though. Gemma Arterton, I am not a fan of her, I found her quite boring from the beginning yet she manages to show some spark in this movie. Jake and Gemma's chemistry is cold at times and at times it looks real as cunning people. The best person in the movie was Alfred Molina, who knew that he can crack some good jokes and bring a cheerful performance in action movie like that. All the other actors were fine. Overall Prince of Persia is a big disappointment and especially in the ending retreating all things we watched from last 2hrs is quite pathetic. Still watch it for non-stop silly Desert Ride, don't think about it, and just watch two beautiful actors on some mindless desert adventure!"

","I'm a big fan of the Sands of Time computer game and thought that it was a fortunate and rare confluence of great gameplay, a good story and intelligent writing. The movie, unfortunately, is nowhere near as good.<br/><br/>I don't know whether this is the fault of the writers or the directors, but this movie, which, in general, is good but not great, is nearly ruined by the presence of Alfred Molina's character. He is completely anachronistic and his modern speech pattern (planted, no doubt, to help today's audience ""cope"" or ""get it"") is almost the undoing of the entire film. Note: I don't blame the actor; he plays it like he's told to play it.<br/><br/>For the benefit of the writers and/or director:<br/><br/>The term ""bureaucracy"" originated in 18th century France; the word ""entrepreneur"" also originated in France, at the beginning of the 19th century; the names of the days ""Tuesday"" and ""Thursday"" are Middle English in origin, originally Norse and Germanic, and came into use around the 13th century. All of these words are used in this movie by Molina's character, in his very modern British delivery, which is presumably set somewhere between the 8th and 14th centuries (from the presence of the Hashshashin), in PERSIA.<br/><br/>Hollywood's usual spectacular underestimation of the audience's intelligence is in full flight here. Thanks for nothing.<br/><br/>But, um, otherwise good."

I wish I could buy this movie, but frankly, the women just don't wear enough clothes. Nor do I think that Jasmine and the Little Mermaid wear enough clothes. There, I said it. And, it gives everyone reading this a reference to go by when they consider the movie. Biggest complaint? Technically speaking, that is... :-) I cannot stand the way that the camera-man insists on viewing the fight scenes from the inside! Backing up enough to let the rest of us watch it, too, would be nice. More than once I couldn't tell up from down or which way things were going.

"hrafnthor","8","0","2","17 August 2010"," Surprisingly good movie adaptation in pretty much every regard
","It has been a trend for the past 2 decades to make movies based on famous commercial video games, and it has only been getting ""worse"".<br/><br/>Worse because, as a video game player I would like to see some games made into movies that explore the story and lore in more depth but, producers and directors tasked with doing so have, except on few occasions, pretty much done a horrible job so far. <br/><br/>Prince of Persia is one of those few occasions.<br/><br/>Without giving any of the story away, it revolves around the age old story of good versus evil, family feud, princesses and ancient mystical powers. And normally this would, before seeing the movie, make me skeptical it was possible to pull all this off in only 120 minutes. PoP does it.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal plays Prince Dastan very convincingly, never has those annoyingly unbelievable lapses of reason that the main protagonists in game adaptations normally have. Ben Kingsly is always a treat to watch and even in a supporting role he shows why is one of the best.<br/><br/>Gemma Arterton, who reminds me of Audrey Hepburn at times, looks beautiful as always and is perfect in the role of Princess Tamina and I'm looking forward to seeing more of her in the future. <br/><br/>The special effects are used in abundance but not so much that it becomes an overkill. The sets are believable in the old mystical realm that the movie takes place in, and there were never any noticeable Deus Ex Machina moments.<br/><br/>As with all movies it has its shortcomings in a few areas but overall I was very pleased. I give it 8 stars and recommend it for all."

","It is a cursed Hollywood trend that video-game-to-movie adaptations simply don't work. Hit-man, Farcry and Max Payne are evidence of this. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is the newest adaptation to hit the big screen and although it doesn't reverse this pattern, it's a small step in the right direction. <br/><br/>The film focuses on an adventurous and extremely acrobatic Prince (Jake Gyllenhaal) who, after being framed for a crime he did not commit, is forced to join alliances with a beautiful rival princess (Gemma Arterton). Armed with a dagger that allows him to momentarily reverse the flow of time, The Prince sets out to stop the traitor from releasing a catastrophic sandstorm upon the world. <br/><br/>Excluding the greatly altered storyline, Prince of Persia is a faithful adaptation of the game. The elements that made the game so great – the leaping from rooftops to rooftops, the fast fighting style and even the flirtatious bickering between the Prince and the Princess – are all present. The action scenes are particularly thrilling to watch as the Prince effortlessly scales walls ten times his size. Unfortunately, the constant banter between the Prince and the Princess doesn't translate well into the film and ends up coming across as very clichéd and sometimes cringe-worthy.<br/><br/>If you've never played the games, Prince of Persia's entertainment value will depend on your love of the adventure/action genre and how much sappy dialogue you can tolerate. If you're a fan of the game, you'll either love it for what it manages to capture about the games, or hate it for what it does not. Either way, it's the best video game adaptation to date – but, then again, that's not saying much."

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time is the adaptation of the popular 80's video game The prince of Persia. The movie is about A rogue prince (JAKE GYLLENHAAL) reluctantly joins forces with a mysterious princess (GEMMA ARTERTON) and together, they race against dark forces to safeguard an ancient dagger capable of releasing the Sands of Time - a gift from the gods that can reverse time and allow its possessor to rule the world. Prince of Persia tries to be an epic adventure full of action, some moments of humor, romance and fantasy. What it really is just an adventure with some decent action, a little of humor and cheesy moments. But not everything is bad, its special effects are quite awesome. The cast is pretty good, their performances not really, Jake Gyllenhaal is good but I think that the role of hero didn't fit him very well, Gemma Arterton was decent enough in her role of Tamina, Sir Ben Kingsley is Nizam, the villain, his performance was maybe the most convincing of all along with Alfred Molina as Sheik Amar, he contribute with the funniest situations of the movie.

","There is a very specific reason why Lion King remains the worlds most heartily lapped up animation film to date, in spite of a handful of arguably better made films like Finding Nemo and Wall-E taking this format of storytelling to a newer high and many others showing off far superior animation and yet falling flat on their face. Clearly, too much use of a particular technique kills the whole charm that surrounds it.<br/><br/>Thus, Lion King remains the absolute masterpiece in animation because it introduced us to a latest, very affable charm; that of seeing a single tear appearing from the cornea of a baby tiger and making its way through his lush gold face. It was mind numbingly surprising how much heart it all possessed; in spite of its unreal nature. The followers of the lion saga, the ones that didn't work, overused the technology to the extent which made the technique lose its marvel.<br/><br/>And so, why I smash this undeniably long prologue in your faces before actually coming to the point is because Mike Newell's latest suffers from this very mishap.<br/><br/>Prince of Persia – The Sands of Timepass is so stuffed with computer- assisted effects that it makes the experience of watching a wide-angle shot, that of a huge castle amidst a densely populated civilization, entirely underwhelming. It is all unreal, we know that. But did it really have to be this artificial?<br/><br/>Visibly, he is so fascinated by the use of CGI and computerized gimmickry that the use, itself, is not fascinating at all. 'Special Effects' are no longer special since this film makes you wonder if you would have had more fun sitting at home and X-boxing the very game which forms the crux of this film. The crux, which starts off with the Persian army invading another region with the pretence that it contains weapons of mass destruction, a very American plot line to begin the film with, and a probable reference to the Iraq invasion.<br/><br/>This is not bad, bland or boring a film, by most standards. It is decidedly quick in its pace and bores rather rarely. Starting off very well, it boasts off a promising premise to begin with and later, turns into an unremarkable fantasy-action flick wherein even the fist fights are computerized. The action is well-choreographed at places but there is absolutely no heart to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Sure, it's a summer blockbuster that is meant to entertain only. And it does that, albeit intermittently. But some genuine smartness wouldn't have hurt, right?<br/><br/>The leads however do their jobs well. Jake Gyllenhaal, taking this role more seriously than he should have, does rather well. The Brokeback guy is an excellent actor and this film sees him having a ball as he swiftly jumps around like a monkey performing ballet. The Lady, Gema Arterton, looks edible but her performance is as erratic as the film's sloppy editing. Funnily, you wonder if the wonderment surrounding her display of anatomy is a result of her natural beauty or a product of the films hackneyed CGI.<br/><br/>So while the climatic twist musters up the courage to actually make the audiences take notice and become a participant in the narrative, it's rather late and you are accustomed to 'watching' a game by then. Not a film.<br/><br/>And, although, it is rather enjoyable to sit on a couch and watch the buddies battle out a fun match on a Play Station. But wouldn't you rather play the game?<br/><br/>**1/2"
"Robert_duder","8","0","1","20 July 2010"," High flying summer adventure that actually keeps the game in tact AND entertains
","Obviously the transition between gaming and movies is a tumultuous relationship. Successes like Resident Evil and failures like Doom are prominent everywhere and I've often wondered how they manage to screw it up really. I mean video games are like books in many ways and the transition to big screen should nine times out of ten be brilliant. Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time proves that this transition can be executed with brilliant adventure, characters, romance, and still keep elements of the game that makes fanboys swoon. As the film began I was a little worried. It sort of drags in the beginning and even seems a little campy which doesn't bode well for a 'summer blockbuster.' But my concerns were soon put to rest as the story takes hold and the action begins. Obvious comparisons to Pirates of the Caribbean are worthy given the film is produced by Disney and has very similar adventure plots and directing style. The story is a solid fantasy tale and the lead characters are both very strong in their own right and carries you through the whole film. It is said that the director didn't want any action sequences that looked cheesy just because they were in the game but he still kept some really great game like moments that didn't stick out on screen as being bad.<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal takes on the lead role as the Prince himself and does a really solid job. He obviously takes the role seriously and puts a lot of effort into it. He looks the part, and pulls off the stunts flawlessly. Bond girl Gemma Arterton plays sassy, strong Tamina. She isn't really likable at first but I don't think she is supposed to be. Her and Gyllenhaal have good chemistry BUT not great chemistry which is the one place the film stumbles. Still both of them separately make really amazing action stars. Ben Kingsley plays a subtle but ominous role as brother to the King, Nizam. Kingsley doesn't have a lot of lines or moments in the film and yet still plays a really solid role in the film and is always great in a cast. Supporting cast that don't have significant depth but still really do honestly add something to the cast include Alfred Molina, Steve Toussaint, Toby Kebbell, and Ronald Pickup.<br/><br/>If anyone would be right for a film like this director Mike Newell would be perfect. He is becoming an expert on fantasy adventure and absolutely tells a great story. Best of all he did manage to respect gamers and the original concept by keeping enough of that original idea in tact without forcing down anyone's throat. If you watched the film without any previous knowledge where it came from you would have no idea it was based on a video game and yet if you're a fan of the game series and watch the film then you'll be pleasantly surprised with how much of the film is connected to the game. I agree with several reviewers that were surprised how low this film scores on IMDb because I think it holds itself at least on par with entries in the Pirates series and holds its own as a terrific summer action flick. Well worth your time and money!! 8.5/10"
"wolverinesforever","6","0","1","18 July 2010"," Somewhat entertaining film that cheats at the end
","Ah, Jerry Bruckheimer. The ultimate bigwig in big-budget, over-the-top, special effects laden action and entertainment. Sometimes, his films will fully deliver the goods (""Black Hawk Down,"" ""Pirates of the Caribbean""). Sometimes, they're flat out messy (""Armageddon""). Sometimes, they're flat out boring (""National Treasure""). This film sometimes delivers, and almost does. But then it cheats at the end, and it left me feeling very unsatisfied, like the entire picture had been a waste of time.<br/><br/>Set in ancient times (or whatever those title cards said), ""Prince of Persia"" follows Dastan (Jake Gyllenhaal), an adopted prince who, along with his two brothers, his adoptive father, and his Uncle Nizam (Ben Kingsley), is first found attacking the holy city of Alamut. They believe the city is committing treason. The raid is successful, but evidence of treason is not found. Dastan does, however, encounter the much heralded Princess Tamina (Gemma Arterton). During a victory celebration, the King of Persia announces that he will make Dastan king and make Tamina his wife. But then he suddenly dies, and Dastan is framed for the murder. Now he must flee with Tamina, and together, they must find out who is really behind this conspiracy.<br/><br/>Gyllenhaal is pretty good in the lead as Dastan, not his best performance, but okay nonetheless. Then again, considering his caliber, it would be very hard to find Jake in a bad performance. Likewise, Gemma Arterton is okay as the feisty Princess Tamina, and she and Gyllenhaal do enjoy a little chemistry together, but not very much. Ben Kingsley doesn't impress too much as the ""evil uncle"" Nizam. The best performance, ironically, comes from a role that doesn't contribute a whole lot to the plot. It's from Alfred Molina as the (ready for this?) taxes-hating, ostrich-racing, Sheik Amar. Molina seems to be the most aware of ""Prince of Persia's"" B-movie roots, and he plays up his role appropriately. It's hilarious to watch him complain about taxes and over-like his ostriches, and at one point, Molina even makes a remark that, for all I knew, mocked the movie he was in. I not only wished he was in the movie more (as it is, he was in for roughly ten minutes), but I wished the other actors played it up to his level.<br/><br/>Production values and special effects are pretty good here; the movie cost a reported $200 to make. As with many other summer movies, action scenes are ""Prince of Persia's"" bread and butter. Unfortunately, they are frequently hyper-edited and zoomed in too close, thus making them rather average. Gyllenhaal seems to pull of some impressive stunts by running off of rooftops, but I couldn't entirely tell. The film was directed by Mike Newell, and just like with the fourth ""Harry Potter"" film, action scenes are not his strongpoint. He does much better with character interaction; unfortunately, he doesn't have a whole lot of that to work with here.<br/><br/>As for the plot, well, it's not too strong. After Dastan is forced to flee, the plot has a tendency to go in circles as we see the Dagger with the Sands of Time (that's the chief object of desire here) trade numerous hands, Dastan run around in city after city, and endless numbers of bad guys complicate our hero's journey. But I had fun with it anyway, despite its flaws. It wanted to be a fun B-movie, and I started to go with the flow. The actors were likable, and it was through them that I got most of my entertainment value.<br/><br/>But then came the cheat. I won't spoil it, but let's just say that the twist at the end made me feel like the entire movie had been a waste of time. Admitted, had the movie not cheated, my recommendation for ""Prince of Persia"" would have been marginal, but it would have been a recommendation nonetheless. As it is, even for pure entertainment reasons, I cannot recommend this movie."
"Reel_starz","5","0","1","17 July 2010"," The epitome of a guilty pleasure
","I walked into Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time with virtually no expectations, yet at the end, I felt simultaneously relieved that I had seen the movie for free and not particularly guilty that I had seen it at all. With good reason by all accounts, films adapted from computer games have gained an almost malicious reputation over the years, and many film lovers lament the increasing number of such movies. Prince of Persia is most likely among the best computer game adaptations ever made, mindless and sometimes outright incoherent yet a perfectly enjoyable way to spend two hours, alternating between cringe-worthy and snappy dialogue and boasting a solid cast led by Jake Gyllenhaal and Gemma Arterton.<br/><br/>Strangely enough, for a big-spectacle summer blockbuster, the most gaping flaw of Prince of Persia is the action. The stunts are incredible at times, but thanks to sloppy cinematography and CGI that is often all too obvious, the numerous action scenes are far from the compelling setpieces expected from epics of this nature. Probably in an homage to the video game from which the movie is based, director Mike Newell frequently takes advantage of slow-mo and Bourne-like fast cuts, yet these stylized techniques do nothing to enhance the action, instead reducing it to an almost headache-inducing mess.<br/><br/>Naturally, the story, a convoluted plot involving royal factions, a murder and a sacred dagger that allows the user to go back a minute in time, is far-fetched to the point of hilarity. Despite the high costs, the audience never invests much in the story's outcome and real emotion is pretty much nonexistent. In the hands of, say, Ridley Scott, the movie could have been a complete failure. However, it is clear that the film-makers do not take the material seriously, and they are fully aware that however entertaining Prince of Persia is, the mere concept that forms its foundation cannot allow for a serious outing. Instead, because they ostensibly had fun making the movie, the audience has fun watching it.<br/><br/>The cast also helps transcend the material. Jake Gyllenhaal, incredibly buff yet still boyish and sincere, steps outside his comfort zone, his career thus far consisting mostly of quiet dramas like 1999's October Sky and 2005's Brokeback Mountain. Notwithstanding a bizarre, not altogether successful British accent, he glides through the film with vigor and enthusiasm, making for a likable hero. Gemma Arterton, on the other hand, while not terrible, is shrill, aggravating and insufferable. Even toward the movie's conclusion, her character stays trapped in the obnoxious stereotype so often depicted in romantic comedies and action movies, one that is increasingly on the rise with the recent trend of rom-com-action films along the lines of Killers and Knight and Day. In fact, when stripped to its bare bones, Prince of Persia could easily be considered a romantic comedy (albeit with little of the romance): the hero and heroine meet; they initially treat each other with contempt and disgust; they slowly fall in love despite their wildly differing personalities and various external obstacles; they manage to overcome the force separating them and eventually, through a mix of hard work and, perhaps to a greater extent, coincidence, they wind up in each others arms for a classic happily ever after. Their relationship works for the most part, not because Gyllenhaal and Arterton have particularly great - or even good - chemistry but because their banter, both fun and unbelievably cheesy, is among the movie's most enjoyable parts. Of the supporting cast, Alfred Molina is by far the standout, arguably stealing the movie from its two leads. As the greedy, bumbling owner of an ostrich racing ring and an ardent hater of capitalism, he bites into his part with relish, saving his character from becoming a completely infuriating waste of words and screen time.<br/><br/>In the end, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time manages to surmount the rules of logic and good film-making to become a diverting, campy, wild ride."

","If you haven't played the video game series that this is based on, it's okay because they are only very loosely related. Here's what you need to know: ""Desten"" was an orphan, now he's a prince with two brothers, a kingly father, and a 'loyal' uncle. There's a dagger that allows the user to turn back time. Battles, betrayal, chases, and much adventuring ensues.<br/><br/>First off I'll say this: judging this only as a movie based off a video game it gets 10/10 right off the bat. For a game-based-movie, it is easily one of the best, but honestly it doesn't take much to be better than some of the other trash that Hollywood gives us. Anyway, on to the good and the bad.<br/><br/>The Good: while not really AAA actors, I quite liked the cast. Jake does a pretty good job as the prince, Ben makes a decent villain, Alfred makes an amusing (and only slightly annoying) comic relief character, and the lovely Gemma is a love interest that is actually quite essential to the story (unlike the usual LINTS - Love Interest Non-Essential To Story). The movie is also great taken as a pure adventure movie---I haven't really seen a good one of those in a loooong time. There is a great amount of good action as well---large-scale battles, small-scale fights, riots, acrobatics, etc. A good throwback to the games.<br/><br/>The Bad: There are quite a few plot holes. How did they get those costumes? How did they plan that so quickly? Where did those weapons come from? Why are they all speaking English?Most of them are pretty forgivable however. I'm also still not quite sure what I think about the ending. I usually hate the style of ending they used (cant spoil it though) but they handled it pretty effectively<br/><br/>Overall I was quite pleasantly surprised. I almost facepalmed when I first saw the trailer, but it pretty much broke my expectations. I give it a good recommendation if you're looking for a fun movie that isn't too serious.<br/><br/>Final Score - 8/10"

No, so jake did a swell job, just maybe work on the accent a little more. But if there's a second one, get the people who made 300 in it and get Disney out!"

","OK if you're looking for a film with a fair enough love story then this is a film for you. But if you watch the film for an adaption to the film then prepare to be astonished to the lack of it. First where is the second sword from the game where he breaks the Walls. Second what were story writers thinking to make it a love story from action suspense and fantasy film. Also where are the ghouls from the game he's dad is actually human? The swift use of swords jus like in the game no it's just flicks of the wrist unlike pirates of the carrabean swashbuckling where fight scenes looked real. There has to be a sequel and they must bring the ghouls the blessed water drinking the suspense the different swords and live up to the game."

","Prince of Persia: The Sands of Times it's just OK. I did enjoyed the movie, it was very entertaining. I didn't feel bored or that it was slow at any time, and that's the point.<br/><br/>The rating it already has it's pretty much accurate. I haven't played the game yet so I didn't have any expectations about the movie being like the game, but my friend told me it was very different. I don't care anyway because it has nothing to do with the movie being good or bad.<br/><br/>Nice CGI, and solid acting. Amazing fighting scenes and some funny lines. Nothing new.<br/><br/>I would recommend it to watch it with friends or family to have a good time.<br/><br/>My rating: 6.5/10"

","You know this curse . Games made by movie are bad and movies made by games are also bad . This is something what didn't stop me to go watch this movie . Trailer wasn't something attracting but I heard that it is entertaining . There are lot of prejudices but Prince of Persia(game) was definitely big mania . I knew few guys who were crazy about this game . This is nice beginning for this promising movie . Is it another trash with silly effects ? Definitely not . Far from this . Plot maybe isn't so great but its realization is definitely good . Actually I like movies from Disney . This movie is even better than one of my favorite serial Pirates of Caribbean . Great effects in this movie and really thrilling fight scenes are great . I don't mind what maybe showing of Persia was a bit childish .<br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhal as Dastan was surprisingly good . When you see few his movie you can never expect that he could act this hero . I thought that he will act it only on some character way but he had nice improvisation and he handled himself in every scene . You can see that his image is really good . You can't tell that his acting wasn't convincing . Really entertaining acting which didn't show any suffers . It is also on level of Johnny Depp(Jack Sparrow).There weren't some mistakes and in romantic scenes he was also great and he didn't screw . He acted with heart . He was for this roles and it was on level of this fantasy movies inspired by games . This movies always have to be some kind of fairytale .<br/><br/>Gemma Arterton as princess was also surprisingly good . She is always in roles of some wise princess . You can't even imagine how this acting was convincing . It wasn't like Io in Clash of the Titans when she was like some forced role . I can't understand that she was so good . She was also attractive and she was really like one historical beauty . She really looked like sign of female strength . I think that it was one of her better performances .<br/><br/>Ben Kingsley as Nizam was also great . I expected good performance from him . After also one villain role in Shutter Island I could only expect the best and I got . Again one provocative acting with heart and soul . You can see that he is profiled actor with many different roles . From greatest heroes to most notorious villains . It was really nice to see him in this role . I think he was very inspired .<br/><br/>All in one really entertaining movie . I like this genre of adventure spectacle . If you didn't watch this movie what are you waiting for ?"
"thefilmguy7","5","0","1","13 June 2010"," Prince Of Persia: The Waste Of Time
","Prince Of Persia starts off with some promise considering that it's just another conventional summer popcorn film. It has a nice little origin back story for it's hero and then a visually interesting opening action sequence. With the introduction to the mystical dagger though, the film quickly moves into a messy narrative that is so predictable that you would think that you time traveled backwards from the ending. <br/><br/>Jake Gyllenhaal puts in his best effort to play his cardboard one dimensional hero. Gemma Arterton is gorgeous and seems to have a nice chemistry with Gyllenhaal. Ben Kingsley is totally wasted here as he could have been played by a cut out of Dr. Evil. Alfred Molina is actually a highlight in the film performance wise but his character is totally pointless other than offering some comic relief.<br/><br/>The CGI effects are pretty impressive but are also so excessive that they take away believability and make you feel as though you are still playing the video game. The action scenes follow the same pattern of being impressive but too over the top. You need the audience to feel threatened for the hero and it's hard to do that when the hero can leap tall buildings in a single bound and dodge around collapsing structures like he's in The Matrix.<br/><br/>It is a well known fact that the ending is the most important part of any story. Sure the beginning is important for investing the audience with introducing them to the characters and the world they live in and the middle is important for raising the stakes. However it's what happens at the end of the film that resonates with the audience the most. Everything in the film is building towards the ending and with out the proper pay off the structure of the film falls apart. This is the case with the ending of this film. With out spoiling anything, something happens at the end that leaves the viewer feeling like the last hour and a half of the film was a waste of time. That is never something an audience member should feel. Stories should feel like journey's that the audience takes along with the characters. If the journey feels pointless than movie feels incomplete. <br/><br/>If the film had found a way of making the journey worth while in the end than I would have given it a slightly higher rating. I mean the movie wasn't with out some charms. It did have entertainment value despite all it's flaws. However it failed in it's ending and left a bad last impression on top of all it's other short comings. I wish I had the tagger so that I can turn the sands of time back to tell myself to just wait for this one on rental."
"cooldude_03","6","0","2","7 June 2010"," Excellent Story undone by poor direction and acting
","After watching Prince of Persia in theater i am of the opinion that this is best movie based on a video game, but still can't overlook the fact that it is far from perfect when it comes to good quality cinema. <br/><br/>Only 15-20 minutes into the movie i realized that the action sequences and the sword battles lack a certain amount of intensity and bloodshed, and the director is more inclined to please the kids than the grown up audience. Also when one set fight and jump sequences end the movie seems to rush to the next set of fight and jump sequence, with short dialogues and quirky humor in between. The action sequences themselves are not very long and although most have been well done, i would have preferred lesser but more elaborate ones than having too many of them. Due to this the action sequences become a bit of drag towards the end and the climax doesn't feel that strong. The acting of most lead characters is amateurish leaving aside Jake and Alfred Molina who fits the role of a crook merchant with a lighter side. Gemma Arteton on the other hand stands out as most irritating as princess whatever who cannot act and speaks with a heavy British accent in a movie with an Arabic setting. The method of storytelling does not leave any room for character development or growth of story. Don't get me wrong, the story of PoP is the strongest point of the movie and the only thing that kept me interested. It is the way it has been told that leaves a lot to be desired, which actually is not a surprise to me as Mike Newell, the director was also involved in Harry Potter and the goblet of fire, the weakest movie in the franchise. Though it was refreshing to see a video game movie possessing a good story because attempts prior to this had no story to speak of, let alone a bad one.<br/><br/>A serious take on the good story and maybe no involvement of Disney would certainly have helped in making it a more mature movie than what it is.<br/><br/>Still give it 6/10 just for the story which otherwise is a pop corn entertainer."
"deathiscoming-1","4","0","1","2 June 2010"," Another adulterous faecal stain on the slowly diminishing brand of Prince of Persia
","Frankly, I'm flabbergasted at the positive reviews bestowed upon this movie, seems like Hollywood is the (anti) Sheppard and the masses are the sheep – well NOT ME! Occasionally, I'll have a happy thought and it happened again a few days ago when I thought, ""let me don my happy-go-lucky cap and tinkle skip to the cinema to watch my favourite prince in action."" Only to be roundhouse kicked in the face whilst freerunning off the cinema seats by my metaphorical prince representing bafometic Hollywood.<br/><br/>The difficulty is choosing where to begin, so I'll start with the storyline. Prince of Persia (POP) fans will be horrified to know that the storyline is some made-up dribble, an iota of which doesn't follow the game with an opening scene which has a shameless and uncanny resemblance to Disney's Aladdin. Why can't ""adaptation"" movies just follow the already established and much loved story of its original? Wouldn't that make for easy writing too? Another theft is the ""leap of faith"" and panoramic cinematic views stolen from the Assassin's Creed games, although like in the game – I loved 'em! <br/><br/>Okay now some positives; the costumes and actors are perfect for their roles. Jake Gyllenhaal (who plays the prince – I'll come back to this bit) plays his role convincingly and has the costume nailed to the ""T"", but Gemma Arterton (who plays the absolutely divine Princess Tamina) schizophrenically flits between Selene (from underworld), Vicky Pollard and Bridget Jones which is exasperating.<br/><br/>Okay that last bit wasn't really a positive, but oh well, back to what's wrong with this movie. A strange indecision regarding the characters' accents looms throughout the movie! One minute they're (and I'm using plurals because all the characters do it – bar the cockney, Grant Mitchell wannabe merchant guy and the black guy who just mumbles a bit) American and next minute they sound like they work on a market stall selling fruit in the East end of London! <br/><br/>Back to prince himself – firstly, why the silly name ""Dastan"" (which means ""story"" in Hindi/Persian/Urdu). Subsection; The Prince has always been known as The Prince. Subsection two; if you ARE desperate to name him, why not something fitting like Kismat (meaning ""fate"" in Hindi/Urdu). Now the Parkour, OH the parkour, the prince we know effortlessly combines his slick yet daring parkour moves with his neck snapping butt slicing attacks, here he barely moves with grace of a retired nursing home dwelling circus acrobatic these days using a Zimmer frame! As a loving fan I wanted to see more impossible wall runs, at least one ripping slide down a curtain (they took time to tantalise us with a wonderful shot of a carpet on a wall but alas no sliding partook) and especially more matrix style super flips whilst cutting people's heads off! Fight scenes are too fast, short, few and far between that if you blink you'll not see another for 30 minutes, gone are the days movies like The Matrix slowed time to ultra slow-mo showing off every mind-boggling moment so the viewer could savour every moment whilst dribbling uncontrollably on our seats staring exophthalmically at the screen.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie is an embarrassment to POP, the storyline is ridiculous and doesn't follow the game, the central element of parkour blended with gratuitous broad sword violence is pretty much absent and every time you start twitching with frustration close to having a seizure they just show you some beautiful scenery or Princess Tamina's illustrious beauty to calm the brewing storm (if not to start another *wink* *wink*).<br/><br/>Advice: watch the trailer and that should be enough to satisfy your carnal needs, anymore and you'll only be disappointed, like when you walked in on your wife and your best friend... or erm something similar!"
"rightwingisevil","Null","0","2","4 June 2010"," Too formulated with terrible British voice-over, annoying leading actress
","This film is just like other couple of dozen similar films with special effect, all of them including this new one are just too formulated. Since it's a British product, so the whole movie is with all the annoying thin British accents, male or female likewise. The CGI crated special effect is of course another similar format. Ancient Gods, mankind, the destiny, all depended on a dagger with time-sand. All the fighting scenes were performed and shot so closely that you just couldn't see clearly. But the worst letdown is the actress who played the princess. She's very annoying with quite plain features that absolutely opposed to all the praises in the movie, saying how beautiful she was. In this movie, she didn't like a Princess but a spoiled high school drop-out. God, all the Persians, tribes and bandits, speaking with the annoying pretentious British accent that almost drove me crazy during the viewing. Why the director couldn't make most of the players in this movie with certain accents of the middle east? And it would make the whole movie more believable and realistic. With everybody speaking like the tight-and-narrow lipped English people, this movie just didn't feel right. The close-up fighting scenes only showed that wide-angle fighting scenes simply couldn't be well managed by the director and the camera team."

","The latest from Jerry Bruckheimer's house ""Prince of Persia:Sands of Time"" lived upto its expectation stimulated by the trailers. The film is fast paced, engaging, visually great but still something was missing. I guess... the story or this genre is bit dated.<br/><br/>The story is not much to talk about. On direction side, it was okay. On acting side, Jake Gyllenhaal has boyish charm with macho body which also worked. Ben Kingslay as villain was also good. Gemma Arterton as Tamina is alluring in this. But the big let down was Hasssasins as the trailers promised. They were hardly terrifying. There snake looked fake.<br/><br/>The film beautifully portrayed the imaginative world of Persia in a more realistic manner. Visual and sound effects were decent. In conclusion, if you don't expect much you will like this. If you have expectations watch other films by Jerry Bruckheimer such as Pirates of Caribbean."
"musings-morsels","8","0","1","2 June 2010"," Prince of Persia, pretty darn good for what it is
","To bring out yet another a film based on a video game (and with the quality of past video game films like Tomb Raider, Doom, etc) immediately heightened my critical scepticism. But as soon as the first scene leapt on screen, I was pleasantly entertained from start to end. Jerry Bruckheimer and Disney already accomplished a similar feat when they brought Pirates of the Caribbean to the big screen, a movie based on a theme park ride and reigniting the spark in a overly common dwindling genre.<br/><br/>There was really nothing I could criticise too harshly about the film. Some of the scenic choices seen in Prince of Persia were nothing short of breathtaking. The storyline and character development were just enough of an explanation to move the plot along without taking away from the action. No useless characters or WTF dialogue. The theme explores the idea of strong family values, which is a unique take on Hollywood's usual action packed box office films. It took all the best parts of the original game bringing back the childhood nostalgia but finely tuned the good old Prince of Persia experience. The protagonist prince Dastan (Gyllenhaal) was introduced to the audience as lovable character, immediately intriguing us to follow this underdog's story. Gyllenhaal who really bulked up for the roll showed off his impressive athleticism and fancy footwork which gave the action scenes a distinct look and feel; and frankly less boring to watch.<br/><br/>Of course there were annoying little flaws here and there throughout the film that could have been addressed better. Like the occasional awkward romantic moments between Dastan & Princess Tamina (Atertan) or the underuse of the Dagger in critical moments. And worse of all the typical Disney airy fairy happy ending which is as bad as 'I woke up and it was all a dream' (an amazing dream at that). But overall entertaining and amusing for what it was, great cinematography, likable characters portrayed by decent actors and an original plot and theme delivered through substantial script and storytelling.<br/><br/>There was no distinctly stupid or funny scene that I can recall, but I did love the 360degree rotation of Dastan standing on the roof's edge during battle. Which reminded me a lot of the Assassin's Creed video game and for an instant I thought he'd jump off and land in a shallow hay barrel (often used in the game). But instead he tied a rope to his ankle and managed to jump into the level below in one swift impossible manoeuvre, that gave me a little chuckle.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the next Jerry Bruckheimer & Disney collaboration - The Sorcerer's Apprentice.<br/><br/>http://musingsandmorsels.weebly.com/"

","This might just be one of the best movies I've seen so far this summer. I really enjoyed this film more than Iron Man 2. Both I feel are great films, but Prince of Persia I feel offers the audience the best escape from the summer heat. First I want to say the film is about 2hrs and 30 minutes long but you do not feel you have been trapped in the theater that love . This is due to what I feel really saves this film from just being just another in a long line of video game films that suck, THE STORY. I have to say Mr. Bruckheimer must have spare know expense on this gem of a tale. If only Spielberg got these gifted script writers for Indy 4. Without a doubt Mr. Jake owns the role. Destan is Jack Sparrow and Will turner rolled together into one great hero. The exotic sets and sizable action all make for one great summer hit. I pray that Pirates of the Caribbean fans will not miss this one. About the only thing that I didn't like about the film was the lack of the main characters use of the sands of time. I wish the writers could have used this great prop in the story more. Filled with humor, romance, and adventure Prince of Persia is what the summer should be about at the movies. Pure Escapism from the troubles of our daily world. A solid 9 out of 10."

","I just got home from viewing Prince of Persia with my thirteen year old niece. Even with our age difference we both agreed about one thing, that it was too long. I do not think it was well edited. Some scenes were too long or could have just been cut, and it would have conveyed the same story with more interest and imagination. I felt myself getting bored and wanting to scream get on with it! Without revealing too much, the main ""object"" changed hand a few too many times for my taste. Also it took awhile to wrap up the ending. It swirled and swirled for minutes, when a minute would have been enough. In its' favor, the costumes and scenery were fantastic! They both captured a bygone romantic fantasy of the desert and palace life. The acting was good with the fight scenes well choreographed. Andrew Molina was good at adding comic relief, and the ostriches were great. Overall, It was a purely fun movie. I recommend it for a night out when one wants entertainment, without having to think."
"Vahid232323","6","0","1","1 June 2010"," Fantastic and Cheesy
","I went to see this movie tonight, as a fan, because I've played all the games. I didn't expect much, but I got more than what I had bargained for. One main point about this movie is that even though the storyline had the potential to be groundbreaking movie, It was made in a way to appeal 100% to the general audience to make reasonable money. there was not any major deviation from the standard Hollywood-ish stuff in this movie. So here are the good and the bad: The Good: 1-There was a lot of action scenes with respectable and at some points glorious visual effects. (I have to admit that in two or three brief scenes, I could totally see the CGI, if you know what I mean) 2-It was based on the Persian history and values, the way the Persian royalties behave in this movie, are very similar to the real events in Persian history, specially the values that the Persian stand for in this movie, are based on what is known of how the Persian's used to behave back then. (Which is primarily the Achaemenid Era) 3-Story was not exactly the same as the Game's story, But had twisted the original in a pleasing way (though I think the original story had more to give) The Bad: 1-It was too cheesy at times, and too typical romance between the characters, which I don't like. 2-There was too much sand, way too much sand, People in middle-east never lived in the sand, they live in that area, but either in mountain-side or riverbanks, NOT IN THE SAND. 3- in some scenes you could see some minarets which are known to be of Islamic origins, which did not exist back then. that's a flaw. All in all, they could do more research. Even though they had done so, but choosing relevant Persian names.<br/><br/>I rated it a 6 cause it earned the 6, don't get me wrong, I really loved this movie and I would go and see it again if I hadn't seen it tonight!"

","As a fan of the Prince of Persia video games, naturally I had to see this movie. Initially my expectations weren't too high, since I've never heard of a good video game movie so far.<br/><br/>I loved this movie. Even though the storyline was only very loosely based on the Sands of Time game, I enjoyed the plot created for the movie. It flowed well and made sense. The time travel was fun. Dastan's character was also believable. Jake Gyllenhaal looked great, and I think he played the character well. The romance with the princess was charming, even though it never got too involved. The stunts were fantastic, and the parkour was a great tribute to POP's signature platforming gameplay. The visual effects were great, especially the dagger time-rewinding scenes, which looked fantastic.<br/><br/>This was a great fantasy-adventure movie that left me with fond memories of the games. I'm actually also playing the latest game in the series, Forgotten Sands, so it was great to see this and then go right back to dodging deadly spikes as the Prince! Jerry Bruckheimer got it right (seems like he really can make a movie based off of anything) so hopefully this means he's set the example of how to make a great video game movie!"

My husband was rather bored with this movie and said over and over, This is not nearly half as good as Pirates of the Caribbean. <br/><br/>Problem for me was Jake Gyllenhaal. Although he is a great actor, he is clearly not the ""eye candy"" that this movie needs, (Jake has the Jay Leno thing going on). Also, the movie doesn't deliver anything new, its all been done before and if you see this movie and other movies, you will know what I mean. I don't want to give anything away but you will see.<br/><br/>Also, the leading actress, Gemma Arerton basically played the similar role that she did in Clash of the Titans, without her spray tan. I found that really boring.

"akram-ali-112","9","0","3","30 May 2010"," An action experience that true Prince of Persia fans dreamed of.....
","I am writing this review about a few hours after watching the movie.....<br/><br/>POPSOT is the game to film adaptation that breaks the myth that such adaptations are awful and spoil the reputation of the game. The movie stays true to its source material as much as possible while incorporating elements that would induce a movie-goer to sit in his seat. The following review is from the point of not just a movie goer but also as one who enjoyed the Sands of Time game trilogy and remains a fan of the Prince...<br/><br/>The plot has remained true to the original game as far as possible with a few name changes here and there. What struck me the most was how they managed to retain the Prince's sarcastic and daredevilry nature that we all loved in the first game and were sorry to see leave in the second. Jake Gyllenhall has portrayed the Prince to near perfection in both body and mind. Gemma Arterton has provided good company to him as the Princess Tamina (Farah in the game) and looks enchanting enough to live up to the reputation of a beautiful princess. Ben Kingsley, on the other hand seems to have been wasted in the movie. The role given to him does not live up to his talents. Alfred Molina provides the comic relief of the movie that is not already been given by Gyllenhall and Arterton. The stunts have been done magnificently and are reminiscent of the 2008 spin-off as well as Assassin's Creed. The CGI are equally brilliant with the time reversal power done magnificently. The camera-work is the highlight of the movie, capturing beautiful vistas of Ancient Persia. <br/><br/>Overall, if you are a Prince of Persia fan, who has played the games like me, you will hold this one close to your heart. However if you are just a regular movie-goer with no idea of what this movie holds, then it might take you a second viewing to actually understand the story and get the spirit of the plot. VERDICT: Brilliant adaptation! Makes you reminiscent of the game, and makes you want to play it!"

The fighting could have been a little bit more in the time period but as far as weapons it was spot on. Costuming was a big role in this movie and i think they were almost perfect there were thing i would think they could add but they were good no matter what. The comedy part of this movie were very funny and were sometimes for some people hard to understand but were funny no matter what. As well the prince and princess were great working with each other.

"galahad58-1","7","0","1","29 May 2010"," Nice Start to Summer
","Usually Memorial Day weekend is the start of the summer movie season and Hollywood usually slots a ""perceived"" Blockbuster for that spot. This year no Blockbuster type film was scheduled for this weekend. Prince of Persia was the only film that had Blockbuster (limited) potential for the weekend. What can I say about PoP? Think Pirates of the Caribbean. Jake Gyllenhaal could easily be interchanged with Orlando Bloom---Gemma Arterton was almost exactly portraying her character the same as Keira Knightley. The only thing missing from PoP was Johnny Depp acting like a spaced out drug addict. Story wise PoP is based loosely upon a video game, so it plays a bit like a PS3 game. Dastan (Gyllenhaal) scales walls, jumps off buildings, spins, rolls, and does feats that you see in today's video games (looked a lot like Assassin's Creed the way he moved). The story was typical Disney live action movie fare. It was satisfactory towards the picture and did not disappoint, nor break new ground. The performances were also what you would expect in a Disney based film. The movie looked good, it moved at a nice pace, it was not too silly, and thus it was entertaining and worth the ticket price. I would give it a 7/10 and recommend it as a nice popcorn summer movie."
