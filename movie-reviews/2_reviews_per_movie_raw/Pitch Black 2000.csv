"ParanoidAndroidMarvin","10","268","311","8 April 2002"," An Excellent use of Sci-Fi as a story telling medium
","While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra terrestrials end up being cheap imitations of the 'Aliens' series, Pitch Black stands as a fine piece of Sci-Fi, and an excellent movie all around.  Perhaps my favorite aspect of the film is the lighting.  This movie beautifully employs many different colors, shades and intensities of light which set the mood and lend a unique feeling to the film itself, something different than the 'normal' movie lighting we are generally subjected to.  Vin Diesel brings his character to life in an excellent manner, skillfully avoiding the routine portrayal of the hardened criminal.  After all, the film is about Riddick's (Diesel's character) personal journey, so thankfully Vin doesn't drop the ball.  The remainder of the cast (with the exception of the talented and gorgeous Claudia Black) were unknown to me but all turned in marvelous performances, animating the diverse characters with unique quirks and mannerisms.  Pitch Black is a perfect example of making a great film with out the resources of an excessive budget.  The special effects are more than adequate, but at the same time they are by no means the sole focus, as in many high budget 'blockbusters'.  It's a great movie because it uses Science Fiction as a medium to tell an engaging, provoking story, rather then telling a mediocre story to use the flash of Science Fiction."
"NightfallRaven","8","146","179","10 May 2005"," How to survive in pitch black?
","Pitch Black is a survival story. It's about how to survive in an hostile, alien world against even more hostile enemies. The task gets even more difficult when the nearest enemies can be found within your own surviving group.<br/><br/>The plot of Pitch Black is quite usual and has been seen several times before in different variations. But what makes this movie shine above others, is it's well-written characters.<br/><br/>The group consists of very different people with few more interesting than the others: Jack, a boy with a secret; Fry, a pilot having hard time with her own conscience; Johns, a bounty- hunter with a drug-habit; Imam, a holy man facing the fact that God is sometimes cruel and Riddick, a convict and a murderer learning to value others, not only himself. Characters start to live in the movie. They aren't only paper like in many other movies of this genre. You start to care for the characters, especially for Riddick though that feels quite odd. He is supposed to be the bad guy. In this movie, the line between light and pitch black is very thin. All characters are familiar with both.<br/><br/>Other thing that works in this movie is the casting. Rarely do actors fit to their roles this well. Radha Mitchell is suitable for Fry. Cole Hauser brings the right amount of cruelness and sense of responsibility for Johns. But the most impressive work is done by Vin Diesel. He does great job as Riddick. In his hands Riddick is quite creepy, definitely very dangerous and also deep character, just as he is supposed to be.<br/><br/>So, how do you survive in Pitch Black? Keep your friends close and enemies even closer."
"charles000","Null","40","47","28 September 2011"," This is a great film! If this is your genre', you won't be disappointed . . .
","I will admit, I was already a fan of Serenity, Riddick Chronicles and all that, so I did go into this film with a bit of predetermined anticipation. On the flip side, I'm not always that much of a Vin Deisel fan, in that he is somewhat mono-dimensional in his range of characters, but for the embodiment of Riddick, he does fit perfectly. As for the story and how it plays out, the pace is good, not too encumbered with gratuitous special effects and all that, but where it does fit, the CGI is well done and appropriate.<br/><br/>The one really glaring technical defect in this story is how everyone just gets out and starts walking around, breathing in the air without the slightest concern for differences in the atmosphere, microbes and so on, but this is a common flaw that is often somehow glossed over in many such stories, so I can't harp on that detail too much.<br/><br/>As for Radha Mitchell, she is smokin' hot here, not in a ridiculous or frivolous way, but as her tough, seasoned interplanetary merchant marine ship's captain character ""Fry"", she nails it perfectly. If anything, she very much reminds me of Andrea Osvart (see her as the Hungarian assassin ""Gilda"" in the film ""Two Tigers"").<br/><br/>Now, if these two ladies ever appeared together in a film, I would drop everything and go check that out in a heartbeat . . . but I digress.<br/><br/>In any case, I have no trouble with granting 8 stars to ""Pitch Black""."
"trehling","8","113","148","18 February 2000"," Interesting and entertaining with a good cast of mostly unknowns and great special effects.
","The opening scene of this movie is pretty incredible.  I've seen a number of sci-fi movies with great special effects but my roommate and I looked at each other after the opening sequence and he said plainly, ""sensory overload.""  The plot of the movie is pretty simple but the nice thing about this sci-fi movie is that it lets the audience figure out most of the technology for themselves instead of wasting time to ""subtly"" explain it. The creatures in this movie are also very interesting.  You don't get a really good look at them until about two thirds of the way through. Overall, a very entertaining movie."
"atalanta-3","10","64","82","6 June 2000"," Complex, detailed and immensely satisfying film
","This is without doubt the most exciting and satisfying film I've seen in years!   The plot seen in print is almost banal- a ship crashes on a desert planet with three suns, the survivors have to adjust to the landscape and each other, then darkness falls and the monsters appear.   Pilot Fry, after a moment of cowardice during the descent through the atmosphere when she almost jettisoned the passengers, takes charge of the group and enlists the help of convicted murderer Riddick to lead them through the darkness to the escape ship - he's the one with surgically enhanced eyes that can see in the dark.   But it's really not that simple - every character is complex, three-dimensional, with conflicting traits so you never quite know who's good and who's bad.<br/><br/>The performances are uniformly superb - Radha Mitchell shows Fry steeling herself for leadership, overcoming her own fears, and trying to prevent further bloodshed, while Cole Hauser, as the man taking Riddick back to custody, shows he has his own agenda and his own idiosyncratic standards. But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as Riddick - he has the most magnetic screen presence I've seen in years.   For much of the film his face is in shadow, and he doesn't actually say a great deal, but he draws your attention all the same.  Sometimes he draws your attention by not speaking - or by not moving.  And Diesel doesn't trivialise the character, as could so easily be done, by giving him a ""heart of gold"" - Riddick is still one mean and vicious man as they approach the ship - he just lets us glimpse those first tentative steps from caring only for the self to caring for others.<br/><br/>Technically the film is very good.  The lighting effects are excellent at both ends of the spectrum - the overbright triple sunlight and the pitch darkness.   Special effects showing both Riddick's and the monsters' points of view add to the suspense, as do sound effects of the monsters flying and using ultrasound to ""see"" (the monsters themselves are anatomically plausible and suitably frightening).  Editing is so tight it's almost jarring at times - there is literally no padding in this film, no fades, no time to re-orient yourself.<br/><br/>From the opening shot to the end of the credits you have to keep your wits about you.   Every scene, every line of dialogue, every single camera shot is important.   See it three times to understand it all.<br/><br/>My only caveat is about the science - the solar system as shown in the model is impossible (planets revolve around suns, not vice versa).   However, that doesn't affect the human story, so I haven't taken points off for it."
"HAZEL-5","10","178","245","20 February 2000"," The next Alien...
","From the first 10 seconds of Pitch Black I was hooked.  I had walked into this movie thinking that it would be just another cheesy sci-fi movie. Instead I found a highly entertaining, on the edge of your seat, thought provoking action film.  The movie goes beyond your basic special effects flick. The actors are amazing, Radah Mitchell (High Art, Love and other..) as Fry is truly a joy to watch on screen, while Vin Diesel as Riddeck is so captivating that you are dying just to hear him speak again.<br/><br/>The look of the movie is breath taking, the contrast of blues, yellows and oranges due to the three different suns is amazing. Followed by the complete darkness of nightfall. I would truly recommend any lover of the ALIEN movies or Radha Mitchell (which is why I went to see it) to check out this film. I'm sure by the end you'll look at the dark in a whole new way."
"MovieAddict2016","8","80","106","27 September 2003"," Surprisingly fun!
","I must say that I didn't expect much sitting down to watch ""Pitch Black,"" but I got a lot back, in terms of excitement and pure fun. It's the type of flick where you can just lean back, relax, and have a great time just being entertained. This isn't a deep film by any means. Everything that it offers is either recycled or ripped off of other movies such as ""Alien,"" ""Predator"" or such. But when I watch a rip-off, I want it to be good, and this rip-off is great. <br/><br/>It opens with a galaxy of stars. Some of the greatest films of all time open with this type of scene - ""2001,"" ""Star Wars,"" ""Alien,"" ""Predator."" A ship is cruising through space when inside the entire cryogenically frozen crew is awoken. The ship has been hit by something. They crash land on a nasty little planet with three suns. Everyone flocks out of the ship when they find that their prisoner transport, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), has escaped confinement. They scan the desert planet in search of him and eventually find him, but they have no way of getting their ship to fly again. They search the planet for water and civilization but it seems that everyone suddenly disappeared from the planet not too long ago.<br/><br/>Then they find out that every 22 years the planets line up in a solar eclipse and the entire planet turns pitch black. There also happen to be hoards of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet - what are the chances? They happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens - what are the chances? And Riddick has a rare talent - he can see in the dark - again, what are the chances?<br/><br/>There seems to be a lot of coincedence in this movie, but a film like this isn't out to get Oscars for originality or believability. It's there to entertain the audience - it does so with ease. Vin Diesel is a big gorilla of a man with no acting talent whatsoever. But I've got to say if there's anyone who can fit the part of a trashy, homicidal felon it is Diesel. Listen to him mutter, ""He did not know who he was fu**ing with."" Great stuff.<br/><br/>The aliens in this movie are a mix between hammerhead sharks, those from ""Alien"" and Predators. They've got long, horizontal heads like a hammerhead, the quick-moving agility of the aliens, and the stealth of a Predator. I assume David Twohy (director and writer of the movie) didn't expect audiences to believe his creatures were truly something never seen before. At least I hope not.<br/><br/>""Aliens Redux"" might be a better name for this movie, but then again, it is better than both the second and third ""Alien"" films put together. In a time when apparently ended series are getting revived - ""Terminator 3,"" ""Alien 5,"" ""Predator 3,"" ""Alien vs. Predator"" - ""Pitch Black"" stands out as a new series altogether. Two more sequels are planned. Let's just hope they don't get carried away. I can just picture it twenty-five years from now: ""Aliens vs. Predator vs. Pitch Black Aliens: *The Fight of the Year.""<br/><br/>*Fight of the Year title may be shared with the upcoming film ""Freddy vs. Jason vs. Michael vs. Leatherface vs. Norman Bates vs. Alien vs. Predator vs. Terminator vs. James Cameron vs. Barny the Dinosaur.""<br/><br/>4/5."
"mstomaso","8","76","102","10 September 2006"," Relentless and gorgeous sci-fi action film
","Let me waste a moment of your time to explain how I approached this film. 1st I dismissed the trailers out of hand because the film appeared to be an uncredited remake of Aliens, which I consider to be one of the weakest films in the Alien series. Stupidly continuing to dismiss the film after I heard positive things about it from people whose opinions I trust, I missed the theatrical run completely. I then became hooked on Farscape, in its 3rd or 4th season at the time, and found Pitch Black on cable one night around bed time - so I said ""oh why not, at least it has Claudia Black in it."" Soon, I recognized Keith David, and began to realize that Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser could all act (why this should surprise me, I do not know). I was captivated. I have now remained captivated for four years. I just watched the film for the 3rd or 4th time, and I still love it.<br/><br/>This is not an art film, not an independent, and its not entirely original, but where it fails to break a lot of new ground, it utterly succeeds in providing interesting, realistic characters, hard-driving action in the medium of a compelling but simple plot, and non-stop entertainment; an absolutely beautiful environment with tastefully rendered special effects. Sound to good to be true? Don't take my word for it... see it for yourself.<br/><br/>The film also highlighted the charisma of the now somewhat iconoclastic Vin Diesel, introducing the character of Richard Riddick. Diesel would go on to star in the somewhat Riddick-ulous Chronicles thereof (which I also enjoyed, though recognizing its rather huge flaws) and is now something of a legend. Diesel is so charismatic, so big, and so interesting to watch that it is easy to ignore the fact that he is not only a talented actor, but a smart one too. Checking out the DVD version of Pitch Black, with the audio comments on might just blow you away.<br/><br/>The film is about the crew of an inter-system transport ship stranded on an unknown planet after a crash-landing in which their captain was killed. The new commander is inexperienced but bright and heroic (Mitchell), but she is caught between two dominant and dangerous personalities - a bounty hunter with secrets (Hauser) and a dangerous criminal who has been surgically altered to see in the dark (Diesel). Is that all? Of course not - the planet is inhabited, and the inhabitants are hungry.<br/><br/>As unoriginal and improbable as some of this may be, Pitch Black is beautifully filmed, well told, and very nicely performed. Don't expect to learn anything, and don't expect to have to think a whole lot, but do expect to have fun with this modern sci-fi action classic."
"RaziaK","10","109","165","17 November 2004"," Amazing, one of the best sci-fi films ever.
","As a zombie fan, I really love these types of plots where people end up in strange places surrounded by wicked monsters! PB is also an excellent tie-in to Chronicles of Riddick (COR). The gang has to run as fast as they can away from darkness. There are so many metaphors in the story! Riddick is this bad guy, but he's also the hero who tries to save the slow-paced folks. The Muslim guy, Imam, relies on the sun's positions for the five times a day prayers, but he is stuck in a land where darkness will rule. Overall, I recommend this film to any sci-fi fans. You won't be disappointed."
"stephie-12","10","101","155","22 February 2004"," Best sci-fi movie ever!
","This movie is about the crew of a spaceship who crash land onto a strange bright planet with three suns.  Among the passengers is convicted serial killer, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel), and his nemesis, Johns (Cole Hauser). While the survivors of the wreck are getting their bearings, an eclipse of all three suns happens.  Shortly afterwards, scary creatures begin to appear and start to pick off the crew members one by one.  During the eclipse, Riddick comes into his own, as his eyeballs have been surgically shined, giving him night vision.  The crew have to rely on him to try to get them to safety.<br/><br/>This is a very stylish film, with the colour of the sky changing scene by scene, giving it a very strange look.  Vin Diesel is brilliant as Riddick, truly menacing but forced to help people who otherwise would only see him as a threat.  There is also an underlying humour in his performance as well, which adds another dimension to the character.  This is the sort of role that Vin excels in, the anti-hero, whos character is not as one-dimensional as first appears.  I can imagine no-one else in this role, it could have been written specifically for him.<br/><br/>Roll on Chronicles of Riddick!"
"lopcar1993","7","5","5","28 May 2009"," Not as good as it could have been, but a very good movie at that
","When I first saw ""Pitch Black"" about seven years ago I didn't know what to think of it, I thought it was a very good Sci-Fi horror flick and that was pretty much it, But now seeing it again I has a whole new meaning. Pitch Black is the first movie in the chronicles of Riddick series and it introduces the world to Riddick.<br/><br/>This film is not perfect, nor does it pretend to be, there's allot of bad dialog and sometimes the movie just seems to trail off in some places and doesn't follow a steady pace. But if you can over look that this Vin Diesel vehicle is pretty good.<br/><br/>Pitch Black offers you a new insight to the creature feature genre. Instead of dinosaurs , croc's and giant bugs it gives you a whole new species to fear and loath, with that this film delivers only good creature violence and some awesome CGI but besides that it's not much more that a loud clunking action film nothing more nothing less. But all in all Pitch Black is an enjoyable, if not at times absurd, action film."
"KristinaElora","10","30","43","28 January 2005"," A great character-driven, action packed Sci-Fi movie
","""Pitch Black"" was a complete shock to me when I first saw it back in 2000. In the previous years, I was repeatedly disappointed by all the lame sci-fi movies (Ex: STARSHIP TROOPERS) and thought that this movie wouldn't be any different. But to plainly put it: This movie freaked me out... in a good way. I wasn't aware that I was still afraid of the dark till I watched this movie; I must have buried my fear in the back of my subconscious when I was a kid and it rightfully deserves to stay there.<br/><br/>The alien creatures sent shivers up my spine; the individual(s) who designed them have a twisted but brilliant and creative imagination to come up with something so impressive and grotesque. <br/><br/>I loved how the writers gave each main character a history and showed their flaws and strengths without much confusion.<br/><br/>Riddick's (Vin Diesel) gift for escaping out of any impossible situation and putting up a hell of a fight was jaw dropping. At first, you figure him out to be a coldly intelligent villain but in some brief moments, you can see something humane behind his animal side. But as soon you discover it, he does something maliciously devious. He certainly keeps you guessing right up to the very end. I didn't know whether to despise or admire him... he's definitely a love/hate type of character.<br/><br/>Johns (Cole Hauser) was a perfect example of a character that puts up a good front but through a need for greed, shows his real intentions and what he's willing to do to survive. John's knack for knowing what buttons to push and the right words to say makes him as devious as Riddick.<br/><br/>Fry (Radha Mitchell) is a character who, as Johns so nicely expressed, looked to her thine own ass first before considering the consequences. But what's endearing about her is that she quickly realizes the errors of her ways and tries desperately to pay penance, even while endangering her life when others discarded all human values and went for the dark hills running.<br/><br/>Jack (Rhiana Griffith) simply wanted to have a hero and was the first one out of the whole group to look for that hero in Riddick; through a child's eye, good can be seen through the thick clouds of evil. I thought it was absolutely priceless when Jack shaves his head in ode to Riddick; you know what they say: Imitation is the best form of flattery.<br/><br/>Imam (Keith David), like Jack, has the ability to see good in any evil. He uses philosophy to carry him through the hardships that he meets and when time permits, he rationally grieves his losses and then soldiers on. In a way, he served as a morale booster for the survivors even though most of the characters acted as though they weren't listening.<br/><br/>The casting for this movie was positively perfect. Each actor shined brightly in their role and their talents blended wonderfully on-screen.<br/><br/>This movie may have had a small budget but the director's leadership and the actor's performances made the movie work and allowed the audience to use their imagination instead of letting some outrageously expensive Special Effects do all the work for them. This movie is a definite Sci-Fi classic. Watch it and judge (with an open mind) for yourself. It will be well worth it."
"bjmarsha","8","7","9","19 October 2010"," Should be a part of every Sci-Fi collection
","I love this movie. I agree with some other comments that this is simply a tried and true story, but it's done very well. Lighting is fun, especially in the beginning with the use of the blue/yellow suns, and of course the Predator-esquire look through Riddick's eyes, or the aliens' eyes once in awhile adds to the life of the movie. Special effects aren't mind blowing, but they do suffice nicely. Vin Diesel isn't a great actor, but unlike most other muscular bad-boy types, he's not terrible either, and he plays his character pretty well.<br/><br/>Overall, the only thing the plot really lacks is some extra development. Characters have lots of different personalities, but I think I could stand to see more of their quirks, so that I became a touch more invested in them before they all die off. I also think its too convenient that the same day they are hit by a rogue comet they also experience a once every 22 year event. I would have really enjoyed another 30-45 minutes of movie developing a short stay on the planet, maybe covering a week or so before the eclipse starts.<br/><br/>Overall, watch or buy this movie. It's by no means a classic, but it's an excellent film, and it's not the type of movie that after you see it once, you don't care to see it again."
"hostagtj","10","7","9","8 July 2004"," Less (FX) is more....
","Like Spiderman 2, this movie succeeds because if focuses on character development and emotion. FX and action do not overwhelm the story, but rather serve to advance the story and our investment in it, as good cinema should. Too bad Pitch Black 2 moved away from this formula! Radha Mitchell makes a substantial impact in a Sigourney Weaver (Ripley/Alien) role. But this is not an Alien knock-off.... Real, flawed characters in a morality play touching on issues spanning the existence of God to the redemption of even the most cold-blooded of killers. On more superficial levels, Pitch Black also serves as a good popcorn movie, with funky lighting effects, good tension, and cool creature FX...."
"PlanecrazyIkarus","Null","68","127","27 February 2002"," Forget the first half hour, then it's great!
","This film gets off to a bad start. An incredibly corny monologue is followed immediately by a brilliantly-done, truly amazing spaceship crash. Then things go downhill again, as you realize that the survivors are all a) bad actors (apart from the docking pilot and the psychopath) and b) almost all of them fit too nicely into the role of monster-fodder. Hell, half of them don't even speak English, preventing the audience from getting to know the characters at all. You feel as if you were watching ""Deep Blue Sea"" meets ""Silence of the Lambs"", minus the good bits. And unfortunately, the entire thing tries to hard to be ""Crashed on a desert planet with Hannibal Lecter"" during the daylight scenes. Vin Diesel is a great actor - but he is no Anthony Hopkins, and he frankly annoys as the smart hyper-cool psycho. There is at least one very good scene involving an unexpected survivor - but apart from that you could just as well have cut out the first thirty minutes or so...<br/><br/>But then things take a turn. I can't exactly pinpoint the moment, but soon the movie gets a lot better. It also feels less chopped - the scenes actually begin to follow each other with a consistent narrative, and Vin Diesel becomes much less annoying and soon he is a show-stealer. By the time the first monsters appear, the film is actually quite enjoyable. By the time night falls, it is great. Thrilling, horrifying and exciting. And even the character development of most main characters is well-done. If you can just sit through the poor bits at the start you're in for some GREAT entertainment. <br/><br/>Besides, the visuals are eye-candy, and I honestly admit: I love the colour and the tone of this movie. <br/><br/>7/10 (could have been 9/10, if only....)"

The story is engaging with good special effects. But the most amazing is the direction and the perfect casting of unknown actors and actresses. ""Pitch Black"" brought the attention of the audiences to Vin Diesel in his first success; Radha Mitchell, from ""Everything Put Together"" of the same year, is perfect in the role of Carolyn Fry; and the always efficient Cole Hauser and Keith David have also great performances. The noncommercial conclusion is also a plus of ""Pitch Black"". My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil) ""Eclipse Mortal"" (""Mortal Eclipse"")"
"LivingDog","10","53","105","31 October 2004"," Best Film Noir SciFi Ever!
","I really enjoyed this movie. It was edgy without being sociopath. Vin Diesel brought the Riddick character to life and made you feel good and bad about him on different levels.<br/><br/>I also saw Iron Giant and Vin is perfect. (The snowmobile movie - oh yeah, it's called ""Triple-X,"" or ""xXx"" - was a weak example of his work.) In Pitch Black he plays an anti-hero to the max. I don't think you can go wrong when Vin stars in a movie. Unfortunately, Hollowood might type cast him as an adventure action movie star - wrong! I think the script for ""XXX"" was weak for which Vin couldn't act down to it.<br/><br/>Anyway, Pitch Black is a great scifi - see it!<br/><br/>-Zafoid"
"charchuk","8","6","8","14 March 2007"," Impressive creature feature
","A nice twist on the Alien formula, with a surprisingly good script and a great performance by Vin Diesel. Riddick is one of the most likable anti-heroes in recent memory, and in this film he's given equal doses of hero and villain. The exposition is nearly perfect, introducing all the characters very well and setting up the story adequately. It moves a little too fast after that, though, bypassing a lot of the story in favour of quick kills. Still, the visuals are solid and the direction is quite innovative - I liked the high contrast showing how bright it was on the planet. Diesel carries the movie, but Radha Mitchell is pretty solid opposite him. Some pretty nice gore scenes too. Just a pretty good creature feature."
"jamesrupert2014","7","7","10","17 March 2018"," Good science-fiction adventure
","A crippled spaceship lands on a planet with three suns that only experiences darkness once every 22 years, things come out in the dark, and the crew must fight for survival, or die - that pretty much sums up ""Pitch Black"". The concept of a planet bathed in (almost) continuous light was the premise of Asimov's classic short story ""Nightfall"", but rather than being our own worst enemy, the ""Pitch Black"" planet is home to fierce, flying nocturnal carnivores. As space adventures go, this one is pretty good. The look of the glaringly illuminated desert planet is very well done and the various backgrounds (the bone filled canyon and the hollow towers for example) look great. The acting is what one would expect for this kind of movie, lots of gruff tough-guy posturing, semi-comic relief from the less-heroic characters, and the usual alien-chow that only live long enough to establish the threat. Vin Diesel's 'Riddick' character was so popular that he front-lined a couple of less-than-stellar 'sequels', but I didn't find that he was any more interesting that the rest of the main cast. Of course, the raison d'etre for this kind of film are the aliens, which, although usually only seen briefly, in the shadows, or through Riddick's enhanced eyes, are excellent. The plot does hang on some coincidences such as the crash occurring just hours before one of the rare eclipses and the abandoned geology base having an orrery (a somewhat archaic tool for an interplanetary mission) that conveniently explains the whole three-sun eclipse scenario, but those are minor problems in an otherwise pretty good story."
"allegra-sloman","7","8","12","29 July 2009"," A great ride!
","From the opening crash scene - a classic, even if it does mess around with the laws of inertia - to the closing scene, this is pulse pounding sci-fi horror with a bravura performance from Vin Diesel. The CGI and effects serve the plot, and not the other way around.<br/><br/>The critters are fantastic (although I have to wonder what they eat when there are no hoomins around).<br/><br/>As with all films like this, there are a couple of troubling plot holes, but far fewer per running foot of celluloid than the average George Lucas movie, and far, far fewer than average. The direction is taut.<br/><br/>Quibbles. Soundtrack is very derivative in spots. To keep the George Lucas comparison going, it's partly dumbed down John Williams. That said, the score has some great creepy parts too. Science quibble.. Low oxygen results in non existent flames and complete inability to run. Character quibble... Vin Diesel's character Riddick's unusual skillset is not explained enough for my satisfaction.<br/><br/>But heck, none of this was enough for my willing suspension of disbelief to get more than a few spare cables cut. If you don't normally watch SF movies this is definitely one to consider, and if you like SF horror this is a must see - in fact true horror buffs might find it tame.<br/><br/>I am variable in how squeamish I am. Some days I can handle pretty disgusting stuff and other days I can't. This movie has a couple of pretty scary scenes, but I didn't find any of it particularly disturbing, and Vin Diesel made the whole trip worthwhile, in this, his breakout role."
"fractalmama","10","9","14","30 June 2004"," delicious thriller
","As a dyed in the wool sci fi fan it has been years since I've seen anything come out of the Hollywood machine that was so smart and spine tingly at the same time (Carpenter's The Thing comes to mind). The CGI is great - mostly seamless, Diesel is a real sexy anti-hero and the dialogue really keeps things moving. Vin Diesel is a rare one that can pull off the stunts of an action sci fi thriller and not come across as a large block of wood with a toothy smile. I went after this movie when it came out following the career of Claudia Black from Farscape and found a new favorite in Diesel - but still waiting to see Black in a more substantial role. Now all that being said no film is without flaws and if you have watched enough sci fi or horror then the 'plot twist' at the end was lined up for us from the beginning but I for one didn't care in that I fell hook line and sinker for Riddick and wanted to find out what he would and wouldn't do and it was such a delicious way to get there. I'm greatly looking forward to Chronicles of Riddick and if you have the where with all to follow a character and not just a blockbuster then go check out Dark Fury too. It is a great segway and though brief is a good character study."

","When their spaceship crashes on an outskirts planet, fears mount in regards to an incarcerated convicted murderer who fled captivity in the crash, however, the crew and passengers soon find something far more terrifying on the planet itself in this action thriller with a sci-fi twist. Relatively simple as the premise may be, it is undeniably effective with the film's best moments coming from the crew and passengers scurrying about in fear of Vin Diesel's killer, accidentally shooting one another in the process. The tension is not quite the same once Diesel decides to unite with the group to overcome the vicious alien presence on the planet, but there is still plenty to ponder over as all concerned find it so hard to trust Diesel even in the face of a very real alien threat. As for the alien presence on the planet, it brings up a whole gigantic slate of unanswered, perplexing questions, particularly in relation to their allergy to sunlight. Then there is the amazing coincidence of the characters crash landing just before the planet is about to plunge into several days of complete darkness - but this is a pretty decent film when one focuses on trust/mistrust themes and the portrait of diverse individuals all banded together in the name of a common goal to survive. Diesel is very good too in the role that really kick-started his career; he has an awesome line towards the end about saying good night, and with his blacked-out contact lenses and designer goggles, his character leaves an indelible impression that lasts long after the movie has ended."
"sddavis63","7","5","7","9 July 2009"," A Very Pleasant Surprise; Good Performance By Vin Diesel
","Exciting and interesting from the start, I have to say that while I approached this movie with at best limited expectations I came away from it pleasantly surprised. Vin Diesel is not really my cup of tea as an actor, but in fact he put on a very good performance in this futuristic sci-fi drama as Richard Riddick, a convicted murderer who's being transported to prison on a spaceship that crashlands on a strange alien world. Once there, the survivors discover that there are terrifying creatures who come out only in the dark, which at first doesn't seem much of a problem since the planet has three suns and is never dark. They then discover, though, that the planet is about to go into an eclipse, plunging it into complete darkness for an unknown length of time, and releasing the creatures to hunt them down.<br/><br/>Diesel's Riddick ends up as the hero of the movie, because he has surgically enhanced eyesight that allows him to see in the dark, and so he takes on the task of leading the others to safety. This movie is at times frightening, and on the odd occasion graphic, but not gratuitously so. A lot of effort was put by director David Twohy into developing the character of Riddick, and into portraying the change as the others slowly learn to trust him with their lives. I thought it slowed down a bit in the last third or so of the movie, and somehow became less interesting once the creatures were actually released by the eclipse. There seemed to be far more suspense as the survivors tried to figure out some of the mysteries of the planet and as they faced the approaching darkness. Once the darkness came, in some ways the movie became a pretty standard sci-fi monster type of movie. Still, it was a lot better than I had expected it to be. 7/10"
"malmroes","7","5","7","4 July 2008"," Good movie which takes a new approach to the sci-fi genre
","Even though this movie starts off with the usual: something goes wrong, spacecraft crashes, people are stranded etc. it still pulls off and introduces the viewer to some new ideas. Riddick is somewhat of a bad-ass convict and has modified his eyes so he is able to see in the dark which is a much sought after ability due to the situation the ship-crew and he gets in. The cutting in the movie is very good and emphasizes the mystique that shrouds around the anti-hero and male protagonist: ""Riddick."" The story in Pitch Black is, as already mentioned, to some extent very unoriginal and dissatisfied, but the clipping and cutting in the movie blended with some surprising elements which has been added to the story helps it to still support itself very well and one is afterward left behind with a hybrid feeling of satisfaction and hunger for more. Vin Diesel acts really well in the role as Riddick and even though his character is a hardcore, tough survivor he still takes morale decisions almost on the verge of good, but that does not mean his decisions do not turn in his favor at the very end... Why destroy an already perfect reputation? All in all this is a very good movie though not perfect. The story seems very unoriginal at the surface, but underneath it shines with enough originality to entertain. Some scenes has that wow factor while it as a whole is a bit better than average. It could maybe be described as a cult movie and it is definitely a recommendation for people who wants a spiced up sci-fi story blended with some minor psychological moments and an intriguing protagonist, namely Riddick."
"efrench","10","5","7","15 February 2007"," a captivating film
","This is an often under-appreciated film. True, it's a sci-fi/horror film, generally not a genre which churns out many great movies. Also true, the sequels - Dark Fury and Chronicles of Riddick - aren't killer films. The concept, as far as science fiction goes, isn't that original either. The core of main characters and atmosphere of the film however, are why I rate it 10/10. Radha Mitchell plays the convincing protagonist ""Fry"" with great emotional involvement, drawing in viewers' sympathies along with their respect. Vin Diesel seems so natural as the cold and cynical prisoner Riddick it's almost frightening - Diesel was born for this role. Cole Hauser completes the trio of characters with an exceptional job as Riddick's captor Johns, a truly multi-dimensional and conflicted character whose interaction with Riddick makes for the most intriguing aspect of the movie. The atmosphere of this film is likewise exceptional, especially with regard to the contrasts presented between light and dark, and between the openness of the desert and the claustrophobia conjured up by the canyon. What a movie."

He's amazingly captivating as Riddick, a convict. You keep wanting to see more of him.<br/><br/>Second the story is amazing. I'm quite a sci-fi fan and i've seen quite a few cheezy scripts but this was truly first class. Each character has something hidden from everyone else.

","Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy and collectively written by Twohy and Ken and Jim Wheat. It stars Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, Claudia Black and Rhiana Griffith. Music is by Graeme Revell and cinematography is by David Eggby. <br/><br/>The year 2000 was awash with sci-fi movies, not all were stellar of course, but siting at the top end of the scale was this, Twohy's super slice of action/horror/sci-fi cake. <br/><br/>Right from the off we are thrust on board the cargo ship Hunter- Gratzner, which as it happens is plummeting through space. The ship has been hit by meteorite debris and junior officer Caroline Fly (Mitchell), after coming out of hyper sleep, manages to crash land on a nearby planet. Only a handful of passengers survive the crash, including infamous convict Richard B. Riddick (Diesel), but as the survivors struggle to cope with the threat from within the group, it becomes apparent that there's a bigger threat soon to join the party, a deadly alien species, a species that can only operate in the dark. Pity, then, that an eclipse is due... <br/><br/>Okies, so lets get the obvious out in the open right away, Pitch Black is a variant of Alien, one of a ream of films that grabbed the coat tails of Ridley Scott's game changer. Yet this is still a fresh movie, a lesson in low budget film making with grace, style, blood, brains and balls - the execution grade ""A"" from those involved. <br/><br/>It's maybe surprising given the synopsis, to find that it's a very character driven piece, with Twohy continually building his characters even as the carnage and terror is unleashed - and these are a very diverse bunch of characters. One of the universe's baddest criminals, a spunky lady officer having to take command, a morphine addicted bounty hunter, an Islamic priest and his young companions, a camp alcoholic and a couple of strays. It's the not so wild bunch, but everyone of them are afforded chance to impact on the story before and during the inevitable picking off one by one at the claws of the beasts. <br/><br/>The narrative strength comes via Diesel's hulking convict, he's double jointed and has had optical surgery so he can see his enemies in the dark! The group must come to rely on him for he is clearly their best hope of survival, but can he be trusted? What is his ultimate ulterior motive? Riddick is the épée to Fry's foil, it's at times like a devil and angel trying to become one in the simple name of survival. These crux characters lift the simple premise to greater heights, that Mitchell (sexy/vulnerable/hard/smart) and Diesel (moody/beefy/gravelly/menacing) are bang on form helps no end. As does the work of the tech department. <br/><br/>The setting created here is a splendid veer from one of the curses of sci-fi films, that of an unbelievable world. Twohy, Eggby and the art department achieve a world of 3 suns, of a scorched barren landscape, with the photography switching between bleached and metallic filters for maximum sci-fi impact. While the effects work belies the budget, check out the pre-eclipse sequence. What of the creatures themselves? They are legion, a sort of pterodactyl nightmare who let out high pitched bleats, they smell blood and move at high speeds, and like Riddick they have special vision in the dark, it's the light that they are afraid of, thus this gives our survivors a glimmer (ahem) of hope in how to stave them off... <br/><br/>The science and logic is hokey, but so what? This is a classy and taut sci-fi film brought about by a very under valued director, one that puts many a bigger budgeted Hollywood production to shame. Come the finale, where there's still time to have your draw dropped, you may be minus nails and on the edge of your seat. 9/10"
"lewiskendell","8","6","9","24 September 2010"," Unexpectedly good sci-fi.
","""Finally found something worse than me, huh?.""<br/><br/>I'm somewhat of a rabid Radha Mitchell fan (the woman is gorgeous and talented; she should be a much bigger star), so seeing her in a solid, gritty sci-fi/horror flick like this is a pretty good use of two hours for me.<br/><br/>The basic story is about a transport ship (piloted by Mitchell's character) that is forced to crash land on an unknown planet. A planet that happens to be inhabited by deadly, light- sensitive predators that come out to feast every twenty-two years when a cosmic event shields the planet from its three suns for a time. One of the passengers of the ship also happens to be a deadly, light-sensitive predator (Vin Diesel) on his way back to the maximum-security prison world that he escaped from. The rest of the crash survivors are forced to rely on Riddick because of his ability to see in the dark and his natural survival instincts, but will he ultimately help them escape, or leave them to their dark fates?<br/><br/>Pitch Black isn't perfect. There are a few rather large plot holes (What do the beasts do for the rest of the twenty-two years, just hang out? And what do they live off of on such a barren planet?), but nothing that really took me out of the story. Some of the characters are overly dumb, annoying, or inexplicably antagonistic, but such story devices and character archetypes come along with the genre, more often than not. The special effects and monster designs do look their age, but that can be forgiven in a movie that's more than eleven years old, and they're really not any worse than what you'd see today on the average made-for-TV sci-fi flick. On the other hand, the filmmakers did do a good job of using visual trickery to make the outback of Australia where the movie was filmed look a lot like a harsh, alien world, and on a small budget I'm assuming. So they get props for that.<br/><br/>As for what I liked about Pitch Black, it was a pretty entertaining ride. Mitchell was great as the flawed, conflicted pilot unceremoniously promoted to leader, and Diesel was well- suited for Riddick, who's really the main character of the movie. There are likable characters to get attached to and fear for, several tense situations (though calling the movie scary would be a stretch), and a solid amount of action. <br/><br/>All in all, Pitch Black was a pleasant surprise. I was more impressed with Diesel than I've been at any other movie of his that I've seen, and none of the lesser elements of the movie are significant enough to stand out much. Recommended."
"michaeljharvey","7","6","9","1 June 2008"," Believe it or not, this is a good movie
","Yes, this is a B-movie, but that doesn't mean it can't be good. The plot is nothing remarkable, but still works. A spaceship carrying a mixed bag of characters crash lands on a desert planet. Of course, the survivors are not alone and are soon in a battle for their lives against strange bat-like aliens.<br/><br/>What works here is the writing and character development. Vin Diesel is surprisingly good as the clever and philosophical Riddick. He's a dangerous convict turned reluctant savior. The supporting cast does a great job of bringing dimension to characters that could easily have been overly simplistic. What drives the movie is the constant uncertainty about the main characters' true motivations. Riddick is particularly hard to figure out and in the end it's hard to say he's really a ""good"" guy. His character is far more complex than that.<br/><br/>The special effects are strictly mediocre, but the director seemed to understand this. So the creatures are mostly kept in shadows, helping to avoid those, ""That looks so fake!"" moments. The actual design of the bat-like creatures is clearly ""inspired"" by Giger's design for the movie Alien. They certainly could have been more original, but they get the job done. At least the special effects people decided to rip-off an all-time classic movie monster design.<br/><br/>The story moves along at a good pace, never feeling too rushed or too slow and keeps the viewer on edge. It's usually pretty obvious who the survivors will be in this type of movie (where characters are being picked off one by one), but this one surprised me a little at the end. Overall, this is a good effort and far better than a lot of big budget sci-fi action movies."
"NicolasCostoglou","10","2","2","29 March 2017"," Pitch Perfect entertainment...
","David Twohy is one of my favourite directors/writers today. He makes only movies he wrote himself, and they are always unique in some way. He often takes scientific ideas and uses them to make movies which are in a special genre and does something different with it.<br/><br/>And Pitch Black is one of the many times where this premise worked perfectly. It's a sci-fi-horror film about a ragtag group of survivors who crashed on a desert planet and have to survive.<br/><br/>SOunds simple? Well it is, and that's a strong point of the film, because the premise is simple and doesn't seem that original at first, but the mystery aspect of this film is what makes it great. Nearly every character has something to hide, and so does the planet which isn't as lifeless as one might think...<br/><br/>The actors are all very good, most of all Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel. Mitchells character feels guilty the whole way through, because she wanted to drop all of the passengers to get a better chance to land the ship, but it didn't worked and now everyone greets her for saving them, and want her to be the new leader. And Diesels character is by far the most interesting Anti-Hero since Snake Plissken (who Diesel said he used as a inspiration. You can't take your eyes off the screen when he's there.<br/><br/>But one of the things you have to talk about in a David Twohy movie is the unique style. The movie is edited like all of his movies in a kind of ""push it to the Limit!"" mentality, which is never too distracting, but underlines the intensity of the scenes effectively. Also the cinematography and colors are amazing. The day scenes with the three suns look like you would dry out, and breakdown instantly because of the heat, and the night scenes are fantastically realized (which is very hard to do) and the movie really earns it's title.<br/><br/>Also very great: The movie is mostly centered around the characters and how they will get out of the situation, or even if they won't kill each other beforehand, and not so much focused on action, or horror. There are also no jump scares in the film or any other horror-bull crap, it's fairly suspenseful and character driven.<br/><br/>That the movie was a fairly low budget doesn't hurt it in any way, the creative way the film is directed by Twohy, prevents it from looking cheap, and the visual effects are just used then needed and aged incredibly well, most of all, of the way they use them.<br/><br/>All in all, one of the most intense, dark and unique Sci-Fi-Horror movies you'll see..."

"troyputland","7","2","2","23 May 2015"," Little originality but still a decent thriller.
","Pitch Black is a decent cross-genre movie, that ups the ante the deeper it goes. Starting as a fight for survival, PB is an upheaval of frights for the marooned party we know so little about, on an unknown planet after their plane crashes. With limited food, water and no shelter, the odds are against them, especially with a known murderer in their midst. The temperature drops, sun begins to fade, and the creepy crawlies come out to play. Pitch Black holds no originality to its name, displaying facets of thrillers like Alien and Predator. The computer-generated beasts riddling the survivors' breathing space are imaginative; covered by the darkness to make our imaginations run wild, but also to hide the fact the CGI is below par. The darkness settles, scaring them and us respectively. One terrifyingly cool scene sees the group fending off hordes of monsters with big glow sticks. At the time in 2000 none of the actors were glowing stars. This means everyone and no one can survive, from Diesel's hard-edged mystery man to Radha Mitchell's likable captain. All you need to know is what's right in front of you. Like other thrillers, the who's and the hows aren't necessary."
"Tweekums","7","2","2","13 July 2009"," Be afraid of the dark
","It is possible to look at this film as a cheap imitation of the Alien franchise, this however would be unfair as it is a decent science fiction monster film in its own right.<br/><br/>The film opens with a spaceship being holed when it flies through a shower of small yet deadly meteors, the surviving crew wake up to find themselves plunging towards a desert planet. Carolyn Fry, the pilot is forced to start jettisoning the cargo and would also jettison the passengers if a fellow crew member hadn't stopped her. Luckily she and a handful of the passengers survive, including Riddick, an escaped convict being transported back to prison. Once safely on the ground the survivors start to explore the surrounding desert hoping to find much needed water. They find an apparently abandoned settlement which has an escape shuttle, they also find that there is something dangerous there which attacks in the dark. This shouldn't be a problem as the planets three suns ensure perpetual daylight apart from a period of eclipse which occurs every twenty two years, one can guess how long it was since the last eclipse. As the escape shuttle is out of fuel they must race back to the crash site to get the required power cells. By the time they are ready to return the eclipse has started so their solar powered vehicle will no longer work meaning they must get back on foot, all the time avoiding the deadly alien creatures while never being totally sure which of their own group can be trusted.<br/><br/>The cast did a good job, I especially liked Radha Mitchell's performance as the Pilot Fry. Vin Diesel's portrayal of Riddick was decent enough too. The special effects worked well, making the creatures genuinely scary. There is also a nice twist involving one of the survivor which I won't spoil here. To get the full effect of this film watch it in the dark."
"alex-brooks6","8","2","2","17 October 2006"," A good prequel.
","I'll begin with a brief outline of the general storyline.<br/><br/>A transport ship, known as the Hunter-Gratzner, while travelling through space, is hit by a sudden meteor shower, and is forced to crash-land upon a desert planet. A scorching-hot planet with three suns, no water and no apparent wildlife. Just barren rock for miles, and eternal light. The few survivors from the crash (a group of Muslim pilgrims on Hajj, a jump-pilot, a mercenary,a band of settlers, an alcoholic entrepreneur and an escaped convict) salvage what they can from the ship, now damaged beyond repair. During their explorations of their surroundings, they discover the planet is scheduled for an eclipse, where an orbiting planet crosses in front of the suns, casting the world into pitch-darkness. I won't spoil the rest for you.<br/><br/>The surprising thing about this film is that it was produced under quite a tight budget and schedule, yet it yielded extremely good results publicly. Scoring no marks for unpredictability, yet 10/10 for originality, this movie introduced the deep and mysterious character of Riddick, and acts to fill in the background and history of this certain individual. Unlike its unplanned and extremely overrated sequel, this film earned Vin Diesel the reputation he deserves, along with its Director David Twohy.<br/><br/>8/10 in my opinion."
"JimmyZappa","8","2","2","14 July 2006"," Pitch Black - An Enjoyable SCIFI/Action flick
","Pitch Black is a very unusual movie. While action at its core, with Vin Diesel as Riddick (as Bruce Willis was to John McClane, Ah-nold Schwarzenegger was to the Terminator, Sylvester Stallone was to Rambo, and (more notably) as Sigourney Weaver was to Ellen Ripley), this movie somehow take a generic spin on SCIFI and make it incredibly captivating.<br/><br/>While I thought the beginning was kind of slow to start and a little ""meh"" considering the writers threw in Muslim stereotypes and other generic spaceship cadets, with Riddick being the only one who stood out as the more interesting one out of the bunch, that all changes 15 minutes into the film. As the movie stretches out and reveals what exactly is going on, the cast becomes more captivating. Cole Hauser (William J. Johns), Keith David (Abu al-Walid), and Rhiana Griffith (Jackie) are the ones I grew to like over the course of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is not particularly strong thanks to the weak performances given by supporting cast members like Radha Mitchell (who's current claim to fame among fans is 'Rose Da Silva' in the 2006 Silent Hill movie) while Vin seems to come out okay and pop out the occasional 'one-liner' joke when he's not trying to be the ""cold-as-steel"" badass.<br/><br/>One of the things that I liked were the different hues used to portray the different parts of the world (which is inhibited by three different suns). I imagine some people wouldn't like that and will find it distracting, but I wouldn't agree. I think it gives the movie an interesting ""edge"" and makes it a little more captivating to look at.<br/><br/>By the end of the movie, I came to really like it. Despite the fact I didn't care for the sequel, Chronicles, Pitch Black actually made me walk away with satisfaction. While it's not the best SCIFI film i've ever seen, and it didn't have the best story or action either, for what it was and how it performed it...it was all worth the entire view. I recommend a rental, if anything."
"paul2001sw-1","7","2","2","2 October 2005"," Doesn't eclipse 'Alien'
","There have been few films as influential as 'Alien' and the first thing to say about 'Pitch Black' is how closely it follows the template laid down by that groundbreaking film. An ensemble cast of characters, landed in circumstances unknown by presumed hostile, try to keep their cool in the face of a growing but undefined sense of unease, but in the finale have to fight to the death with aliens (and traitors among themselves); not all will survive. Add to that a grungy, poorly lit aesthetic and you might consider the film almost a carbon copy. But if you're going to copy a film, then copying one known for it's atmosphere of claustrophobic tension is not such a bad idea, and there's a lot of original detail in 'Pitch Black' as well, some of it good, other bits less so. For example, the central idea is of a spaceship crashing on planet bathed in near-permanent light, thanks to three suns; but on which, like a desert in the rain, all sorts of things come alive when (every twenty years or so) there's a solar eclipse. The three suns also provide three alternative colours of light (before the darkness strikes, of course), which allows director David Twohy three visions for the price of one; but he doesn't seem quite to know what to do with this gift, and while the colour of the world changes from yellow to blue to red, it's unclear what this adds to the film except for a superficial jumpiness. As for the indoor scenes, shot unfailing in half-light only, the use of semi-darkness as a cheap way of creating an air of menace has surely not been this overdone since David Fincher's 'Se7en'. <br/><br/>As for the characterisation, the dynamics of a group whose members have their own selfish agendas are well portrayed, but the film lets itself down by making clear its sympathies for two crew members over the others, especially as the two characters it favours are essentially the least believable: vin Diesel's super-criminal Riddick, and the unlikely babelicious ship's commander, played by Radha Mitchell. While the moral darkness of the plot's conclusion is offset by the willingness to grant vin Diesel corny, Schwarzenegger-style lines, usually involving at least one word starting with the letter 'f'. Another flaw is Twohy's exaggerated preference for constant cross-cutting between scenes, which sometimes increases the tension, but sometimes makes the film appear more like a pop video than a movie. He undoubtedly succeeds in capturing an interesting look, but only at the price of also acquiring a certain corollary shallowness.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this certainly is not a wholly original film. But it looks good, and is plenty scary. Moreover, the whole somehow feels a little more distinctive than the individual parts. Still, one can't help but feel, this movie is just 'Alien' with better special effects, less judiciously used."

When a strong willing beautiful pilot (Radha Mitchell) discovers that the planet, it's turns dark every 20 years and there's a pack of terrifying creatures hide from underground, because their weakness is the light. Once it turns dark, the creatures come out from their hiding places and attacking the survivors.

","My wife and I watched this movie last night, and we both thoroughly enjoyed it.  This movie received lots of bad reviews, but I think they missed the intent.  This is not a deep thinking science fiction movie.  This is nice effects, cool looking creatures, good sound effects, and a pretty decent cast.  The acting is definitely carried by Vin Diesel; however, since the other characters are (at best) supporting characters - who cares.  If you want sci-fi high cinema, watch 2001.  If you want a good time, watch Pitch Black"

","I, surprisingly, truly enjoyed Pitch Black. It was an exciting, well-acted and visually impressive film. I was particularly impressed with newcomer Vin Diesel. His strength, both physically and in presence, carried the film in the few scenes without the monsters. Which brings me to another point: the monsters. Those just blew me away. They were truly intimidating, creativly designed, and well animated. I reccomend Pitch Black not only to sci-fi fans (which I am not) but to anyone who apreciates a decent action film."

","Pitch Black is an above average horror sci fi that goes a little bit further than just good special affects. The story is about a group of people who crash land on a planet which is occupied by  crazed aliens that live and hunt in the dark. It just so happens that they land when the planet is set for its 22 yearly eclipse , hense setting these blood crazed loose. The thing i like about this film apart from the story is that you never quite know who are the nice guys. The human's characters change throughout leaving you not sure who you want to die! The cast are unknown's (unknown to me anyway) but this does not distract from the film, Vin Diesel coming out of this film with top marks but i wish he would change his name! Not bad. 7 out of 10."

","This has to have been one of the worst films I've ever seen. I only went to see it because one of my friends wanted to, and we both left mad because we had just blown ten dollars on this movie. The aliens are far from original (They look like the ones in Alien), and most of the characters are about as interesting as cardboard (which is a shame, since one of my favorite sci-fi actresses-Claudia Black-plays one of those characters). Riddick is just about the only character that has any dimension, and it is not explored very well. Take my advice: Do NOT see Pitch Black. It's two hours of your life you'll never get back."

Alien is a sci-fi classic. This steaming pile is a B movie at best that Alan Smithee would be mortified to be associated with.

","In this sci-fi action flick, a spacecraft full of youthful, photogenic people crash lands on a desert world lorded over by hostile creatures that have an aversion to light. The script does a nice job of allowing the space travelers to change as the plot progresses, or rather for their true selves to emerge, as a result of the alien threat. But we never really get to know the characters in any depth, and I was indifferent to all of them.<br/><br/>Lack of depth is noticeable in this film. The premise lacks scientific credibility, and the screenplay has a couple of obvious plot holes. There is no cerebral message or subtext that I could discern; there is nothing to think about or ponder. The film is pure escapist entertainment, with an accent on high quality special effects. Visually, the film strikes me as a cross between ""Alien"" and ""The Road Warrior"".<br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" will appeal to viewers who like fast action sci-fi films that emphasize visuals, not dialogue. The film also will appeal to people who have no need to infer, contemplate, question, analyze, or read between the lines. What you see is what you get."
"WilsonLau","1","18","37","27 October 2000"," What were they thinking?
","This was quite possibly the worst movie I've seen this year and this is not exactly the best year for movies. The story line was interesting but the characters were one dimensional and boring. The ways the characters reacted to their spaceship crashing on an unknown planet was like they just woke up and were like, hey were on a strange freaky planet we're not suppose to be on, and oh yeah theres some booze. Like they didn't really care, like its something that occurs to them every day. That certainly was really unrealistic. I think anyone would be in shock. And they just happen to have a guy who can see very well in the dark. How convienent! Yeah I know a whole bunch of those people. And I know someone who can breathe underwater to save me just in case I'm drowning. Another part of the movie that displayed how poor the directing was handled was in one scene they are walking towards this abandoned station, theres a few buildings there and a spaceship, then they're coming back to their own spaceship and suddenly out of nowhere they have this space car that their driving around. What is this some kind of magical movie? Where we're supppose to fill in all the holes in the plot ourselves? The sad thing is that there are people who actual liked this movie. What kind of world are we living in?"
"bridgesofsighs","4","9","16","2 March 2018"," Interesting idea, poor execution
","The premise of this movie had a lot of potential, but it didn't meet my expectations.<br/><br/>The characters were either completely forgettable or annoying. Some of them died because of their stupid decisions as if the characters only existed to embody negative character traits. For example, two characters started fighting each other while being surrounded by aliens. Another character went crazy from fear and messed up the lights that were keeping the characters safe. I didn't feel scared at all, because I didn't care about what happened to the characters.<br/><br/>In fact, I kept hoping someone would kill Riddick, because he was so unlikable. I feel like I'm missing an inside joke, because there are so many reviews praising him. He crashed the ship, killing most of the people on board. His lines were cheesy and edgy, his glasses looked silly, and his night-vision made him an obvious plot device. Even at the end he was still playing mind games with the female lead (whose name I forgot) and wanted to abandon the other survivors, showing that he hadn't got redeemed at all. The worst part is that his casual attitude made me feel like he was never in any danger. He was a male Mary Sue who had the plot revolving around him. Characters in horror movies shouldn't seem invulnerable.<br/><br/>Also the planet didn't make any sense. Why would the dominant species on a planet that experiences constant day be scared of daylight? The planet didn't get enough eclipses to let the aliens come to the surface to hunt regularly. If they hunted all other species to extinction, what were they eating between the crash-landings? Each other? Then their population should be shrinking and not be so massive. The problem could have been fixed by giving the planet extremely long days followed by extremely long nights, like some real planets have."

","I don't say surprisingly because I don't like SF movies; more because cheap SF movies tend to be kind of bad -- and they certainly never challenge social norms.<br/><br/>But then comes Pitch Black: four Muslim characters who are not terrorists (I'm looking at you, True Lies, and any season of 24), plus, and this is the biggie, a movie that acknowledges that women menstruate! I haven't seen that since ... actually, I've never seen that ever, unless you count embarrassing high school ""Now You Have Become A Woman"" movies.<br/><br/>Also, Vin Diesel has never been hotter. Call me shallow, but those arms make me (when I'm not actually menstruating) (ok, I lie, pretty much all the time) those arms make me go squee. I'm only human.<br/><br/>Anyhoo, I'm sure that there are people who will compare this movie to Alien, but really, it's completely different, and it's well worth seeing if you enjoy the SF thriller genre, or, indeed, if you just enjoy your basic thriller that's well paced, has hot guys, chicks who kick arse.<br/><br/>One small criticism: I felt that it was a little bit anti-Australian. And to be honest, I'm a little tired of the way Australians are portrayed in the movies and in the main stream media. Some of us prefer to de-nasal our accent.

There are a few things that made this movie really lame. First of all, they crash-land on a planet with three suns. This is simply impossible. If a planet orbited three suns, it would have one hell of a bizzarre looking orbit, not to mention some really screwed up gravity. Second, let's not even get into the odds of a nitrogen-based atmosphere way out in the galactical boonies. In other words, how could they breathe? Finally, I loved the wonderful ""Soylent-Green""-esque camera tinting. Please, hollywood, or wherever these half-baked movies come from, stop.

","I saw ""Pitch Black"" when it first came out in 2000, i loved it back then & i still love it now!!!
It's a great mix of Horror & sci-fi with lots of suspense & a nice deserted eerie atmosphere.
Vin Diesel is Awesome & Cool as hell as tough Criminal ""Riddick"" he's like a character from the universe of ""John Carpenter"" a little bit of the iconic ""Snake Pliskin"" is in there & the fact he's an Anti-Hero with a criminal past!!! Vin is great in this role & this was my first introduction to the cool voiced future Action star, we also have an excellent ensemble cast with Vin, we've got the always good ""Keith David"" a star of John Carpenters ""The Thing"" & ""They Live"" & we have in the form of a tough chick ""Radha Mitchell"" as the 2nd main lead & she's great but for me the 2nd best character & performance after ""Riddick"" comes from the excellent Cole Hauser as ""Johns"" the equally tough & troubled Bounty hunter transporting his prisoner ""Riddick"" back to civilisation, it's a great intense & lively role for the underrated Hauser as he goes from cool,calm & in control to panicked & Angry often, he's a really interesting & conflicted character he's sly & corrupted by not totally evil, a great performance.<br/><br/>The Creatures are Awesome looking, Night time sharp looking bat & shark type things, a really cool monster design & very creepy creatures that move very quickly & hunt in the dark.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is an Awesome old school type of Sci-fi Horror film, it could've easily come out in the 80's as it's got that look & vibe to it, the lost desert planet they crash on looks like the wastelands of ""Mad Max"" so it's got a real cinematic vision that feels like we know it!!!
There's plenty of excellent action scenes & plenty of cool monster attacks & some cool character bits especially the fight between ""Riddick"" & ""Johns"" a cool little scene.<br/><br/>All in all ""Pitch Black"" is a Gem of the sci-fi Horror genre, it fits in there with films like ""Aliens"" ""Predator 1&2"" & other Classic's of that genre.<br/><br/>I've loved this since the vhs days & it's one of those films that if you haven't seen it in years, you watch it & can't believe how good it is!!!
Definitely nothing less than a true cult classic but deserves to be a Sci-fi Horror Classic like ""Aliens 1986"""

","Not in order The crash landing...I see where Star Wars Ep.3 garnered inspiration from. The blood thirsty creatures. Cleverly displayed dark and fleeting; there's 3 scenes I saw them in detail. I still debate which species is worse the 1979 Alien or these guys...still can't decide. Anywhoo I love their deceptively sweet whale-esquire sounds and how relentless and by and large unstoppable.<br/><br/>The Characters: My favorites (in order) Fry, Jack, the leader of the New Mecca pilgrims then Riddick. My one trouble with the film and I had this with Chronicles of Riddick--Most the time I don't understand what Diesel is saying first hearing his lines; I have to listen at least three times. But that's just me--He's the funniest one in the film. Except for 2 of them (both a bit overly depended on controlled substances), I was sad when they were offed.<br/><br/>Now number 1 The whole eclipse sequence and the rise of the beast. Wow! Especially the eclipse--I've keep going back on it beginning to end."
"cchase","9","3","4","5 December 2008"," ""We Don't Need Another Hero?"" - Don't Worry...He's Not One...
","People who thought that THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK sucked harder than the black hole that swallowed up EVENT HORIZON, probably didn't see the movie that spawned Vin Diesel's skin-headed killer to begin with, and probably have no intention of doing so. Too bad, because PITCH BLACK actually does kick major ass.<br/><br/>Directed by genre vet David Twohy, (WARLOCK and the excellent but underrated BELOW) and written by siblings Jim and Ken Wheat (LIES, SILENT SCREAM), PITCH BLACK begins with an 'ALIEN'-esque prologue. When a combination cargo freighter/passenger ship is badly damaged by a freak meteor shower (in which the captain is also killed), the co-pilot, Carolyn Fry (SILENT HILL'S Radha Mitchell) has an important decision to make: ditch the cargo or the passengers? Close to picking ore over occupants, the crash landing derails her ultimate course of action.<br/><br/>No matter, because the catastrophic landing has been made on a foreboding rock that once held a mining colony. Amongst the survivors are a couple of settlers, Shazza (FARSCAPE's Claudia Black) and Zeke (John Moore); an Imam (Keith David) and his young followers (can you say ""red shirts"" boys and girls?); an antiques dealer named Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald); a 'young boy' named Jack (Rhianna Griffith), and the most controversial members of the group: a Marshall named Johns (the excellently slimy Cole Hauser) and his prisoner...a dangerous murderer named Riddick (Diesel). <br/><br/>How the group dynamics shake out make for a lot of the dramatic tension, especially with concerns about Riddick and how many people he might slice and dice if he ever gets away. But no one here gets out alive, as the saying goes, and the biggest twists have less to do with how they get along, than how they'll survive when they discover the unthinkable. They are not alone on the planetoid. Things that are hungry, taloned and quick are slithering around just where they can't be seen, living in the darkness where they can survive and thrive. They want the flesh of the new arrivals to sate their appetites, but they can't come out into the searing daylight to forage for food.<br/><br/>Does the phrase ""total eclipse"" make things a little more interesting? You betcha. Hence the more-than-fitting title.<br/><br/>Vin, more monosyllabic than Clint Eastwood's Dirty Harry on his grumpiest day, dripping more testosterone than sweat, has a field day here with a character that really does seem worth a sequel or two, and Hauser, oozing menace and bile is every bit as good as his dad Wings was at on-screen villainy. Surprisingly, though, Mitchell holds her own and manages to be strong and sympathetic as Fry. You would expect no less than a strong showing from Black, She Who Once Was 'Aeryn Sun', and she doesn't disappoint. (Too bad her role wasn't bigger, but that's all I'll say about it.) And David makes his usual indelible impression as the holy man whose faith will truly be tested in the very pit of Hell itself.<br/><br/>The pace moves faster than Riddick slipping up behind his prey with a shank in his teeth, and once the darkness descends, the terror and tension never let up, pretty much as in other classic sci-fi/horror flicks which this imitates. But if imitation truly is the sincerest form of flattery, Dave Twohy and the Wheats deserve major backslaps for getting this one right with a vengeance, and for giving us an ending that is anti-Hollywood to the max.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the surprises, so I won't say much more, except that if you saw CHRONICLES first and weren't too happy, give PITCH BLACK a chance anyway. And if you've seen neither, definitely start with this one. <br/><br/>I don't know what Vin is up to now, but he could certainly do worse than to give these guys a call again. I'd love to see what they would dream up next..."

I had a rough idea of the plot or so i thought, my idea of the plot was that a small crew along with Riddick himself were stuck on a planet with a bunch of man eating aliens and it would roughly be quite simular to Riddick 2. <br/><br/>Oh how I was wrong in stead it turned out to be a Sci-fi horror! with a crew that gets nearly all picked off! Brilliant i thought and as soon as I got over the stunning opening scene i knew i was about to watch something completely different to Riddick 2 and overall and greater film. <br/><br/>Vin Diesel's performance as Riddick is better than the second film but only just. He really makes you fear him as a character with his unnerving and random personality as he changes from funny to violent with out warning. <br/><br/>All the actors do a great job playing their part and story has more surprises and the characters are deeper than normally horror films. <br/><br/>overall Pitch black should be watched by anyone who loves sci-fi or horror or even both. if you enjoy a good action film then you'll be treated by this excellent sci-fi classic."

","There were outer-space ghoul stories before ""Alien"" (""Space: 1999"" had a few) and since (""Event Horizon""). Most of them are pretty bad and ""Pitch Black,"" which is utterly unoriginal, could easily have been, too. Instead it's a cool, character-driven yet action-packed, dark thriller. An interplanetary space transport crashes on a desert planet with 3 suns and apparently perpetual daylight. Like ""Alien,"" the film begins by exploring the handful of survivors. Like ""Lifeboat,"" it gradually divulges that some of them have things to hide. Not Riddick (Diesel), an escaped murderer being returned to prison by bounty hunter Johns (Hauser, effectively icy & sleazy). When perpetual day suddenly turns to perpetual night, the creepy-crawlies come out to kill, rend & chow down on Fresh Human. To survive, the others must accept Riddick, who is tougher than all of them and has had a prison ""shine job"" on his eyes that lets him see in the dark. But Riddick must also overcome the hatred he has for all of his own kind, a rage that he covers under a cool, wry facade of independence. Will Riddick eventually sacrifice the others to ensure his own survival, or maybe even just for one universal up-yours to the human race? Diesel has a star-making role, making a repugnant character sympathetic, giving us fleeting glimpses of Riddick's sadness & loneliness while never, ever detracting from his granite-souled strength. Several other actors have more work to do in this film than most action flicks, but they are all up to the task. The guilt-ridden pilot Fry (Mitchell), a dark, refreshing break from the butt-kicking babe stereotype begun with ""Charlie's Angels,"" holds the others together while Riddick comes & goes. Mitchell has a steeliness & style that belies her blonde cuteness and holds up well opposite both the brawny, in-your-face Diesel & the taut, cool Hauser. David, as a Muslim space pilgrim, brings religious faith (""Because you do not believe in God, does not mean God does not believe in you"") to counter the others' anger, despair or wry selfishness (""Look to thine own ass first""). The dark, percussion-heavy score is perfect for ""Pitch Black's"" visual effects, which are somewhat less spectacular than recent ""Star Wars"" but more effective, a background rather than a replacement for the action. ""Pitch Black"" is as entertaining as any old Saturday matinÃ©e, much better suited to our know-it-all times, without the condescension & stereotyping to which Hollywood is usually so devoted."

","At first glance, Pitch Black seems to be just another sci-fi horror flick. However, when you dig a little deeper, you can see that there's a lot more to this film than appears at first glance. Pitch Black is a story about humanity itself. It shows us one of the truest glances into the depths of human nature we've ever been given in popular culture: when people are pushed to their limits, there's nothing that won't do to survive, but they will *only* survive if they work together. Though the plot is a little lacking (and a bit cheesy at times), the filmography is wonderful. The cameras are used in much the same way as a master artist uses their brush - as a means to make the viewer see what was going on in their head. Pitch Black's camera styles range from jerky, blurred action shots - often shooting back and forth between the eyes of two people - to sharply-contrasted color-toned shots of the harsh desert climate. The movie is, quite simply put, beautiful. I give Pitch Black a solid ten out of ten. Not only is it one of my personal favorites, but it's an excellent film as well."

","It's hard to find new stories in sci-fi genera. Most of the movies just circles around some basic themes. This movie is a breath of freshness in this genera. Although there is a spaceship in this with a not so unique fate assigned to it at the beginning but the plot changes its course to some uncharted territory pretty fast after that.<br/><br/>The making and acting is decent. The interesting story creates a thrilling experience throughout its runt-time. Vin Disel nails his part with perfection. It was more than impressive to watch him act.<br/><br/>There are some unnecessary events in the story that felt forced to me. These were avoidable and probably were there just to get the audience emotional(if you have seen this you might understand what I am talking about). Without these I would've probably considered this to be a perfect sci-fi classic."

They do not understand the subtleties of the script and direction, or the nuances of acting. It builds, it teases, then it executes.

Claudia Black's northern-suburbs-Sydney was particularly lyrical. Solid turns by Cole Hauser, Keith David and Rhiana Griffith and others. Radha Mitchell could have kept her accent too but it seems that films contractually require American accents from ""lead"" characters so much these days that it's become a real pain in the ear.<br/><br/>This is Diesel's best film in my opinion and an entertaining ride."

Fortunately - perhaps - Riddick's eyes have been modified to allow him to stay in the dark.<br/><br/>Of course, this is yet another take on the ""last man standing"" theme, but with some nice wrinkles. The scenario is original, there are some interesting characters, and the uncertainty over exactly where Riddick stands adds its own tension to the considerable tension generated by the survivors' plight. There are some powerful performances, particularly from Radha Mitchell, and Vin Diesel in his first leading role, oozes charisma, not to mention silky menace.

Several people survive on a planet and start a bloody fight against horrible man-eating flying creatures, merciless and cruel. Nothing new? Well, Riddick makes it very fresh and upbeat. He is cool, strong, cynical and very clever. He is not daunted or haunted, he acts in cold blood and his actions seem cruel at first, but then it is him who saves at least three people and helps them escape the bad place that they had landed on. Vin Diesel proves that he is a good drama actor and not simply a strong guy with muscles. He does play and does that admirably well. Good work, smart and clever."

After I saw ""Event Horizon"", a film I liked that garnered an enormous amount of negative criticism, I kept my eyes peeled for something like it to resurface.  ""Pitch Black"" looked like it, and I was attracted to it.  The theater was packed, and the ads labeled it ""the scariest movie"", so I was in exceptionally good spirits.  What the projector and celluloid strip revealed was probably the worst film I think I have ever seen in my life!  Never, ever, have I been so cheated and so offended by a movie!  I'm ashamed to say that I watched it!<br/><br/>First off, there's no plot.  Next, the casting and acting is bad. Following that, it's not scary.  It's boring, actually.  Also, it's unoriginal, whatever the point of this...thing may be.  And of course, nothing is done with the characters, so you don't care about what happens to them and find yourself enjoying watching them die.   For the first time in my life, I wanted to ask for my money back, and the hour and a half of my life.  For the first time, I felt like I wasted my time.  I was upset all afternoon after it, and I woke up this morning thinking of all the different, more useful ways I could have spent my money.<br/><br/>This movie shouldn't have been released in theaters.  It could have been released direct-to-video.  I take it back, it's not even that good.  This should have been released as a ""premiere-TV-movie"" on the sci-fi channel, which loves illogical, mindless sci-fi garbage.  The best alternative would've been to shelve this movie permanently and make absolute certain that it never saw the light of day!<br/><br/>The effects and de-saturation of colors are nifty, but that becomes boring in and of itself and fails to save this shit.  Hell, this movie is so bad, it doesn't deserve to be called shit.  For those of you who like laughing at bad movies, stay away.  This makes Ed Wood look like Stanley Kubrick!

","'Pitch Black' is a science fiction thriller about a group of astronauts that find themselves stranded on a desserted planet with creatures that come out at dark and start killing off the astronauts one-by-one as they attempt to find a way off the planet. This film is a typical thriller, and if you enjoy this type of film, then you will probably enjoy this. In my opinion, the film was too slow-moving, and the action and attempt to create an emotional and frightening story just did not work. It had little to offer, and it was dull that the film took place in just one planet, in the darkness. It was also unrealistic in the sense that these creatures are living on the planet, but what do they feed on, besides the small group of stranded astronauts? Simply a bad film, but I don't like thrillers, so this may appeal to some."

","When something goes wrong in a deep space crossing, a passenger ship crashes on a desolate planet losing most of it's load along the way.  Once on the surface they discover signs of past human life and soon discover that the planet is populated by dangerous creatures.  They discover that the creatures come out at night to feed just as a solar eclipse begins.  The crew's only hope of survival is one of the passengers  a dangerous murderer with the ability to see in the dark.<br/><br/>This film has the reputation as being Vin Diesel's breakthrough movie and I therefore expected it to be pretty good.  The plot is quite clever if you say the whole `seeing in the dark' thing, but really this is more of a plot device than a plot  the actual plot will not surprise anyone who's seen any alien movies before.  The cast are eaten one by one  you don't have to look at your watch to see if the film is nearly over, just count the number of characters left onscreen!  There are some exciting moments in the second half and the film manages to be enjoyable without being that good.<br/><br/>I understood that Riddick can see in the dark, but didn't get why (at the start) he was walking round in daylight and the characters seemed unable to see him.  His being able to see in the dark is also a bit of a leap and all smacks of lazy writing if you ask me  it would have been better to not have this twist rather than making it feel like it was forced.  The actual aliens themselves are not well designed  when half seen they are fast and exciting, however seen in more detail they are quite basic or, as my friend said, look like Big Bird's cousin.<br/><br/>The film is really over-edited which in one way works but in others doesn't. The thing I liked was the use of washed out film stocks to show different times of day and to give a different feel to every part of the film. However the constant jump cuts etc just got annoying and suggested a director who lacks confidence and has to resort to visual excess to compensate for his lack of faith in the film to carry itself.<br/><br/>The cast are all pretty awful if you ask me.  Diesel does have a good screen presence, even if he is lacking in charisma (in my opinion).  He is just like a young muscle man actor but does quite well here I suppose.  At least, he does in comparison to the support cast who are all clichés who await their death scenes with impatient hamming and cardboard delivery.<br/><br/>Overall this is an average film as it lacks any new ideas (other than the central one) and feels like a retread of other films.  Visually bits of it are impressive but then other bits just are over the top, edited to within an inch of it's life for no benefit.

The trip is going OK until they crash land on a planet that seems deserted.

Seems believable...... until they realize there also happen to be hundreds of aliens that thrive in darkness living on the planet - ironic? Well, that's possible too, until you factor in the chances that they happen to be on the planet right as the eclipse happens - which is a .0037% chance..... Oh, and one more thing..... Riddick has a rare talent - he is one of few people in the history of the universe that can see in the dark and must lead them to safety. - Yes, this is a science fiction movie, but I felt the story was written very poorly, with outlandish ideas and it wasn't helped by the horrendous acting by Diesel and his fellow co-actors."

I saw this movie at the 8:00 showing, and fell asleep.  The first half was sooooo boring.  I caught just enough of it to catch the plot.  Then stayed awake for the second half, which made me want to leave the theater. <br/><br/>
The special effects were decent, but nothing really spectacular.  I could probably do that with several million dollars and a computer.  The coolest parts of the film was when you see through Diesel's eyes, and the monsters' eyes.  Although I have done the special effect of the monsters' vision with Paint Shop Pro, I have not seen it on the movie screen.  In fact, it looked like they just used PSP to get all of their visual effects. <br/><br/>
The rest of the movie was shoddy.  The one-liners were not that great (sometimes movies have some real winners, which this movie did not have), the plot sucked, the sub-plots were pretentious, and the story has been done.  It could have been such a cool movie if it had better directing, writing, editing, cinematography, visuals, etc.  In fact, I would not wish this movie on my worst enemy (although I could stomach forcing them to watch Deep Impact or Kazaam or Leonard Part 6 until they died) simply because it was so painful.  I kept hoping for a good ending, but it never came. <br/><br/>
Also, why were the day time visuals so washed out?  Was it just to create a contrast to the dark?  It was so pointless.  At least in Three Kings, the visuals were meant to look like a Xerox copy because of the news prints, and such.  This did not have a reason to look like that except it was a bad Xerox copy of other better movies.  Vin Diesal had potential in his role, but it was never reached.

Yeah that's been done, so has pretty much every avenue movies can take nowadays, but the relationships are what make this one soar. Riddick steals the show, he is just too cool for the others to have a hope. A kind of 'survival of the fittest' logic makes him tick but without even realising it her humanity starts to rub off on him. A by appearance respectable mercenary needs to get him off the planet alive to collect a bounty but Riddick is more than just formidable by appearance, he also has a keen, self-dependant and crafty mind at work, how long can the man who would cross him last.<br/><br/>
Then to the Aliens setup. When getting thier bearings the team stumbles upon a couple of undesirable chamelion-like predators beneath the surface, surveying the remains of the previous tenants they start to realise what they are dealing with, the first bomshell comes when they realise that the planet is about to line up for an eclipse that could last from hours to weeks, the problem is that these predators one weakness is light and they are about to re-enter the hunting ground, the team could well be sliced in less time than the minimum duration of the eclipse. Theres plenty of thrillers out nowadays that you can dismiss on appearance, this isn't one. Vin Diesel is on the short road to stardom, this movie is why. You'll be happy to know all you fans that the director and Diesel are getting together for a follow up, dealing mainly with Riddick. I am astounded at the 6.6 rating this movie is on, I sense opinion changed after 'The Fast And The Furious' hit screens, lets work on flipping that.<br/><br/>10/10"

","First of all, the camerawork and editing were so ridiculous frenzied that you couldn't see anything clearly through the whole movie. A character couldn't open a drawer without the camera weaving and tilting and jump edits to closeups of the contents. The whole movie was like that, worse than Blair Witch's motion problems. And the plot, what little there was, was completely implausible and ridiculous. Brainless characters, needless squabbling between them, and silly B flick monsters. SuperNova was better than this and I didn't like SuperNova. :("

His character is so boring and annoying and is over acted. The characters in this movie do not suit with the plot. Some Muslims, some other people and Vin Deasel all on the same flight. Vin Deasel gives a disastrous performance in this so called horror film. Why does he talk in that stupid way, it annoys big time.

","This film has a lot of problems with its Pseudo science and CGI that other people are quick to point out when dismissing this film.

Each individual character undergoes intense changes under the pressure of this alien situation. The exploration of how people act in survival situations is brilliant, and it provides a superb backdrop to the intense action that this film is full of. Its easy to call Pitch Black a dumb movie, because of the terrible sequels and the quick pace of the film. If you look closer though you can find a rich set of interactions with complex emotions being displayed.

","The creatures were not very impressive, and hey what did they live on in between eclipses? <br/><br/>And who couldn't guess which one was going to be the hero in the first one minute?<br/><br/>And there was way f*ing too much f*ing bad f*ing language. Really tough, really mean, really scary does not rely on schoolground swearing. Perhaps most moviegoers only understand eleven words with one being f* and the other c*, but I don't believe it. I think that most people are better than that and it's time that movie makers recognised the f*ing fact!<br/><br/>What the film really did have going for it - which impressed me very much - were three things.<br/><br/>Firstly, it relied on the age old rule that what you *dont* see frightens you most.<br/><br/>Secondly, the use of light (before the eclipse!) gave a more alien look to the planet than anything I have ever seen before. It was almost black and white - hard light that we just don't see here. It didn't look like a studio, or Mexico (or even Coober Pedy!).<br/><br/>Thirdly, we were presented with a 'holy man' who was not a standard Christian eccentric or magically endowed Indian Guru. A plain simple Muslim Iman who lived by his beliefs but didn't attempt to murder, terrorize or convert anyone, nor attempt to exorcise the monster devils, nor to worship them. Just an example of one of the worlds population in the wrong place at the wrong time. <br/><br/>So I think it was an interesting film, but not for the usual reasons. Not for the plot which was predictable, not for the writing (which mostly was adequate) and not for the effects (which were relatively unimpressive). No, I 'liked' the film because I could really believe it was another planet, because I could believe in the creatures (till I saw them!) and because it highlighted that the things we *are* afraid of, may not necessarily be the things we *should* be worrying about."

I mean I've seen him in The Pacifier and Fast and Furious but he hasn't really proved himself to me to be able to carry a lead role successfully. This movie proved me wrong! As much as I wasn't happy to see Vin Diesel in this movie I thought the character of Riddick was really unique seeing as how he was a bad guy who was willing to use his power of being able to see in the dark to help the survivors of the Spaceship crash. I liked the idea of having a guy you didn't think would want to help anyone manage to end up having a change of heart. I really still don't like Vin Diesel as an actor but this film role was pretty good and I could see anybody playing the character of Riddick and somehow ending up not ruining it. I also liked the idea of having a girl hide the fact she is a girl by dressing like a boy only for her to have her period which leads to the creatures stalking them because they smell the blood.

It's all about character or if convincing enough lack of character. Expecting the run-of-the-mill alien world survival story, I was very elated that it exceeding my expectations. Fry(Rhada Mitchelle) as a very self centered(you can't blame her) cargo pilot thrust into a position of authority wrongly accused of doing her best to save lives. Cole Hauser as a Bounty Hunter with no concern for anything but his cut and his drugs. Vin Diesel as a very cool and dangerous killer with little interest in anything else besides his survival. Vin Diesel is the highlight of this movie, with a complex character. He does an outstanding job and exceeds expectations. This was the role he was made for. Excellent movie for anyone-Except maybe little kids, but hell I probably would have loved this movie as a kid."

"QueenMakeda84","6","1","1","5 August 2005"," Could Work
","I liked this film. You knew most of the people were gonna die, so you went with it wanting to find out how. It was your typical strangers encounter strange planet and find out that they've arrived at exactly at the celestial time that the planet's insane night time creatures come to attack for a spell. How predictable. Riddick is only helpful to the storyline, as he can see in the dark, as the creatures can. The most amusing point is finding out the boy was really a girl based on her menstrual cycle as a target.<br/><br/>The acting was really good, but you were faced with the typical range of interstellar crew mates. The indecisive, yet resilient captain. The religious dude. The cop who's carrying a psycho, but doesn't do a good job as said psycho becomes loosed. The idiot who thinks everywhere in Paris in the springtime. Etc, etc. The same inane characters exist within all films of this genre. Pitch Black emerges in a different sense because it utilizes a murdering ex-convict as it's antihero and savior of the film. He has loyalties to no one and would like to help the creatures if he could, but manages to yell a monotone ""Keep up"" as his way of helping. Naturally, he doesn't help at all, but offers some strange sense of comfort for leading the way.<br/><br/>The creatures weren't all that scary. They even bled blue blood. How's that going really raise hair on our arms? It was like watching Nickolodeon's Double Dare with all the blue goo from dead creatures, not a serious ""I gotta get the heck off this planet cuz these things will kill me"" feel. The movie's saving grace is Riddick, because you want everyone to die anyway, as you're thoroughly annoyed with them in the first 1/2 hour of the film. He feels the same way you do and isn't afraid to show it. His questioning of God is warranted, but the holy man is merely a plot device for Riddick to tell God that he's not altogether pleased with him in truck driver language. It's watchable because Riddick is watchable. The movie fails in itself without hm and that's why he got a sequel. Maybe that's why they killed off the other characters in ""Chronicles"". We just want Riddick and more of him."

"NGMAPS","10","1","1","13 November 2003"," Fill your minds with intensely beautiful horror
","(VERY mildly spoilerish)<br/><br/>I must start by saying that I'm not usually impressed by science-fiction, so Pitch Black (2000) was a pleasant surprise. It had me hooked from the very beginning with rhythm, intensity and visual outburst that left me fascinated and glued to my seat. I'm very happy to say that this movie was the best (okay, at least *one* of the best) science fiction piece that I've seen in a long, long time.<br/><br/>The plot in short might sound simple -- a (space) ship crashes on a supposedly deserted planet and the captain, Caroline Fry (impressive Radha Mitchell), must lead the survivors to safety. At first, a cold-blooded murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel, who plays the role with very believable spare style), might seem like the group's biggest problem but as the dusk starts crawling in, the creatures of the night start awakening... This leads to a desperate attempt to escape from the bloodthirsty predators, which, as we all can guess, does not lead to a happy family picnic.<br/><br/>It's not the plot itself that makes the movie worth watching -- after all, let's face it, if you strip it down to the basics it's not *that* original -- but the skill in which it's told. The story flowed forward, didn't leave me yawning (at least not much) in any point. The directing was fabulous work. This was a very visual, even beautiful movie; the purple night view was a real treat. Although, 'beautiful' might not be the right word to use; yes, the images shown were candy to the eye, but they also added a touch of unspecified grotesqueness, eeriness, as if something was just about to burst out from under the still surface. (Not to mention that the monsters were really well done, they looked realistic, which seems to be rare nowadays [maybe people just can't be bothered to make them look real...])<br/><br/>I did not only enjoy the visual side of the movie but also the psychological aspect of the story. During the movie we get to see the characters unraveling -- some of them fall, some of them rise -- but what fascinated me the most was the developing of the character of Riddick. I enjoyed watching the change in him throughout the movie. To go even further, the other thing I enjoyed a lot with Riddick was the incredibly well and originally executed UST (Unresolved Sexual Tension) between Fry and him that ""didn't"" (you'll get what I mean once you see it). [One can't deny that they had chemistry. Don't even try or I'll seek you out and make you listen to me playing Chopsticks until you scream *grin*] It was fresh. As Radha Mitchell once put it (a modified quote), ""Pitch Black is a really sexy movie with no sex"", which is what makes it even more so interesting.<br/><br/>So, to summarize, I recommend this movie -- even if you're really not a fan of ""space stories"". The suspense was kept until the very end and, what's important, we were (or at least I was) left wanting for more. If you can't be bothered to think about psychology, subtext and such (as is my bad habit), you'll still find Pitch Black highly entertaining. Just kick off your shoes and enjoy."

","I love a good cliche. Like, ""we'll head 'em off at the pass."" Someone got their foot shot off in a Mel Brooks movie just for uttering it. So this film gets off to a good start by having the captain of the spaceship  blow up. And the ship's entire supply of toilet paper? Ooh, that's a tempting one, but we'll have to cross off a few more prominent cliches first, like frenetic cutting which makes the first ten minutes confusing. Who's who and who's where? This sort of constant controlling of the eye dissipates tension through out the film.<br/><br/>Apparently, the crew have crashed on a desert planet that looks like the Australian outback. So why are so many characters moaning when they have Australian accents? They should feel at home, as should the commander who has the useful surname of 'Fry'. But they do moan, because aliens are going to eat them. Which is another cliche not unlike having an escaped psycho on board. Riddick (for it is he) is played by Vin Diesel who apparently used to be a bouncer. There's a lovely bit where Riddick does a Sumo wrestling dance with an alien who has a blind spot. Now, if it was Mr Diesel himself in this unseemly predicament he could have used his full ammunition : ""I'm sorry, Sir, members only. You don't have the right attitude"" which is yet another cliche, but useless with aliens. Mr Diesel never finds his character possibly due to the film's blind spot, the script. Instead, he takes an idiosyncratic but not terribly convincing approach which involves looking enigmatic while hitting the same monotonous note over and over again in a gruff voice which makes me think of, well, a night club bouncer: ""You can't come in, mate, it's aliens night"" which is a coincidence but not a cliche. And speaking of cliches, jailbird psycho's can't just be psycho's anymore, they have to have a bit of breeding and be a bit brainy and existential like Nietzsche (the only philosopher ever to have had a preservation order placed on his beard). I was just waiting for Riddick to say ""That which doesn't kill me makes me stronger!"" It's a cliche that's only being used 2348 times in films like this and I was rather looking forward to it crash landing again. It doesn't, so black mark, writer. Next mistake and It'll be a pitch black mark and then you'll be sorry. We are led to believe that a convicted murderer who has vowed to leave the planet would risk all over a bit of intellectual curiosity over the mind of Ms Fry.<br/><br/>Never mind, the aliens are fun. In his 'Austin Powers' films, the comedian Mike Myers sent up the fact that the British have bad teeth. I looked at the alien's choppers and then looked at mine in the mirror and he's not wrong about that cliche. But how will the stranded crew, psycho in tow, deal with the aliens during an eclipse so pitch black that you can see the black and ethnic characters even better than the whites? (Don't ask me how, I'm still trying to figure it out). There's an empathy problem here. Amongst the crew, there is a whining Englishman who protests he's meant to die in Paris (anyone who shares my aversion to French films will understand his deeply held belief) and a man who loses two sons without batting an eyelid in grief. I mean, if he doesn't care why does the director expect us to? To be fair, he does get a bit miffed when the third son cops it but perhaps he was a favourite and the others owed him money. Either way, he's a funny chap who, despite being Islamic, speaks vaguely about 'God' rather than Allah, which is perhaps the source of all his misery on the planet.<br/><br/>The last quarter is rather gripping as the survivors make a last desperate dash along a canyon. Will they make it or will the aliens (wait for it, wait for it) head them off at the pass? It's worth a rental to find out as the visuals are very pleasing in that DVD way and the ending is moving and Christian despite not being entirely convincing in terms of credible motivations. The film makers want us to relate to Riddick's road to Damascus like conversion (actually, didn't that end in pitch black, last time?) Never the less, I think the relatives of the pilot he killed would rather he did a bit of time in a cell somewhere. Preferably pitch black. But he turned out cuddly enough for us to maybe toss in a few glow worms.<br/><br/>The producers miss out on that grand cliche of them all, the rock song play out. Okay, pitch black mark. They should have had Mick Jagger and friends wailing over the end titles. Which song? Now come on, there can be only one. Yes, I know it's been used before, but what are cliches for?"

","Like the original `Alien', `Pitch Black' is a sci-fi/horror hybrid -- a group of people in the far-flung future find themselves confront by an alien menace in hostile, unknown surroundings.  `Pitch Black' clearly owes a lot of its influences to Ridley Scott's `Alien', but it never sinks so low as to blatantly rip `Alien' off -- `Pitch Black' has a couple of neat touches that make it stand out.  However, it's typical movie cliches that drag `Pitch Black' back towards the realm of mediocrity, and keep it from being a really good film.<br/><br/>Somewhere in the distant reaches of space, a freak meteor storm knocks a star freighter off course, sending the freighter crashing to the surface of an unknown planet.  The survivors, which include pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), bounty hunter Johns (Cole Hauser), and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a sociopathic killer who was being transported back  to prison, discover strange alien creatures lurking beneath the surface of the planet.  These creatures, which cannot stand light, have a taste for blood . . . and soon, they'll be swarming the surface, as a rare eclipse that sends the entire planet into darkness is only hours away.<br/><br/>The story, while uneven, has some neat moments -- the inclusion of the Muslim leader Imam (Keith David) and his ragtag band of religious followers added some unexpected dimensions to the film; and the way the kid Jack (Rhiana Griffith) develops a macabre form of hero-worship for the killer Riddick, while disturbing, is probably somewhat realistic.  What truly brings `Pitch Black' down a few notches is the sheer number of unbelievable things that keep piling on top of each other.   The crashed ship just happens to have landed on a sun-drenched planet mere hours before an eclipse that only occurs every twenty-two years is set to begin.  The ship also just happens to be holding a ruthless killer, said ruthless killer just happens to have surgically-adjusted eyes that can see perfectly in the dark . . . the list goes on and on and on.  A few of these would be fine -- willing suspension of disbelief is all part of the movie-going experience -- but after the first dozen or so, it's sheer overkill.  Any small, cool original moments created in `Pitch Black' are inevitably lost amidst the big, steaming piles of unbelievable nonsense.<br/><br/>As Riddick, Vin Diesel injects a large amount of coolness in `Pitch Black'. He gives the character enough nuances to keep things from getting boring. Radhia Mitchell was also quite good as the pilot Carolyn, who's forcibly thrust into being the leader after the captain dies in the initial crash. Her struggles in taking charge of the survivors is very believable, and very good.  The rest . . . well, they're predictable stereotypes.  They do a good job, but their every action is incredibly predictable, making `Pitch Black' a lot less tense than it should've been.  <br/><br/>Of note is David Twohy's excellent direction:  the way the planet is initially bleached blindingly bone-white after the crash adds a real sense of desolation to the desert plant, and serves to contrast nicely, with, well, the pitch black darkness of the eclipse.  He keeps things moving along at a fairly quick pace, adding enough tension to constantly keep things interesting.  The idea of keeping the CGI creature mostly unseen in the dark is also a good one -- they're a lot creepier that way, and by using them prominently, they might've looked lame if the CGI effects weren't perfect.<br/><br/>A pretty respectable thrill ride; definitely check it out if you're a fan of sci-fi films.  Grade: B-"
"utica","10","1","1","11 January 2000"," straight up sci-fi actioner whose quality belies its meagre budget
","Saw this movie at a preview screening last year.  I don't think is was the final cut, but pretty close to it.<br/><br/>The basic scenario is quite familiar - a disparate group of space travellers is thrown together when their ship crash lands on a seemingly desolate planet whose barren exterior hides a nasty surprise.  However, this film has a gritty edge more reminiscent of independent ""cinema verite"" than the glossy coating applied to standard mainstream fare.  This ""down and dirty"" approach is if anything more evocative of Alien than any plot similarities. The dialogue is sparse and terse and generally manages to stay away from the cliches which so many other films in this genre seem so ready to embrace.<br/><br/>The greatest strength of this film is its relatively unknown cast.  The anxiety of this group who don't know or like each other is palpable. Their grudging agreement to work together under the direction of Fry, the sole surviving ship's officer (played by Radha Mitchell) is borne of necessity and practicality - there is no attempt at ""chemistry"" here, just the believability of desperate people facing the facts.  The resolution of clashing personalities as the situation rapidly worsens forms the meat of the story and exposes the character's weaknesses and - more importantly - their true motivations. At the core of these revelations is the relationship between Fry and the convicted criminal Riddick (played with muscular vidour by Vin Diesel), everyone's survival will ultimately depend on whether these two can resolve their distrust of each other.<br/><br/>The film is well crafted. The effects work is excellent but never obtrusive, serving the story well.  The cinematography adds a truely weird feel to the alien desert landscape.  For a film that in total cost around what Shwarzenegger gets for a single movie this is an impressive offering from director David Twohy."

","Finally a sci fi movie done RIGHT!  This movie is basically the old sci fi formula famous in many other science fiction movies...space travelers crash land on a strange alien planet, and soon are stocked by deadly aliens, and must struggle for survival and to find a way off the planet.  The story has been done before, but never as good.  Vin Diesel's character of Riddick is ground breaking.  My favorite movie heroes are always the ""Bad"" good guys...as bad as a good guy can get, and still be a good guy.<br/><br/>This movie is brave.  The script is original, the execution of the movie is phenomenal.  I loved this movie!  And I am sure you will too.<br/><br/>I have to comment on this movie's ending.  Don't worry, no spoilers here. But the end was brave.  It will surprize you.  You think you know who is going to survive and who is going to die, but you will be surprized.<br/><br/>I actually spoke to Vin Diesel himself at a chance meeting at the Hard Rock Casino here in Vegas and he told me the sequel to this great movie is in the works, and it will be called ""THE CHRONICLES OF RIDDICK.""  I will be first in line to see it!"

","Before posting this, I read 20 or 30 of the other posts, and wonder if the posters who thought it stunk were paying bills or something equally onerous while watching this terrific sci-fi flick.<br/><br/>What did I like? Vin Diesel was terrific, as was the actress who played the pilot. The creatures were pretty good, if reminiscent of Alien with the wide carapace heads. The different lighting to show the three suns effects was clever. The use of music heightened the nail-biting suspense. I never could foresee who would get it next. I felt the aridness of the landscape and thought the costume department did a great job of dressing people like real people dress.<br/><br/>It was a good escapist movie with a lot of clever and intriguing touches. Don't try to compare it with '2001' and you'll enjoy it just fine. Remember that when Terminator came out, Arnold was just another body builder doing muscle movies with grunts for dialogue. Every body has to start somewhere. I think Vin was terrific. Have also seen him in boiler room, where he also makes a lasting impact.  Really enjoyed this movie."

","In the late 1990's and early 2000's some movies had been made which seemed to try to imitate the greats of science fiction, Lost In Space and Supernova are just two examples of these poor copy-cats.<br/><br/>Pitch Black just sitting there on the rental shelf seemed to have a dangerous chance of being one of these duds, but I took the risk anyway.  I am glad I did, because I was dead wrong.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is one of the best sci-fi movies I have ever seen.  Combining great acting, great storyline, and great action, Pitch Black makes for a high quality, satisfying, non-cheesy, flick.  Cheesy being what so many sci-fi movies have come to be.<br/><br/>Up-and-coming Vin Diesel as Riddick quietly steals the scene.  An escaped convict being taken back to the slam, Riddick begins the film with his narration, his cyro-sleep speech, if you will.  Diesel's deep, almost mysterious voice absolutely sucks you into the time and place, setting the stage beautifully.  And when he escapes after the crash landing, one thing everyone wanted to do was find him, not necessarily to meet him, but to lock him up again.  At one point our dear friend, Paris, is driven, for certain reasons, from his comfy lawn chair.  As he is talking to the others you suddenly notice that Riddick, unbeknownst to the others, is sitting in Paris's lawn chair, enjoying Paris's beverages.  It was Riddick who told Fry to look deeper in the hole for Zeek.  It was Riddick who had the simply spoken statements bringing what the others dared not think, to words (All you people are so scared of me, most days I would take that as a compliment, but it ain't me you gotta worry about now.)<br/><br/>Fry was great.  A courageous young woman trying to, at all costs, get of the desert planet.  Her guilt for trying to drop the live cargo (namely human beings) to save her own skin is what motivates her to do everything in her power to save the survivors.<br/><br/>Johns, who was taking Riddick back to the slam, was a flat out jerk, or as Riddick put it ""a blue eyed devil.""  He was meant to be a jerk, and boy was he ever, a well acted jerk at that.<br/><br/>Shazza, Zeek, Paris, and the Middle Easterners were very well acted, as were all the above characters.  All of them well developed, well portrayed people.<br/><br/>Don't get me started on the kid, Jack.  Jack tried too hard, but you will find Jack very interesting.<br/><br/>The storyline held my attention, I didn't find a need to ask myself any questions as the video was rewinding.  The plot was airtight.<br/><br/>The movie belonged to Vin Diesel, Fry or no Fry.  He didn't take over the movie, making the others appear miniscule, as could have easily been done. He was fantastic.  I do believe that he just might be the next Arnold, who didn't exactly play a Conan the Destroyer in his come-back movie, End of Days.  His character, Riddick, was very believable.  <br/><br/>Gore was minimal in the rated version  What was there was not bad, granted it was gross.  A friend of mine, who has seen Alien numerous times, always starts watching it pretty early on in the evening, so she'll have time for the second movie she always needs on Alien nights just to go to sleep.  This is nothing like THAT.  The one scene that made me go all out and declare ""Oh yuck!"" was when, or rather how, Riddick escaped the second time.  Tied, hands behind back, to a pole that didn't quite reach the ceiling, there was only one means of escape.  Purposely dislocating, then relocating, his shoulders, I believe, up and over, he was free.  (Oh yuck!)<br/><br/>The editing was beautifully done, quick, not dragging.  One minute you see Shazza staring at the general place in the hole where Zeek met his end, and where he no longer was, the next minute you see Riddick looking emotionlessly at Shazza, and the next minute you see Riddick racing away.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is a GREAT movie!!!  Totally worth the rent, or buy, or whatever.  Just don't watch it in the pitch black."

I wasn't about to pay $7 bucks to go see what would probably end up being a campy sci-fi flick with cheap effects and bad acting.<br/><br/>All I can say is WOW! This is the kind of movie that I plan on buying. Pitch Black was from being the cheesefest I expected from a film I had heard very few positive things about and starred people I knew next to the nothing about.<br/><br/>The effects were above-par although the aliens looked strongly influenced by the all-famous Aliens. Nevertheless their movements were realistic and creepy.<br/><br/>Despite a plot which could have been summarized in a single sentence, the character development and strength of acting was superb. One of the things I found the most visually pleasing (besides Vin Diesel - yum!) was the hue and contrast of the terrain. Turning what would be a normal ""rocky desert"" scene into something that looked truly off-world and baked bones under the triple heat of its suns.<br/><br/>I'm very pleased that I wandered into the movie and was treated to such a gem that I feel this film has redeemed my opinion of Hollywood's recent sci-fi flicks since seeing that waste of film, Wing Commander."

","Scary, Sexy, Cool, and Surprising!  I haven't seen a really good scifi film in ages, but this one definitely gets my vote.  Although some of the minor characters (Shazza, Zeke, etc.) lacked the amount of development I would have liked to see, there are still plenty of heart stopping scenes and surprises.  The open ending leaves room for a sequel which I always like. Vin Diesel did a fabulous job as Richard B. Riddick; the characters actions spoke louder than words and Diesel's excellent body language and expressions added to the character's dangerous aura immensely.  A definite must see."

","This movie certainly isn't the holy grail I have seen some people make of it, but it is a solid, competent effort. The biggest thing I would change about it is replacing the female lead with Claudia Black instead, who I think would have made it more compelling, but what can I say, I'm a Farscape fan.<br/><br/>The movie definately is influenced by the Aliens canon, but doesn't reach that level of greatness. It does however, despite a small budget, feature solid acting, some originality, and a nice little theme of redemption.<br/><br/>One interesting note I read on here, and I would agree with it totally, is that I was never really 'scared'. Sure, I'm used to these types of movies, but the aliens did leave me with a pedestrian sense of deja-vu. The aliens seemed to be clones of the ones in Starship Troopers. Predictability is often the pitfall of these types of monster fests, and this one suffers its fair share of it.<br/><br/>I give it a 6, for a solid hour of sci-fi diversion. Think of it as a really good Sci-Fi Channel original movie (a rare beast), which in the end I think describes it's level of quality best."

","What can I say about Pitch Black - while viewing the trailer I found this to be a rather exciting idea for the science fiction vehicle, but was terribly disappointed at the outcome.  The opening scenes instantly gave me a bad vibe about this film - o.k it is a low budget film but that doesn't  stop it from being good - but the ham acting and bad dialogue does.  This film also tries to win the audience with some badly thought out humour which wasn't close to being witty or sharp.  Allright I hear you say it's just a sci-fi movie but it could have been so much better - what seemed a good idea (spaceship crashing on an unknown planet with several survivors trying to re-launch before the planets 3 suns eclipse and unleash winged beasts who only come out in this period of darkness to kill and destroy etc ), this film tried to play with this idea and failed.  I felt cheated by seeing the trailer before-hand, which showed probably the best clip which lasted 30 seconds (honestly), and had to suffer the remaining 1hr 29 minutes and 30 seconds.  The characters I found laughable; the convict (wanted for murder - which by the way is glorified sadly throughout the movie) who is bad-guy turned good-guy , the English antique dealer ???? (thats what I thought!!), the totally unconvincing captain of the ship - I could go on but I'm not going to.  I honestly am a big sci-fi fan but I would class this as a straight to video release from the eighties ( YES that bad!!) and find the only thing  frightening about it is how this movie has become so successful. The special effects are rubbish and look like  rejects from the Starship Troopers studio and that along with a pathetic script ruins what seemed to be a pretty good idea. Nuff said 1/10."

","Spaceship is forced to crash on an alien planet with three suns. Among the survivors is a criminal named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who, through a surgical alteration to his eyes, has night vision. Soon it's discovered that the planet is inhabited by nocturnal bloodthirsty creatures. Good thing the planet has three suns and it's always day right? Well, as luck would have it, these people have crashed on the planet at the same time an eclipse is about to begin so all hell is about to break loose. They must rely on Riddick to lead them to safety in the dark. The question is can they depend on a convicted murderer for help? <br/><br/>Wonderful character-driven sci-fi action horror movie with a terrific cast. Vin Diesel's best role by miles. The Fast & Furious movies are good for what they are but he doesn't have to do much in them but act tough. Not that this is Othello but at least the character of Riddick has some depth. The rest of the cast is solid with standout turns from Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser. The special effects are good and the action is exciting. A fun thrill ride of a movie.

"fredericksmith1952","9","2","4","18 March 2012"," Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a ""villain"".
","The plot in this film is pretty straight forward, and certainly not original in the scheme of science fiction. The characters are somewhat predictable, with the Imam leading and caring for his three teenage followers on a great Hadj to New Mecca, the docking pilot having her first ""command"" thrust upon her, the bounty hunter a junkie hooked on pain killers, the entrepreneur who cares more about his cargo that the situation, a kid traveling alone, a provocatively beautiful woman who is apparently traveling for work, and a hard core killer with eyes that glow and the ability to see in the dark. Okay, so that last character isn't so predictable. As a matter of fact, Vin Diesel portrays a thinking killer who displays none of the classic psychotic behaviors we are used to in a ""villain"". Instead, Riddick is a cold, calculating man who carefully reads the people around him. Radha Mitchell is excellent in her role, letting the inexperience of command shake her confidence while she attempts to lead the group into the right decisions. Keith David is the man of God, the man who always finds the hope in the situation and tries to encourage others to do the same. Cole Hauser is a perfect sociopath, coldly deciding who should be sacrificed as long as he survives. The film moves at a good pace, makes one or two logical flaws in the plot, but overall entertains and apparently creates a memorable character in the form of Riddick, who we see next in The Chronicles of Riddick, our next review. Rated R for violence and gore, and language, this film is collectible for Vin Diesel fans and anyone who likes good science fiction."

","I'm not going to beat around the bush here, so I'll just start by saying that this is the worst movie i've ever seen. I've watched some pretty horrible movies but watching Pitch Black was the closest I've ever come to actually walking out of the theatre (prevented only by my refusal to pay for a whole movie and only watch half (and my fear that if i walked out i would miss the only good part.... which incidentally never arrived...)). Forget about the second rate trying-to-be-a- sci-fi-short-story plot, the horrible acting and the un-pronounceable/easy to confuse character names. Though they all contributed to the ""awful""rating what really took the cake was the actual physical pain caused by the movie. When I go from no light to blinding brightness, it causes my eyes more than just a little bit of pain. So we get either ""can't see because there's no light"" or ""can't see because I'm BLIND"" ?... great film making, good job. I get that its called ""Pitch Black"" but if i wanted to sit in complete darkness and listen to people talking I could just turn off my living room lights and turn on the radio. Though i suppose if was to properly simulate the experience of watching Pitch Black, i would have to get a friend (or enemy) to stand right in front of me and (at random intervals) flash a thousand watt light bulb in my eyes. good times... though i suppose at least I'd never have to sit through the pain of accidentally seeing vin diesel again and reliving the whole horrific experience that was Pitch Black."

They've all been complete crud and this is NO exception.<br/><br/>**** POTENTIAL SPOILER ALERT ****<br/><br/>Let's start with what's cool in the film. Very little.<br/><br/>
1) The concept of the tertiary star system with the planet they're stuck on in the la grange point between the stars. (basically the point of gravitational balance so that the stars and other planets can orbit around it. certainly feasable as far as my knowledge of physics allows).<br/><br/>2) The enhanced seeing ability of the ""prisoner"" character, which also serves as a plot device later.<br/><br/>3) The aliens themselves. Although I look at this film and then the film ""Aliens"" and go ""rip off, rip off!"", at least they seem to act like ordinary unintelligent animals which makes a damn good change. Their POV shots so we see what they see are also pretty cool too.<br/><br/>4) Our ""baddie"" character who through the magic of role reversal is also a ""goodie"", has very very cool eyes. Don't believe me? Check out his POV camera shots.<br/><br/>5) The ""bleach bypass"" used on the film negatives gives a very very interesting look to the film and helps add realism to the tertiary star system concept.<br/><br/>The rest is crap.<br/><br/>Seriously. The rest is total rubbish. The start of the film although with impressive CGI rings hollow and the rest of the film does too. I watched the first 40 mins or so and I was BORED. I just didn't care two hoots about the characters.<br/><br/>They spend 30 minutes or more going on about what a bad character our ""hero"" is. Great. Now show me. Oh, you're not going to are you? Right, now the suspense behind him is completely shot before you even see him in action. Just because the other characters are afraid doesn't mean we are because we haven't seen what he's supposedly done. Put up or shut up. Preferably shut up.<br/><br/>Now it should be pointed out that David Twohy obviously doesn't know how or where to point the camera. There are a couple of interesting shots which are great if we were watching a pure suspense film. We are not however. There are scenes where I was left almost dizzy and not knowing what is going on because of the camera blur.<br/><br/>Because of this, the story just doesn't ring true. There seem to be shots and lens effects used simply for the sake of the ""oh, doesn't it look cool?"" trap i've seen many filmmakers get into. (including myself).<br/><br/>I'd like to have known what the original script was like. David Twohy is on record as stating he took the original script and re-wrote it in his own image. This to me is arrogance of the highest order. Didn't anyone else get to read it first? There was probably nothing wrong with it in the first place. As a result, some of th ... no, most of the damn dialogue is incredibly stilted and unbelievable.<br/><br/>There were good moments, but not many. This film tried to be too many concepts at once and failed miserably at every one of them.<br/><br/>So, to sum up. Don't pay money to see this. Ever. If a friend has made the mistake of renting it then watch it if only so you can laugh behind his/her back later. Cruel, but true. I wasted £2.75 on this rental.<br/><br/>Stop David Twohy before he ruins another script and/or film."

","Pitch Black is the first film in the so called Riddick saga, featuring Vin Diesel as the titular main character, Richard B. Riddick, and David Twohy as director slash producer. The films are noted for their dark aesthetic and their focus on an almost unlikable antihero, who nevertheless manages to garner your sympathy and support.<br/><br/>And as far as debut films go, I've seen far worse. It's a niche scifi film that chooses to focus on a small crew of survivors stranded on a desert planet where night is fast approaching and hunters eagerly await the fall of darkness. No one has a clear idea of what to do and now they have a certified killer, Riddick, on the loose.<br/><br/>Where the film shines is the execution of its main idea. Its modest budget is very well utilized and the character roster is a strong one. Diesel's Riddick has gathered a cult following, but I also really liked Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, the leader of the survivors.<br/><br/>The film also uses lighting amazingly. The title of the film refers to a long action set piece near the end of the film where the characters have wade through literal pitch black darkness while avoiding attacks and pursuit. And it is a glorious scene. One of the best of its kind.<br/><br/>I wouldn't call Pitch Black anything groundbreaking, but it has enough style and substance to stand on its own feet and withstand the ravages of time.

","This is one of those surprisingly awesome films, one that I really don't know how many times that I have seen. I probably did miss it when it was in the cinemas, but then I also suspect that it may have been one of those films that developed a strong following after its release. In a way as a sci-fi horror film there is just so many things that it does right, from the tense scenes to the absolutely gorgeous cinematography, to the character development throughout the film.<br/><br/>The film is about the crew of this merchant ship traveling through space, that happens to be loaded with passengers, among other things. Anyway, the ship passes through the tail of a rogue comet, which means that rocks go flying through the hull, and the ship then veers towards this desert planet, and after some heroics, the crew manage to land the ship, though not without loss of life (which is sort of expected in a sci-fi horror film).<br/><br/>At first it seems simply like a story about a group stranded on a desert planet where we happen to have this criminal that has escaped custody, but as I suggested it quickly starts to take a number of twists. While it seems like this planet is caught in perpetual daylight, it becomes apparent that this is not always the case, and also, there happens to be all of these nasties that happen to thrive in the dark. It is just during the day (and it seems to be an awfully long day), they are all hidden underground.<br/><br/>The characters are all pretty interesting as well, and I won't go into too many details because that certainly does spoil some of the twists that the movie is regularly throwing up at you. Like, yeah, there are some characters that are pretty straight forward, and what you see is what you get, but there are a number of other characters that have some interesting traits, and some hidden flaws. Riddick was obviously a pretty popular character, considering that there are two more movies based around him, however I would argue that he is actually one of the pretty straight forward characters - much of the concern we have with him stems from the agent that has captured him and is returning him to prison. No, it is the other characters that tend to end up throwing curve balls at you, and quite a few of them.<br/><br/>I've seen this film a few times, and considering its age, I suspect that it is probably fairly well known, but then again, I also suspect that it has probably fallen back into obscurity with a lot of the people these days. However, I wouldn't be all that surprised if there is a cult following, and this film certainly does deserve it, that do hold it in high regards. Honestly, I'm surprised that I haven't actually written a review on it earlier, considering that it does happen to be one of my favourites, and that I did actually purchased it on DVD. Yeah, it is certainly one worth watching."

The synopsis is a commercial transport ship and its crew are marooned on a planet full of bloodthirsty creatures that only come out to feast at night. But then, they learn that a month-long eclipse is about to occur.<br/><br/>We begin with some voice-over narration done by Diesel. He talks about being the animal and some other things, revealing some of his characters thoughts and how he operates. He is on a spaceship as it travels toward its destination. The crew is woke early when they run into a meteorite shower. They are pelting the ship and actually kill the captain. The other two crew members help right the problem, preventing it's destruction. One of them is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and the other is Greg Owens (Simon Burke).<br/><br/>Carolyn takes over the controls and the ship crash lands on a planet. She dumps as much as she can from the ship, trying to get it righted, but they're still too heavy. She comes to the moral decision that she is going to dump the passengers of the ship in order to save it, but there's a malfunction. It crashes and we get some survivors.<br/><br/>Of the survivors is a bounty hunter, William J. Johns (Cole Hauser), and a religious man, Abu 'Imam' al-Walid (Keith David). There's a collector Paris P. Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), Sharon 'Shazza' Montgomery (Claudia Black) and teenage boy Jack (Rhiana Griffith). There is also John 'Zeke' Ezekiel (John Moore) and three boys that are following Imam. There is also Diesel who is Richard B. Riddick. He is handcuff to a post while they try to find a way off this planet. It should also be pointed out that he has escaped from prison, is a murderer and has had a surgery on his eyes so he can see in the dark.<br/><br/>The planet is covered in desert. At first they believe that it has two suns, but as one goes to set, a third one appears. It seems that this planet is never covered in darkness. It is pointed out to everyone that Riddick is dangerous and they should stay away from him. They start their search for water and a way off this island.<br/><br/>Riddick ends up freeing himself by dislocating his shoulder and grabbing a nearby blowtorch. He flees into the wilderness. William is upset and starts to look for him. Zeke is tasked with burying the dead and digs a hole. Riddick ends up back to where he is and watches as he is attacked by a creature in a hole that he uncovered. Jack also sees what happened.<br/><br/>This causes the survivors to blame Riddick. Carolyn isn't buying it and wants to get to the truth. The more they explore the planet, they realize there is something wrong here and things are made worse with an epic eclipse coming that only happens once every 22 years. They need to band together to survive or fall victim to these monsters.<br/><br/>To start this off, I have to say that when this film first came out, I figured it was just going to be another sci-fi action film, but this one is actually pretty solid. This is one of the first films with Diesel that I saw and made me like him. He does well in his role and I would say across the board everyone does as well. I really like the idea of him as a space criminal and that he had a surgery on his eyes that allows him to see in the dark, for the reason though that he is in prison where it's always dark. The core group with him is Mitchell, who I think is solid in everything I've seen her in. David is a legend for me in cinema and Hauser really just plays angry characters well. They all round this movie out for what is needed.<br/><br/>A problem I do have with the story is the lack of interaction with the creatures themselves. We don't get to really learn much about these aliens outside that Riddick discovers they have a blind spot and he exploits that near the end. I also found it odd that only one is really killed by anybody and it is Riddick with a knife. I understand this is to show his dominance. We just have characters like William and Imam, that are played by veteran action movie actors, I think we should have gotten a bit more.<br/><br/>I thought the aliens were scary and despite being CGI which didn't look horrible. This film does a great job at making you feel like there is very little chance of them making it out alive, which and that works. We never see them really getting the upper hand, which is something else I enjoy. I thought it was shot well in building that up and using darkness to its advantage. The cinematography is used strategically for that.<br/><br/>I'd like to preface that I really like this film, but I did find myself a little bit bored right after the eclipse happens. It takes them a little bit before they decide to try to make it back to the ship there going to use for escape. There were also some lulls early in the film right after they crashed that had me waiting for something to happen. The ending was good for me as well. One final thing I will add here as well was that this film does a great job at showing us who is good and bad in the beginning, but we slowly see this change which I love seeing in a film.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I would recommend this film. If you are into horror films that involve aliens and take place on distant planets, this one is up your alley I'd say. The acting is good, the concept is solid and the story isn't bad, but could have been better. There is some good action and there are quite a few deaths in this one. It does have a depressing feel of there is no way they survive, which I really liked as well. If you're a big fan of Diesel, I would also say to give this a viewing as it is enjoyable for sure. I did find this to be above average."

","Plot; A ship crash lands on a planet where deadly, night roaming creatures may not be the greatest threat.<br/><br/>There are several elements that keep Pitch Black from being just another in a long line of Alien knockoffs, but the strongest of these is the character of Riddick. Vin Diesel may have the range of a spitball, but when it's in his wheelhouse he can crush it, as he does here. His Riddick is more than just an antihero, he's the straw that stirs the drink. Riddick is surrounded by some strong characters, all with satisfying arcs and little sections of turf to call their own. The film itself is tight and lean, with no wasted motion. The f/x are shoddy at times, but that's to be expected from a low budget sci-fi/horror film from the early 00's. What really matters is the execution, and here it's nearly pitch perfect."
"Leofwine_draca","9","0","0","9 October 2016"," A decent sci-fi B-movie
","Finally, after years of cheap and rubbish ALIENS rip-offs, comes one that is actually pretty darned good for a change. Despite being unreleased for about a year in this country, and with its fair share of plot holes and flaws, PITCH BLACK still manages to be one of the most impressive science fiction films in a long time. Although a pure B-movie at heart, PITCH BLACK impresses us with some wonderful photography, strong acting, and characterisations, and, for once, an imaginative script which throws in many inventive touches as it goes along.<br/><br/>It's action right from the start as the film opens with one of the most tense, prolonged, and realistic spaceship crashes in a long time. The special effects here are adequate, although strained by the budget. Once the survivors group together on the planet's surface and decide to explore, here the fun really begins. The suspense is racked up to breaking point, making this relatively quiet first half pretty damn tense, as the viewer is aware that the survivors are not alone, and it takes a long time (and a few deaths) for them to realise this. Due to the wealth of action and different situations, even with a relatively long running time this stuff never becomes boring.<br/><br/>Once the aliens show themselves (in a scene where the lead character is repeatedly put in danger but just manages to escape) the thrills and chills are heightened further. The plot twist of having an eclipse suddenly occur has already been stolen in the cheesy FROM DUSK TILL DAWN 2, but it's still a good one in any case. There's a taught NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD-inspired scene where the remaining survivors huddle inside the crashed ship as the aliens mass outside, trying to get in. The final third takes the form of an immense trip on foot through the desert to reach a working spaceship, and offers up most of the fun as our character's lighting begins to fail bit by bit, until they are left in ""pitch black"" by a string of unlucky accidents.<br/><br/>There are some many horrific scenes in this film that it's hard to pick the best, although I did especially like the moment (shown in the trailer) where a character lights a torch quickly to see himself surrounded by the aliens, before it going out again just as suddenly. The squelchy sound effects do the rest of the work for us. The desert landscape of Australia is put to good use, with the bleached photography achieving the same realistic sun-scorched effect as in THREE KINGS. Indeed, the photography (whether in the bright light or in the dark) is excellent throughout, and one of the film's strong points.<br/><br/>The acting, too, is pretty good, and the fact that the film lacks famous faces makes it all the better. Radha Mitchell - an ex-NEIGHBOURS actress, if you would believe it - makes for a tough, likable and resourceful heroine, and one of the best female roles in a sci-fi movie in a while. Keith David pops up in a role as an Arab, and is as good as ever. I'm happy to say that he actually survives in this film. Cole Hauser (son of Wings) creates a believable, three-dimensional bastard in Johns, the film's most hateable character. However, acting honours go to Vin Diesel, playing the imposing escaped convict. Despite having surgically-altered eyes so he can see in the dark, a shaved head and imposing bulk, Diesel still manages to make his killer a likable character with a hard edge, and succeeds as an action hero.<br/><br/>The CGI effect of the large aliens are generally pretty good, with the well-designed creatures being most menacing, especially when seen in a half light. One thing I didn't like were the tiny flying aliens which just look like a blob of CGI in close-up. There's a fair smattering of (computer generated) gore for horror fans, with heads and bodies being ripped apart in very brief shots. There are also some fun p.o.v. shots from the aliens' and Diesel's perspectives which are nice to look at. I'm pleased to say that director David Twohy (who also make the pretty good alien invasion flick, THE ARRIVAL) has succeeded again in making an enjoyable movie; one which is suspense, horrifying and exciting in equal measures, and should be seen at once by all genre fans as a breath of fresh air in today's cinema."

","""Pitch Black"" is basically a simple story about a crew landing on a planet and fighting off creepy aliens. There's more to the story, mostly to do with the character of Riddick played by Vin Diesel, but I'm not interested in writing about that at the moment. The whole thing plays out like a relatively sub-par version of ""Alien"" with sub-par versions of the action scenes from ""Aliens"". The film features competent visual storytelling and looks okay considering its relatively low budget but I found the fact that the planet the crew lands up on having three suns meant cheap and annoying use of camera filters detracted quite substantially from the film overall. Entertaining, but I like the sound of ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" far more, as ""Pitch Black"" contains hints of an in interesting mythology but aside from Riddick himself could have been a SyFy original movie with a bigger budget, and brings almost nothing truly interesting to the table."

","OK, I just finished watching the movie Waterworld. I last saw it when it came out and thought it had a nice flow to it, nice development and evolution of character and plot line. I enjoyed it even more this time around. But I had this eerie feel of déjà vu! No, I am not mistakenly posting a review for the wrong movie, please bare with me. A quick search on IMDb and I came up with this: the writer for both movies, Waterworld and Pitch Black is the same one!<br/><br/>The rest is quite easy to follow. The unlikely hero, an outcast from the society, crosses paths with a party in distress. Reluctant to even approach him, they find themselves in the need to ask him for help. Our hero meets the innocence, the child, the only one who will truly see inside his soul and will see him for what he really is: the man and not the beast. Through the child's eyes, the others and the audience will grow closer to this character, who will lead the worthy to the salvation.<br/><br/>OK, there is a tiny hint of sarcasm, because I felt a little disappointed when I realized the story was recycled A to Z. And yes, I know what you are going to say, they are two completely different stories. A giant deserted planet without so much as a drop of water could not be any more different from the planet covered with the vast seas (and not a drop of fresh water). But all jokes aside, both narratives are great none less. They hold their own and have many layers and depths to discover. I guess in this time and age of the Hollywood recycling machine I was craving for the rare spark of originality, but I will let this one slide since they can both be accredited to the same brilliant writer."

","We follow a group of around nine people trying to survive on a hostile planet where they have crashed with their spaceship. Among them is a prisoner, played by Vin Diesel, who they fear and at the same time have to depend upon as the story develops and this makes the group-dynamic very interesting to follow. They have no chance but to trust him and still they become anxious every time he is out of sight. The fight for survival has been made with a lot of suspense and the little group faces a lot of challenges which they try to solve in the best possible way. On the planet they have crashed upon, they discover a former colony of humans that apparently was abandoned in a hurry so along with the fight for survival comes the effort to try and answer all the questions as to what happened here?<br/><br/>I think that this movie is beyond any comparison much better than the sequel. If treated in a competent way the ""survival""-theme is always interesting to follow especially if it is combined with the possibilities and challenges of being in a group. Should I rely on the group or should I only trust myself? Should I try to become the leader or should I accept that somebody else is trying to impose leadership on the group? There are many nuances to describe in the theme of ""survivel with the group"" and I think that ""Pitch Black"" pulls this off in a both entertaining and plausible (if you accept the basic principles of the story) way.<br/><br/>Regards Simon<br/><br/>Ps. When you read reviews that gives max score check to see if the user has made more than one review. If not consider the possibility of a lobbyist.

","This is a very unique science fiction movie. It involves a spacecraft crashed on a planet with hostile life forms, some sort of birds that just cut people to shreds. It involves the characters who have to rely on a fairly interesting and definitive anti hero to help them. This could be called the HOMBRE of outer space movies. The chief character, Riddick, now appears a lot, and makes a very good anti hero. He is not vicious, just a survivor. He couldn't be more unlike the ridiculous characters of spaghetti Westerns who don't make a bit of sense. He is more akin to John Russell of HOMBRE. In fact, this movie's style is based on its strength of character development. There is a lot of action, and the characters are extremely credible, even if the plot is somewhat flimsy. But that's okay, because this is a movie which puts real people in an unbelievable situation, which is far superior to a movie which puts unbelievable people in a believable situation."

Superb action, outstanding photography and great actors - and tension, tension and tension for one and a half hours. Vin Diesel id undeniably the central figure of the movie and plays his part as it is written in the book for a runaway prisoner. Yes, it is similar to the Alien series but the climax of the movie is different: the hero here proves sooner that he is able to cope with the seemingly invincible mutant creatures that eases the tension and gives the audience a final relief and faith that all will come to a happy end after all."

","I'm not generally a Sci-fi fan, but i watch this movie whenever it comes on. It sets an unusual, and at times haunting tone, where you are often unsure who or what to root for with an element of simplicity that it's sequel was sadly unable to capture. First of all, it is not (as some sci-fi films *including it's sequel* can be) overly reliant on complicated governmental or moral systems, in fact, if it wasn't for the space travel and what not, the movie would be largely plausible if it were set in the present day. It is human, and you don't have to worry about understanding anything but being human to watch it.Also, considering that it's a ""b-movie"" it has some really excellent performances. Obviously, diesel steals the show (in what i would argue is possible his finest acting work to date), but all of the cast does well at portraying their varied and quirky group. Don't base your opinion of this film on it's successor, they are totally different pursuits. If you're sci-fi fan you'll like it, if you're an action fan you'll like it. It's a great movie."

","There are so few true science fiction movies made, this is one of the very few that passes the bill for me. This is not a disguised horror film, though it certainly drifts that way quite a bit. It is certainly not a science film - much is implausible - what do those tens of thousands of indigenous creatures eat when there aren't a handful of humans on the planet and mass extinction is obviously in progress? Let along how do three suns revolve around a group of planets (Newton would shudder in his grave)? But this film does the one thing science fiction is supposed to do - and does it well. It creates an alternative reality and lets you imagine real humans living in it. The alternative reality works, and the psychological elements of the drama are icing on the cake. As a lifelong science fiction fan (in written form), my disappointment at the weakness of science fiction in film is nearly endless. This film encourages me. It is part way there. I'm looking to seeing the sequels (and probably will soon). I would also rate movies such at 13th Floor, Contact, Mission to Mars (and of course, Forbidden Planet) in that class - true science fiction films, as well as the more popular and mainstream original three Star Wars movies and the Alien series.... but not a great deal else....

"TrickyTheHorrorFreak","9","0","0","22 September 2006"," Really good science fiction film made better by the character Riddick.
","""Pitch Black"" is the perfect example of a film that clones most of its elements from a previous classic (in this case it's ""Aliens"") and yet still manages to be entertaining and amazingly appear somewhat fresh. Both movies involve a group of people stuck on a distant planet being hunted by an extremely dangerous species. After the initial onslaught, both movies then see the remaining characters attempting to survive while desperately working to get off the planet as soon as possible. So how can ""Pitch Black"" possibly seem fresh despite all these similarities? Well, the difference is in the details.<br/><br/>When a spaceship is critically damaged by some sort of asteroid storm, the pilot is forced to crash-land on a desert planet that has three suns. Due to at least one of the suns being above the horizon at all times it at first appears as if the planet exists in constant sunlight. Soon after they arrive it becomes apparent that the survivors are not alone. A species of creature takes a few of them out before they have a chance to figure out what's happening. This reptilian looking animal appears to have a severe reaction to light of any sort and so the climate seems to be ideal for the marooned travelers to avoid contact. But when the three suns and a planet all align in a massive scale eclipse, the creatures are free to roam the planet, attacking any life-forms that they come into contact with. The crew will soon come to realize that they need to rely heavily on a convicted killer they were previously transporting if they are to have any chance of survival.<br/><br/>The setup is a good one. The suspense builds dramatically as the light begins to fade away. But the thing that takes the movie to another level completely is the cast and the special effects. The effects are awesome, particularly when you consider that ""Pitch Black"" did not have a huge budget. In particular the initial crash scene is grippingly intense and kicks proceedings off with one heck of a bang. The creatures look real and frightening and the use of light and shadows works well for both the story and the budgetary constraints. The movie was filmed in Australia yet the planet appears alien due to the strange overexposed lighting used throughout the daytime scenes as well as the alien looking skeletal remains that dot the surface. Each member of the cast has a distinct persona as well as their own story to tell. Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) is an attractive young woman that comes awfully close to intentionally killing most of the crew during the crash landing in an attempt to save her own life, only to be considered a hero when they all live to see another day. She struggles throughout the movie with this cowardice and the undue praise that followed. William (Cole Hauser) is a morphine addicted mercenary intent on making sure a convicted criminal comes to justice. But the star of ""Pitch Black"" is undoubtedly Vin Diesel as Riddick, an escaped prisoner that the rest of the crash survivors rightfully fear. Diesel doesn't say an awful lot during the movie, yet every time he is on screen, he simply demands attention. I do feel that the creators tried perhaps a little too hard to make Riddick appear insanely dangerous, yet it's a credit to Diesel's performance that the audience still finds themselves in awe of him as well as hopeful to see more of him in action. The character was so successful that there is now a sequel called Riddick as well as a computer game based on him alone.<br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" is most definitely ripping off previous films as stated above, but it does what it does tremendously well. Considering the amount of dreadful monster films that have come out in recent times, the grittiness, setting and Riddick make this movie a complete success. I highly recommend it to any fan of science fiction and horror."

Excellent pop-corn scif-fi, intelligent enough to keep sciffy fans happy and enough action to please everyone else. Different look, too! And Vin Diesel is very good in this. I haven't seen anything else with him in it that I like, but here he is very much in his element.<br/><br/>The characters are really perfectly written and portrayed, the special effects are in fact fairly cheaply done but but also very creatively, and the slightly moth-eaten-ness of everything actually contributes to ambiance of the movie.<br/><br/>There's been talk about the physical laws being violated in the solar system this movie is portrayed in - there aren't any violations that I can see. The story is set on the moon of a ringed gas giant which is orbiting a star which is in a binary system with... another, smaller binary system. Binary systems are commonplace, as are gas giants with moons and suns with interesting orbital resonances leading to grand alignments and complex eclipses. Just because the orrery takes the planet as the fixed frame of reference (which is probably what you'd have to do anyway to represent such a system) doesn't mean any laws are being violated. In fact, the cosmology in this movie is really GOOD... OK... Enough cosmology...<br/><br/>The monsters are great! Convincing, scary dumb beasties a bit like sharks and a bit like bats and a bit like snakes and a bit like pterodactyls...<br/><br/>The plot collapses under scrutiny, but not through badly thought-through character motivation or twists that make no sense, nobody does anything *unbelievably* stupid, by which I mean everyone's behaviour is logically explicable and can be related to. It's the weight of all the coincidences that causes the collapse, but that's okay, the movie's exciting enough that you don't care.<br/><br/>It probably doesn't carry repeat viewing, I'd guess...<br/><br/>8 stars! 2 for Vin diesel, 1 for the sheer coolness of a story set on an interesting and physically possible solar system, 1 for the rest of the characters, all of whom are excellent, 1 for the fast and furious plot, 1 for the beasties and a whopping 2 for that lovely shot of the the suns going down behind the gas giant in the middle of the movie...<br/><br/>WOW... that was pretty..."

Once the movie goes into its eclipse phase, we get to see the action through Riddick's ""Shine Job"" vision and also through the sonar of the creatures hunting him and his fellow survivors.<br/><br/>There is a creditable amount of restraint in the CGI department and the special effects work well. Any shots of the night creatures are only a few seconds long each time, so that we never get a clear image of what's eating its way through the cast.<br/><br/>Twohy's screenplay, written with Jim and Ken Wheat, manages to create some believable characters and make the audience care about what happens to them. Well, some of them anyway. There is a good balance of humour and pathos mixed in with the bloodletting and there is very little excess anything as the story bowls along.<br/><br/>The script is fleshed out well by a good cast. No one stands out, although Vin Diesel and Lewis Fitz-Gerald seem to get more than their fair share of the best one-liners.<br/><br/>Universal clearly saw ""Pitch Black"" as a launch vehicle for Vin Diesel, previously a solid supporting player in films like ""Boiler Room"" and ""Saving Private Ryan"". Diesel went on to star in some big ole' blockbusters after this film, but ""Pitch Black"" is where he proves that he has genuine screen presence. At least Universal Studios can claim the credit for noticing him."

","Now I have to start by admitting that I think Vin Diesel is a decent actor. Yes, so he always looks like someone who might pop in to Miami Ink to get a new tattoo of an eagle on his back and then ride off on a Harley.... but he is very watchable. He is no Larry Olivier or John Hurt... hell, he's not even as good as Tom Hanks or John Goodman... but he does have a charisma and personality that fills the screen. He was great in boiler room, and with Riddick, he is good yet again.<br/><br/>I wasn't expecting a lot from the film - it has had some mixed reviews, and comparisons to the Alien series is understandable (even if the types of films are very different), but I have to say that the cinematography is on a par with (well recently) Three Kings and the special effects are pretty much flawless.<br/><br/>The story is... well... to be honest, secondary to the characterisation and the look of the film, but then, isn't that true of so many sci-fi efforts? Most of the characters are well developed, if a little ""typical"" at times, and it made a change for some of the peripheral characters to actually survive.<br/><br/>Oh, and yes, the whole thing about a species that can only come out to hunt every however many years.... and the fact that no other species on the surface would have survived without sunlight... let's ignore it!

","There isn't much that I can say about Pitch Black that hasn't already been said: it's dark, low-budget and brilliant.<br/><br/>Riddick is one of my favorite characters in cinema, alongside Darth Vader, Bond and Jack Sparrow. Vin Diesel has a type of menacing presence that only very few actors can achieve. The over-all grading of the film also gives us a nice and unsettling atmosphere, and a little bit of dark irony keeps the film alive.<br/><br/>I guess it's a bit of a bummer that I saw Chronicles before Pitch Black since I already knew the outcome, but as a science-fiction suspense film (I don't like the term ""horror"") it is a major success as well as a bit of an unconventional drama."

Probably the biggest advantage of this film is it's original story and pretty cool visual effects. If you'are not expecting a master-piece, you might just like it.

You couldn't help but to cheer for the villain. The story is similar to Alien but expanded to a greater scale. The killer aliens didn't look threatening at first but after a while their deadliness was up there with the alien from Alien. Cole Hauser's performance would make anyone hate his character. The chemistry between Hasuer and Diesel in their fight scene reminded me of the ""grudge match films"" such as Demolition Man, Face/Off, Broken Arrow, Universal Soldier, and Virtuosity.

","Pitch Black opens with the basic shot of a transport vessel moving lazily through space. Almost obscured is a huge comet blazing a trail right in front of the ship. Three minutes later the comet has ripped through the ship, killed the Captain and set the ship on a direct course towards the surface of a handily placed planet.<br/><br/>Pilot Fry is thrown into the fray, and she has a choice between jettisoning the half of the ship containing the passengers to save her skin or trying to get the whole ship down in one piece which is impossible. She ignores the safety of the crew and trys to jettison the crew quarters, only to find that there is a malfunction and she is unable to do so. She manages to crash the ship, yet around fifteen of the passengers survive. One of those passengers is bounty hunter Johns. Another is his captured prey, Riddick.....<br/><br/>Riddick escapes, and Johns is forced to search the surface of the planet looking for him. It turns out that there are three suns for this particular planet, which isn't the most helpful thing for Riddick because while in prison he had his eyes 'tinted' to allow him to see in the dark. This is why he wears a pair of designer goggles that keep him safe from the sunlight. Johns captures Riddick and ties him up with some metal cables, taking his goggles away to keep him subdued.<br/><br/>With the ship damaged, the crew, led by Fry, finds an outpost with a small shuttle type ship. They need to transfer the fuel cells from their transport ship to this little shuttle in order to escape. However, while searching the outpost they discover that they are not the only living creatures on this planet and that there are some winged bat things that only come out at night. With three suns you'd be thinking that night would be impossible on this planet right? Wrong.<br/><br/>Unluckily for the survivors there is an eclipse of one of the suns. Its unclear why the other two suns suddenly disappear but hey, this is Hollywood. Anything can happen.<br/><br/>So the crew enlist riddick to help them survive the ensuing darkness. He helps them take the fuel cells and fights off the marauding bat things while sparring with Johns at the same time.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is a low budget movie that looks far more expensive than it really is. The effects for the crash are superb, and the bat things are brilliantly realised. As fry, radha Mitchell exudes just enough power and vulnerability to show that she is in charge of the situation yet aggrieved about what she tried to do during the crash. As Johns, B-movie regular Cole Hauser is eerie enough and strong enough to play the role easily enough, although his trusty shotgun looks a tad on the flimsy side.<br/><br/>The movie though really belongs to Vin Diesel. His riddick is a brilliant creation, all muscular front and steely insides. He doesn't care about anyone or anything, although he does seem to develop a lust for Fry that grows throughout the film until she is literally taken from his arms at the end of the film. He is easily able to carry the fight scenes and while not a talented thespian he does give his few lines (he doesn't speak at all in the first twenty minutes) with enough zest to carry him through.<br/><br/>David Twohy injects the limited scope of the film with skill and grandeur, and the action has a pumped up and superior feel to it. Short and snappy action scenes fill the latter half of the movie, and the lack of really choppy editing keeps things moving at just the right pace. The performances are adequate, and while the film is never really scary or chilling, it is definitely entertaining enough to fill an evenings worth of viewing.<br/><br/>This is proof that sometimes a low budget can really aid a film, as Twohy doesn't just throw a huge explosion or gun fight into the mix just for the sake of having one. He keeps things tight and focused, and the film is all the better for it.<br/><br/>A brilliant little movie."

","This story is the prequel to Chronicles of Riddick. But don't be fooled. I don't think Pitch Black was ever made with the intention of producing a sequel. I think Vin Diesel just became a big enough star that someone decided to continue the character of Riddick. This whole thing is sort of the reverse of ""Remo Williams-The Adventure Begins,"" where the title would suggest a sequel maybe even a trilogy. But no, they started off with a big-shot title that never took flight other than its original film. I never could figure out why though. I mean, it's not all that bad of a movie.<br/><br/>Anyway, excuse my departure from the subject - Pitch Black. This film is a sci-fi/horror about a group of survivors who crash land on a deserted planet. But one of their passengers is a serial killer - Riddick. This surprised me in that I would have thought Vin to be the hero (which in a way he semi-becomes but not blatantly). Soon the unfamiliar companions realize there is something else to fear on the planet that is worse than Riddick. Bodies soon turn up missing.<br/><br/>This film does a good job with CGI for the creatures and Vin Diesel's character, while still an enigma at the end of the film, surprisingly portrays a backward struggle to compassion. And Radha Mitchell does will in playing a starship pilot seeking redemption. While these themes transpire nicely in the film, the main focus, of course, is on the alien creatures. The gore definitely brings the sci-fi into the horror level. Some good suspense scenes too, where the director draws you in to sympathize with the stranded crew, each of whom seem to have their own conflict. Just don't be misled in thinking you'll see Vin-Riddick as the superhero that Chronicles of Riddick make him out to be. In this film, his motto is, ""When the Bad Get Good."" 7/10"

","First off, if you are a Sci-Fi fan (or loved Star Wars) then you should definitely see Chronicles of Riddick before you see this movie. Chronicles of Riddick creates a universe and series of friendships which do not entirely align with Pitch Black, unless you see Pitch Black second.<br/><br/>Judging from his recent works, David Twohy might have done well as a pastor. By that, I mean that he seems to enjoy the marriage of genres to create new situations. Pitch Black is a slasher/horror film for sci-fi/alien fans in the same way that Below is a ghost/horror film for Submarine/War fans. I would hypothesize that if you do not like Science Fiction, you will not like Pitch Black. If you like Slasher/Horror movies, you *might* like this.<br/><br/>David Twohy is one of my favorite big budget writers because he puts you in a world unlike your own. The problem with Pitch Black is that it does not reveal the full world - there is much mystery. This would not be such a bad thing if its sequel hadn't changed/defined the universe.<br/><br/>Ultimately, Pitch Black is probably a better movie than Chronicles of Riddick in the respect that it appeals to (possibly) a larger audience and accomplishes a more with less."

","""Pitch Black"" is a visually-dazzling sci-fi thriller that pretends to be the same as most ""Alien"" knockoffs, but is instead something else altogether. It dares to be excellent in the face of intense criticism - those who contend that the film owes a lot to its predecessors, which indeed it does - may eat their own words when they see what an excellent job was done with the story.<br/><br/>Though ""Pitch Black"" surprised many audiences in 2000, it was met with a lot of mixed praise; I didn't pay much attention to it and the hype surrounding the movie had soon faded from my attention. When the ""Pitch Black - Unrated Director's Cut"" DVD was released just a few months ago as to rake in pennies from the inevitable hype for ""The Chronicles of Riddick,"" my interest was renewed.<br/><br/>""Chronicles"" chronicled the downfall of summer movies (I wasn't going to see it anyway, but the free ticket that came with the ""Pitch Black"" DVD burned a whole in my wallet; plus the movie was dumbed down to ""PG-13"" from an original ""R"" rating, meaning that more scenes of character development and graphic violence were removed to cater to teenage fanboys). The best thing to be said about ""Chronicles"" really, was that the production design and visual effects were quite impressive.<br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" offers something more in the way of characters, that you actually care about them and when you rooted for that bad ass Riddick (Vin Diesel), those feelings were genuine. You actually got scared when all the lights went out and the small band of survivors led by Riddick and the unwilling captain of the downed spaceship (Radha Mitchell) had to make it to safety in total blackness because bloodthirsty, nocturnal creatures were on their tail the whole time.<br/><br/>The director, David N. Twohy, created a beautiful, nightmarish place - this sun-scorched desert planet that's roasted for an undetermined amount of time by not one, not two, but three suns. Twohy was a master with ""Pitch Black,"" especially since his only previous directorial effort was the alien invasion thriller ""The Arrival,"" with Charlie Sheen, back in 1996.<br/><br/>The characters in ""Pitch Black"" aren't fodder for the monsters; they're people with real feelings and emotions. You feel sympathy for Radha Mitchell's character, who quickly finds herself stuck in a really nasty situation and is also the unwilling leader of these survivors. And though this should be her movie, it's really Vin Diesel's, who would go on four years later to make ""Chronicles,"" which really has nothing to do with this film, as it is more influenced by the subculture (comics, cartoons, etc.) that has amassed around the character since 2000.<br/><br/>""Pitch Black,"" despite some of its minor flaws (some pacing problems, a little uneven storytelling), is still a remarkable film nonetheless and I'm sure it's destined for some kind of cult status.<br/><br/>8/10"

","There was nothing particularly brilliant nor bad about this movie.  I borrowed the DVD from a friend and watched it late one Saturday night and found it entertaining.  There was a cool visual feel that sucked me in right away and the script and direction actually did a very good job at creating an eerie alien world.  It reminded me of the world that Riddley Scott created in the first Aliens.  You don't know very much about the world, but you know enough to let your imagination fill in the oh so creepy AND curious details.  Its rare these days that a movie actually assumes you have some imagination and even rarer that it tries to engage it!  Case in point, some characters don't speak English. Instead of giving them bad accents or putting up subtitles, the director intentionally keeps you in the dark.  You don't really need to know that `ensign green #1' says to `ensign green #2', `I am scared.'  `Yes, me too.' Instead, the director relies on the actors to *emote* that, and again, your mind fills in the details-far more effective.<br/><br/>
I am not really a big fan of Diesel, and knew nothing about the supporting cast.  But they could actually act!  Even the minor characters played their `ensign green' roles well.  You know that all the characters will not make it and many will die in a morally `appropriate manner' and I get annoyed at films that try to kid us about this little fact.  The film generally does a good job not trying to play this silly game.  <br/><br/>Overall the film is more horror than Sci-Fi but it did a good job of creating tension and is worth a rental.

","""Pitch Black"" cannot lay too much claim to being original, since ""Alien,"" ""Predator,"" and a whole array of other sci-fi and non-sci-fi films have dealt with the issues in this movie before. But that's what Hollywood is all about. The film opens as the captain of a civilian cruiser, while in a cryogenic sleep, dies. Two other crew members, Owens and Fry, struggle in vane to land the ship, dumping cargo in an attempt to raise the nose, and land on a nearby planet. After crashing and wrecking the ship, Owens is mortally wounded and the one hostile passenger, Richard B. Riddick, escapes.<br/><br/>The planet has three suns, so there is no nighttime. Great rib-cages of monstrous animals lie in canyons on this seemingly waterless planet. Among the survivors is an Arab holy man and his three sons, a prospector, an antiques dealer, a mischievous ""boy,"" and an Aussie, whose job now is to dig graves for the dead. Also, there is a man named Johns, who is hell-bent on tracking down the escaped killer, Riddick. But his motives are more ambiguous than people think.<br/><br/>The only water on the planet comes from a well where people had previously settled here. But nobody is around. But thankfully they left some kind of lifeboat shuttle, that the crew can use to leave the planet.<br/><br/>Zeke, the gravedigger, mistakenly shoots another surviving passenger, mistaking him for Riddick, and discovers a hole in the burial site wall. When he looks in there, something kills him and sucks him through, and Riddick's standing right there.<br/><br/>Initially blamed for Zeke's death, the escaped convict, a man who has had an operation on his eyes to see in the dark, warns of something inside that hole. When indeed they do find creatures, and a model of the planet suggests that the last civilization was wiped out during a rare total eclipse, one which coincidentally is about to happen again, Johns makes a deal with Riddick to help them if he promises to play nice.<br/><br/>The movie features a cast of, at that time, fairly little-known actors, save for Keith David (best described as a character actor). Vin Diesel had been in ""Saving Private Ryan"" as a soldier who got shot by a sniper, and in ""Boiler Room,"" but this was his first starring role. The character arcs help give this movie credibility: Caroline Fry (Radha Mitchell) was willing to dump the whole passenger load to save her own life, and now is hailed as captain for saving everyone's life; Johns (Cole Hauser) is a morphine-addicted bounty hunter; Riddick would just as soon leave everyone behind, as is his animal nature.<br/><br/>On one last note, Vin Diesel is not Marlon Brando, but he's not a ""bad actor."" Certainly not too bad here, as a relative bad guy. But now he's too big. He oughta do more movies like ""Boiler Room,"" playing a supporting role to someone with more clout than Paul Walker."

(Asimov's story had night descend on the planet every few millenia or so). <br/><br/>For a few screams, the writers threw in a few million light-hating, flesh-eating things (that look like the aliens monsters brought out of retirement) and you have the film Pitch Black.

","PITCH BLACK delivers on several levels. Imaginative FXs, thrilling concept, excellent cinematography and good actors. But this is a B-movie nonetheless, not that there's anything wrong with that. The thing that keeps this from being a grade A movie is the constant use of cheesy excuses for stretching the story, the lack of focus on certain aspects of the story, the director's attempts to make the movie look groovy (distortion in images, etc) and the sometimes cheap looking sets (for instance, some seats looked like they were bought at Office Depot). But the whole movie still works, thanks mainly to the director's respect for sci-fi genre, but more importantly, because of the presence of Vin Diesel, who literally became a star after playing Riddick. Vin steals the movie and his excellent performance elevates what could have been a standard sci-fi B-movie into an above average sci-fi B-movie. Juxtaposing the menacing flying aliens with the dangerous character of Riddick was a brilliant idea. As Riddick keeps saying, ""it ain't me you should be worrying about.""<br/><br/>The actors were mostly all good, certainly the top trio, Vin, Radha Mitchell and Cole Hauser. All three actors made a good impression, even though the movie clearly belongs to Vin.<br/><br/>As for the flying aliens, they basically look like THE BIRDS on steroids. They're effective but not 100% menacing. The main problem with them is they're rarely the same size throughout the movie. For instance, at the beginning, the alien creatures look very small when they killed the woman but later on during the film, the creatures suddenly look bigger and more ALIEN-like.<br/><br/>But this is just some minor details to be expected from a B-movie.

I guess some saw it as not ""politically correct"" although for that same reason it is so much HUMANLY CORRECT, because in striving for political correctness we often forget that the real world around us is much more natural, varied and politically incorrect. With this bold (yet so natural) ending, this movie wins me over precisely because it touches this part of our souls that will never be corrupted by false hypocrisy and empty slogans."

","You won't see much in Pitch Black that hasn't already been done a few times before, but that doesn't mean it isn't entertaining anyway.  The basic premise is that a ragtag group of space travelers crash on a planet that has three suns and no nights.  Or so they think.  Adding to the problem of escaping this seemingly deserted planet is the problem of Riddick, a serial killer who survives the crash and almost immediately escapes from the man who is supposed to be watching him.  But, as they find out, there is an alien organism lurking in the shadows that is much more of a threat to their survival than Riddick is.<br/><br/>What makes this movie good boils down to David Twohy and Vin Diesel. Twohy's resourcefulness is showcased here, by the fact that he made this film on a $23 million budget when films that cost twice as much often look much worse.  His visual stylings and guiding hand create a spooky atmosphere, and the deliberately paced film consistently builds tension as it moves along.  And Diesel, who might not be the best actor in the world, is however perfectly cast in the role of Riddick.  He is imposing and intimidating all the way through.  <br/><br/>To enjoy this one you have to accept it for what it is, a B-movie concept with a modest budget that is well executed by its director and cast.  It's a given in a movie like this that there will be some shaky acting, cheesy dialogue, and plot holes.  You just have to be willing to let that slide. Beyond those flaws Pitch Black is a very slick, entertaining sci-fi horror movie with a lot of excitement and a some good laughs, some intentional and some not, along the way.  All in all a fun update of grade-B science fiction."

","This was a great movie and the sequel should know our socks off!!! The action will be nonstop and I just bought the special edition DVD with the animated background story similar to the Animatrix. This will put Vin Diesel back in the spotlight and hopefully get him the coveted role in Spider Man 3 as Venom. He would be the most logical choice for the role. Back to PB this movie even though it is a indie thriller, it has a great story and characters with backgrounds that scream for you to want to learn more.

","If you're a science fiction fan, and you've only seen this movie once, please, PLEASE go and treat yourself to a second viewing. I just did, and I was AMAZED about how good I thought the movie was, as opposed to when I first saw it three years ago. The first time around I was certainly impressed by the astronomical vistas we're treated to in this movie, but by and large I didn't think that much of the movie as a whole. It was an Alien rip-off, and I thought the description of the monsters was a case of really bad science. That they were allergic to light was something I found especially ridiculous. Based on my first viewing, I recently rated this movie a 5.<br/><br/>However, now that the sequel, Chronicles of Riddick, is on the way, and the movie poster for that one looks amazing, I thought I'd better brush up on Pitch Black once more, so I borrowed the video from a friend. I am so glad I did. There's so much of what I thought I remembered from the first viewing that turned out to be wildly inaccurate. I thought most of the characters died very early in the movie. This was not so. I thought Claudia Black's character was the first to die. This was not so. I thought Riddick was the sole survivor. This was not so. <br/><br/>I see now that the movie works *extremely* well. There isn't an excessive, tiresome focus on the monsters. It's much more of a human drama. The main characters are appealing and capable of some convincing acting. And there are so many little details that make the Pitch Black universe coherent and believable, such as the shortage of oxygen in the atmosphere of the planet they crash on, and the fact that the monsters have eaten everything on the planet, and so they turn on each other.<br/><br/>And I have to mention the astronomical vistas again. I mean, we start out seeing the spaceship passing through a comet's tail, with bits of spacedust zapping through the hull. Then we come to a planet with three suns. Just as the shipwrecked people think it's about to get dark, a blue sun rises on the opposite horizon, and everything is engulfed in a blue glow. As the eclipse approaches, we see the huge, neighboring, ringed gas giant rise across the sky, and in the final scene of the movie we see the ship skid closely above one of these very rings. These scenes are created with a sense of beauty, wonder and detail, and I don't think I've seen any other SF movie that really made such a point out of including these things. I hope we see much more of it in the sequel.<br/><br/>Pitch Black now gets from me a rating of 9 out of 10. A cult classic? You bet!!"

Sure, he was there in ""Into Pitch Black"", but here he was ferocious, scary, and intense.

Mitchell and Diesel make a fine combination of feist and freak (the latter has super night vision and superhuman strength) as the combatants against their nocturnal foe.

","The influences of other science fiction and thriller movies and stories are evident throughout this film.  The movies that come to mind immediately are Alien, Aliens, and Starship Troopers.  The story itself is fairly straightforward and not all that original, hibernated traveling through space, crash landing on planet with no apparent life and a ""deserted"" geological expedition - except when the lights go out, forcing different types of people to work together toward their mutual survival, while the body count mounts.  This kind of movie always tends to be fun, as long as it's done well.  I believe that Pitch Black was done well.  The characters are interesting and you want to find out more about them the longer the movie goes on, and I think people will be surprised by who does and doesn't make it.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel plays Riddick, the stereotypical convicted criminal who has a murderous past, physically prowess, high tolerance for pain, and conveniently can see in the dark.  You know he is going to end up doing the right thing at some point in the movie, because it's hinted throughout the movie that he actually may have a conscience about things.<br/><br/>Cole House plays the drug-addicted bounty hunter who's probably in many ways a real bad guy compared to Riddick, as his character reveals itself throughout the movie.  It is most likely that he is most courageous when the odds and firepower are in his favor.  A very self-serving character that in the end gets what he deserves.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell plays the co-pilot on the doomed vessel, who is jolted out of deep sleep because the ship ran through a meteor swarm or the tail end of a comment.  Finding the pilot dead in his sleeping chamber she attempts to land the ship, which leads to our discovery of that's character's potentially fatal flaw - fear of responsibility, accountability, and being a leader.  Her character in the short span of the story probably grows the most, in that she actually grows some conviction, takes charge, and doesn't sit around waiting to be gobbled up by night stalking aliens.  She in some strange way connects with the ever-distant human side of Riddick, who in turn in the end, respects her for her choices and her sticking with them.<br/><br/>The story in some cases plays out as you would expect it, but I think you'll be mildly surprised by which characters survive this harrowing experience. This movie is an entertaining train-wreck in progress to watch.  Go watch it!"

","Screenwriter and director David Twohy has made a career out of crafting challenging, well-mounted science fiction films via limited means. With this somewhat derivative but enjoyable action thriller, he nearly succeeds. Most of the casting in Pitch Black is by type and thus instantly forgettable, though given the story's haunted-house horror movie structure, this is probably by design. The film is anchored by Radha Mitchell and the strutting, grunting Vin Diesel, relative newcomers who prove their mettle on the big screen with reflective performances marked by detailed, intuitive choices. As he did with Warlock (1988), Disaster in Time (1992), and The Arrival (1996), Twohy takes what was intended to be a straight-to-video genre potboiler and transforms the project into something at least a cut above other examples of its type.

","Yay, the first film that launched Vin Diesel into the series of seemingly never-ending roles where he plays bad-ass con after bad-ass con to just plain bad-ass (minus the con).  I don't know if I just can't buy into Vin Diesel being some tough guy or if I'm just sick of seeing that type on the screen.  This setup reminds me John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars  people on planet and need to escape before something comes and kills them.  In Carpenter's film you have possessed people who look like zombies, in this we have imitation aliens who thrive on darkness.  At least Carpenter had the sense to incorporate a degree of humorous corniness and sappiness (even if it didn't go over well with audiences.)<br/><br/>But apparently the masses favor big-bad Mr. Ex con who no one screws with who somehow always has the upper hand regardless of the situation.  I would've been at the edge of my seat hoping that the studio would have it in them to kill off this character, but then I remembered studios don't care about good plot turns and developments and only care about marketability and sequel possibilities which translates to formulas which translates to all the wrong people dying in uninteresting ways at predictable points in the film . . . or in plain English, the studio didn't have the balls to kill off that character.  <br/><br/>And teaming the big-bad convict with an all but helpless crew who cannot survive a day without him  been there, done that, bored me then too.  Why have a movie with other characters when none of them truly add anything more than a minor annoyance and act as a little obstacle from time to time?  If they're going to make a film to play to Diesel's ego why not make it Diesel versus the Pitch Black monsters?<br/><br/>The only surprise in the film involves a laughable standoff between Vin and the creatures; why this seemingly super-human courage' and ability is deemed cool, I'll never know.  But I couldn't suspend my disbelief enough to see it come out as anything but the Riddick character meeting a painful death and cries and screams just as loud as every other `lesser' character on the crew.<br/><br/>Hitchcock is quoted as saying `A bomb is under the table and it goes off - that's surprise.  A bomb is under the table and it doesn't go off - that's suspense.'  Pitch Black has neither suspense nor surprise, just obligatory and formula-drive scenarios shot in a generic manner with an altered perception every now and again in an attempt to keep its audience awake. That said, there's no reason to see Pitch Black other than to see this cast of people perform the standard space-thriller drill.  Not being a fan of Diesel, I can't say I enjoyed Pitch Black."

Maybe like, showing us crotch cams every 30 seconds just so they could be first?<br/><br/>  Now, I know that not everyone will agree on whether this movie is above-par for the genre or not.  Just go into it with open eyes, and push away your bias and pointless criticism.  I swear to you I could pick apart any movie out there based on minor unimportant details and use that as my sole argument for it sucking - but that just doesn't cut it. <br/><br/>
  This movie is very formula in some parts.  It is when it breaks tradition that it gets noticed.  It mixes the psychology into the action so well and SO subtlely, that it never forces it's theme down your throat.  What is the theme?  Redemption.<br/><br/>  9/10"

","I must admit that I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be god awful and quite frankly a joke, and I'm surprised and pleased to be able to say that it was neither. But when people claim that it is complex and cutting edge they are simply kidding themselves. This movie is simply a particular well done modern 'B movie'. And lets not pretend that Vin Diesel portrayed a deep character with conflicting emotions, etc. Vin Diesel's performance was decent and utilitarian; just because the writer called for him 'not to talk most of the time' doesn't meen that he should get all this credit for possessing some incredible eye for character psychology.<br/><br/>The overall plot is the absolute standard scifi: land on alien planet and discover some horrible secret through the people who are there or the remains of the people who died there. This has been the default scifi plot since the earliest scifi days and is probably the plot for 4/5 of all Star Trek episodes. Although the concept of the staying in the light thing seems reasonably original enough I will give the movie some credit.<br/><br/>The inclusion of the 'unique characters' like the Muslims is hardly ground breaking. The writer simply needed to include a mystic/religious grandfather figure (the main muslim guy) and some fodder for the monsters to kill before they started killing the real characters (the muslim kids with him). [Admit it, you knew from the beginning that those annoying kids were gonna die.]<br/><br/>However the movie is worth seeing, just ignore the standard scifi plot holes and try to forget that some of these reviewers said that Vin Diesel is a good actor.

There is a sequel coming out to this and for the first time, I can say, I am looking forward to the sequel....that is...in hopes that it covers the areas that were so missed in this film: Character development, story development. Now, don't get me wrong, the film wasn't terrible, but you just watch it and at some point you say...""Huh. What happened there? There's gotta be more of an explanation to this."" or ""Why did they resort to this cheap ploy?"" I liked the eerie backdrop quality of the film, they should have stayed consistant with that. My complaints were that I saw parts of ""Aliens"" parts of ""Mission to Mars""--parts of other sci-fi ""buddy-pick off cast-terrible guy with heart of gold"" films that were thrown into this film where there was no need. The production and writing crew should have been stronger (Dan O'Bannon overseeing the script, maybe????) should have let this film be a stand alone onto itself and it would have been...spectacular."

","Diesel was much acclaimed for his performance in Fast and the furious, why? The Movie was mediocre at best, and his performance was hardly earth shattering. He played a stereotype badass, with a shallow personality. You could say the same thing about his performance as Riddick in Pitch Black, but then again, you would be dead wrong! Sure he's a badass in Pitch Black, but by no means a shallow one. His performance displays in intricate detail how the human nature is not only divided into black and white, but covers a lot of gray zones. Without revealing too much, I think it's safe to say that everyone in this movie fight for their lives, and this effectively exposes their true qualities! This certainly puts the prospect of ""true evil"" in perspective, and combined with the complex nature of Riddick enables us to vividly imagine the twist and turns the story takes, and the unnerving development in relationships and alliances. In addition to this quite remarkable achievement, Diesel also manages to casually deliver an appropriate amount of die hard one-liners and thereby emphasizes the action element in this movie that should not be ignored.<br/><br/>Sure the plot in this movie can seem a little far fetched at times, but the (relatively unknown) cast, Diesel in particular, and the dialogue they provide ensure that not does only the paranoia scenes proliferate causing immense thrills but also that this movie becomes sci-fi flick with great depth and entertainment value. 9/10"
"Backlash007","Null","0","0","10 March 2003"," ""You're not afraid of the dark are you?""
","~Spoiler~ <br/><br/>Pitch Black is essentially an Aliens rip-off done the right way, with style and flare and balls.  I say hell yeah.  Director David Twohy (writer of Warlock and Critters 2) has created a sci-fi/horror film with more than a few tricks up its sleeve.  In the first ten minutes it sinks its teeth into you.  By the end of the film, you're left wanting more.  Twohy manages to surprise me on a number of occasions.  The characters are the main surprise. They are unusual for a sci-fi flick, and they change throughout the movie. Our hero is, in fact, an evil man.  Who we think at first is our hero is also an evil man.  And our heroine almost killed everyone at the beginning of the movie.  Everyone is non-traditional and the actors are integral in making it all believable.  A pre-action stardom Vin Diesel is amazing in this role.  If they make a sequel to this (and make it right) Richard Riddick could be his Mad Max.  Cole Hauser is also good as his equal (if you could say he has an equal).  Hauser pulls off a great flip-flop in the duration of the movie and you end up really hating his character.  Radha Mitchell is also fine as our heroine.  She's not overly-beautiful and you can believe she is a pilot.  And the always great Keith David plays a unique part: he's a Muslim.  How often do you see a Muslim character in an outer space flick?  The plot is asking a bit much out of the audience but just go with it.  There's a desert planet inhabited by aliens who are light-sensitive that's surrounded by three suns and every 22 years an eclipse occurs allowing the aliens full reign.  Our players have crash landed just in time for said eclipse (yeah, it's reaching a bit).  Take that for granted and watch the characters, and for ""Riddick Vision.""  How cool is that?  The aliens are not bad, but it's the cinematography that makes the film a bit creepy.  The colors and tones of the picture are absolutely beautiful.  Twohy definitely has his own style and I'm looking forward to seeing more of his work.  Perhaps the best reason for watching this movie is that it meets an old Joe Bob Briggs' standard: ""Anyone can die at any time."" If you loved Alien/Aliens and want to see a different spin on an old formula, check out Pitch Black."
"dromasca","7","0","0","8 March 2003"," Good B-class Movie
","The B-class science-fiction movie is surprisingly good. The plot is simple, and has logic - Survivors of a long distance space crash fight for survival on a three suns planet. They have to face unknown dangers, but also their own characters. Acting is good, violence is never cheap, and the effects prove that you can do a lot with little money. It is worth watching, and better than the sequel('Riddick', after the name of one of the main characters) which was released in 2004. The quality of the cinematography is especially good, from the filtered light of a always lit world to the darkness of an eclipse happening every 22 years. Another interesting and original concept is presenting a group of Muslims in the future - taken into account the stereotypes too often met in recent movies their presence is fresh and different here. Overall, good science-fiction and good action, worth a watch, certainly for the fans of the genre but not only."

","I am in a technical profession, and enjoy thinking about the possibilities of science fact and fiction.  However, in my opinion, Science Fiction is at it's best when the technical aspects are not dwelled upon, and the development of character takes over.  This is the case with Pitch Black. Passengers of a transport vessel find themselves marooned on an inhospitable planet.  Fear, trust, and characters coming to terms with their own weaknesses are intertwined with the basic suspense of a classic horror picture.<br/><br/>The film has some rough spots, but for the most part, great science fiction. I think this did not do as well in the theatres as it could have due to the lack of sophistication in today's audiences.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is great in his role, as is Radha Mitchel.  David Keith's character lacks a bit of depth, in my opinion, but is interesting in the role of a holy man that doesn't have ALL the answers, yet is still faithful.<br/><br/>
My biggest regret is Claudia Black's relatively short screen time!<br/><br/>Take some time to see and enjoy this film."

","I am a big sci-fi and action film fan. Give me an adrelin pumping action film over chick flicks anyday. I watched 'Pitch Black' on the recommendation of a movie magazine which claimed it 'started the career of Vin Diesel'. Intrigued, I checked it out and wasn't disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot is pure sci-fi, taking u into the future with a crash landing (literally). A little distanced at first, I found myself on the edge of my seat as the rag-tag crew headed by Carolyn Fry have to learn to trust a murderer to help them escape the planet and it's rabid carnevourous alien inhabitants.<br/><br/>The cinematography is breathtaking with visually stunning colour washed scenes on the planet ranging from hot blazing orange to cool blue. Director David Twohy directs really well, creating fantastic atmosphere of tension without getting too cheesy and predictable<br/><br/>Of course it is naturally Vin Diesel who leaves the biggest impression. His most interesting and provocative role to date, Diesel is understated and sarcastic, very believeable as a convict killer who can see in the dark. You find yourself drawn to him, despite the fact he is a cold blooded murderer and root for him as he clashes with bounty hunter posing as cop Johns who wants to bring him down for money. The sexual tension between Riddick and Fry is electric, clear in their shared scenes. You find yourself cheering at the end when Riddick escapes alive.<br/><br/>All in all this is a great film, all about who to trust when things get rough and how unlikely friendships can form in the direst situations. The aliens are scary enough yet you find yourself smiling when Riddick faces off against one. Twohy should be congratulated on a fantastic piece of cinema. And yes, I cannot wait for the trio of sequels, packaged as 'The Chronicles of Riddick' following Diesel's character after he escapes the planet. They should be extremely interesting if Diesel can repeat this stunning performance"

What I really like about this film is that the creatures don't have scary yellow eyes and scales and all those other cliched things. And this movie didn't even have that much blood either. And that's a good thing. I am not a horror fan but I don't think this movie really fits in the horror category. The only thing that I thought was scary was Riddick. He was a creepy guy. Especially when he and Johns were fighting. He sliced Johns's back with the knife and then the creatures came and got Johns. I think Riddick staged that. He was a bad guy but I think he was saddened when the creatures finally got Fry. I believe that his performance was the best in this film. ""Pitch Black"" was a great movie and it deserves good reviews. Thanks for reading my review and good night! (And may I add that this is probably Vin Diesel's best movie). :)"

"basemnt-dwellr","10","0","0","16 January 2003"," Great Movie
","The movie starts with a bang, the crash of the space ship. The scene is about 7 minutes long and it is totally amazing. You see the crew wake up confused and not knowing what had happened. Then, when they open the window-cover, instead of the anticipated dark space they find out that they are surrounded by flames and that they are on a crash course with some planet. When they finally land, there is confusion everywhere. It is kind of realistic (as far as you can say that about a science fiction movie).<br/><br/>The planet is scorched by three suns. The cinematography is quite impressive, the colors are totally bleached so you get a good impression on the intensity of the light. Also the points of view of the aliens and of Riddick are really wonderful.<br/><br/>I find it fascinating how the group of survivors is composed. You don't very often see Moslems or Arabs in movies who are not portrayed as evil but just as normal people. Also I like the changes the characters undergo during the movie. Or maybe they don't change but only our perception of the characters changes. So at first you think ""well, these are the good guys, and that is the bad guy"", whereas after a while you start to reconsider your opinion.<br/><br/>
The main character is of course Riddick, played very convincingly by Vin Diesel. In the beginning of the movie he is really scary, for example when he and Fry (Radha Mitchell) are together in the emergency ship they find on the planet, talking about Johns. They are alone in the ship, no Johns can come to help her, because they are undergoing some hull integrity check and the door has to remain closed during that test, and you find yourself thinking ""what will he do to her?"" You never get to know what Riddick is thinking because you can't read his eyes due to the ""shine job"" and due to the goggles he is wearing. So you don't know why he is helping the other survivors to get to the emergency ship. Is it out of pure necessity to get there somehow, or is it because he actually cares for the others? I like it that in the end of the movie he is still willing to let the others die on the planet just to save his own life. Only Fry's willingness to risk her life to save the others impresses him enough to go back with her. But does that really mean that he has changed?<br/><br/>I also like the relationship between Johns (Cole Hauser) and Fry as to who is the leader of the group. In the beginning, it is Johns who they go to, but during the course of the film, Fry is more and more accepted as the leader. Of course that leads to some nice conflicts between the two characters.<br/><br/>I like the ending of the movie.<br/><br/>The acting is really good, better than you would expect of such a movie. Everybody plays his/her character totally believable and although some of the characters remain bland and are only in the film to get eaten by the aliens, the characters are well developed.<br/><br/>The aliens are quite impressive too. You never see much of them which makes them all the more scarier. Unfortunately they are not as scary as for example the one in ""Alien"" but as the film is more a character based movie than a horror film, it doesn't really matter that much.<br/><br/>There are of course some big holes in the plot, for example that they happen to crash land on the planet exactly when the next eclipse is due, that such a planetary system as depicted in the model cannot exist, and that they land within walking distance to an abandoned geologist's camp, but hell, nobody is perfect. You just have to ignore those things, and actually, they really don't matter. Great movie."

A step into darkness leads to a death and soon they learn that once there is a solar eclipse, what is in the dark will appear and they won't be able to see ""it"" except Riddick, who has had surgery on his eyes giving him the ability to see in the dark, but does he even want to save the same people that want him dead?<br/><br/>The plot was great, I fast forwarded most of the ending of the movie to prevent nightmares, but it wasn't that scary or anything (Sure, you'd expect me to say that once I've just admitted I fast forwarded!) The special effects made for Vin Diesel's character Riddick were awesome, as for the monsters, they reminded me of Alien in a way, but the movie was very dark towards the ending and also the ending sucked due to the last person who gets killed, that shouldn't have happened, but sad to say it did happen and it ruined the movie.<br/><br/>I rate this 7/10, Vin Diesel was really good as Riddick, the guy you just start to like, but end up laughing at his sarcasm and then end up hating him."

Twenty-two years between eclipses and our gallant crew put down with just a few hours to spare. What? Too much to take, sorry...<br/><br/>But that's not what it's all about. This is a character drama that just happens to have a sci-fi setting. And that's what keeps me going back and watching this movie again and again. The characters are intense and very well portrayed - all of them, even poor Paris. We see Fry grow from the selfish bitch who would sacrifice forty passengers to save her own skin, to someone who would give her own life to save the others. And Riddick...<br/><br/>Riddick is in a class of his own. Too many times in movies we see the bad-guy-with-the-heart-of-gold stereotype. This ain't Riddick. He's just as bad at the end of the movie as he is at the start, and is quite ready to leave the others in a cave rather than risk himself. He only saves the others when pressed, or when it costs him nothing to do so. We find that Riddick has morals, though - better morals than Johns, the bounty hunter who's herding Riddick back to slam.<br/><br/>This is an *excellent* movie; every time I watch it I pick up something new that I hadn't noticed before. Ignore the contrivances in the plot. Ignore the impossibilities in the science. Instead watch the characters develop, and you'll find a great movie."

What i'm talking about is about 20 or so minutes into the film we are believing that we are going to get an awesome insight into the mysterious Riddick and then all of sudden it's ""WTF it's dark and aliens are eating the crew!"".

I feel like this is how the aliens in PITCH BLACK survive.  The glow in the dark ""slugs"" are actually alien larvae that need many years to mature.  They glow in the dark to keep the adult aliens from eating them (since they glow, they would hurt the adults).  Makes good sense.<br/><br/>3.  What do the aliens eat, you ask?  Well, each other.  Since this is a sci-fi movie and we are to assume that since this is an alien world (and may not even exist in a universe where are laws of physics and nature apply), anything can happen.  These aliens, it is my theory, eat each other.  It's one hell of a theory, but it's possible that they sacrifice themselves for the good of the species.<br/><br/>Well, that's my little run-down.  I really liked the movie and thought it was one of the best Sci-fi movies of the past 10 years.  Science Fiction is lacking a big SMART movie, but Pitch Black is the best Alien sci-fi movie I've seen in years.  What else can compare?  STARSHIP TROOPERS?  I think not."

","This is a brilliant science fiction film that got the treatment of no more than a modern day Alien rip-off. There is actually three films going on at once here, one is a story about a ship that crashes on a deserted planet and its crew must find a way to get off of it. Second is about an escaped convict named Riddick that the crew is searching for before he can kill them all and finally, the third is about a bunch of aliens who are prone to light, but just as luck would have it the crew decided to crash on the planet just at the time of a solar eclipse, rendering the entire planet in darkness. If this film were to stick with the second story then we may have had a classic on our hands but it decides to throw all three together and branches off in some many different directions that it is hard to pinpoint one set story pattern. The first half of the film is superb because it bases itself upon the unknown, we don't know what caused the ship to crash, we don't know why the planet is deserted, we don't know who or what Riddick is and we don't know anything about the alien that inhabit the planet. But that is a problem by the end of the film we still don't know anything about the aliens and I was even questioning why they were even there in the first place, they served no purpose at all and instead of adding to the story they only raised the body count. So after the first half of the film the impact of the film goes way down and it turns into nothing more but a bunch of sci-fi cliches and bloodshed while everyone walks around in a tense position fearing who will be the first to go if Riddick decides to snap. This film was what really put Vin Diesel into the picture and made him a household name and even though he now stars in huge action blockbusters it is nice to see him play the more atmospheric, character driven roles like that of Riddick. It was a smart move casting Diesel as Riddick because the film, as far as I can tell is basically all about him and Diesel easily outshines the whole cast and is the only one to produce any suspense and humour for most of the film. To science fiction fans what I am saying has more than likely already flown right over your head and you are probably drowning in a pool of your own drool by now, to everyone else this is just a retread of what you have already seen hundreds of times before just a lot less scary, but I do recommend this film because of the eye-popping special effect, a great performance from Vin Diesel and a highly entertaining first half."

I must admit that suns orbiting the planet bothered me a bit, but I decided to forgive some unrealistic matters because of sci-fi.<br/><br/>I really liked Radha Mitchell's captain Fry who was the major force of keeping the group together and organising things -and that's why the ending surprised me.

"peejmeister86","Null","0","0","20 October 2002"," A wonderful idea, criminally wasted.
","This movie confused me, all the more so after reading other people's comments about it. It was billed by the press as ""scary as hell"" and by fans of the genre as an excellent sfi thriller with a great portrayal of the anti-hero Riddick, by Diesel - I found it to be neither - but it could have been. This movie was such a disappointment because it's positive aspects could have been used to much greater effect. What is it about the Alien movies (Resurrection omitted) that makes them so pant wettingly frightening, when almost every clone that has followed has not been?<br/><br/>*SPOILERS ALERT, DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT YET SEEN* The film starts promisingly enough. A ship with a crew of cryogenicly frozen passengers crashes on a desert world, most of the ship's compliment is killed upon impact and the remaining survivors realise that they must first find water and then a new ship to transport them off this seemingly deserted world. They soon realize that a previous colony of settlers mysteriously disappeared during a solar eclipse 22 years ago and that they are due another - they also realize, to their horror that they are not the only lifeforms on the planet. With the light fading they turn to Riddick, (an extremely dangerous convict who was being transported on their ship) who has the ability to see in the dark, to lead them to the safety of an escape ship.<br/><br/>I was quite prepared to suspend the inevitable 'Aliens' comparisons and my disbelieve as to just how heroine Fry survived having a windshield explode in her face upon entry into a planet's atmosphere. Apart from that, the crash effects and near-future technology of the spaceship were impressive. Little details such as the survivors having to take in oxygen due to the planet's low levels and the washed out effects created by the shifting light colours of the planet's three suns added to my enjoyment. The vision of the aliens and Riddick was well done and intelligently used, but the preciousness of light could have emphasized more. In Alien, the psychological breakdown of the crew is superbly portrayed and their fears were shared by the audience, it is criminally underused here. The idea itself is novel, the story was originally to be the plot for the 'Alien' sequel, but it was turned down in favour of James Cammeran's - Hence Newt's line, ""they mostly come out at night, mostly.""??? Unlike 'Aliens' however, it was when the creatures started appearing that the film descended into mediocrity. Possibly never have i seen such dreadful CGI animation as was in this film, the very way they move is abismal and utterly fake. I amazes me how over 20 years earlier, Ridley Scott achieved a truly terrifying creature with a man in a rubber suit! The creatures were fully revealed too early and any sense of ""oh my god, what the hell are they?!"" is wiped out an hour before the films ending. The setting of darkness should have been used as a way of keeping them hidden -'Predator' style.<br/><br/>The character of Riddick was interesting and adequately portrayed by Diesel, but those of you billing him as the next Hannibal Lecter are mistaken. A much more satisfying ending would have been to have Riddick convince them he was changed, only to have him leave them in the cave, as their last flare goes out and the film fades to black. Instead we are treated to a confused and disjointed finale that is as pointless as it is empty. And do you know what - it's actually a real shame."

","*Spoiler Alert*<br/><br/>The main review on the front of the DVD says ""...scary As Hell!"" Nothing could be farther from the truth. This movie has some excellent special effect, and the cinematography is supberb, but if you have seen Event Horizon, Sleepy Hollow, What Lies Beneath, etc. than this will be all about a great movie and no suspense. There are several rather disturbing scenes of a human being eaten alive by vicious bat-like creatures, and very computer-generated beings following them in the shadows, but it will scare only the weakest hearts. There is no more gore than the Mummy series.<br/><br/>The story is magnificant, though not totally original. Several people taking a trip on a spaceship to some distant planet crash-land into a mysterious world where it only gets dark every once in a great while. It just happens to chance that they arrive just in time for the solar eclipse that provides the only darkness to the planet. Only then do they realize they are going to be eaten alive by an unknown yet terrifying (to them) breed of creatures that only comes out in the dark. This is where the movie gets good. Vin Deisel plays a very believable Richard B. Riddick, a convict being transported to another prison. Very similar to John Carpenter's Ghosts of Mars. But the Similarities end there. Deisel, his eyes having been modified by an underground ""doctor"" in his previous prison, is the only one who is able to see the monsters. Everyone is forced to rely upon him to lead them to safety.<br/><br/>The movie's script is a little wanting, but overall did a fair job of conveying the point. The humor is decent, with a few funny quips coming from a British passenger. This movie shows that sci-fi films can still be made without being overly geeky (Battlefield Earth, Wing Commander) and poorly acted. It shows that sci-fi films aren't all show and no story. It shows that films can give the effect of claustrophobia and intensity without being overly gory and grotesque. If you like a good, intense fantasy film that isn't super-geeky and super-techie, check out Pitch Black."

The beginning was a bit dry, but interesting enough to keep your attention. I liked this movie for two reasons: 1. It was deeper than your average horror/sci-fi/thriller, because it got profoundly involved with each character, giving you your own opinions of who should live or die, without knowing who would/wouldn't. You actually started to feel for these fictitious people, and the situation they were in. Or maybe... 2.

","Who's soul is so dead that they can't respond to a really fine monster sci-fi movie?<br/><br/>The critics were luke warm and the box office wasn't that good either. Bah! What do they know.<br/><br/>The opening sequence is simply great cinema. Like the recent Mission to Mars and Red Planet the space ship runs into a meteor shower in the first frame and must land on the nearby planet(this plot device I hereby declare off limits for the next ten years). Of the three films, Pitch Black handles this event by far the best. This is real exciting movie making reminiscent of the plane crash in Alive! or even the first twenty minutes of Saving Private Ryan. It's that good.<br/><br/>The alien planet and the monsters have real punch. It's true that ecologically speaking both make no sense whatsoever, but you must overlook that little detail just like you overlooked all the extra water in Waterworld. Pitch Black is miles better than Waterworld.<br/><br/>One of the joys of this film is that it stars mostly unknowns. It introduces the new star Vin Diesel. He is dynamite. He just oozes menace. In Waterworld the over exposed and ever so sensitive and sympathetic Kevin Costner tried to make us believe he could be cold and heartless. It didn't work. There is some internal resource that Costner lacks that mere acting can't simulate. In the old days Robert Mitchum could do menace. Robert De Niro has made a big career out of his small allocation of natural menace. Diesel is the real thing.<br/><br/>This is essentially a 1950's style ""B"" movie made with state of the art special effects and excellent production values. Just great. A hoot."

I've heard several people, Roger Ebert among them, point out how unlikely it is that nocturnal creatures would evolve on a planet with perpetual sunlight. THEY LIVED UNDERGROUND, PEOPLE. They were subterranean creatures. We have creatures like that here on earth. They're called nightcrawlers, moles, and angler fish. Ooooooh, how unlikely.

","Pitch Black is directed by David Twohy, who has worked as a screenwriter on several films, like G.I. Jane and the new Below. He directed this and I must say I'm pleased to see the film is this effective. The story begins weirdly as we don't know what's going on. It is better to know as little as possible about this film before watching it, so I won't tell you too much. The spaceship crashes into a strange planet in which there seems to be sunny all the time and no nights at all. Soon the darkness begins to threaten and the real hellish nature of the planet starts to reveal and the nightmare begins.<br/><br/>There are many great scenes in Pitch Black and especially the use of camera is marvelous. The fast edits are stylish and they are not used too much and they don't irritate. The use of light, shadow and darkness is so effective that the viewer will be on the edge of the seat. It is great to see that Hollywood still manages to release something this interesting and ""marginal."" As we learn what the real threat in the planet is, the tension just raises as the enemy is too strong (and hungry) for the crew members..Also, the sound effects are very creepy and sometimes reminded me of the power of Japanese film Ringu by Hideo Nakata. Technically this film should please demanding fans of horror cinema, too, and don't be turned off about the big studio status of the film.<br/><br/>The atmosphere in the planet is VERY scary and the feeling of Hell is touchable. There is a real terror and horror present, and in fact, I hadn't seen anything this effective for some time, at least from Hollywood. There are few stupid cliches that should have been left away, but it seems to be always the case with these kind of films. The film is not too clever or intelligent, and it works mainly in the level of cinematic power and pure terror experience. The effects are great and gore is stylish and not too over the top or laughable. At least the ""head bite"" scene is inventive and memorable. Couple of scenes are very disturbing and scary and they only add to the power of the whole movie.<br/><br/>8/10 rating is deserved and this should be seen in big screen (or at least in Widescreen) as that way Pitch Black would be even more effective experience.

I guess the movie is all about the changes his character goes though, but I didn't really get what suddenly made him change his mind and decide to go back and rescue the little girl and the religious guy.  So Carolyn admitted that she was willing to die for them...Ok...so why does Riddick think that's a good enough reason to help her?<br/><br/>Also, I HATED that Carolyn (Radha Mitchell) got killed at the end of the film.  I never really understand why a writer works so hard to make sure a character lives till the end of film, just to get killed off.  Of course sometimes this is very appropriate, but I didn't find this to be one of those times.  Why was it so important to kill off that character?  So that Riddick could see that she was willing to die for him...and DID!?  I guess that makes sense, but that still kind of sucks.<br/><br/>As for the creatures themselves...EXCELLENT!  I loved the design of the animals, I loved the idea that they can only come out when there is no light, I loved that light actually hurt them, I loved the way their vision looked, I loved everything about them!  Some of the CG work was a little cartoony, but I'm not going to let that ruin anything for me.<br/><br/>All in all, I thought it was good movie, but nothing absolutely spectacular. Although, I did think the story was VERY cool, and pretty well told.  If you're a die-hard sci-fi fan like myself, then you're probably going to want to see this, but if you're not so much into sci-fi, then don't go out of your way to see it, but it may still be worth your time.

And the middle section when Fry, Riddick, and the rest begin to realize what's in store for them is by far the best. Much more credit goes to Vin Diesel for his portrayal of Riddick - his voice is like another character in this film, and the narration is so amazingly recorded that it feels like its inside you.

","Pitch Black By Dean Kish<br/><br/>	When the lights go out, fear smiles a little brighter. Oh so they say. 	Pitch Black is director David N. Twohy's third outing as director and second science fiction film. The story chronicles the crash landing of a passenger spaceship. The spaceship crashes onto a planet that has three suns and is inhabited by underground creatures who live in the utter darkness. The menage of survivors quickly find out that the planet will have a once in 22 years eclipse on the second day of their arrival. Upon the dawn of  the eclipse the planet's inhabitants become rabid and blood-thirsty. Now all they can do is survive the dark. 	To start off with Pitch Black isn't a perfect film or even an `Aliens' or `Terminator' but it does have a lot to offer in the sci fi movie genre. What it does serve up is an interesting look at how a movie's texture and feel can steal the show creating an interesting ride. The cast is hardly worth mentioning and the script is confusing at times but the two stand-outs in the cast and some nasty creatures makes Pitch Black entertaining. The stard-outs would be the `Terminator' presence of Vin Diesel and a `Ripley-esque' Radha Mitchell. Mitchell is particularly good shadowing the brutality displayed by Diesel. Her flawed character wrestles with the guilt of crashing which develops her character for the audience and helps us relate to their unbelievable situation. Diesel, on the other hand, is a star in the making and delivers a convincing villain with a conscience. 	 Pitch Black is one of those monster flicks that belong in the category with classics  `Leviathan (1989)', `Deep Star Six (1989)', `Pumpkinhead (1988)' and `Mimic (1997)'. These are probably little known to the masses but are horror/creature gems on video. What Pitch Black has in common with these films is excellent special effect creatures and little known stars. And they prove sometimes that's not so bad. (3 of 5) So Says the Soothsayer."

","This is the type of movie that makes me sick because nearly the whole movie was completely unsalvageable. The script was out of sequence, plot was confusing and it was a reminder of another awful movie called ""Soldier.""<br/><br/>
The only thing to come out of this film was the performance of Riddick turned in by Vin Diesel who was in ""Saving Private Ryan."" I guess good performances in good movies follow certain actors around. Luck was on the side of Diesel in ""Pitch Black"". A dismal film that does not see me clapping for greatness."

","I went to Pitch Black.  I liked it so much that I saw it again.  I plan to see it a third time.<br/><br/>Okay, I will admit straight up the movie is heavily derivative of the Aliens movies.  There are some obvious plot device moments, and yes, there is that moment when our hardy band of adventurers is in a bad situation, and one of them does something incredibly stupid, turning the situation from bad to desperate.<br/><br/>So why did I like this movie? Charaterisation.  None of our 3 main protagonists is a fully likeable person -- a real risk to take.  It's good to see characters with flaws.  I loved watching Riddick, Fry, and Johns plot and try to outflank each other. I found each of these characters so fully realised that I wanted to know more about their lives previous to this adventure.<br/><br/>It's no The Road Warrior (one of my all time fave movies) but it's certainly worth watching."

He makes his character so real and intriguing, you barely even notice anyone else (only as to how well they compliment him). Vin Deisel was a great anti-hero. He even pulled off the ever elusive one-liners, without sounding too practised. The aliens were breathtakingly horrific. The computer graphics were seamless.

The special effects were astounding, but they weren't good enough to mask the emotionless and static acting performances. This movie could have been great if only it was directed by someone with a little more experience in the genre.

","For a genre so littered with cliche garbage like Event Horizon and Starship Troopers, Pitch Black stands as one of the top in its class.<br/><br/>See the film, if for nothing other than the lead character, Riddick, a real gem of science fiction anti-heroes. His voice over sets the tone early on in the film, and distinguishes him as the major player.<br/><br/>""They say your mind shuts down during cryo-sleep.... All but the primitive side, the animal side.... I guess that's why I'm still awake.""<br/><br/>Pitch Black is more about the development of a few of its characters as they learn more about themselves and others, than it is about surviving an alien assault.<br/><br/>Sure, the story is pretty stock, but it's driven by believable people, people I could identify with, people faced with fear, distrust, prejudice, and an army of creatures that forces them to open their eyes to each other, lest they be devoured from without and within.<br/><br/>Impressive special effects, little things like sepia toned lighting on the desert planet that shifts hues as the world's three suns rise and fall. Similar insect-like alien feel to the creatures of Aliens and Starship Troopers, but again, this film isn't really about the creatures. It's about characters, and that's why it works so well. It succeeds where so many movies of its kind fail."

","Pitch Black reminded me of Aliens for some reason.  The creatures have the same look.  It had nothing that was spectacularly new.  Pitch Black has the same tired, predictable science fiction plot.  I had some friends that liked it but I guess I've seen better.  The movie, however, was well directed but gaps in the plot made me lose interest.  It's okay for a movie to be unrealistic because that's what makes a movie good in most cases.  On the other hand, if a movie states criteria early on about certain unrealistic things, then later on breaks that criteria, then the movie loses credibility.  It's not a total loss though.  If you've been really looking forward to seeing Pitch Black and you like Sci-Fi then I say, ""GO."" Otherwise, think twice about spending the hard earned cash."

"Tiger-71","7","0","0","19 February 2000"," Eh, it could have been much better..
","I've seen sci-fi thrillers and I personally thought this one was at the bottom of my list. Yes the acting was great, the animation was great, but certain parts of the movie could have been different.<br/><br/>A quick summary: the crew of a huge ship suddenly awakes to find that their ship is going hay-wire. After trying their best to land the ship, the ship crash lands on a seemingly deserted planet. However, as the plot unfolds, they find that they're only real danger is the darkness which is like day time for the evil aliens that live on the planet.<br/><br/>My, it sounds like wonderful right? Not entierly true. As the plot unfolds more and more, you only learn about the escaped convict which they rely on to escape. Everyone else, it takes you almost half the movie to learn their name. Some of the characters I didn't even know until the credits rolled by. It gave you no background on the characters except for the ""cop"" and the ""bad guy."" Everyone else is hard to get attached to except for the main character, Fry.<br/><br/>Of course, the whole crew of the ship relies on the macho ""bad guy"" to get off the planet. He figures out everything, everyone else follows him almost without questioning him. The characters don't think for themselves except for the very beginning where they are forced to make a choice without him.<br/><br/>Well, ""Scariest Sci-Fi Movie of the Year?"" Not really. Although one part made me jump, others made me nervous, and the simply amazing music (no sarcasm there folks ; )) tries to tie it all together it simply doesn't seem to work. I think because of how short the movie seemed, they never had time to build you up as you went through the movie. Perhaps they could have made it so that it goes between night and day and the characters slowly get picked off rather than having a few hours of an eclipse every 22 years. They could have made this movie a lot better.<br/><br/>The ending, I hated, because of what the writer of the movie did to a certain main character. If you saw the movie you know what I'm talking about. I hated that part. When movies do that to me, they drop down a few points on my, ""List of best movies"" list.<br/><br/>Overall, it was a fine movie. It was not in the least scary. I am a four-teen year old and guess what. I could have fallen asleep if my care for what would happen to the characters did not keep me awake. Do not expect this movie to be a nail-biter. Do not expect that what you think the movie is about, that is what it is about. It isn't. Would I recommend it? Yes...but from there you have to tell me your opinion. 7 of 10 stars."

","After reading a few of the comments made by people who'd seen advance screenings of this film, I had a glimmer of hope that Pitch Black might be decent enough to recommend.  Well, that hope waned considerably thirty minutes into the film and disappeared altogether before it was even half over.  I have no idea why this film was released in its current state.  It has an annoyingly unfinished quality about it, and comes off looking more like an extended trailer than a finished product.<br/><br/>The premise of Pitch Black is as basic and linear as you can get, which is actually a good thing because a more complex storyline is too restrictive for this kind of film.  What we have are a group of crash survivors stranded on a barren planet who must now find another way home.  Their dilemma is compounded by an untimely total eclipse, which releases legions of hideous nocturnal aliens from beneath the surface of the planet.  Now, this situation could (or rather should) make for some real suspense, but Pitch Black fails to mine it to its full potential and consequently the scare factor goes way down.<br/><br/>The acting in this film is mediocre at best.  Since most of the characters are expendable (ie: bait) they are pretty much spared any characterization. Personally I don't care for this.  It would be much more effective, I feel, to have a well-developed character or two die than half a dozen static ones. Sure it takes a lot more work to write this kind of script, but the result would be far more rewarding.  As for Vin Diesel being such a good actor in Pitch Black, anyone could play Riddick's character and stand out simply because his is the only one that's fleshed out to any degree.<br/><br/>As for the special effects in Pitch Black, they are strangely minimalistic for this type of film.  The creatures are pseudo-Giger and ultimately very unscary for we don't really get to see them until the very end, and even then it's more of a prolonged glimpse than anything.  The only effect that really impressed me in this film was the actual eclipse, with the hordes of aliens erupting from their subterranean lair against the backdrop of fading light.  Very cool.  But overall, the effects were nothing to scream about.<br/><br/>
So I left Pitch Black disappointed.  And so did the people sitting around me.  I overheard one of them mutter, ""I knew I should have gone to see the Boiler Room instead."""

Its more jarring, just as intense, and just as unique as Alien. Every character had their little background story, which is something that is rarely ever dealt with when it comes to flashy, sci-fi epics. Vin Deisal's performance finally sold me on his talent, and could be the next Arnold Schwarzeneger (and he even has a better voice!). The scene where he is eye to eye with the flying beast is simply heart-stopping! Who would have the guts to do something like that! David Twohy made quite a gem. Now the real question: Will anyone ever remember it? I hope so."
"xanada73","Null","0","0","15 April 2002"," On the Origins of this Film.
","I am surprised that fewer people have compared the story of ""Pitch Black"" to that of Isaac Asimov's ""Nightfall.""  Surprised and gratified, as there exists only one common plot device: the sudden disappearance of a planet's several suns, the casting of that planet into darkness, the resultant chaos. ""Nightfall"" is about the fall of an entire civilization, while ""Pitch Black"" concerns the trials and hazards of a few stranded space travelers, so the latter is hardly a 'rip-off' of the former.  It is a good film which does indeed succeed in distinguishing itself from the plethora of ""Alien"" rip-offs, in presenting likable characters that the audience actually cares about, and in presenting its story in an innovative and visually interesting way.  And at an admirably modest budget.  It is not a masterpiece, but it is good, it is well crafted, it can be enjoyed by intelligent men and women, and it is worthy to exist.<br/><br/>I just thought it necessary to point out that its exploration of a sunny world's sudden descent into darkness was not its own, that it came from a previous source of which Mr. Twohy and the Wheats (that sounds like the name of a silly band) could not possibly have been ignorant.  I also believed that the way ""Nightfall"" capitalized on this idea was better thought out and less contrived: a planet of people unaccustomed to darkness periodically go berserk during the solar eclipses which overcome their planet every two millennia, setting everything ablaze for illumination, and, thus, destroying civilization again and again.  With ""Pitch Black,"" we have the presence of ravenous nocturnal life forms (unlikely to evolve on a perpetually sunny planet) capable of slaughtering anything in their path when the suns set (which coincidentally occurs a few days after the space travelers arrive, another extremely unlikely circumstance) on an otherwise barren world.  And, as a segue, those hoodoo-like structures that crumble when the bats usher forth from them; how long would those take to form?  Just to fall over in a single night?  ""Pitch Black"" should not be reviled for its plot, as it was in no way a work of plagiarism.  What is needed is a proper film version of ""Nightfall."""

","A rocket ship crash lands on a desolate planet.  Here the ships occupants must learn to survive the elements, each other, and some really nasty bat-like creatures that come out when it's dark.  <br/><br/>Basically it's your routine action/thriller with some sci-fi trappings thrown in as frosting.  The structure seems to work on a timing pattern that spits out a new catastrophe every two minutes.  The first one comes almost immediately, even before we know who the heck these people are.  You almost wish that with each new calamity everybody's favorite robot would come out and warn ""Danger Will Robinson Danger"".  Not so much to give a break in the action, but to at least warn you to it's Speedy Gonzales pacing.  Of course if you do blink and miss one of these 'danger moments' you don't need to worry since another one will follow  precisely one minute and twenty seconds later.<br/><br/>The cast is made up of purely stock characters.  Their sole purpose seems to be as darts, which are mechanically and constantly thrown into one terrifying scenario after another.  When the tension needs tuning they simply respond with looks and sounds of horror.  When the tension needs loosening they simply belt out a wise guy like one liner. Of course it does investigate a certain degree of 'darkness' to their personalities, but this attempt at multi-level is simple in nature.  There is nothing profound or philosophical here, which should be a turn off to most hardened sci-fi fans.<br/><br/>If you have seen ALIEN of PREDATOR then you have essentially seen this.  Of course if those films are your drug than this movie can be your fix. Despite it's very obvious mechanics it does strap you into it's roller coaster ride and give you some excitement.  It's only after the ride is over and the seat belts unfastened do you realize how typical this Hollywood trip really is.<br/><br/>Fans of this picture will pretty much tell you that the best thing about it is Vin Diesel.  He performs a very refreshing, very engaging sort of anti-hero, the likes of which haven't been seen for a long while.  This pretty much is HIS vehicle and he drives it quite nicely.  Good for Diesel fans and for those who might not yet be familiar with his work."
"ParanoidAndroidMarvin","10","0","0","7 April 2002"," Beautifully filmed movie
","While most movies that pit humans against horrendous extra-terrestrials end up being cheap, pointless knock offs of the 'Alien' series, Pitch Black stands firmly as an excellent piece.  The lighting is amazing and beautiful, offering sharp contrasts that operate not only as an effective element of the plot, but also give the movie a unique feel.  While many films limit their lighting to black/white contrasts, Pitch Black employs several different colors, shades and intensities.  Vin Diesel does a great job and brings to life a character that could have very easily been run-of-the-mill. The remainder of the cast, including the gorgeous Claudia Black (Farscape), are lesser-known and very talented.  If you like Science Fiction Pitch Black is a must, but the fact that the film focuses (very effectively) on things other than 'bug-hunting' make it an excellent movie for all."

","I used to hate sitting in English class and try and find those ever elusive symbols in a work.  But the first time I say Pitch Black, it seemed familiar and the second time it clicked.  This was a story of personal redemption and spirituality.  Riddick admits early that he believes in God, but believes that God hates him.  He ridicules (Riddick??)the faith of the moslem crew members and taunts their suffering as evidence of God's absence.  His survival is paramount, but his increasing interest in Pilot Fry is balanced against her responsibility for the entire group of survivors.  He is willing to save her, but she is only willing to be saved, if all of the survivors can be saved. Riddick is drawn back into human society by Pilot Fry and ultimatly when she is drawn away at the moment of death he exhalts ""NO!, not for me!""  Her death, for the sake of the others, including him, causes him to realize that others are willing to die for him.  He becomes a human, and is 'saved' by her death.  Is Pitch Black a Passion Play?"

","Pitch Black starts out on a positive note with awesome special effects. It takes several simple undeveloped characters onto a dead planet inhabited only by quick creatures of the night.  Though the plot has much to be desired and isn't much different than the typical horror/suspense/sci fi movie (i.e. Deep Blue Sea), it still comes across as a watchable entertaining movie.

"jim.adamson","9","0","0","27 March 2002"," A Text-Book Example of a Top Quality Sci-Fi Action Thriller.
","This movie absolutely kicked ass. I had no fingernails left by the time the credits rolled, and felt like I'd just been on a rollercoaster ride. What's more I didn't have to disengage my brain to enjoy it. Compared to what was realised on the screen this was done on a shoestring budget and was full of invention and superbly written and directed. It puts to shame many films that were done on five times the budget, and should act as a lesson in film-making for this genre.<br/><br/>Lesson #1. The scenario and scary creatures may be slightly reminiscent of other movies, but you can put an interesting spin on the idea which justifies your film being made. In this picture there were various elements which had been seen before, but the mixture of stranded crew, desert planet and hidden danger is presented with a new spin which is a perfect recipe for suspense and thrills. The opening sequence sets up the scenario nicely and as the seriousness of the situation unfolds, a queasy sensation of mounting horror takes over. From then on I was squirming in my seat thinking ""Wow, these guys are screwed"" and wondering how anyone would survive.<br/><br/>Lesson #2. Limited resources and lack of big star names can be turned to your advantage. The makers of this film have concentrated on writing a good script and using what resources they do have to make it look interesting. There isn't much in the way of flashy CGI effects but it looks superb, and the director has used some excellent photographic effects to depict the planet and the Riddick character's unusual vision. The writing is excellent and I notice some of the best dialogue has been given a deserved web page of its own on the IMDB site. This combination of good writing and inventive direction makes the whole picture work better, in my humble opinion, than many a film whose special effects cost ten times as much. This is the essence of good sci-fi, because the genre often doesn't get the resources required to realise an ambitious vision and even when it does, it's usually wasted on brainless popcorn-fodder like the Fifth Element.<br/><br/>Lesson #3. Characters. The makers of this movie have fortunately realised that it never hurts to come up with interesting characters and creating an ensemble with some interesting chemistry. The leading players all have a slight edge to them that makes them more vulnerable and more interesting than a clean-cut action hero. The pilot haunted by her decision to try and save herself at the expense of others before the crash, now trying to save everyone, the murderous convict who no one can trust, the shady law enforcement officer - all makes for a bit of added spice and makes everyone seem more human and sympathetic. The supporting cast have all got slightly different viewpoints and motivations and this means people can act in different and conflicting ways. It's not Shakespeare but it works well and gives the story the ability to take different turns due to the characters' actions. Vin Diesel is the best thing in this movie with a terrific performance as the convict, but all the actors performed quite well in their various roles thanks to the characterization and good judgement by film-makers who clearly understand what works in a sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>Lesson #4. Set up the situation, pile on the problems, and then let the characters try various ways to dig their way out of the hole. The story advances, as do the characters (the surviving ones anyway), as they keep moving on. Pile on a few more problems, suspense and shocks, and plant the characters tantalisingly close to the chance to succeed and stick one last frightening danger in their way. This movie was so gripping and clever I was rapt throughout. The ending was a bit abrupt and inconclusive but perhaps in keeping with the hard-edged, almost bleak mood the film had conjured up until then,<br/><br/>Overall, an absolute cracker and worth watching. I expect I will buy this on DVD to keep as one of my favourites of the genre.<br/><br/>One criticism: While not giving this movie a massive budget to play around with, which might have been a millstone around everyone's neck, was not necessarily a bad move, the studio should have given this movie much more support than it got. Surely when they saw what was in the can, the suits should have given this better distribution and promotion, and taken the opportunity to clean up at the box office with what was the best movie of its kind in years? I saw one trailer for this movie, which didn't do the production justice and made me think it would just be another rip-off of Aliens et al. I waited for the video as I simply don't have the opportunity to see that many films at the cinema and limit myself to the unmissable releases, and then kicked myself black and blue for not queuing round the block in the rain to see this. In the end this movie nearly doubled its money at the US Box Office but this deserved to be a $100m grosser. When you've got something this good, make the most of it."

And there's more besides great SFX and scary moments, there are great three dimensional performances from every cast member, amazing cinematography, and a cracking score which sets the mood of the film! Oh yeah, and of course there's Vin Diesel...<br/><br/>He's tipped to be the new Bruce Willis? Yep, I can see where that comes from. He prefers a black vest though instead of Brucie's trademark white! Anyway, judging by this film alone, Vin Diesel should be going on to bigger and better things, mind you, it's hard to see how he can better this film - he's electrifying in it!! (Fast and the Furious? o.k. I just made myself look stupid! He'll be BIG sometime soon.

If that's not your kinda thing, then why are you on this page?!<br/><br/>The usual plot - spaceship crash lands on alien planet, and survivors try to find a way off the planet. But, they encounter aliens which try to kill every single one of them! So, we're on familiar territory. This film gives the sci-fi horror a new lease of life though, and it's mainly due to the new alien species that are in the film.

","The title of Pitch Black is really right on the nose as far as the situation that the passengers of the ship find themselves in. This movie could just as easily have been called In The Dark as well because not only do these people find themselves dealing with the obvious demons in the dark, they deal with their own demons and fears on a personal basis as well. No one is entirely sure who is capable of what and (without giving anything away) who is capable of surprising even themselves in the end.<br/><br/>I completely enjoyed this movie because not only does it keep your attention with it's pace, it is not overly gory and leaves quite a bit to your imagination. I also left the theater thinking that maybe you can't judge people by what they have done (or are capable of doing) but rather if you put a little faith in them and yourself, you just might be surprised.

A sort of solar eclipse thing happens, and boom, all darkness, no sun whatsoever... everyone is wearing tank tops, but NO ONE IS FREEZING.  The movie gives absolutely NO explanation as to why this is so.  In the normal desert of Earth,  when the sun sets the temperatures can drop to sub zero, yet there it seems to remain all the same.  I can understand that they were excited so sweaty, generating a lot of heat etc but it makes NO sense why they felt no cold whatsoever.

","Despite taking its cue from movies like Alien and Predator to some extent, Pitch Black is nevertheless an effective suspense thriller, featuring a largely unknown cast ( apart from Keith David, who's appeared in THEY LIVE, MARKED FOR DEATH and ROAD HOUSE ). The hideous creatures were pretty well done, a nice touch being that they are sensitive to light and Vin Diesel brought an air of menace as the dangerously unpredictable SOB on whom the fate of the others depends. The story does have some inventiveness such as the fact that amongst the stranded survivors is a convicted killer and a cop protecting him who may not be all he seems."

","Pitch Black is the kind of film that elicits controversy. The same sort of people who Ridley Scott's classic Alien to that awful B grade flick Starship Troopers cry over a lack of gory action scenes, while all the time missing the point. Never mind.<br/><br/>There are major flaws in its story and setup, but these are not directly apparent when watching it for the first time and can be overlooked. Firstly there is the ridiculous coincidence of managing to crash-land less than a few kilometers away from the previous settlement. Then there's the fact that the eclipse (which occurs every 20 years or so) happens not much more than a few hours after they arrive. Then of course there is the planet itself - no thought was given to creating a realistic ecosystem or environment. Again, never mind, although these are issues that could have been addressed by the script writers, and it's a pity they weren't.<br/><br/>This is the film which introduced Vin Diesel to me (had seen Saving Private Ryan, but never really took much notice of Camparzo). Along with Radha Mitchell he was excellent, really made the character. Riddick is an interesting creation with some depth not often seen in a film like Pitch Black - his religious beliefs, expressed in a scene cut from some releases of the film, impressed me deeply. Unusual to see such a character prevail. ** SPOILER ** Fry also attracted some attention - seeing her die at the end created an emotional response which implies Mitchell had created a character you will care about.<br/><br/>To contradict those who complain about that issue, Fry's death is of course necessary to the story. It finalizes her character - she states at the beginning that she will not die for the others, then finally proves that she actually would (and does). It also sets an example to Riddick who is no doubt impressed by her.<br/><br/>Technically the film has its ups and downs. The crash is actually a little disappointing - the entry into the planet's atmosphere was unrealistic and improbable, as was the initial 'collision' with the comet's tail. The boiling clouds shown on the surface below are silly - a desert should have greeted them. Once on the surface, however, the following scenes are brilliant. The washed out filters used create a wonderfully gritty feel, and you really feel for the characters as they become tired and dehydrated. And the scene showing the simultaneous sunsets and eclipse is amongst the most beautiful graphics I've ever seen in a film. The second half of the film loses the other-worldly feel with the light, but by then the scene has been set and other things occupy your mind. And the final scene showing the spacecraft moving out of orbit over the planet's rings is certainly a picture to end on.<br/><br/>Grade A, awesome film, see it - but don't be too technical."

","This film may not expand the Science Fiction Cinematic Universe as we know it, but there's a couple of twists and turns and enough atmosphere to make it a worthwhile addition to the genre.  `Pitch Black,' directed by David N. Twohy, involves a commercial space flight carrying forty passengers that crash lands on an unknown desert planet.  With three suns above them, there is plenty of daylight in which the survivors can negotiate their quest for survival, and finding water is their main concern.  As they begin to explore the wastelands for sustenance, they find evidence that others have been there, apparently some years before them:  A small ship and a couple of buildings; all of which appears to have been abruptly left behind.  Lead by pilot Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell), the small band of survivors have a couple of additional obstacles in their way, as well.  One is Riddick (Vin Diesel), a murderer who was being transported to a penal colony.  But he may not be their greatest danger; because there is someone-- or something-- else close by.  Very close.  An entity that in all probability is responsible for the disappearance of those who came before.  And, if that isn't enough, Fry ascertains that the three suns above them will be setting soon; their world is about to be plunged into absolute darkness.  Soon, they will have to deal with Riddick and the entity stalking them in the pitch black of an eternal night.<br/><br/>	This concept is nothing new, and there's a sense of been there, done that, about it, but to Twohy's credit, what it lacks in originality he makes up for in presentation by building the suspense and maintaining the tension right up to the end.  The story was obviously influenced by a number of other films, predominately `Alien,' `Soldier' and even `Rocketship X-M' from 1950, but there is a unique characteristic about Riddick and a revelation at the end (that has to do with his true nature) that secures a separate entry in the annals of Sci-Fi lore for this film.  This one definitely has it's moments, enough to take it to a level that even such highly touted offerings as `Event Horizon' and `Alien 3' failed to achieve.  <br/><br/>	The performances, too, are a cut above the usual for this kind of fare, and while no one in the cast is likely to win an award for their work here, they do a good job, individually and collectively.  Radha Mitchell has an affecting screen presence and creates a very real person in Fry, equal to, if not surpassing Sigourney Weaver's Ripley in `Alien.'  Diesel is effective, as well, especially in the menace he brings to Riddick, which is subtly honest and believable; the understated way he plays it gives added impact to the character and takes him beyond stereotype (though not quite up to Rutger Hauer's Roy in `Blade Runner').  With Riddick, what you see is basically what you get; there's not a lot of depth or complexity to him, but that's who this guy is, and Diesel plays it well.<br/><br/>	Also turning in effective performances are Keith David as Imam, Lewis Fitz-Gerald as Paris Ogilvie, Rhiana Griffith as Jack and Claudia Black as Shazza.  As Johns, Cole Hauser is adequate, but he fails to give his character the definition his co-stars achieved with their respective roles.<br/><br/>	Rounding out the cast are John Moore (Zeke), Simon Burke (Greg), Les Chantery (Suleiman), Sam Sari (Hassan) and Firass Dirani (Ali).  From the beginning, you know what you're in for with this one-- it's a survival story, and few of the characters, if any, are going to make it to the end. But as entertainment, `Pitch Black' does the job; it's thrilling enough that by the time it's over you feel like you got your five bucks worth.  You may not remember it next month, but while you're watching, it's a pretty good rush.  It's the magic of the movies.  I rate this one 7/10."

The twist in this movie is the murderer, who can see in the dark and how the rest of the group has to depend on his help to get out of the planet they're stuck in.

","I must say that this is unusual for me but since first seeing it I have watched this film around 5 or 6 times. It is one the of the best I have seen in a long time. Not because of lighting or special effects (Although the opening sequence of the crash was excellent) but because of the interaction between the characters. especially Cole Hauser and Vin Diesel. Amazing acting. Radha seems a little strange at first but by the end of it she is excellent as the pilot Fry, the way she a Diesel act together is incredibly convincing despite the unconvincing storyline (How coincidental is it that they landed on that planet just as the next 22 year eclipse was ready for another go) Fantastic film, you wont be wasting your time if you see it."

In Pitch Black he excellently plays the likeable baddie Riddick with a frightening menace and charisma. THe film was only 22 million but this doesn't show woth the superb speccial effects that put some big budget films to shame.

","Oh yeah, this is the real mccoy!<br/><br/>Creeps up on you this film. One minute you're sitting there thinking, ""Yep, been here, done that"" and suddenly - you haven't! To say this is the best sci-fi ever shot in Australia (somewhere around Coober Pedy I recall) really conveys little. What Aussie sci-fi IS there? (let's forget about the eminently forgettable RED PLANET debacle, most of which was shot overseas anyway) so lets upgrade that comment to ""one of the best Sci-fi films ever made anywhere!"" David Twohy goes a long way towards redeeming himself after the soporific WATERWORLD.<br/><br/>One of those movies you simply have to view two or three times to appreciate its qualities, it just gets better as it goes along. The plot contributes nothing to the film's success. Interplanetary spacecraft ""Hunter-Gratzner"" crashes on to a barren planet at the ass end of the Universe. Bathed in perpetual light and murderous heat from a triple sun alliance (um? is that actually technically possible?  don't planets orbit suns??) the ten or so surviviors deduce that an eclipse is imminent, the first in 22 years - is that bad timing or what? Things are especially problematic when the planet's terrestrials surface from their underground lairs specifically during darkness to snack on whatever's on the menu.<br/><br/>The ship's captain, Carolyn Fry (Mitchell) is  already feeling a tad down, as she feels it is her fault the ship has incurred some seriously permanent body-damage. The other crew members are more worried about Riddick, one mean motherf----- of a convict. As it turns out, with his surgically enhanced eyes, he is the only one can see the aliens with his neat ""night-vision,"" a talent which comes in majorly useful as the survivors attempt to make their way back to the ship for protection.<br/><br/>It is Vin Diesel's movie as he plays his role to perfection. This is as much a story of individuals working out their own issues under extreme pressure as being taken apart by grisly predatorial nasties. Radha Mitchell is equally cool as Captain Fry (a very different Ripley!), an officer with all the right stuff when it matters and a soft feminine side when it doesn't.<br/><br/>Top twist at the end and hey, are those aliens grotesquely realistic or what? This is a thinking persons' film."

","When they crash land on an unknown planet, the passengers and crew have to plan a way off before the impending solar eclipse. When darkness falls the planet is beset by millions of marauding monsters who live underground in the daylight. Unfortunately, for the crew, this planet of perpetual sunlight is about to be plunged into darkness for the first time in 22 years - which is the worst bit of bad luck since Janet Leigh decided to pull in at the Bates Motel!<br/><br/>Full of cliches, and a cringeworthy script, 'Pitch Black' is at least one of a rare breed nowadays - a sci-fi movie that takes itself seriously, and one that delivers a real scare. The monsters are pretty terrifying, and it's an ingenious device to show them mainly through the eyes of Riddick, a prisoner who has had his eyes adapted to see in the dark (an amazing bit of good luck!). In fact, it's the look of the film that really puts it apart from others in it's class. There is an ethereal glare to the whole planet, either sepia toned, or tinted blue, which makes for a genuinely distorted view. it's also a relief to see an unknown cast, which always benefits this type of story because you don't identify with any one character.<br/><br/>Although it's budgetary limits are sometimes plain to see, and it's heart at one with the best of the B-movies, it's still worth a rental if you're sick of seeing the same 'Alien' rip-offs."

","I must say, when I first saw this arrive I was sceptical. A cast, mostly unknown, an interesting idea and a trailer full of wonderful scenes, which I thought might be the movie there and then, with creatures that reminded me of Alien. Another shoddy collection of other films into a new sci-fi I thought. Wrong.<br/><br/>This story doesn't have a hero, it has many flawed characters, all of whom behave unexpectedly and change before you as the story unfolds. The suspense of the story is pulled from the lack of trust between these characters and the whole premise of complete darkness throughout. The idea of having the one person who could save everyone as being the one person there's no way on any planet you could trust, is ideal. It also brings forth the idea that you're behind the bad guy all the way, just like the Terminator.<br/><br/>My surprise at the effects, the acting, the standard of filming and storyline was high.

The shades of blue, yellow, red and white, polish the film with an edge that is equally balanced with good performances from the mostly not-famous actors. <br/><br/>Although there is not much science in this fiction, there are bits of pieces of how the world work in this alternate future. The interaction between the characters and how they quickly work as a team is very well conceived, as it also fills in the lack of background or scientific rationalization of the crew's history, the planet's or the creatures'.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel as stated elsewhere, steals the highlight of the movie, with a charismatic presence and a cool portrayal of an anti-hero. There are surprises along the way, with little humour here and there.<br/><br/>
It could've been longer and more gory, but I guess the director/producer didn't want to overdo it. So when you count on the low bodycounts and how people die, it is not so much of a horror movie as it is more of a survival thriller.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the creatures are animated, so they don't look/feel that threatening, as opposed to Alien/Aliens animatronics, courtesy of Stan Winston.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a highly entertaining stylish movie.<br/><br/>Log out."

Don't expect this to become a classic or in fact be anything more than a rather unoriginal yet entertaining and rather well made sci-fi horror experience.<br/><br/>This film does have many weaknesses. You can tell right from the start who's cannon fodder and who's not, some of the effects are a bit cheesy (the creatures POV was irritating to say the least), and there's heavy borrowing from films like Alien, so no points for originality.<br/><br/>Pacing is quite off at times, but the film always manages to get back on track before this becomes annoying. Unfortunately this makes some of the scenes meant to be suspenseful fail embarrassingly.<br/><br/>I liked the performances. Yes, the characters are stereotypes, but this is how it works in these kinds of films (see Alien), and the actors deliver these stereotypes convincingly (if this isn't a contradiction in itself).<br/><br/>Vin Diesel plays the see-in-the-dark tough guy in a wonderfully over the top fashion. In fact, this is one of the most enjoyable tough guy impersonisations I have seen in quite a while.<br/><br/>Dialogue is what you would expect from a film like this - it mainly propels the story. There are a few memorable lines, mostly for ""coolness"", and always delivered by Riddick (Vin Diesel).<br/><br/>Expect to see a nice amount of eye candy, both in terms of CGI effects and photography.<br/><br/>All in all, if you're into Sci-Fi I would say that you should see this film.

Just once, I'd like to see a party of survival-hopefuls include a character with a superhuman talent that *isn't* completely appropriate to the set-up. Inclusion of a character with night-vision in this movie was just too 'deus ex machina' for my taste.<br/><br/>There were moments when the director tried to deviate from cliche, and it's too bad that those attempts were so obvious - the self-conscious aspirations only underlined the fact that the movie was working on a foundation of cliche.

","Pitch Black begins with the most spectacular and harrowing spaceship crash ever put on film. Unfortunately, while the film is superior to most other recent screen SF, the rest of the film doesn't quite live up to the promise of the opening. It is also unremittingly bleak and violent, and some plot premises rob the film of credibility. A long-range space transport is carrying about 50 passengers and crew in a distant region of space. One of the passengers is a captured escaped convict (Vin Diesel). The ship flies through a comet's tail (why couldn't the ship's nav computer automatically avoid this?) and micrometeorites punch holes in the hull and kill part of the crew before they can awaken from cryosleep. The docking pilot (Radha Mitchell) manages to bring the ship down on a nearby planet (where did it come from?) but the ship is wrecked, with only a handful of survivors among the passengers. The planet is actually a large moon of a Jovian-type ringed planet in a 3-sun system, so it never gets dark---they think. The ragged band of survivors discovers an encampment (lucky it was so close to their crash site) set up by mining geologists for test-core drilling, but it has been deserted apparently for 22 years. They find a small emergency rescue vehicle, functional but without power. The survivors return to the wreck for power cells when the planet passes behind its primary and ""pitch black"" night falls, which, it turns out, happens every 22 years (you guessed it, these folks arrived just in time). This is the signal for thousands of winged creatures to issue forth from underground roosts (why do they have wings if they don't come out but once every 22 years? And how does this barren wasteland support thousands of these creatures?) The surface rover is solar powered, so the rest of the film involves the steadily dwindling group toiling to get to the escape shuttle, on foot over open country, with a shaky supply of artificial light to ward off the photophobic creatures. Their hopes are pinned on Riddick (Vin Diesel), who was incarcerated on a prison planet where it was perpetual night and who had his eyes surgically altered to be able to see in the dark. The climax is not the final dash to the shuttle but what happens immediately afterward. The eyeless creatures (created by CGI that is not as good as we have recently become accustomed to in other SF offerings) are a cross between Ridley Scott's Aliens and pterodactyls, and the noises they make are quite unconvincing; they sound like the electronic music soundtrack for ""Forbidden Planet"" rather than the more realistic animal sounds of, say, Jurassic Park. The human characters are more complex than the average SF or action thriller. The two leads, the gorgeous Radha Mitchell and the imposing Vin Diesel, both play highly flawed characters; viewers who note that the film also features Farscape's foxy Claudia Black will be disappointed as she plays only a supporting role and her character's demise is rather gruesome."

If you are a fan of either action movies or scifi/horror flicks, you will be entertained. Personally, I believe this movie suffered from poor marketing.  Had the studio marketed the film as a Vin Diesel vehicle, and steered away from any blatant allusions to Alien, the movie would have provided a better box office take, and it would have received the attention it deserves.

","This movie was surprisingly good.  The cast, although not super star-filled, was very high in quality and did an excellent acting job, without which, the movie would've been ruined.  Another feature that made this movie a must-see is the superb directing from a man whose name I didn't recognize (sorry). His sharp movement of the camera, captivating and stunning transitional shots, and unique motion clips made this movie one with which the audience can really interact (and not to mention get frightened).  The screen play was great as well, with some twists and unsuspected turns that will keep you failingly anticipating what's to happen next.  This aspect was enhanced due to the lack of stars....without stars, anyone and everyone is fair game to get killed.  This beautiful blend of elements made for a very entertaining and scary movie.

He plays a convicted murderer who doesn't give a damn about anything or anyone. His character is a little off his rocker and that just adds to the appeal of the character. Special effects are great in this movie. The various species of meat eating aliens in the movie are well done.  They don't look like CGI creatures at all they look totally real. One good scene is when Vin's character fights a creature hand to hand. If you are going to be attacked by aliens it's always a good idea to have a psychopathic killer on your side! <br/><br/>       Now, for the bad part. There are a few clichÃ©s in the movie. One is the religious zealot who thinks his God will save them. Another is the crewmember who wants to sell everyone out to save his own hide. I won't say who it is but it's probably not whom you think.  <br/><br/>         If you like science fiction you will probably like this movie.

","I have to say that the film on a whole, is very good. I was expecting non stop special affects etc.. instead it seemed that a lot more work was instilled in exploring the characters. Vin Diesel as everyone else will no doubt have to agree, is fantastic as Riddick. I felt that the eclipse happening every 22 years, and them by chance crash landing on the planet on that day/ within days was a little hard to swallow. The flaw with the physics of the planet and it is a huge flaw, is the fact that these predators don't appear to have anything else to eat. There are huge, huge numbers of them, yet they is no visible forms of life for them to feast on. If these creatures can only come out every 22 years, then they haven't had any food for at least those 22 years because all that is left on the planet is bones, no doubt caused by them on their last outing. Still, I have to say that I really liked the film, admittedly on the strengh of the characters. If Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell had not been in it, then the film would have just been plain.

The special effects were pretty good, even though it is apparent that the CGI animators STILL haven't quite got the hang of colouring and lighting - some of the creatures look out of place due to the mismatch of colouring.<br/><br/>It also had a few technical flaws, such as the double-ringed gas-giant planet (which I'm sure is not possible), and also the fact that the double-eclipse to block the light from both light-sources would be unlikely to occur every 22 years - it would happen on a much larger time scale.<br/><br/>Aside from these technical flaws, though, it was a moderately scary film, although I have seen much worse.<br/><br/>In all, I'd give it 7/10."

The chardonnay-guy brings the points down but Lex, Riddick and the boy-girl (Jack?) brings the points way up!<br/><br/>The choice of location will recieve a perfect 10 out of 10. What better place to portray a desert-planet than the Australian outback! The bleached film to show the three-suns effect gives PB if possible even more credit.<br/><br/>The direction gets a 10 out of 10. David Twohy has kept things low key, to reach the desired effect.<br/><br/>The effects gets a 8 out of 10. No clear view of any of the creatures, they are smartly hidden in the dark. Great cgi-usage, but they are still low budget cgi.<br/><br/>The cool-factor is a total of 7 out of 10. The last line ""We can't leave without saying goodbye"" definately brings the score down from a 9.<br/><br/>The music I cannot remember, so I will give it an average of 5 out of 10.<br/><br/>TOTAL SCORE IS 7,9"

","Well, this certainly was a well thought-out concept.  It seems that Jim and Ken Wheat spent a lot of time working out the most convoluted way that this film could be presented.<br/><br/>A freak crash-land on a desert planet, devoid of life... only it's not devoid of life it has millions of horrific flesh-eating creatures living under its surface.  Hang on though, they are afraid of the light and the suns never set on this planet.  Phew!  Uh-oh, once every 22 years a conjunction of planets means that the planet is plunged into pitch black. Big problem.  What they need is someone who can see in the dark.  Luckily they have someone who can.  Unluckily he is a re-captured escaped convict who has committed many mass-murders.  Things are not really easy, are they. Take away any weapons or real means of power and they are all in trouble.<br/><br/>
The first half of this film is excellent, with a good command of suspense. I watched this film late at night in the dark and it was very effective. The second half (you know how it is with horror: the bit where they show the monsters) was not quite as effective, but had some reasonable action to keep the plot moving.  Competent acting from another ex-neighbours cast member, as well as the rest of the cast.<br/><br/>The other thing I liked was the use of colour in the photography for the different colours of the suns.  It looked really nice in the first half before the suns went down and it went all black.<br/><br/>In summary:  Worth watching.  Competent and good fun, but will not be a classic in years to come."

","I really expected Pitch Black to be nothing more than a 2nd rate Aliens clone. I'm glad to say however, that it actually turned out to be surprisingly brilliant. A classy sci fi chiller which perfectly illustrates how CGI should be employed - ie. with grace and subtlety. The movie, like the majority of films in this genre, relies heavily on visual effects, but Pitch Black succeeds because it never allows technology to hinder the story. Its overall impact is greater because of what we don't see and the tension between the main human characters is just as interesting as their plight with the alien creatures. Compare it to a higher profile, bigger budgeted movie such as The Mummy Returns, where there is a constant bombardment of special effects but very little in way of a script or decent characterisation, and you see just what a good film Pitch Black is. The fact that there is no really big 'star' means that there is no need for a typical action movie hero, which serves the plot very well too. The performances however are consistently strong with Vin Diesel being particularly memorable as the menacing Riddick. Overall, this is a highly effective sci-fi thriller with a strong script and excellent visuals. (The DVD comes with two top class commentaries as well)"

","I would have to say that this movie is outstanding! The first 45 minutes of this movie are totally gripping. Visually, I have never seen a movie like this before, and that's a very generous compliment.<br/><br/>This movie has outstanding special-effects. Even though this is a sci-fi spectacle.. there are some outstanding performances here. Australian actress Rhada Mitchell commands your attention as the strong but sometimes insecure Second Commander Fry. You may recognize this actress from the movie ""High Art"", where she also nearly dominated the movie. This movie proves Rhada Mitchell is every bit the leading lady, and I look forward to seeing more from her in the future.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel, under-utilized in ""Saving Private Ryan"", also proves he has real acting chops with his performance in ""Pitch Black"", and he has some of the best lines in the movie. I can't quite place the actor, he looks a lot like Matthew McConaughey, but I think his name is Cole Hauser, and he turns in some excellent supporting work in a thankless role where he is primarily the challenger to Second Commander Fry.<br/><br/>Sadly, several of the more interesting characters die as the movie progresses, certainly not the ones I would have picked, and the movie ends cynically and on an unpleasant note designed to keep everything open for a sequel, but overall a fantastic and gritty sci-fi actioner that does not let you down, that does not disappoint, that has the real feel, texture and taste of a possible near-future.<br/><br/>Whoever handled the cinematography here is worthy of an Academy Award, and would be my ideal selection to film adaptions of any books by Bruce Sterling or William Gibson that ever have the fortune to make it to the silver screen. Excluding ""The Matrix"", also filmed in Australia coincidentally, this is probably the best sci-fi movie made since Robert Zemekis helmed ""Contact."""

There only distinguishing feature above over sci fi monsters is that they have a unique radar that helps them catch prey...but not when it gets close to their face, where they would eat it to be exact. Secondly these creatures are harmed by light...so why then did they evolve on a planet that has three suns!? The acting is good, that I will admit but the film never really goes anywhere and there are no moments to distinguish it from anything else. Brainless and flawed. This was a huge disapointment."
"alunrichards","Null","0","0","30 May 2001"," Very good...
","I've been looking forward to seeing this film for quite a while and I'm glad to say I wasn't disappointed. With this in mind I'll begin by commenting on the low points so as to end on a high. Spoilers alert The general premise of this film was pretty unoriginal and the story contained a few cliches, not to mention some moments which require a fair bit of suspension of disbelief. Some people have complained that it was ridiculous for a psychotic killer to be transported on a passenger ship, but I can accept that the mercenary ""Johns"" might have wanted to keep his trip back to Earth low-key in case a competitor tried to relieve him of his quarry, and we have to remember he was an independent mercenary and probably not possessed of infinite resources.<br/><br/>It's a little hard to accept that the ship would crash at exactly the right time in the 22 year cycle to experience a total eclipse, and the astronomical model in the film seems to show three incredibly small stars somehow linked together, orbiting the planet. Perhaps the centre of the model wasn't actually the planet, I'd have to see the film again.<br/><br/>The aliens seem to change drastically throughout the film, from some creepy looking ""starfish"" to swarms of bats, then from three feet tall quadrupeds to six feet tall bipeds. Also, their sensitivity to light seems to increase. Early on they all come out in the twilight as the suns pass behind the neighbouring planet's ring. Later they are warded off with bottles of faintly luminous grubs, though for some reason they have no problem running directly into torchlight.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel is just too resilient. He has no trouble running through the pitch darkness in an alien warzone pulling 140kg of power cells behind him and even wrestles with an alien and kills it (one of the bigger ones, not the starfish/bats).<br/><br/>These are the only problems I can see in the film, some people have complained about the dialogue, this is something that always irritates me as I feel that it's more realistic if characters don't have an ingenious catch phrase for any eventuality. People say dumb things in real life.<br/><br/>Overall, I though this film was very good delivering suspense, some decent action and incredible (but restrained) effects for the relatively low budget. Most of the characters were a little cliched, but they seemed fairly credible to me (face it, spaceships need pilots, equal opportunities will dictate there is a fairly good chance of them being female and most people don't like to leave others to die on alien infested hell planets). I was impressed that the Englishman lasted so long, I was tipping him for an early end, probably jumping down a dark hole after a particularly expensive Chardonnay. Apparently the characters were ""irritating"", so I must have missed a crucial character-building moment when I went to answer the door.<br/><br/>Apart from the points above I can't fault this film. You don't get much good scfi around these days but this is a highly respectable addition to the genre.<br/><br/>8/10"

This is a formula sci-fi horror but its one of the best formula sci-fi horrors I've seen in a while.

I am normally not very complementary about most of the films I watch and had heard mixed revues of the film but I must say that I thought that it was an extremely enjoyable film to watch.  The plot is definitely a no brainer, with most of the tension being character driven.  All the actors in the film are excellent, especially  Vin Diesel playing the convict Riddick, who has to be the best anti-hero since Snake Pliskin in Escape from New York. <br/><br/>
The films plot reminds me of two films, Aliens and Deep Blue see, almost as good as the former and far better than the latter.  Visually the film has some amazing moments and David Twohy can be extremely proud of what he has put together.  Special praise has to go to the David Eggby and also lighting department, for the excellent cinematography and lighting.  The editing is good, but their are no really scary moments which would make someone jump out of their seats.  The computer stuff is done extremely well and is never aloud to overwhelm the film or over shadow the actors.  The fight sequences are well put together and extremely exciting, especially when Riddick goes one on one, with one of the creatures, maybe the highlight of the movie. Praise, also has to go to Graeme Revell for putting an amazing score to the film, which I now cannot get out of my head.<br/><br/>Overall, this is the movie that Alien 3 and 4 should have been, its exciting, thrilling and also stunning to watch.  Pitch Black also shows what can be done with a limited budget, take notice Hollywood.  Definitely a film to watch.  The DVD also has a couple of extremely good commentaries by the cast and crew, which are very useful to all the film students out there."

The special FX are nothing to drool about.  The actors are mostly people you've never heard of.

It's a decent, acceptable movie.  Decent scifi films are hard to come by these days. Pitch Black is one of the best scifi movies to have come out in the past two years.

","Pitch Black isn't really a classic, but it takes a basic science fiction<br/><br/>scenario that's been done to death since Alien in a lot of low-grade B- and Z-movies, and makes it a fairly high-budget decent production with good characterization of most of the players. van Diesel is the definite star and a definite anti-hero (not a villain, really, although people often confuse the two). The rest of the cast isn't really that well developed, and there are some gaps in characterizations (Johns in particular is never really drawn convincingly enough to explain his eventual betrayal).<br/><br/>The alien monsters are well-done, although one wonders why the evolved a sensitivity to light on a light-intense planet. There are some other plot holes, such as the fact that the original colony had lights that weren't solar-powered: how'd they all get killed? And sometimes the characters can move around quite easily.  Riddick gets from the cave to the colony pretty easily with no lights, and Fry does the same with one puny little light.

But on the way back with Imam and Jackie they have no end of problems.<br/><br/>Still, the movie moves along at a pretty good clip, and there's no character so weak that it really flaws apart.

","OK, so Pitch Black starts with the ""wake up in hypersleep"" scenario that's really been done before. OK, overdone. Then there are the odd lapses in reality during the crash scene and later throughout the movie. Look past all of that, and hey, it wasn't half bad. Don't expect the next Citizen Kane and you've got an hour and a half of escapism, creepy monster movie fun. The F/X (especially during the eclipse) are good, the monsters are fairly cool and sometimes scary, Riddick (the anti-hero) was well played, and there isn't the typical ending."

","The main reason I went to see it is that I've been a fan of Vin Diesel ever since I saw 'Iron Giant' (He hosts the making of on the DVD).  Pitch Black is a little darker than most movies I see, but it was very good.  The cast was excellent, especially considering I knew none of them except one.  In my mind, it was similar to Alien.  A struggle to survive against a species that views humans only as an organic food source.  I actually liked it better, since after the blood was shed, and the last survivors escape, one has been profoundly changed."

","But this movie does so seamlessly.  The acting is believable.  The characters evolve with the drama, and more importantly, the storyline is not predictable.  I was carried along, and found myself caring whether or not the characters lived or died.  So often, the people involved in making movies forget that what can make or break a flick lies in the details.  As much as I might try to suspend my disbelief for a film that I really want to like, I will find fault with careless details, and lose interest in the story.  This did not happen with ""Pitch Black.""  The focus was more on the characters and their relationships with one another, than about the technical details, so the little indiscrepancies in the story didn't detract from its deliverance.  Watch ""Mission to Mars"" and you will understand what I mean about too many gadgets and not enough character developement.  And while we're on the subject - they probably paid the entire cast of ""Pitch Black"" what was paid to one actor in the movie ""Mission to Mars,"" which I thought was an awful movie. The acting in ""Pitch Black"" was right on target. It wasn't overdone or half-baked.  It was good.  Especially Vin Diesel's performance. I am not a huge science fiction fan, but I will definitely add this movie to my collection, for the simple fact that it surprised me and had me rooting for the villain.

","Pitch Black as proved to be the best movie i've seen for a while by far, ranking up there with the top SciFi movies made in forever. The Aliens movies (Alien, Aliens, Alien 3, ect. ), The preditor movies even possibly ones that have made a large impact on the way movies are made, ( Star Wars). The Twists and the action dragged through out the whole thing pulls you to the edge of your seat every time you watch it, wether it be the first or the tenth. And Vin is just awesome to say the least the way he portrays the escaped murder ""Riddick"" and in away the characters evolution. As expressed in other comments about the small flaws conserning the suns  it proves that some people don't think with an open mind. the wonders of space are still developing so that the human mind can grasp it. Just because our solar system is postioned around a sun doesn't mean that the one in the movie had to. Our sun is the biggest piece of matter in the area making it have the biggest gravitational pull, rotating the other planets around it. Its possible that the suns in the movie weren't the biggest piece of matter in the area and the sun, as well as the planet they had crashed on rotated around a very large planet that held a bigger gravitational pull then any of the others. Well, thats just my view on this wonderful movie and if my, uh, ""Theories"" prove to be wrong and my spelling/grammer aren't the best you'll have to look past it as i'm simply in the 8th grade. heh..

","It was doomed to be B grade from the start.  Not overly big budgeted (by sci-fi today standards) no star power on the surface (Vin who?) and a few Aussie appearences spelt failure as I approached Pitch Black.<br/><br/>Im happy to say I left with a broad smile and that old sci-fi fire inside of me.  The solution to overused inter-planetary science fiction plots was actually quite simple, and Pitch Black worked it well!  Character!  The solid script work really rounded each character development off quite nicely, focusing more on the changes in the players rather than their reactions to the flying nasties.  (quite scary too) It was fresh to see an alien movie not about the aliens primarily.  The characters all bounce off each other with great effect, particulary Riddick, Fry and Johns.  There are no surprises plot wise, but when it comes to the metamorphasis of certain characters (not giving anything away) there are some neat pay offs and impressive changes.  A cheeky approach to the traditional good versus evil if you will. The direction is impactful in selected scenes.  The crash at the beginning and the intense ""escape in the rain"" with Riddick rivals something like Jurassic Park, especially the most memorable scene with Riddick coming ""face to face"" with an alien. The setting calls for some unique camera trickery.  The director played around with some cool color filters to give the desert planet a truly hypnotic feel under its three suns. What steals the show, however (apart from some chuckle performances from some of my fellow aussies) was Vin Diesel.  Yes, it'll be hard to forget his name now.  He has a very ""Arnie"" presence in this movie, kind of like the Terminator, big, bad and as tough as chewing on a car tyre.  His best lines, delivered in that gravely dirt road voice, rival big Arnie's antics in T2. ""Don't you cry for Johns....don't you dare..."" the line of the year!! The only bumps in this film are some of the lesser characters, such as a Holy man who decides to collapse into a frenzy of sorrow only after his third boy is killed (he must'nt have been attached to the more youthfull, other two) and the aussie's resembled bait for the flying killers.  (except for Fry, but she had an American Accent, which must have acted like a repellent to the aliens). Overall a big surprise.  It well deserves its praise as one of the most engaging sci-fi's of recent times.  Four out of five stars.<br/><br/>""Don't you cry for Johns....don't you dare....""  I luv it!"

Unfortunately, despite an intriguing story line, I have to say it came up short in my estimation.<br/><br/>I guess I expected more suspense, more white-knuckled moments, but they were few and far between.  <br/><br/>The visuals and graphics were good.  The monsters were quite believable and realistic.  I didn't think the characters were especially well-developed, however.  I didn't find Radha Mitchell's character, Fry, especially captivating.  Keith David was wasted in his role, and I felt nothing for most of the rest of the characters; in fact, we knew their fates..  Vin Diesel was certainly the best of the lot and he portrayed the criminal Riddick fairly well.<br/><br/>My biggest complaint was all the ambient light during the eclipse.  I was expecting virtual darkness and there was far too much light in certain sequences toward the end of the film.  Obviously, from a visual standpoint, you can't have total darkness, but give me a little bit more -- it would heighten the apprehension and terror.  But it was to the extent where if their lights went out, they could still see..  If that's the case, at least show a moon or something to indicate that's what's happening.<br/><br/>In all, some parts of the movie were good, but with the expectations I had for this film, I was left feeling a bit disappointed at the end.."

You sit through these scenes when Jack (Jackie) squeeks and just says a lot of really annoying things, and you clench your teeth.

","""Pitch Black"" kicks right off with a pretty spectacular scene. In this scene a spaceship serving as a sort of inter-galactic subway train crash lands on a strange planet.  Among the surviving passengers is a convicted mass murderer, Riddick (Vin Diesel from ""Saving Private Ryan""), being transported back to prison or somewhere nasty.  There's the co-captain of the ship, Fry (Rahda Mitchell from ""High Art""), who finds herself in charge. There are about ten others to begin with, but that number of course is reduced to about four by the end.<br/><br/>The planet is very desert-like (what world of your typical sci-fi movie isn't?) Luckily (by golly, what a coincidence!) they land near a settlement now seemingly abandoned. There's also a canyon nearby filled with the bones of alien creatures. The group sets out in search of water, concerned by the presence of Riddick. But then something else starts killing people. They discover that the planet's only remaining life forms are these nasty, hammerhead shark-looking things that fly. The planet has three suns and for some reason, these creatures can't live in sunlight. Day lasts 22 years. At night, they hunt. Thing is, night lasts maybe as long as the day (a very cool concept that put a grin on my face). Oh and wouldn't you know it, after almost 22 years of daylight, these poor people crash land on the planet only a few days before the long night falls. sucks to be you I guess.<br/><br/>The film is actually the best sci-fi flick I've seen lately (which only demonstrates how bad the sci-fi has been this year). It's quite entertaining if you can get past how absurd it is. The trick is not to think too much when you're watching it. The script cleverly plays the personalities of the characters against each other. It plays the horror movie game of ""who's the real bad guy?"" for the entire length of the film as well as another old favorite, ""who's going to die next?""

The difference here is that Pitch Black just happens to be set in space, rather than being about space.<br/><br/>Aside (minor spoiler): The device that demonstrates the eclipse is NOT a true model of the solar system. It works like those stylised subway/train route maps with the straight lines and stations spaced evenly apart. Instead of being drawn to show true distances and geography, it simply provides spatial relationships for convenience. Likewise, the device just tracks the apparent motion of the suns and planets against each other in the sky, relative to the desert planet (which is why it's in the centre).

Or could it be that they like the idea of the movie and not so much the movie itself.<br/><br/>I think this movie is lacking a lot of things, for one: suspense. When you call a movie Pitch Black it might be a wise decision NOT to start the Pitch Blackness 1 hour (!) into the movie and not have the story be dragged on for such a long time. After an hour the audience doesn't care anymore about creatures coming out of the ground because it is now dark. Even the great visual depiction can't help you anymore at this stage.<br/><br/>The story starts out with a blast but after that it gets lost in its own desert of improbabilities and impossibilities. If this movie was supposed to be pitch black, then there was an awful lot of ambient lighting in the second part of the movie.<br/><br/>A plus is the Unrated Director's Cut DVD.

If only they would have put more effort in getting a story with depth and meaning, then this film would have been a big hit."

","*Minor spoilers ahead*<br/><br/>All I can say about this movie is WOW! this makes my third viewing of it and it is still as intense and suspenseful as the first.<br/><br/>I have seen Pitch Black described as formulaic. Well, it's a formula that works.<br/><br/>After crash landing on a deserted planet, a small group of civilians, the only remaining crewmember left alive, a Bounty Hunter, and Riddick, a convicted killer being sent back to the slam after an escape. They have to figure out how to get off the planet which has three suns in different orbits around it, so they are constantly bathed in scorching light. Adding to the complications, Riddick (excellently played by Vin Diesel) has escaped and is sneaking around the wreckage. Soon however, they find that Riddick is the least of their worries, when one of the survivors, while digging a mass grave for the dead, is dragged underground by some nightmare creatures. Through their investigations, they find that the creatures cannot be exposed to light, so they stay mainly underground, you would think that a plan to simply stay in the constant sunlight provided by the three suns would be a good idea, right?<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the find through use of a model of the solar system that they are within days of a total solar eclipse that happens once every 22 years, cutting them off from all the light. They work to get a rescue skiff ready for launch, but the eclipse is closer than you think. They fail to get the final component (some fuel cells) for lift-off out of the crash ship before darkness finally falls and the creatures come out.<br/><br/>The movie is neatly divided into two parts: Before and after the eclipse. Before the eclipse is the setting up of the characters, the psychological Riddick and Johns (the bounty hunter) play with each other. How the characters are actually human, not your typical Sci Fi archetypes.<br/><br/>After the eclipse, it becomes a battle for survival. Characters change into ruthless 'every-man-for-himself' types, quivering cowards, or true heroes. There is no true good guy, just an antihero and the rest trying to survive as they are picked off one by one.<br/><br/>The ending is surprising and terrifying at the same time, and Riddicks cries of ""Not for me!"" will go with you long after the final credits have rolled.<br/><br/>If you have the means and ability, get the unrated directors cut. it flashes out the characters a bit more, and you get a better feel for them.<br/><br/>One of the great Sci Fi movies. Give it a 10."

","The one thing you'll have to remember when seeing any kind of film, is just what kind of film you are seeing!<br/><br/>This is a Science fiction / Horror movie, and my review is based on it being this genre. So Expect some of the characters to be a little one dimensional, and the script to contain a contradiction or two.<br/><br/>All that aside ""Pitch Black"" is a very good movie!<br/><br/>If you liked Alien (the first) you'll love Pitch Black. A cargo ship carrying 40 passengers crashes to a desert planet. In the crash a killer in the same weight class as Hannibal (if not in sophistication then certainly in blood lust) escapes. We soon see that he is the least of the survivors concern.<br/><br/>The characters work well together. Our heroine seems a fragile little woman, but her dark side is exposed in the beginning of the movie. The killer is frightening, but his polished roughness brings to mind a feline, or almost feminine quality.<br/><br/>The most refreshing about the movie is the lack of heroes. All characters have their heroic moments, but at the end there is not one individual who saved the day (and goes to sleep to awake in Alien # ?).<br/><br/>All survivors are flawed and have failed in critical moments, which makes you love them even more!<br/><br/>The script does lack a little originality, (you can't help to think about alien) and there are some Discrepancies which are just a little to big to swallow, so all in all I'll give it a 9/10<br/><br/>My recommendation is : Rent it, steal, or go see it in a movie theater, if you like science fiction/horror movies!"

","Brouhaha, an absolute blast!  Pitch Black is what every sci-fi and horror fan has been expecting ever sense that horribly disappointing Alien Resurrection.  Yes I know it's the same old opening sequences.  A deep space vessel crashing on an alien planet which happens to be a desert.  Don't let the stereotypical opening to this film frighten you away, wait for the real frightening, when you get involved with the main story.  Specifically it is the great dialog that drives the story so well.  You have interesting characters, and the tension they all exert plays well against the situations they all become entangled in.  There is even some religious debate that added the the characters depth that I found quite entertaining. SPOILER ALERT Vin Diesel plays an extremely enthralling character named Riddick, who's an killer/escapee being brought back by bounty hunter Johns, played by Cole Hauser.  After the shipwreck Riddick escapes.  The tension of such a savage killer running around scott free creates turmoil between the other survivors of the crash, and before they can get comfortable with Riddicks presence it turns night.  In a desperate attempt to leave the planet our heroes keep on hurdling obsticals one right after another.  Yet the dark proves not to be without the boogie man.  As blood thirsty aliens come out to have a mid-night snack our heroes turn to an unlikely hero, Riddick.  Riddick happens to be genetically enhanced to see in the Pitch Black, making him a very important asset in the others survival.<br/><br/>What I absolutely loved about this film was Vin Diesel's physical presence, on top of having a great performance as a dark anti-hero. Having a character scarier than the aliens killing everyone off was a neat twist that I enjoyed most of all.  Where other sci-fi horror films have failed, Pitch Black pulls off an A in my book."

The basis of the movie is this:  A team of ""travellers"" crash in their ship on a seemingly deserted planet.  One of the passengers is an escaped convict.  They find a colony of ""monsters"" that can only survive in the night.  Predictable enough, the THREE SUNS become blocked and the planet becomes dark, letting the ""monsters"" roam freely in the dark....hunting their prey.

","I'm not a huge fan of science fiction films (as I find most of them to be predictable and disappointing), but I found Pitch Black to be a well made flick, despite being short of what the trailers make it out to be.<br/><br/>Even though it appears to come across as a generic science fiction movie about the survivors of a spaceship crash who have to battle carnivorous monsters before they can escape, Pitch Black throws you one of its many unexpected curves by having complex characters who actually seem like real people placed a rather interesting bind.  Most of the survivors, as diverse in religion and occupation as you would expect to find amongst a list of survivors of any plane crash, are as much at odds with the convict and murderer Riddick as they are with the monsters from which they must protect themselves.  Riddick is also at odds with the other survivors, who would rather see him dead or behind bars again, as well as with their common enemy.  It makes one wonder whether they're helping each other out of the goodness of their hearts or for their own personal interests--a refreshing change from many science fiction films where the protagonists want to help each other out of moral responsibility.<br/><br/>I thought the special effects were appropriate for a film like this, and it's hard not to appreciate the imagination that went into the setting (it's nice not to see people stranded on a desolate copy of Earth with only one orange sun that rises and sets).  While I thought some of the actions of some of the characters were rather stupid at times, the evolution of others made up for it.  Vin Diesel stole the show with his commanding screen presence as Riddick, but Radha Mitchell was a bad choice to play Fry. Overall, it's not the heart-stopping, edge of your seat thriller that it was advertised to be, but definitely worth the rental fee and is anything but ""average""."

The creatures are not badly conceived and have some cool special effects in their perception of light. <br/><br/>
Unfortunately, there are some stupid moves on the part of almost every character except Riddick (Vin Diesel steals the show), who is the consummate survivor.  He maintains your interest throughout -- you are never quite sure if he has redeeming qualities, besides some reflective stuff on his eyeballs, physical courage, strength etc.  Not that he is in any danger of breaking out in a spot of bon homie.<br/><br/>A boon:  The ending is actually not predictable.   Try guessing if any of them survive, and if so, which.  Well, its clear some of them are just not gonna make it, but after that, try guessing.  <br/><br/>Low points you can pass over: What lousy luck arriving at just exactly this point in the 22 year cycle.

The slight twist to this plot is the planet the surviving crew are stranded on is due to experience an eclipse. They of course find this out after finding some rather less than sociable creatures who are only able to get around in the dark.<br/><br/>The creature design was good and the animation for the CGI stuff was excellent, making the threat of the creatures realistic and believable.<br/><br/>The crew are working on a way to get of the planet when the eclipse strikes sending them into a claustrophobic darkness.<br/><br/>The characters are very good, Vin Diesel giving it his all as Riddick, an escaped con who, having served time on a planet where light isn't permitted, has had his eyes genetically altered to let him see in the dark. the story slowly weaves it's way through the different members of the crew, with not all of them being what they first appear.<br/><br/>If you like suspense, a well made film, the odd fright and a good cast then go see this.    <br/><br/>I'd ignore the bad comments you here about this, and go and judge for yourself, cos it really would be shame to miss out on a film this good just because a mate of yours doesn't like it."

It does succeed thanks to its beautiful artistic vision and artistic direction.  But, its artistic merits rest atop a script that relies too much on some very traditional and tiresome sci-fi plots.<br/><br/>The acting, especially the transported criminal played by Van Diesel (who has a great voice for the part) is above average.  The special effects have some novel and quite interesting approaches to portraying an alien world with three suns.  Artistic direction gets very high marks, several scenes seemed to be almost framed and contain a certain attention to detail that is rare today.  The aliens themselves are also very interesting, if a bit derivative from Aliens.  Although, we never do get a real clear look at them, but this ends up working well since it lets the imagination of the viewer fill in the details.<br/><br/>Overall, a very good attempt a making a worthy derivation of the classic aliens genre."

It's set on a planet with 3 suns, each a different colour, two of which orbit the third AND EACH OTHER! The solar system is so small and the planets are so big and close together and orbit so fast that they come into a ""pitch black"" (geddit?) triple solar eclipse often enough for the dominant life form to evolve into a flying creature that thrives in the dark.<br/><br/>The hero is a gravel-voiced fighting machine escaped convict whose law-man captor easily kicks his ass every 5 minutes for the first half hour, and a cold-blooded homicidal menace who never kills anyone.  After about 30 minutes the law-man gets a sudden character transplant and acquires the martial arts skills of a cabbage, because the con is supposed to be the hero.  For added credinility, the space pilot is a curvy young blonde whose uniform is a low-cut satin crop-top and pedal-pushers. Distracted only occasionally as she found yet another reason to lean forward or crawl toward the camera, I found ""homages"" to too many classier movies.<br/><br/>Predator is threaded through everything from the aliens' point-of-view visuals to Vin Diesel's Arnier-than-thou performance. Both the good ""Alien"" movies are here, obviously, and cult classic Tremors, with a dose of Con-Air thrown in to justify the bad-boy hero. A desert planet with twin suns appeared in which ground-breaking Star Wars movie? The mixed bag of cardboard cut-out characters are straight out of 70s disaster movies like ""Poseidon Adventure"".<br/><br/>Real thrills are few and far between. The final chase back to base camp is hackneyed, over-extended and predictable - you really have seen it all before. The CGI monsters are animated to about the standard of the original ""Species"", and of irritatingly inconsistent relative size.

","Pitch Black is one of the most entertaining science fiction movies I've ever seen. The script was surprisingly intelligent. It would have been easy to make a film about monsters on an unknown planet be extremely stupid, but the screenwriters managed to avoid this. Every character is well written, there are no ""cookie-cutter"" characters. They are all 3 dimensional people with good and bad traits.<br/><br/>While all of the acting in the movie is good, no one was as good as Vin Diesel as Riddick, the escaped convict that the stranded passengers turn to for help. Even when he's not speaking, he commands attention. Diesel makes it clear that Riddick is only out to help himself. Only near the end do we see some signs of caring for others in him, but even these are minimal. Diesel never lets us forget that Riddick is a murderer.<br/><br/>Technically, the film is also very good. The lighting was interesting before the darkness comes. There are 3 suns around the planet, so the lighting is a little brighter than normal. And at one point the screen has a kind of blue tint to it, apparently because the bluish sun was higher in the sky. It's a nice effect. Also the editing is very quick and frantic, especially during action sequences. The crash scene at the beginning is especially tense due to the editing.<br/><br/>Does Pitch Black teach us any great lessons about life? No. But who cares?

Yes, yes, the plot has been done, but still an entertaining flick. What really saves this film is the group of un-likeable characters. Basically, there is not really a character you find yourself cheering for... and I find that a big plus. You have a criminal with cats' eyes, a pilot who'd realistically save her own ass before thinking about anyone else, a cop-like character who's almost as dangerous as the criminal he's captured, and several other disposable characters that predictably turn on one another as soon as the suns go down. The special effects are good, but I preferred how they didn't focus to much on them. What gives this film the bit of creepiness it has is what you don't see hiding in the shadows. To think of it now, you don't actually SEE the monsters all that much. What you have is a ""Blair Witch"" element of ""sometimes it's what you don't see that scares you."" In any case, not a bad movie, but I can't help but feeling like I was watching a direct-to-video flick that got mixed up with a film with better production-values."

","A spaceship crash-lands on a desolate planet. Now the survivors must face the unknown - and each other - in a never-ending game of terror.<br/><br/>Sound familiar? Okay, maybe a little. But there are a couple of hooks in this movie. One is that the planet these guys have landed on has three suns, and wouldn't ya know it all three suns are about ready to align, plunging the planet into a complete and lasting darkness. Add to this creepy setting a malicious convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who's gone to the trouble of having his eyeballs surgically altered so he can see in the dark, the better to sneak up on you, my dear. This is explained to us rather poignantly early on, and of course his eyesight becomes useful later on.<br/><br/>
There are two ways to look at this movie - either as generic drama, powered by a plot, or as a horror film. Those of you looking at it as a horror film already have low standards (admit it!), so you won't be disappointed. I don't mean to belittle you, but let's face it - when you want to sit down to a good horror film, the story isn't always a top priority. You want stuff that'll scare you! If you're looking at this as a drama - man versus self, man versus alien planet, and so forth - you still won't be disappointed. In short, there are two things going for this - an excellent use of special effects (and, consequently, a great sense of what's creepy) and a solid plot. You can't go wrong. <br/><br/>To complicate matters, the remaining humans - now deep in darkness, with only flares, flashlights, etc. to help them - are besieged by nasty flying alien creatures who only attack in the dark. Seeing the ripe and ready flesh of the humans must seem like an all-you-can-eat buffet to the aliens. And if the outside threat isn't enough, our heroes have to deal with Riddick, who's released from his chains early on. Will he kill them all? Will aliens slaughter them in their sleep?<br/><br/>I won't get into the acting except to say that I have movie posters in my house that have more emotion and personality. And the script itself - the dialog sounds as if it were written by a high-schooler. But there are a lot of genuinely startling moments, and there's a magnificent atmosphere to the whole deal. You never get to settle in to the movie, and that's key to a horror film, in my book. At no point did I have a chance to sit back and notice how bad the acting was, and that's quite a feat. So, in short, you can either look at this movie super-critically (in which case you won't be pleased, unless you delight in finding fault!) or simply go with the flow. It's a scary ride, folks, because you don't know what you'll run into when it's dark."

","Occasionally along comes a film which is not hyped to the maximum and generally comes recommended by a friend, my favourite Sci-Fi film of all time came to me this way, that film was The Hidden. Now it has been surpassed by Pitch Black, received the US DVD last week and so far watched it 5 or 6 times and the film just gets better and better.<br/><br/>So where to begin, the start is excellent full of action not the usual eerie pan around the spaceship interior. The bodycount also starts pretty quickly. This leads into a very fast pace for the whole film all the way to the end.<br/><br/>The sound (on DVD) is excellent and the visuals (although not scientifically accurate) are a wonder to behold, with lots of freeze framing going on. Characters are well in two camps ( those who survive most of the time and those who don't ), Riddick, Fry, Jack, Imam, Johns and to a lesser degree Paris all have some development throughout the film and add some interesting plots.<br/><br/>The acting on the whole is very good and Vin Diesel deserves to increase his Hollywood profile following this film. The DVD offers a lot of information with the commentaries sections and would recommend checking these out. I look forward to 10th November when Pitch Black is in UK cinemas ( yes that is 9 months since the US release and some one should face criminal charges of cruelty for that ) as it will be a visceral feast to enjoy on the big screen.<br/><br/>If you liked Predator, Aliens, The Hidden, Independence Day, The Thing or any other leave your brain at home and enjoy the ride movie then you MUST see Pitch Black."
"mjanky","Null","0","0","31 October 2000"," Not a bad movie... but not great either.
","The visuals and sound quality on DVD make this a worthwhile watch, but now that I've seen it I'll probably sell it on EBAY. Granted Vin Diesel is the most interesting character but he does a mediocre job here at best (check him out as the voice of the robot in Iron Giant). The creatures and other effects are done very well but without interesting characters and a storyline to care about it hurts the film in the long run. **POSSIBLE SPOILER** The fact that this ship crashes on a planet on the same day that a once every 22 year eclipse occurs is just way too much to swallow, even for sci-fi. And what do you suppose the odds are that the main character would have surgically altered eyes that allows him to see in the dark, when the creatures only come out in the dark. Really...come on! Why not just have a regular day-night cycle and have the people terrorized over and over. That would be much more interesting over all. I could care less about the argument over suns revolving around planets or vice versa, because who knows what happens outside our galaxy, but I do care about plausible vs. just plain goofy! 6 of 10 for effects."
"draftyrafters","9","0","0","20 February 2000"," Perfect Pitch
","A new sci-fi thriller was released this past Friday.  It stars nobody famous, was directed by David Twohy (who is responsible for some pretty major flops, like G. I. Jane, The Arrival, Waterworld, Critters 2 and Terminal Velocity), and was written by the brothers Wheat, Jim and Ken, who have also spent most of their time penning some pretty dreary stuff (Birds II, The Fly II, and Nightmare on Elm Street 4).  Aside from the fact that Twohy once directed The Fugitive, this movie has nothing going for it right out of the starting block.<br/><br/>	It's called Pitch Black.  And, as my dad always says, ""This movie will eat your lunch.""  That means its good, for those of you who don't speak the language of my dad.<br/><br/>	Let's talk plot.  Taking place in the distant future, a space ship is carrying some passengers to an unnamed planet.  Among the denizens is a dangerous convict, who is our narrator.  For no explained reason, the ship's hull is punctured full of holes, causing an understandable and intense crash, depositing the surviving members of the group on a large deserted planet that has three suns.  Unfortunately, a major solar eclipse is on the verge of occurring, and the planet just happens to be infested with a horrifying race of aliens that can only live in the dark.  Needless to say, the aliens begin feasting on the poor survivors like they're Human McNuggets.  Pass the popcorn!<br/><br/>	Perhaps the most admirable trait of the movie is its patience.  It jumps into the story with just enough exposition to keep it sensible, but it doesn't rush anywhere from there, doesn't make any excuses, and doesn't explain itself any more than it has to.  Each element of the story (including the nicely designed and unobtrusive sub-plots) achieves a mythical quality within the confines of the well-measured story. 	Of course, the cinematography helps.  The first half of the movie, establishing the mood and situation, is almost over-exposed, glaring a hot white.  The three suns (one of which is a silver blue) shine beautifully on the shimmering and humming planet, and everyone's faces become bleached masks.  And then, suddenly, it's dark.<br/><br/>	There's nothing devouring about the film.  It certainly doesn't swallow the audience whole, the way Aliens did.  But it does provide a context and a story that, in its own element, is believable and suspenseful, the way Alien did.  Sure, Pitch Black has its cheesy moments, but it's the type of cheese you don't regret, and most of it provides a welcome relief from the constant swarthy forms rushing by in the darkness.  Balanced out by moments of intense creepiness, the cheese helps keep the movie from falling into total self-importance.<br/><br/>	But what makes the flick (despite nicely underplayed acting all around) is the visually enchanting tricks the director opted to add.  The convict narrator spent most of his life in a prison with almost no lighting.  Upon his release (i.e. breakout) he got a doctor to give him night vision. (C'mon, it's the future)  At many points the movie adopts his point of view, which is simultaneously gorgeous and chilling.  Add to that the alien point of view (which is an array of crystalline shards, intended to represent the way they ""see"" things in a manner similar to bats: via echoes), and you have a flick well worth just watching, if not experiencing.<br/><br/>	It's hard to know who'll like it and who won't, but I don't hesitate to say this is a good movie.  Playing out like a live action version of Myst plus Doom, this show has its weak points and its strong points, its silly moments and its strong moments, but doesn't disappoint.  And although some of it may be gross, some of it disturbing, and some of it a little dopey, it's an engaging story without a predictable resolution, tuned to an almost perfect pitch.<br/><br/>	Get it?  ""Pitch?""  Pitch Black?  Just go see the movie, for crying out loud."

","I'm astonished that Pitch Black didn't do better, it was a wonderfully realistic and well written movie!  And why can't people just enjoy the darn flick?  People say the science is bad.  WRONG!  Gravity is what holds planets around a sun.  If the planets are dense enough or big enough and the suns are small or less dense, than they very well CAN rotate around planets! Nobody even mentions the glow-slugs later!  Of course it makes sense that on a planet like this evolution would create phosphorescence as a defense mechanism.  Lovely detail! And quit whining about contrived plots and ripoffs!  You CANNOT make a movie today without ripping something off! For everyone who called this movie a wannabe or compared it to Aliens or the Matrix, I hate to break it to you, but the critters from aliens were almost IDENTICAL to a critter in a novel called Voyage of the Space Beagle by AE van Vogt written at least 20 years before Alien came out.  Likewise, the Matrix was ripped off from an RPG called Shadowrun which was released in the mid 80's!  And yes, it seems a little hokey that they just happened to crash in the 22nd year when the darkness came, but you'll notice in Alien that out of the whole gigantic refinery ship, the creature just happened to hide in the little teeny-weeny lifeboat ship.  And the queen in Aliens just happened to hide in the one place where they couldn't get her without killing themselves  And finally as for those who say the characters are shallow. When was the last time you saw a character admit they did something stupid? (Fry crawling down the hole) or when survivors thanked the pilot for the extremely tough job she did of keeping some of them alive in the crash instead of ""oh, great babe! ya really screwed us over with that pro landing!""  And Riddick was still a nasty guy at the end, he was just starting to change and soften a little.  Kurt Russell overcame 35+ years of ironclad conditioning and mind control in just a few weeks in Soldier!  So everyone out there that keeps complaining about unreal this, and shallow that, save your money and watch ""The Real World"" on MTV.  Those of you that can open your mind and just enjoy the great fiction, put Pitch Black at the top of your must see scifi!<br/><br/>8/10"

However, this sci-fi movie fell into the hole of a horrible 'B' movie.  The special effects were great and the action was decent.  The problem lies in the badly developed characters...except for Vin Diesel's.  There seems to be a character to fit every niche of society.

There is absolutely no thought required to view this film.  As long as one can tell the difference between a human and an alien, you're all set.

","""Pitch Black""'s basic premise, while certainly intriguing, doesn't really offer anything new that really advances the science fiction genre to new heights. Movies like this rely on tenser things to make them work: Memorable characters, gripping, terrifying scenes, and stylistic choreography. ""Pitch Black"" has all three. <br/><br/>I have always believed that an effective science fiction film is one while introduces the viewer into a whole new world of its own and then invites the viewer to suspend their disbelief and go along with it. If the science fiction film is good, then the viewer will be so intrigued by the notion of the film that they will allow the movie to suck them into it, and they become lost in this film's new world. Few films have achieved this style of brilliance. The ""Star Wars"" saga did. ""Dark City,"" one of the best sleeper-films of 1999, did. ""The Matrix"" did. The first ""Highlander"" film did. And now, ""Pitch Black"" can be added to that list.<br/><br/>The very essence of this film, the plot notwithstanding, is in the execution of making the viewer feel absolute terror in this strange, barren, desert-like planet inhabited by creatures of the night, in which space explorers crashland on after a hull breech. It works, thanks to realistic characters and stunning choreography. The two principal colors in this film are black and white, with most of it taking place only with the lights shining on the faces of the actors and the alien creatures flying overhead. The characters are not the standard ""good guy"" and ""bad guy"" cliches either. There are several significant characters here: A super-human serial killer, a morphine-addicted bounty hunter, a captain with a secret, a Muslim priest, an athiest, an antique dealer (who, *spoilers* has one of the best death scenes in film history), and a child. All of them present both evil sides and good sides, and a cast of characters hasn't been so motely in a sc-fi film since ""Aliens""<br/><br/>This film, however, cannot be compared to ""Aliens."" Nor ""The Terminator,"" or ""Predator,"" or other successful sci-fi thrillers. This film is simply ""Pitch Black,"" in a league of its own. And it works. <br/><br/>An early prediction: This film will either become a sleeper and quickly get dumped to video, or else it will achieve the status of ""The Matrix."" It will probably be either one or the other, with little in between. We shall see.<br/><br/>On a personal note as well, keep an eye on Vin Diesel, who plays the mad serial killer. If any producer reads this, he might be a good choice for the role of Beowulf in the upcoming version that Roland Emmerich's company is working on. He's well built and has a lot of screen presence.

Diesel is fed with lines which are on the borderline of being cliches but he makes them pure bad-ass. I have also seen Keith David before as an extra in like a gasillion movies.

","Pitch Black is surprisingly good for such an obvious b-movie. Usually in this type of movie, producers, trying to sell an extra scene of gore, sex, or fright, will allow some bad writing or trite cliche to spoil the story. But Pitch Black is relentless in its integrity; it's lean and mean and it doesn't waste time being anything other than a horror/thriller.<br/><br/>Pitch Black takes place on an alien planet where the bones of land leviathans lay in the desert. Passengers on a wrecked spaceship must survive the planet's heat, an escaped violent prisoner, and whatever terrors might be found on the planet's surface.<br/><br/>In everything it does, Pitch Black is successful. For example, it opens with a crash scene, and the ""special effects"" are very well done. The effects were clearly not expensive, but they were effective, melding editing, acting, and sound into a tense, plausible scene. The cinematography of the film is an interesting cross between Saving Private Ryan (with strobe-like footage from a fast-shutter camera) and Three Kings (giving the alien planet a bleached, sun-baked look). Finally, some very good sound editing makes the film seem just otherworldly enough to remind you the setting is not Earth -- like the simple sound of a gunshot sweetened with an eerie bird-shriek.<br/><br/>Pitch Black quietly opened in early 2000, then quietly faded away.

An odd, but not so odd, group of people, who are the only survivors of a crash landing, band together (more or less) and try to find a way to continue their journey to Mecca, another planet. The idea of this movie is original (other than who's afraid of the dark), but what I think really gave it the depth,that these particular movies need so much, was Vin Diesel. Count on seeing more of this guy. His character was fit to play. Riddick (Vin) is a convicted murderer that you learn to respect first and then possibly like. His coolness is outdone by his straightforwardness and you might wonder if he really is a bad-guy. So an eclipse takes place and these wild-looking creatures (they can't tolerate light) come out to eat. Riddick is the ace (he has night vision and alarming strength), and he and the attractive, now in command(captain was killed in crash) Fry, are the strength in this gradually diminishing group.

","As I've scanned through here, with varying takes on how good or bad ""Pitch Black"" is, it never seems to have occurred to anyone that the kind of story that this movie tells is what science-fiction is SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT. Despite what the tagline would have you believe, it was never truly intended to be a horror piece ala' ""Aliens"" per se (though the design for these unnamed beasties are definitely ripped off from H.R. Giger's original design). Like many of the best episodes of ""The Outer Limits"" (where a story of this sort would have fit perfectly, I might add), it's just old-fashioned science fiction in the fashion of ""The Day the Earth Stood Still""...that is, dubious science but believable human interaction.<br/><br/>Much of the film's power comes from Vin Diesel as ice-cold, convicted murderer Riddick. His opening voice-over sets the tone quite well. Plenty of time for things to go wrong, indeed. How they go wrong is, in much the same way the dubious scientific mechanics of the eclipse are handled, unimportant. What IS important is how the survivors react to them and each other. While Riddick is about the last person one would want to be stranded on a rock crawling with insects, he ultimately turns out to be the only one who knows how to survive...which isn't to say that he's not willing to leave the rest of them behind. It takes the guilt-ridden acting Captain of the ship to get him to follow through. He's more intrigued by her attitude than moved, I felt. It's not until she comes back to save his bacon that he begins to change (and not that much, considering how he says ""Good night"" to the aliens). Add a junkie merc with a badge who becomes the party's biggest liability and the most important components of the story are in place. Practically everything else, by itself, would not have been able to sustain the movie.<br/><br/>All right, so ""Pitch Black"" is no more ""The Matrix"" than it is ""evil vs. evil"" (more like ""alien nature vs. human sociopath""). That still does not make it any less a small gem in the all-too barren wasteland of sci-fi."
"Joel I","5","0","0","20 February 2000"," Predictable marooned-in-space entry
","""Pitch Black"" is an undistinguished entry into the ""marooned in space"" genre.  A very mixed group of space travelers (including a psychopathic convict and a family of devout Muslims) crash land on a barren planet, only to find they are not alone.  The planet is inhabited by man-eating monsters (did someone say Alien).  One good thing is that the monsters are photophobic and can't come out into the light.  Another good thing is that the planet has three suns and is always in light (the monsters dwell bat-like in caves).  But then comes a major problem: the travelers learn that every 22 years, the planet gets thrown into a total eclipse (of all three suns no less).  And guess what!  This is the 22nd year!  Uh-oh.  This could be a neat and scary premise, but director David Twohy hasn't figured out a good way to film scenes in the dark.  The monsters look like they could be terrifying, if only you could see them better.  There is the predictable one-by-one reduction of main characters, but because of the darkness, you can't even be sure which character has been eliminated.  None of this is helped by the awful performance of Radha Mitchell as the spaceship's tough commander (there seems to be a genre trend toward female spaceship commanders).  Mitchell showed she could act in ""High Art,"" so we will charitably assume that she was just miscast here.  She seems about as tough as a val-girl at the mall.  Directors seem to think that if you just take any actress and dress her in a tank top and let her curse a lot, she will turn into macho-woman.  Not here.  The saving asset of this movie is Vin Diesel as the mysterious psycho convict, Riddick.  Diesel adds welcome depth to the character, and imbues him with an impressive Darth Vader voice. There are also hints of a back story on Riddick that seems to be more interesting than this movie.  Perhaps we will find out."

Sure, it has alien critters taking the cast out one at a time (the only comparison that it's fair to judge by) but these creatures aren't as menacing as the creatures from that movie.  These creatures are more like buzzards than calculating terror.  Anyhow, it's got a VERY UNIQUE feel to it and feels like two movies in one.  The first half is science fiction and the second half is horror. A rather pleasing aspect is the utter gloom I felt when the cast lost their daylight.  Very ominous, indeed.  But, to sum it up: Vin Diesel's character is an instant legend.  This character belongs in the same file folder with some of Arnie's and Sly's best personas.  The special effects and plot were fine.

","Science fiction movies are either so good they are instant classics or so bad it goes into the back of the shelf of Blockbuster never to be seen again.  The movie Pitch Black, I believe, is a classic.  It is by far a bizarre little film, but in no way is it a gory alien movie. 	<br/><br/>The story is fairly complex.  In some time in the future, a passenger ship caring dozens of people causing the computer to fly it to the nearest planet that can sustain human life.  The nearest planet is a hot, windy planet barren of life, or so it seems.  Three suns encircle the planet creating a weird yellow effect on the camera lens.  It is easy to tell the director and cinematographer had some fun with this.  Through out the early part of the film, the camera has been distorted and creates the illusion that the actors are on a hot, sunny planet. 	<br/><br/>After the ship lands, only a few of the crew and passengers survive, the ships last member of the crew Fry, the antique dealer, a group of Muslim priests, the Prisoner Riddick, and Riddick's guard Johns.  Riddick soon escapes.  The rest of the survivors wonder the planet for water in fear that Radik will find them, and murder them.  Eventually they find a human mining quarry that has been empty for twenty-two years.  They soon discover that the planet goes into an eclipse every twenty-two years.  Soon, the entire planet is covered in darkness, and the real fun begins. 	<br/><br/>Earlier in the movie, Riddick explains that in prison he had surgery on his eyes to allow him to see his victims in the dark.  This seems a little too coincidental because once the lights go out, as they say, strange creatures start to fly out of the planet to kill them. This forces the group to keep Riddick around to help guide them to safety.  I'm not a physics major, but how does a planet that only sees darkness every 50 years have aliens that any come out at night?  As it turns out, light actually hurts these creatures. 	<br/><br/>Seeing this movie, I was amazed at its special effects.  This is an independent movie, meaning some large production company like Warner Brothers or Universal did not pay for it, but out of someone's own pocket. This person must have had a very big pocket.  The camera effects I mentioned earlier guarantee this movie a best cinematography Academy Award, or it at least deserves a nomination damn it.  The acting does leave a bit to be desired, but that is not the point of this movie.  This movie surprised me also with the fact that the humans fight each other more than they fight these creatures. 	<br/><br/>This has become one of my favorite science fiction movies, one that rivals the Matrix and the Terminator.  I highly suggest this movie to anyone who doesn't have a weak stomach, the camera does some major shaking and quick turning.  This film will make you have a new appreciation for the light. Overall, it's a fun little movie and you all should see it.<br/><br/>My Rating: ***1/2 out of ****"

","A curious little movie, this one. It seems to hover between the world of 'straight to video' derivatives and something rather better. Perhaps it deserves to be classed with ""Slipstream"" - a low-budget SF film with plenty of failings but enough interesting features to make it worth a look.<br/><br/>On the face of it, the main theme of the film - stranded space travellers on an alien planet must struggle for survival against nasty local creatures that eat them one by one - has been done to death. The ""Alien"" series pretty much wrote the book on this one, and by reinventing the theme slightly with each iteration, more or less exhausted the possibilities of the idea. The makers of ""Pitch Black"" also deserve a hefty virtual slap for using another of science-fiction's tired cliches, the dreaded meteor storm.<br/><br/>One thing that redeems ""Pitch Black"" is the focus on characters. While the characters are cliched - plucky but vulnerable pilot, superhuman serial killer, tough-guy bounty hunter, serene holy man, and a handful of the usual monster fodder - the director allows each of the actors room to work with the material that they've been given and the results are surprisingly good. Vin Diesel's sardonic Riddick is ""Hannibal Lecter"" Lite, but with greater room for depth and development, while Radha Mitchell turns in an impressive performance as the young pilot pushed into taking command in an impossible situation. Between them, they establish an intriguing and often plausible human dynamic that is rarely seen in similar films. That ""Pitch Black"" is able to rise above the level of the usual ""eat-'em-one-by-one"" picture (something that, for example, ""Event Horizon"", with its much larger budget and celebrity cast, was not) is because it becomes a film not about monsters but about flawed humanity, and the largely unknown cast are good enough to make their characters - even the most minor - believable and often likeable.<br/><br/>The picture also looks better than you would expect. The cast wear their clothes and equipment as if they lived in them, and the back story hints at a complex, multi-faceted civilisation (albeit one without any wild leaps of creative imagination: the technology and concepts are all fairly twentieth-century). The spaceship sets have a gritty, workaday feel, while the bleached, washed-out tones of the daylight exterior scenes actually make the alien setting seem real. When the characters emerge from the dark confines of the hull into the glare of day, your eyes narrow in sympathy. This is a Star Trek universe, where crash-landings are always made on planets that have breathable air, water and (usually hostile) life, but for all that, the nameless planet of ""Pitch Black"" is as barren and brutal as the plot will allow.<br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" is not without serious flaws: there's much, beginning with the main plot premise, that's hackneyed or unconvincing. But at the same time there are definitely things to like about it and food for thought. The fact that it is ultimately a film about the best and worst in human nature makes it deeper and more gripping than the broad outlines of the story might suggest."

But, I'm a fan of Farscape and I'd heard Claudia Black was in it (She is and is great) so I went to go see it. I think the moment I realized that I was enjoying the movie was when a Gas Giant with Rings begins to eclipse a sun. Wow! It was some great Imagery. The casting of Rhiana Griffith as Jack/Jackie was ridiculous. I don't want to revel too much of the plot, but if you've seen the movie you know why. I really think this is the best Sci-fi Horror film since Alien, I recommend it to any who enjoy either Genre."

","Almost as good as THE MATRIX (***1/2). The only thing that held it back was its ending. Now the ending was good but from the type of movie this was, I kind of expected a better ending. The rest of the movie was phenomenal. This movie has some great references to other great sci-fi films. It was a combination of ALIENS (***), PREDATOR (***1/2) and BATS (***). It also had some great Matrix type special effects.  But what I really liked about this movie was that despite its great references to other sci-fi movies, it didn't try to copy any of them unlike this year's first sci-fi movie SUPERNOVA (**1/2). Sci-Fi fans will love this movie. ***[3 out of 4]"

"Alcaminhante","9","0","0","16 June 2000"," Everything Alien 3 and 4 should have been.
","Now, this is how you do an Alien movie !<br/><br/>Altough i find it a bit unffair to compare this to the Alien series, because in a way this is nothing more than a classic 50´s flick , (where Alien got its idea also),  where a bunch of astronauts get marooned on a strange planet and they get attacked by creepy alien life forms. Replace the giant crabs, snakes and spiders with three heads by some great modern looking aliens and we got PITCH BLACK. With a diference...in this movie the human characters are interesting, have personality and we end up caring for them, much more than we expected, after seeing dozens of alien monster movies through the years.<br/><br/>In fact the characters was the thing in the movie that surprised me more, after all i already was expecting good special effects. In fact i wasn´t even counting to get much more out of this movie than just some good action sequences. I was surprised to find such well writen parts for such diferent characters, in a movie that didn´t asked for it to make money in the box-office.<br/><br/>And i loved the fact that there were no Hollywood superstars in it. Just this fact made this story much more credible, and right untill the end we are never to sure about who´s going to survive. This movie has achieved something that rarely we see in a movie. That is, inside a story that almost doesn´t exist, there are some excelent characters wich realy keep us interested and fill the usual ""empty"" bad-aliens-eat-good-dudes story with small details and characteristics. The details in this movie are another good thing, and i particulary liked the idea of using Arab characters stranded in a desert planet.<br/><br/>There is not much to say about this excelent movie, the characters are excelent particulary the prisioner Riddick, the special effects are excelent, there are some good scares, it´s a great space adventure movie like it wasn´t seen in ages, nice little twists during the plot, fantastic sound particulary during the crash scene, it has plenty of little details everywhere on sets and script, and the visual style is magnificent. In fact i don´t care much for this type of MTV edditing style, ( i didn´t liked it in Matrix for example altough it´s a good movie), but in this case i think it works wonders for PITCH BLACK because it doesn´t exagerates, trying to give style, instead of being used just to tell a story.<br/><br/>In fact the direction gives a nice personal feel to this movie, and we can see the director trully likes sci-fi. I never heard of this guy David N Twohy before, but he sure is on my favorites list  for sci-fi, and i can´t wait to see his next film. An excelent little movie, that i recommend to everybody who preffers substance over style. Particulary in an apparent empty plot.<br/><br/>PITCH BLACK is a real good surprise, and to me one of the best three movies i´ve seen this year along with MAGNOLIA and the SIXTH SENSE, altough they have nothing in common.<br/><br/>More please."

","As far as sci-fi/actions films go, Pitch Black is solid and enjoyable.  The effects are pretty good, some of the characters are okay (though a few are pretty terrible and you find yourself hoping that the cast is eaten in order of acting talent, which is exactly what happens) and there is a sufficient amount of suspense to keep the thing running.  <br/><br/>If you forgive a few of the fairly major plot holes (eg1: the odds of arriving on a planet on the exact day of a solar eclipse which occurs once every 16 years.....; eg2: it's a scientifc impossibility for just one form of life to live on a planet - once they've eaten everything else, they can't just survive by eating eachother (as suggested in the film)) you'll enjoy this film.  You won't love it, but you won't regret the price of admission (as you might with films like Mission to Mars, Sphere, Deep Blue Sea, Lake Placid, Aliens 3 and 4, Phantom Menace etc)."
"vhilden","Null","0","0","14 June 2000"," Fiction, yes; Science? Hmmm...
","This film has some of the elements of a Good Science Fiction Film. Well, at least it's fiction and it's a film. Unfortunately, it's not good and it's not science.<br/><br/>After the first few minutes you know exactly who will live and who will die. Thrillers should reserve a few surprises for the viewer! The convict is not a saint, but he will survive and show some basic human feelings at the end. The cop is so arrogant and so sure of himself that he will surely be killed, the only element of surprise being: will it be the convict or the aliens? And, of course, most of the supporting cast will die, with just one exception of two. How often have you seen such a film?<br/><br/>
So, this is not really a thriller, too predictable for that. Well, how is the science? From time to time, not very often, there comes a truly good science fiction film. The best I remember were ""Soylent Green"", ""Gattacca"", and ""The Thirteenth Floor"". But just placing the script in an alien world doesn't turn a story into science. <br/><br/>For instance, Astronomers today know a few dozen extra-solar planets. The only feature they know of most such planets is their orbit, almost nothing else is known about them. Yet in this film a crew of planetary scientists had been in the planet, not knowing that there would be an eclipse there! And when they found out that, did they use a computer? An electronic calculator, perhaps? No, they found out using a mechanical contraption built with bicycle chains, and other pieces of junk. Just to put things into perspective, recently NASA lost a probe they sent to Mars because they made an error of about one part per million in the orbit calculation. Yes, engineers and scientists do make mistakes, but can you really believe that a group made of a murderous cyborg and a few religious fanatics could survive where a crew of trained scientists died? Perhaps this is the message that Hollywood tries to send: an ordinary bum who routinely flunked math is really more intelligent than a planetary scientist. Too bad. Don't waste your time with this film."

","I'm sorry to say that this movie's a real bomb. The photage is quite nice at times, experimenting with different filters and lights.<br/><br/>The script would have been much better without silly taglines, the characters talk too much. It would have been much better to focus on the moods than actual dialogue. The story loses pace at several occasions and quite a lot of events are farfetched and illogical.<br/><br/>So, all in all, it had a lot of potential but it fell for cheap shots à la Hollywood.

","I really enjoyed this film. I admit I have now seen it 6 times due to Vin Diesel fandom, but the film itself is really excellent.<br/><br/>It isnt some big budget lets blow stuff up/spend big on special effects movie, its a story of people in a nasty situation - the basic premise of any good scifi story.<br/><br/>In fact I remember after the second time I saw it the thought I had was that it was like watching a scifi book at the movies - with character development, good pacing, etc. I then later refined it to being like a good scifi short story because it is only a dip in the ocean of a larger story I think.<br/><br/>I loved the story, I loved the look of it, I loved the characters - my faves (other than Riddick) were definitely Jack and Fry. And Cole Hauser did a great job as Johns - ewww I hated him! LOL!<br/><br/>My list of peeves is short. 1)Certain people died or died first that I wasnt impressed about. 2) Fry stating the obvious all the time ""they're hollow"" and ""the light hurts them"" after someone just said the light is scolding them.<br/><br/>But apart from that - a great film!!"

","I'm not going to recap ""Pitch Black""'s plot -- no point in that, you'll probably read that elsewhere.  My feelings on this movie are... mixed.<br/><br/>I dunno.  The whole experience reminded me of the sci-fi films you find late nights on cable or on the direct-to-video wall of Blockbuster, only this one escaped into a higher budget bracket.  Trashy, but at least it was diverting trash.  It was a good enough way to kill two hours, had some interesting characters and plot twists, but I couldn't shake the feeling I had seen this movie before.<br/><br/>Overall, it's a competent job, and Vin Diesel does well, but it left me underwhelmed.  I was never scared or in any particular suspense, just mildly curious where the next attack would come from or what accented character was going to die next (in movies like this, the accents always buy it before anyone else).  What it all boils down to is, I liked this movie better the first time I saw it, when it was called ""Alien."""
"curved","8","0","0","5 June 2000"," About as good as sci-fi can get now that the genre is getting crusty.
","I have heard so many people say ""I didn't want to see this,"" or ""I had low expectations..."" But I have a different outlook when it comes to sci-fi films. Yes, most are boring pap, and, yes, most aren't worth the time or the money, but I can still hope, can't I?!<br/><br/>Director Dave Twohy's The Arrival is certainly one of my favorite sci-fi/conspiracy films ever made. Interesting direction, a great, tight script, and good acting (yes, you heard me: Charlie Sheen does a good job!) put it way over the top. So it disappointed me that it didn't do so well at the box office. Twohy's back in the director's chair again (although with Nightmare on Elm Street 3 scribes the Wheat brothers this time.) I placed high expectations on Pitch Black after seeing one TV spot; after hearing Twohy's name, I knew it would be great. I wasn't disappointed!<br/><br/>The premise is as follows: a ship full of people in deep-freeze (including one cunning, violent criminal,) are being transported through space. After crash landing on a strange planet, the tension builds. I know it doesn't sound too engaging, but it is. Upon landing, murderer Riddick (played wonderfully diabolically by Vin Diesel) escapes. The crew finds that they have even larger problems to deal with when the three suns of the planet go through an almost month-long eclipse and seemingly nocturnal alien predators come out to play.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, I really liked Twohy's direction in The Arrival. But it looks childish compared to the techniques in Pitch Black. The three aforementioned suns are different colours and, depending on where the camera is facing, so is the film tint. Twohy also gets some rather good performances out of Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell (Fry). I had never heard of Mitchell before Pitch Black and came straight home to look her up here on the IMDB. I was surprised to find out that she was the naive-yet-grown-up first time lesbian Syd in High Art; what a stretch! She's great in High Art being the uneducated underdog, and seems comfortable and natural in Pitch Black as the take-charge Fry. But we don't care about sci-fi films for the acting, do we?<br/><br/>The Wheat Brothers' script is well-realized and adds a small but welcome plot twist near the end. You will expect certain characters to die and you will probably be wrong since the film is more worried with getting the protagonists off of the planet than with what ""type"" to kill off in order. The film also has a wonderful, surprise climax that, in my opinion, turns these annoying Alien comparisons on their head (really, the men do most of the fighting, not the in-charge woman.)<br/><br/>Certainly, the sci-fi genre is running shallow. With the exception of The Matrix, it's getting to be about as fun as playing with a used condom. And there are certainly many Alien (or Aliens) clones, but I don't believe that Pitch Black is one of them. It may have a strong female lead, a good, cohesive script, and excellent direction like Alien, but it still holds up as rather fresh and individual. And if you don't walk away with a crush on Radha Mitchell, than there's something VERY wrong with you!"

","Pitch Black was great. It was beautifully put together, tightly written, and they did some exciting things with camera angles, lights and movement.<br/><br/>
They did some funky things with the visuals, like with the action scenes, they messed around a bit with cut, choppy scenes mixed with hand held camera feel, which I didn't like much but was bearable, but they over exposed the desert scenes a little, so everything was golden and glarey when in sunlight, and only normal inside buildings and such. They also messed around a lot with visuals in what the aliens ""saw"" and also in what reddick (The swoonable man with the mirror eyes) sees as well. Very funky visuals, well put together, definitely in the line of aliens ( as an action movie more than horror) and stacks of fun.<br/><br/>The ending was good except for one slight touch of sentimentality, but it was an implied sentimentality rather than an overstated sentimentality, which was good.<br/><br/>Lots of Australian actors, which were very cool.<br/><br/>I had stacks of fun, and have seen the film three times this week. There is every chance I will see it again later this week. Every dollar is a political vote, and I sincerely hope they make more stuff like this.<br/><br/>
Quick Character Analysis<br/><br/>Vin Deisel as Reddick was brilliantly cast, and would definitely be worth dying for in my book! He is nicely contrasted with Fry, being all male, all animal, killer and an all round NOT a nice guy...but I have a weakness for that sort of thing anyway. Vin Deisel's muscles deserve a mention for good acting as well; they certainly star in their own right.<br/><br/>This man is just built. The mirrored pupils really catches your eye, as well as his nifty little sunnies, but also the fact they chain him to the nearest space craft every time they catch him, and I have to admit, I was in awe for most of the film.<br/><br/>The cast held together really well; Radha as Fry was entirely all woman, and yet still was an able leader. She was not a masculine woman as many films portray female leaders to be, and yet she also wasn't a twist the ankle type heroine either. I would say she makes a good female lead role to be looked at further in feminist terms, which is of course open to interpretation!<br/><br/>
Anyway, if I keep talking I am bound to hit that spoiler mark somewhere, and I would prefer not to...so go! Enjoy! It's a great ride!"

","I thoroughly enjoyed this flick. It had some interesting camera effects, such as certain colors being tinted over the lenses. The ship crashing onto the planet was impressive. This is probably the best science fiction action movie to date since Alien, Aliens and the Matrix, and far better than Event Horizon. (which in my opinion, was a very bad movie.)<br/><br/>WARNING: There may be spoilers, do not read this review if you have not seen this movie!<br/><br/>Story revolves around space ship crashing onto a barren planet, (with three suns!) and the survivors discovering the hard way they're not the only inhabitants of the planet. There are thousands of nasty carnivorous critters living under the ground that come out only during the once-every-22-years eclipse!<br/><br/>Characterization was really good! Better than I expected of a movie of this genre. By the end of this flick, no one is who they first seemed. I think the cast played their roles well. Especially the dude who was the convict. <br/><br/>
Special effects are impressive (as expected). You only see glimpses of the critters, although they seem to change their size an awful lot. It would be nice to see something made of actual matter instead of a computer-animated graphic. If you watch their actions, however, there almost seemed to be some kind of behavior between the creatures. I found this quite intriguing, and it would've been nicer to see more interaction between them.<br/><br/> CONCLUSION? A definite must see! I rate this 9/10."

Even the opening scene becomes striking in its unique beauty as you see the ship moving towards the trail of the comet which will lead our friends into disaster and shipwreck them on the alien-infested planet.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell is a magnificent star, with the beauty to make you underestimate her and the acting and kick-butt ability to make her seem both strong enough to drive our characters to salvation yet fragile enough to make you wonder if she can pull it off.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel has a reputation as an egomaniac, but after this film you'll wonder if it isn't deserved. He has the strength (both the physical and the onscreen presence) to carry this film alone though I'm glad we still get to enjoy the great ensemble around him.<br/><br/>Thanks to great writing, the main characters never remain the way you expect them too. Before we know her as the hero, Radha is willing to sacrifice the lives of everyone to save her hide. When you believe Diesel, though a psychotic killer, at least has a sense of honor, the director pulls a fast one there, too.<br/><br/>And though this movie, like many others, begs you to scream ""Run!"" to the characters on the screen... well, that isn't always such a good idea either, even in Hollywood.<br/><br/>Pitch Black gives you just enough look at the aliens to know you don't want to mess with them.

Next are the obvious plot-holes dealing with the eclipse itself, the character's interactions--would you tell a psychopath you'd trust him if he behaved himself?, and the cliched ending top the list.<br/><br/>I would advise to see this movie if you are in a pinch for a SF fix, otherwise, you may just want to wait for it to appear on cable."

Now they are stuck and the basic plot becomes apparent about 45 minutes into the film,I won't spoil it for you but it really isn't riveting. The first 45 minutes to an hour into the film are excellent I have to admit that, and the eclipse sequence is just a work of art, really incredible, there's a few chase scenes that get the adrenaline pumping, but when the characters are being chased by carnivorous birds, they dont seem to be too worried after the first death and carry on as if it was another routine walk from A to B from then on it goes down hill, the characters change very rapidly as they progress along their very singular mission. The hard man goes soft and basically it seems that as soon as they start running towards their goal, the film crew must've run out of money, ideas and creative writing skill.

The director picks some odd camera angles and weird shots, but I think it pays off. He lets see from the viewpoint of the killer/hero, the viewpoint of the weird alien bats, and he actually makes you a little afraid of the dark.     The noises of the creatures are very frightening, but sound a little grating after a while. Other than that, and the fact the movie is about 10-15 minutes too long, its really worth your while.

Each role is shredded over the course of the film, either literally by the monsters or figuratively by some sort of revelation about the character.<br/><br/>
Most of the lukewarm reviews of Pitch Black say it draws too much storyline from films like the Alien series.  Well, I've never seen any of the Alien films.  And I really didn't see much of a storyline anyway.  Group of people, dangerous place, some live/some die, the end!  It's a beautiful formula.  Anyone can use it, but you have to produce it with style. Director David Twohy is fortunate to have a very talented cinematographer (David Eggby) who does interesting things with movement when the crew is in space and with the atmosphere on the surface of the planet, which has three suns.<br/><br/>I liked the ensemble, especially Vin Diesel as Richard Riddick.  He gets all the good one liners, is smoldering but incredibly cool and has eye implants so he can see in the dark.  Now, THERE'S a bonus on a planet that's about to experience a full eclipse!  He gets a buff nine on my sigh scale.  Radha Mitchell is our plucky femme fatale.  She's a tiny thing with a will of steel, who aptly supplies heart to their desolate situation.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is a fun ride, as long as you don't expect to be enlightened. Some rough language plus some violence and a few scares equal an R rating. Good acting, taut action scenes and cinematic style add up to 3 Â½ on my scale.  Recommended!"

","Ladies and gentlemen, this is a great movie.  First off, I feel it is necessary to explain that this is a movie for people that watch movies because they're entertaining.  People tell me this movie has problems because a solar system with three suns couldn't possibly exist as it does in the movie.  Quite frankly, who cares?  I'm not taking my astronomy book into the theater with me...the fact is that in the world created in ""Pitch Black"", that's the way it is and you know what, I thought it was great. Other complaints focus on things such as the crash landing in the opening sequence.  Personally, I thought the scene had an amazingly high intensity. The photography made me feel the suspense of the crash...the flashing scenery was perfect.  Note that I wasn't analyzing what I was seeing, telling myself that due to laws of physics, I don't believe the ship would withstand such a re-entry.  People it's fiction!  Relax! Enjoy!  That crash is amazing! Well, enough gripes.  What I liked:  Before getting fully involved in the story, I felt the photography was extremely well done.  There were many angles and fades that amounted to an original and artistic feel to the film. I enjoyed the computer animate special effects.  The planets were beautiful and lifelike (please, put the astronomy book down).  The ship crash effects gave the movie great intensity.  The aliens were incredible.  Will I compare them with the original Alien?  No.  You can't compare them, they're completely different.  The aliens in ""Pitch Black"" were excellent!  They were scary, thrilling, and lifelike.  The aliens compounded with the whole ""fear of the dark"" that is within us all made for a suspense filled thriller that conquers all other space movies in it's genre (excluding classics of course, i.e. Alien, Aliens...).  I enjoyed the in-depth character development of not one or two but multiple characters.  All characters are well known and personable by the end of the movie (or at least, by the time of their demise).  All character death scenes are exciting and memorable. I liked the fact that this movie dispelled many pre-held concepts of what horror entails.  By this I mean, in this movie, people die when it's the last thing you expect and more than that, everyone is now a feasible victim; yes folks, children are no longer saved at the last minute.<br/><br/>I don't want to write a thesis (although I easily could on this excellent film) so here are my last couple ideas:  See the movie for what it is.  Watch it for the story - don't over analyze.  The characters (and acting) are extraordinary, the graphics are incredible, the plot is both exciting and interesting, the creatures are scary, and when you least expect it, this movie even throws in some humor.  A Great Movie...watch and enjoy!"

","We begin with the standard view of a ship drifting through space. A voice-over gives us a little background as we're slowly taken into the ship. Comet fragments begin piercing the hull(and one or two people) and the cryogenicly frozen crew is woken. So begins the ship's decent. During that decent the pilot(Mitchell) attempts to jettison the passenger section in order to land safely, but a malfunction prevents her from doing so. Nevertheless, they manage to make a rather ugly emergency landing(played out with awesome visual effects). The Captain is one of the unfortunate souls who dies in the crash. Now that everything's calming down, the passengers begin to assess their situation(not at all promising). Given that the planet has three suns(it's a giant desert, basically), some of them set out looking for water and stumble upon an abandoned mining outpost. A survey turns up no signs of life, just a lot of solar powered machinery and another(functioning) ship. Obviously they have a way off the planet. Kind of odd, though. Why would someone prep an evac ship and then abandon it?<br/><br/>The setup is probably the greatest asset of ""Pitch Black"". A standard Sci-Fi plot, heightened by the pacing of Twohy and a few genuine people mixed in with the fodder, is all it takes to create a good, if unexceptional, Thriller.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the setup is superb, building tension by developing the current and forthcoming situations. For instance, the clues to the miners' disappearing: the final update in the research logs occurring 22yrs ago; the mobile that shows the alignment of the planets to be a 22yr cycle; the preped ship; the numerous animal carcasses scattered about. They all lead one to the conclusion that the miners didn't simply disappear, and that whatever happened 22yrs ago is about to happen again.<br/><br/>The films only major fallback is the hyper-active camera movement of Twohy. I don't know about you, but I got tired of it during the crash, but that's not to say he doesn't do a good job of putting the film together. On the contrary, he paces everything perfectly. He does a wonderful job with the latter half, where all the action is shrouded in darkness. The problem is, he doesn't change his tactics much in the light. Though there are some impressive visuals(kudos to Eggby for the beautiful coloring) Twohy never seems to take full advantage of his landscape. This is just a difference of artistic opinion, though. The only real complaint I have is the sometimes shaky camera work. It's become a trend of the Action genre in recent years and I don't care for it. Used sparingly, it can work, but constant use(like the crash) looks haphazard.<br/><br/>The final examination is of the actors and their characters. To be honest, I don't expect much from this genre in terms of acting, but every once in a while I'm pleasantly surprise. This is one of those times. The majority of the cast is expendable, so their characters aren't given any attention. On the other hand, there's the three leads, Mitchell, Diesel, and Hauser. Mitchell was willing to kill the passengers at the beginning of the film and she's faced with a similar choice later. Diesel plays a murderer who wants to get out alive as much as everyone else. It's not the typical ""bad guy turned good guy"" scenario we've seen countless times before. Instead, we have man who's struggling with the idea of leaving the rest of them to die, or risking his own life and it's not as predictable as you'd think. Last, we have Hauser, a drug addicted bounty hunter who's caught Diesel after chasing him for years. Their history will come into play, as well.<br/><br/>All together, ""Pitch Black"" is worth at least a matinee viewing. If nothing else you're going to enjoy it. Good Sci-Fi films are rare these days and it'd be a shame to miss this one."

","This movie was more entertaining than I expected.  The basic premise -- a starship runs into trouble, crash lands on an alien planet, and the crew is eaten one-by-one by the locals -- is hardly original, but the execution is good and the result doesn't feel cliched.  The movie maintains tension throughout and manages to shock occasionally, something horror movies often find hard to do these days.<br/><br/>The characters are more interesting and have a little more depth than usual. Radha Mitchell does a good job of conveying the vulnerability of the pilot, though she does seem a little miscast at times (isn't she a little too, well, blond for this kind of movie?).  Vin Diesel has a lot of on-screen charisma, although his character is a too unflappable to convey the emotion that would have made the ending stronger.  Nevertheless, I thought it worked.  Perhaps the director didn't want the movie to be /too/ dark.<br/><br/>I could quibble about the world conveyed here -- why, for example, is there a breathable amount of oxygen in the air without plants or seas to maintain it?  What do all the predators eat?  And what do they do in-between eclipses -- watch cable TV?  Why does that gas giant have two sets of rings and how does the second one stay in orbit at a higher latitude (not inclination) than the equator?  (Or did I miss-see something in the effects?)  That said, this movie still doesn't strain credulity the way others have.  The visual and lighting effects convey an effective sense of being on another planet (as opposed to, say, being in Queensland Australia).  The aliens are mercifully unhumanoid and even appear to have complex behaviors other eating starship crewmen.<br/><br/>So if the previews for ""Mission to Mars"" had you psyched for an SF movie, skip that one and go to this instead -- you'll be less likely to be disappointed.  I actually felt like seeing it a second time, though at $8.50, it's hard to justify."

That makes it really difficult not to compare it to Aliens.  The fact that these critter seem to like the dark allows you to draw even more parallels.  But think a moment:  What would *your* story feature?  Would you buy a race of hyper-intelligent purple cabbages that always sit out in the open and kill people?  Nah.  Didn't think so.  So, make it dark, make them bug-looking. It is a cheap scare, but it always works.  Deal with it.<br/><br/>So, that off my chest, I went into this movie with pretty low expectations. It is usually safer that way.  But I was treated to a multifaceted movie featuring survival against a barren planet, survival against a dangerous night, and survival against your cutthroat peers.  There's a bit of over-played not-so-good guy versus bad guy with-a-heart-of-gold kind of things going on, that smack of an morning soap opera, of course.<br/><br/>But I really enjoyed the two-in-one movie theme.  I was sort of dismayed when the Gilligan's Island remake was over, and the movie became yet another bump-in-the-night horror film. But then, the horror film aspect wasn't bad.<br/><br/>
All in all, I came away feeling pretty good about the movie.<br/><br/>

Anyone who paid attention in school can hopefully interpret what they see on the screen, and see how much thought David Twohy and the other writers put in to how these creatures would evolve in such an environment, and how the rest of the planet-- visiting humans, or otherwise-- would react.<br/><br/>So the premise isn't 100% believable, but that's a nitpicky excuse from someone who doesn't know what they're talking about.  Humans can't travel between solar systems, EITHER, but no one thought to comment on THAT.  It's a freakin' movie folks, certain things have to be accepted.  This ship is going from Planet A to Planet B, and they crashed on a planet that has comparable gravity and atmosphere to Earth, and it's got 3 suns.  Stranger things happen on Star Trek and I don't see a single negative comment THERE... heck, it's even more improbable that an Alien (1979) could have acid for blood, but everyone bought that without batting an eyelash.<br/><br/>Ignore the Nitpicky comments you see on this site.

","Just got back from seeing this film, and I have absolutely no qualms about stating that this is thinking person's sci-fi on the order of the first two ""Alien"" movies and the original ""The Thing."" Anyone expecting escapist stuff in the manner of the ""Star Wars"" and later ""Star Trek"" films would do well to stay away. This is not for the faint of either heart or stomach!<br/><br/>All of the performances stand out, but the two leads are what really hold this film together. Male lead Vin Diesel is alternately terrifying and sympathetic as the not-as-bad-as-he- seems ex-con who becomes a hero in spite of himself. Radha Mitchell is the gutsy lady pilot who is initially repelled by Diesel yet comes to eventually rely on him. While there's never even a hint of romance between the two, you can see the chemistry between them almost from the beginning. And Cole Hauser is Johns, the suitably smarmy villain of the piece, who eventually gets his cumuppance at the hands of the space aliens. These aliens, by the way, are almost always seen in shadow, being nocturnal creatures. One wonders what they'd look like in broad daylight. Chances are, one wouldn't want to know.<br/><br/>I won't give away the double surprise of an ending. I'll just say that this is the best edge-of-your-seat sci-fi to come along in many a year. And even if you're not a sci-fi buff, you owe it to yourself to see this film for some first-rate suspense."

","The joke goes that in a G rated movie, the good guy gets the girl while in a R rated movie, it's the bad guy.  In a X rated movie, everyone gets the girl.  Which leads us in a quandary about ""Pitch Black"" where no one gets the girl.  The film models itself after scary movies from the past, notably the first ""Alien"" and the earlier classics, ""The Birds"" and ""Day of the Triffids"".  But ""Pitch Black"", for all its inventiveness and original ratchet sounds, is no more than a slight thriller because it never intended to aim any higher.  Oh, there is some religious theme if you buy the Muslim father figure who still sees God in a mucked up world and there is the loyalty of a reluctant starship commander named Fry (Radha Mitchell) to her companions.  But basically this is a film to sit back to get frighten by and to figure out who will survive at the end.  It helps that a certain figure named Riddick (Vin Diesel) comes with night vision eyes because the eclipse will render everything unsafe. And that a barren planetary outpost has just the necessary props to fit the plot.  The ending, while unexpected, is in keeping with a film that is, first and foremost, out to scare you.  Anything else is just not in the cards."

","While not being the best or most original movie, I really feel this movie has been unfairly lambasted by critics. There's a ton of cool effects, the characters are not one-dimensional as a whole, and there's some dark humor to keep things going. I think that as long as you buy into the horror formula of that when you think things can't get any worse, they do, and don't mind the fact that it's a little derivative of its predecessors, you're going to have a good time. Incidentally, without giving anything away, I think the movie does break one cardinal rule of the genre towards the end - I think you'll know what I mean when you see it."

","During the past few years, an alarming trend of movies with respectable cast lists, massive special effects budgets, and little or no plot has swept through the Hollywood scene. Such examples include ""Godzilla,"" ""Star Wars: The Phantom Menace,"" and the recent example of cinematic stupidity, ""Supernova."" Those who felt completely ripped off by ""Supernova"" should go to see ""Pitch Black.""  The ""Pitch Black"" experience will remove the sour taste left by ""Supernova."" In an age where character development has been all but forgotten, ""Pitch Black"" returns to us our ability to develop a kinship (or in some cases, disgust) toward the actors on the screen.  Another selling point for this movie is a genuine trace of realism; although the story doesn't necessarily turn out the way you'd like it to, it concludes in a way that is believable and reasonable, with just a hint of Romanticism.  Vin Diesel, Rhada Mitchell, and Keith David are superb. All in all, an extreme movie experience for any fan of the ""Alien"" series or ""Starship Troopers.""  If you enjoy Sci-Fi movies that will keep you on the edge of your seat, you'll love ""Pitch Black."""

","This was a film I enjoyed a little when I sat thought it. It's about a travel plane in I think 2020 that crashes on a planet with 3 suns. After that happens all heck breaks loose. Its an obvious rip off of Alien. There's no question at that but it's not a good one either. The style in the way the film is presented is very cool. The camera angels and the color get you into the film but it uses over done Sci-fi horror cliques that have been over done for years. The dark scenes, jump moments, no music just silence and bad alien special effects. The performances are not that well done and the violence is either not seen or clearly fake. The one good thing to come out of this film is Vin Diesel. He's great as a prisoner being transfer named Riddick. He just commands and steals every scene he's in. This guy is the next Arnold or Sly or maybe better than both. Get him some bad guys, guns and a good director and we've got the action hero for the Y2K.

Also, good special effects in parts--namely a mesmorising shot of the aliens first coming out during the eclipse.  The coloured camera filters get sort of anoying, but a nice try at something different, and more  accurate.<br/><br/>Then there was the dialogue. One liners galore.

","I would have been much happier than I was after seeing this film.  This is the worst time of the year for movies.  Right after Christmas and before the Oscars.  All the movies being released now are slotted at this time of year for a reason;  the films are weak and would be no competition for the holiday or summer blockbusters, but you'd probably go see something new before shelling out cash to see the re-release of the Oscar nominated pictures.  Pitch Black fits perfectly into this category. <br/><br/>
At this time of year, I'm an easy mark.  It has been almost a month since I saw a movie at the theatre.  That's an eternity! Anything halfway decent would probably get high marks.  Pitch Black is not halfway decent.<br/><br/>
The premise is actually interesting, and has some possibilities. Simply put, a band of space travelers are stranded when their ship crashes.  The suggestion can be inferred that the dangerous criminal, Riddick (Vin Diesel) that is being escorted may have caused the crash in an attempt to escape.<br/><br/>Once on the planet, the people discover that the place has no life and almost looks deserted.  It's not until one of the people is killed and they get past the obvious suspicion of Riddick do we get down to the meat of plot.  There's something dangerous lurking in the caves below the surface. Things get really serious when it's determined that an eclipse is about to take place and that the creatures will have free reign once darkness envelops the surface.<br/><br/>I won't take you much further.  Getting to this point took almost an hour, and from this point on things go down hill.  The film then takes on the standard serial killer formula.  The heroes try to fend off the killer but he's getting them one by one.<br/><br/>No one gives any kind of notable performance, and the story quickly loses any plausibility that it may have had.  Keith David has a part in the film, and the most entertaining for us was saying ""Franks and Beans"" at inappropriate moments in reference to his role in Something About Mary.<br/><br/>All I can say is thank goodness this was free.  I can watch just about anything for free.  Don't blow your hard earned money at the theatre on this one.  It stinks..."

The creatures are interesting, and I like the idea that they only exist in total darkness.  Rahda Mitchell is gutsy and resourseful as Fry, and as I said before, Diesel is primed to be the next big action hero.

I'm curious about how they did the special effect of the character...the eyes are quite interesting, and some of the contortions made me wonder if he was actually doing that or if it was special effects. The character itself has a very nice, dark sense of humor; and the interaction between him and Fry was, to me, almost pivotal to the movie.<br/><br/>He was the type of character I would love to see more of, past the story on the planet. I'm curious if the actor is good in his other movies also.

And I didn't consider Riddick evil, necessarily, either...underneath it all he was human, someone who may not have the same moral values as society is 'supposed' to have, but who did what he had to survive and prosper, in some very harsh circumstances.<br/><br/>Altogether, a very pleasing flick...and one that I may just pay for again."

The actors and their dialogue are all competent, with Vin Diesel (Saving Private Ryan) almost single-handedly elevating the film to greatness as an escaped convict being transported by the authorities (His character, Riddick, is one of the most memorable bad guys I can think of). The movie also ends in an unexpected way that manages to humanize some of the characters without seeming overly cheesy.<br/><br/>The Bad: No matter how sound of a plot this film has, it all boils down to a group of isolated humans being stalked by carnivorous monsters, just like in a thousand other movies. Some of the sets (The prospector villages and the 'skiff') are pretty flimsy looking. Some of the technical details (How did the ship crash in the first place? How do the creatures survive by just eating each other? Why did they grow from being bat-sized to elephant-size all of a sudden? What kind of a dumbass drinks whiskey in a desert underneath 3 suns?) might irritate plot dissectors like me.<br/><br/>All in all, I like sci-fi and hate movies that give it a bad name.

The basic plot has a couple of good themes (the animals are cannibalistic, which kind of reminds you of the humans - also there is kind of a question of whether the characters, or humans in general, are good at heart or not), 2 pretty decent characters (the ""pilot"" and the criminal).  So, the plan was there.  The execution was just flat out awful.<br/><br/>----All this movie needed was someone to write dialogue, which really is what defines a movie.  Some of the lines are just so awful you can sometimes see the actors force them out of their mouth against their own will. Riddick has a line at the end that is pretty much the line Eddie Murphy was searching for in ""Bowfinger.""  It's supposed to be like Arnold saying ""I'll be back,"" but I hope to never see this guy again.<br/><br/>----The specific plot is pretty bad as well.  There are always some characters that you know are going to die in movies, but just once I would like to see the ""British antique collector"" character not act like an idiot who deserves to die.<br/><br/>----This movie had so much potential to be an excellent movie, but when the writers got down and dirty they came up empty, and they really missed the boat.

Sure the first alien film made me jump the first time I saw it, but for me it will never be as good as the first time. As for aliens well it was little more than an action film, not that that is bad but the horror aspect was completely lost. Bringing me back to Pitch Black and what makes it such a good film. The one thing that scares us all when outside at night and we hear a sound. We strain our eyes to see what unknown evil lies waiting in the darkness. That is what makes this film special and keeps your attention. In alien you knew it was somewhere in the shadows and you waited for it to pop out so someone could shoot it. Pitch Black's characters only have the defense of what little light they come up with and you know at the edge of that light the creatures lurking surrounding, watching, waiting at fuzzy area where your straining eyes can barely see the outline of their movement."

Spoilers ahead !!! do not read if you haven't seen the movie yet).<br/><br/>Has anyone else thought over that last scene when Fry came to the rescue of Riddick despite the advice of the two remaining characters. She finds him injured and bleeding from his fighting off the two creatures. Then she grabs him, helps him up and then what happens??? He cuts her and makes her bleed with his knife-like weapon. He makes her bleed to set her as a bait to attract the creatures away from him (also injured and bleeding), he cut her open to save himself, and get enough time to get to the ship. This scheme was debated earlier between him and the bounty hunter, and there were numerous references by Riddick on how the creatures could now easily track human blood. This adds to the movie in a much darker tone and a sizeable ethical dilemma. And it is much more in tune with the character of Riddick and his superhuman sense of survival that would have made him take the decision to sacrifice Fry who came to try and rescue him. Riddick is the most beautifully defined character I have seen in an action movie in over a decade, his sheer charisma can easily make someone forget about his underlying ethics and cold-bloodedness.

I really enjoyed Deep Blue Sea, and that was an incredibly derivative film. Here's what it really is. The trailers trick you into thinking its a sci-fi movie, the director tries to make a Kubrick-like drama, and it is in reality just boring.<br/><br/>The film starts out with a chaotic scene of the ship crashing, which, in addition to being really stupid, also shows off the terrible acting of the actors involved. So I'm like, ok, but soon somethings going to happen. So the ship crashes and they mull around for awhile, but I know something is going to happen. About 10 more things happen (or un-happen, in which they occur but they're so stupid or uninteresting you dont care), and by this time you've lost interest. Throw in some stupid plot twists to keep everyone from falling asleep, and its over.<br/><br/>I will admit that the only thing that saves this film are the cool special effects. The aliens are pretty damn cool, and Riddics night vision is also neat as well. This accounts for about 8 minutes of the movie, and are the only parts worth seeing. Try to appreciate this film as a stupid action movie and you cant because its too boring and takes itself very seriously. Try to appreciate it as drama(like some other reviewers on IMDB) and you cant because its done poorly and in a fragmented,stupid way.

I must admit that I was more than pleasantly surprised after I saw Pitch Black. My first thought upon sitting down in the theatre was that the 3 or so movie previews that I saw would have summed up the best parts in the movie, but not in this case. The movie doesnt fall prey to starting slowly and ending quickly as most Space thrillers do (Before you shake your head no, think of the last couple space movies you saw...zzzzz) Pitch Black jumps you right into the action.. Good performances by a virtually unknown cast (at least to me). With the exception of Vin Diesel and Keith David, I didnt much recognize many of the other thespians' roles in movies except for some bit parts. The movie has some excellent special effects but doesnt fall prey to overusing them like in Event Horizon or (to a lesser extreme) Supernova.

"niteman","7","0","0","27 February 2000"," Oops -- WOW! -- Oops.
","Pitch Black opens with a long, slo-mo shot of a spaceship gliding by the camera.  Oops #1: obvious Star Wars rip-off.  It then presents us with a most improbable crash scene, in which the force of the landing blows out the ship's windshield but leaves the pilot remarkably unscathed.  Oops #2.  The crash scene is edited with MTV-on-Speed cuts, which are both impossible to follow and headache-inducing.  Oops #3.  By the time the spaceship actually touched down, I was regretting losing $4 on this movie.<br/><br/>Fortunately, things pick up speed in the middle.  The visuals are gorgeous -- our heroes are on a planet with three suns, and the scenes are filmed in gorgeous washed-out blue and gold tones.  The deceptively calm surface of the planet serves as a backdrop for introducing and fleshing out characters, who are all given more depth than your average cheap sci-fi cast.  The tension climaxes with a gorgeous triple eclipse and the awakening of the underground dwellers of the planet, who look like a cross between Ridley Scott's Alien and a hammerhead shark.  As the characters scurried around huddling behind their meager and failing light sources, bickering with each other, the suspense was thick enough that it was hard to breathe.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the last half hour abandons any notion of story arc or plot in favor of killing of characters at random and twisting the plot in improbable directions.  The most interesting character, Vin Diesel's hulking homicidal maniac, is reduced to arm-wrestling the aliens and spouting Batman and Robin quality dialog.  By the last twist and the by-the-numbers ending, I was disappointed in the movie again.<br/><br/>Out of the movie's two hours, the middle hour is great and the surrounding hour is average to horrid.  50% is generally an F, but for the great visuals I'll give it a C."
"Uthman","6","0","0","27 February 2000"," Great production design; uninteresting plot
","We haven't seen a really fine sci-fi flick in the better part of a year (since THE MATRIX [1999]), so my expectations were rather high for this one. After all, one of my sci-fi faves, THE ARRIVAL (1996), was made by the same director. While the cinematography and production design are excellent and even plow new fields of creativity, the all-important plot is just a monsters-in-the-dark rehash. The skillful editing gives the film a nice artistic edge, but sometimes it is so jumpy that it is impossible to follow what is going on. Still, the crash scene at the beginning of the film is outstanding, perhaps the best crash scene in sci-fi cinema to date, the relatively low budget notwithstanding.<br/><br/>The film flirts with scientific plausibility, but deviances therefrom are jarring. For one thing, an eclipsing gas giant would not be dark against a bright sky. Since the brightness of the sky is a nearby phenomenon due to light scattering by the atmosphere, all you would see of the eclipsing object, if anything, would be a thin crescent, and perhaps some highlights from the rings, as slightly brighter structures against the sky. From a biologist's standpoint, the ecology of a planet that supports a substantial biomass of large predators with little or no vegetation makes no sense. Doesn't anyone ever think about these things?"
"SFMC-2","10","0","0","25 February 2000"," ""Scary movie"" ain't the half of it.
","Trying to outdo any or all of the Alien trilogy is a daunting task for any movie. Pitch Black takes a different tack, spinning the underlying mythform into a fresh, sexy thriller that leaves you reeling from moment to moment.<br/><br/>The most spectacular success of Pitch Black is the cinematography. Clear, superbright shots of the band of survivors are intercut with cool, danger-filled shadowy caves and buildings, and the pervasive heat and light is so perfectly captured by David Eggby you can feel yourself sweat in sympathy.<br/><br/>David Twohy makes deft use of a time-honored thriller/horror movie technique: hiding the killers as much as possible to heighten the eventual terror of seeing them revealed. In Pitch Black, the killers are huge, nearly silent aliens which hunt the darkness with sonar (another brilliantly translated visual by Twohy and Eggby).<br/><br/>Unlike the usual Sci/Fi fodder, Pitch Black's band of heroes are effectively weaponless, unskilled, and burdened by a host of liabilities, not least of which is the oncoming total eclipse and an escaped murderer in their midst. They rally as best they can, given the massively stacked odds against them, but real triumph of the movie comes not at the climax, but short seconds before, when the (uneaten) characters' development becomes fully realized. This is a movie not about spacers, nor terrible aliens, but about the horrible decisions we all make and their even more horrific consequences. For all its stunning beauty, the setting and circumstances are almost trifling next to the astounding acting and conviction of the cast.<br/><br/>Some of the best acting comes from Radha Mitchell and Vin Diesel, as Fry and Riddick, respectively. Fry, a cargo pilot, third in command, has leadership thrust upon her after a devastating accident and crash leaves her ship scattered over a mile-long track of debris. Riddick, an escaped criminal, escapes from his confines during the crash, and proceeds to wreak havoc with the other survivors until he is captured and pressed into service as an equal by his jailer, a mercenary named Johns. Mitchell and Diesel are utterly believable in their roles, one a ragged but determined savior, the other a bemused and savage killer. Diesel is particularly enjoyable to watch as he plays the quintessential evil villain to the hilt, terrorizing the others until the discovery of the more deadly and savage resident monsters. After that, he's merely the most bad-ass human being on the planet, a role Riddick seems to enjoy.<br/><br/>Sadly, the bulk of the cast fades into the background (or is killed messily) within the first half hour, and the audience can't really begin to care about the remaining characters until the final minutes of the film. This distancing works magnificently with the storyline which builds the action to an intolerably tense level before releasing the audience's tension in a brutal and gory climax. The point at which you begin to want the characters to live, their lives become inordinately imperiled. It's an elegant blend, and the cast is clearly up for the challenge.<br/><br/>See Pitch Black before it leaves theaters...it's too big a movie to appreciate on a television."

","Truth to be told, I went into ""Pitch Black"" unsure of what to expect.  I'd read a couple of reviews in the paper, largely forgotten shortly thereafter, and naturally seen the previews and ads.  Given how movies have disappointed in the past, these days I go into theatres with as few expectations as possible.<br/><br/>I was thoroughly impressed by this movie.<br/><br/>In the tradition of Aliens, Predator, and the like, Pitch Black makes a fine addition to the genre.  All such films share some common factors -- unknown beasties, a limited area in which to move, and people getting killed off in sundry nasty ways.  But although the basis is similar, the plot and implementation was still impressive.  The cinematography and imagery were superb, the acting excellent, and the special effects impressive.  (My primary concern with effects-generated beasties is whether or not you can tell it was effects-generated, that is, does it look like a Harryhausen stop-motion beast.  Pitch Black passed that test with flying colours.)<br/><br/>I have to give a nod to Vin Diesel, who probably was a significant part of why this film was as good as it was.  Each of the main characters had their flaws nonetheless, Vin stands out above the rest of the pack, and not merely in physical stature (though that certainly was a part of it).  In sheer presence and in deeds his was the character that had the audience's attention.  The entire theater was clapping and cheering at one point!<br/><br/>This movie portrays an interesting trinity of protagonists and how they react to the situation they've been placed in.  The ""taste"" of the movie, if you can consider it so, was savory and thick.  It's certainly the best sci-fi movie I've seen since ""The Matrix"" -- ""The Phantom Menace"" was shallow and ephemeral, ""Galaxy Quest"" was decent but too much of a satire to find a place in my memory, ""eXistenZ"" was too bizarre, ""The Astronaut's Wife"" possessed of a weak storyline, ""The 13th Floor"" not bad, but too predictable- you get the picture.  And let's not even talk about ""Supernova"".<br/><br/>The only real difficulty I had with it was the choppy editing during the first 20 minutes or so.  A few more moving shots, used to emphasise transitions, would have upped my rating that final point.<br/><br/>Overall:  9/10."

The creatures were mediocre, the acting was atrocious, and the plot was weak.  I did, however, think that the movie was effective.  The point of a movie is to make you empathize with the characters, and as one of my friends pointed out, we, like the characters in the movie, were hoping that we also would soon see light.

","Is it scary? No, not really. Everyone who dies is pretty much set up to die so when they do buy it you aren't surprised too much. Most are doing something stupid when they do: not staying down, looking in tunnels (when will folks learn?) or running away from the light, for example. You always needs a few of these type deaths but a good grab from the pitch black might have helped too. Are the effects good? Well, kinda. The aliens are pretty free form. There appear to be three varieties: bats, pterodactyls and ground based critters that move too much like the Alien. The right one always seems to be about to make the kill required by the cast member stupidity. When you see them they look o.k. but don't really challenge the genre too much since they do look rather Alien-eque. Characters? Well let's not pretend this matters in a good ole aliens eating people film but these aren't very good at all. Vin Diesel has been praised but this is an easy role to nail and the other characters are mostly flat with stupid attempts at depth: he's an Islamic cleric not a priest (yawn), he's a bounty-hunter with a drug habit (yawn). None of these wrinkles make a lick of plot difference. Plot? Does it make any sense. No. First, struggle to imagine the evolutionary path that creates rabid, photo-sensitive, multitudinous predators on a planet that is pure light for 22 years in a row and has no visble prey items. Ignore that and then try and figure how as little light as the crew has keeps these things at bay. A Jack Daniels bottle used as a torch? This fear of the light seems to kind of come and go being more or less at needed plot moments. Throw in a few twists that don't matter (spoiler): one of the boys is actually a girl...oooh and its pretty silly. Pay a dollar and yuck it up some but don't waste full price on this."

We learn a little about each character, but not much, and never do find out the answers to the rest of the questions. This really weakens the movie, there is no character development at all, except maybe with Riddick.  The acting was above par, especially considering the small-name talent in the film. I can definitely see Vin Diesel becomming a big action star if that is the route he chooses to go. The special effects were pretty good, but they didn't entirely make up for a lack of screen play. I'm wondering why any studio bit on this, just based on the story, because it's a pretty weak one, with very little good dialogue.. they visually covered that up, but that's not enough for me.<br/><br/>I give this movie a 3.5 out of 10.. it could have been much much better, but it falls flat. I'd be interested to see the DVD, to see if anything got cut, as i have a feeling it must have."

","The opening sequence was very good. Lots of action. Then there were many hungry aliens in total darkness, and a group of people tried hard to stay alive. Very good performance by Radha Mitchell (Fry). She's quite cute, so the entire movie I was hoping she wouldn't become someone's dinner. As for Vin Diesel (Riddick), he plays a hardcore criminal who killed many people, but he looks and acts like a teddy bear. Someone you want your daughter to marry. That was a big minus, I think. Also, lots of profanity spoken by small kids. I was sort of offended by that. It wasn't as gross as in Bullworth, but still was absolutely unnecessary. The bottom line: it ain't ""Alien,"" but if you want to see good special effects and get a little scared, and you don't mind mindless profanity, I recommend this movie to you"

","By now, everyone knows this is part of the Alien ""Puny Human"" genre, where a group of people are forced to face an alien threat of the like never seen before. The difference here is that the director worked hard to get everything he could out of the limited budget. The nerve-wrackingly desolate landscapes are effectively turned into purely claustrophobic corridors of dark by what has to be the most spectacular eclipse scene ever in cinema. The special effects are either subtle or over the top, but they always achieve the effect on the audience the director wanted. Despite limited dialogue, the actors throw themselves right into character, explaining nothing that they can't demonstrate with their performance. Vin Diesel, in particular, makes himself an irresistably fascinating amoral predator, who deals with everyone at face value.<br/><br/>What really impressed me, however, is that there were no flamethrowers. In his illustrations for Species, H.R. Giger kept scribling notes saying ""no flamethrowers"", which were ignored. In fact, the flamethrower has become the worst cliche of the whole Alien genre, appearing everywhere from undersea mining facilities to L.A. sewers. Pitch Black avoids this crutch, impressive since flamethrowers would be doubly useful for the night-blind survivors fighting albino predators. The whole crew worked hard on this film, avoiding cheap tricks like this, and it shows."

","One word can sum up my ""Pitch Black"" experience at the movies this past weekend. Dreadful. This movie suffers from a severe lack of talented actors/actresses and the script seems to have been written by a 9th grader with a potty mouth. The only thing that saves this film is the visuals. The landscapes, ships, and other planets all look amazing. The biggest treat here is the aliens themselves. Unfortunately they don't get enough screen time. The movie's not a total loss, but USA Films should stick to their tv movies (which still suck, but at least you don't have to pay to see them)."

","Pitch Black: A ship of interstellar colonists has their plans changed when they pass through the tail of a wayward comet.  They crash-land on a barren planet, with three suns, and no life, or at least that's what they're led to believe.  With an eclipse on the way, a killer on the loose and some scary creatures who come out only at night, things don't bode well for our heroes.<br/><br/>I was impressed with the before-the-eclipse cinematography - the landscape was stark, blinding and essentially monochromatic, creating a feeling of desolation and desperation (I know I wouldn't want to be stuck there under any circumstances).  Second, the opening sequence is extremely well done - from the howling winds to the wild debris - the viewer feels like they are in the cockpit with the crew.   I also enjoyed Vin Diesel's performance as the murderer with a conscience.  Unfortunately, the movie never recaptures its momentum and becomes increasingly insipid. What exactly are the odds that you would crash-land on a planet with three suns, with a killer that can see in the dark the day before a total solar eclipse (that occurs once every two decades) engulfs the planet.  I'm guessing slim to none.  To make matters worse, the monsters, are without a doubt, the worst waste of computer animation I have ever seen.  Who dreamed up these walking anvils with teeth? I found them laughable rather than terrifying.  Finally, the ending was contrived and anti-climactic. <br/><br/>

It means this film isn't completely dedicated to please everyone, but does have enough going for it to elicit strong reactions one way or the other.<br/><br/>I for one enjoyed it very much.  I thought the cinematography was beautiful. I loved the washed-out over-exposed look on the planet's surface.  This section of the move reminded me of the Alien planet scenes in ""The Man Who Fell to Earth.""  I also thought the night scenes were done very well.  The faint glow of torches and the like was handled beautifully.<br/><br/>Another thing that made this movie stronger than most SF you see these days is the wonderful characterization.  I like the fact that nobody in this movie was a perfect character. In fact, everyone in the film is pretty flawed.  I liked the acting quite a bit.  There were quite a few good performances in this movie; Vin Diesel being the stand out.  In fact, he was amazing.  His performance contributed to what I think is the most fully realized SF film character since...hell I don't know. Great.<br/><br/>I know this review is rambling, so I'll cut it short.  What I didn't like about it is that I thought the script was confused about what kind of movie it should be.  Should it be a more character driven piece or more of an actioner.  It tried to split the difference and didn't quite work.  I thought the dialog was very good for this type of thing, and I really liked the little chracter quirks.  I just wanted to either see a little more menace from the creatures, or more of the groups self destruction.

The washed out colors was particularly annoying to me. The absolute stupidity of some of the characters was beyond belief.The alien like monsters that could fly were acceptably competent as sinister adversaries but the story was extremely plodding and there were not enough scary scenes. The cinematography was not very well done. There was grade B movie dialogue executed poorly and with an accent of some sort. The special effect that you saw when the creatures were viewing the victims was tiresome and cheesy. Before people knew what an eclipse was here on earth they thought the end of the world as they knew it had happened. In this film even though most of the characters died at the hands of the malevolent creatures I still felt it was boring in comparison with other films of this genre. I can say that I found this a very unsatisfactory film on many levels but most of all was that it was not that scary. The only really powerful force in the movie was the character played by Vin Diesel. I believe he will be a force in future movies."

Don't worry though, this only happens for maybe 20 seconds and doesn't detract from the movie one bit.  Pitch Black is non-stop action from the minute you see the USA films logo appear on the screen.  Vin Diesel plays one of the best characters I have seen in a movie since Ray Park played Darth Maul in The Phantom Menace last year.

In this case, this movie can't help but be compared to Alien and Starship Troopers, and in some ways, Jurassic Park.

"chuckzilla","8","0","0","20 February 2000"," Worth seeing on the big screen.(minor spoilers)
","I know that there are many comparisons to the film ""ALIENS"" being mentioned by other commentors, and rightly so since the premise is very similar: small band of people vs. hostile life forms. So I bet your saying ""seen one, seen 'em all"". Well don't be quick to judge this movie. There are a lot of different elements that come into play that I think work well to keep you on edge and guessing.<br/><br/>You probably already know the plot so I'll skip that part. The opening crash landing of the Hunter-Gratzner is well done. All the characters come together to take stock in their situation. Right at this point, their biggest concerns are finding water and the escaped criminal Riddick. Very soon it becomes apparent that Riddick is the least of their worries.<br/><br/>I 'm not going to disclose anymore story details because I think that anything else would take away the question of ""what do they do now?""<br/><br/>
I liked the characters and appreciated the little twists of ""appearances can be deceiving"" atmosphere that slowly developes. Even Vin Diesel's character of Riddick could easily be played over the top in so many different ways - to the point of annoying distraction - but that doesn't happen. You'll end up liking him without a doubt.<br/><br/>The SFX is about what you would expect for a movie of this type. The planet's indigenous life forms are mostly CGI rendered and I think were designed by Patrick Tatapolous - of GODZILLA fame. They are nasty creatures and with the addition of lightning fast speed, they have voracious appetites for crash survivors. My only complaint about the movie is:<br/><br/>{SPOILER ALERT}<br/><br/>There are thousands of these creatures out roaming the planet during the eclipse. At first, they are always near and harassing the survivors, but later - they aren't even around for the many times that a survivor puts themselves into a position where they are vulnerable to attack. It seemed a little inconsistent to me. This was probably due to the fact that there were several ongoing character conflicts that were adding to the tension. In a way, this made the threat of the creatures less significant to me, and less scary as well. When I think of ""terror in the dark"" I think of scenes like in the movie THE RESURRECTED where the dark dungeon swallows up the light and conceals the real danger until it jumped out at you. To me, I don't think that movie played with the basic human emotion of fear of the dark - enough.<br/><br/>{END SPOILER}<br/><br/>Other than that, I enjoyed everything else. I also loved the fact that the film was 2 hours long. It seems like lately 90 to 100 minutes was all that people were making.<br/><br/>On a scale of 1-10, I give this an 8. ""More scary"" would have given it a 10 (but it's close)"

I must say that the movie wasn't exactly scary, but the acting wasn't either.<br/><br/>The thing that stood out most were the great ""breakthrough"" performances by Vin Diesel and Radha Mitchell.  Both played believeable characters and seemed to mesh well with each other.  Be sure to look for these two in future performances like Vin in ""Knockabout Guys"" and ""Boiler Room"" out in theaters at the same release time as this picture, and Radha in ""Anasazi Moon"" or ""Everything Put Together.""  Although some of the antics were unrealistic, I will agree that there were a few good one liners.<br/><br/>As for the storyline... Jim and Ken Wheat don't give you much to work with when it comes to background or explicit details, and try point you straight toward the action.  As for action... the special effects team scored an 'A' in my book.  Some of the digital effects were simply amazing.  The effects that stood out most in my mind were at the beginning of the movie, when the crew's spaceship crash lands.

I thought he was excellent in his portrayal of an amoral murderer going through a metamorphosis...becoming someone with a consience.  If you go to this movie looking for a high tech thriller then don't go see this movie.  If you want to go to a movie to see solid characterizations of people stranded on a planet with little water, few weapons, and a pretty ferocious predator stalking everyone after dark then this is the movie for you.  Some scenes were predictably pat i.e., Riddick grabs one of the creatures before it can get him...you know one predator against another?  Other scenes were rather riveting i.e., Riddick tries to convince Fry to just get on the transport and leave the others behind.  Some aspects of this movie do evoke images from the movie ""Alien"" (the first one) such as sounds and atmosphere (remember the clinking chains in Alien?).

","Have we all slipped so far that we fail to acknowledge actual meanings in movies? Have we forgotten that not all movies (specifically sci-fi movies) are restricted simply to tell a story? I think we have had too many films that are simply that-just a story (be it simple kid stuff like Independence Day or even ""adult"" stuff as .say, The Boiler Room).no actual theme. We thought that meanings and ideas are only conveyed in silly pseudo-intellectual [inmho, anyway] spike lee type movies. Well, I for one applaud Point Black for being that different-a deeper film with monster-action visuals that seems to distract most. Watching story-only movies has caused us to forget to actually even realize that there is a deeper meaning in a movie we watch.especially a ""silly"" science fiction movie.<br/><br/>Well, simply put, I believe this is one of the best science fiction movies (if not movie period) to come along in a while. I simply love the characterizations that were shown...how we see actual growth. The characters are not all that they were or what they were portrayed to be in the beginning. The central characters are all vividly depicted, and with exception to the obvious monster-fodder, we actually feel content with how they mature. I guess what I liked is how the archetypal roles (the leader, the gun-toting hero, the bad guy, the idiot, et al) of like monster movies weren't always who you pegged them to be in Pitch Black. Anyway.I really like THE major growth of Fry and Riddick. I like how it all came full circle for her especially.<br/><br/>And again, while there were the obvious monster-fodder, the film completely lends itself as an ensemble movie that instills the idea that each castaway was important. Because of this, I think the casting of relative unknowns was in fact justified. A review I read referenced John Carpenter's Thing remake as correlating to this idea of the characters not being expendable, as they most often are in like movies.<br/><br/>There were comparisons to Mimic and Leviathan.but I don't believe those comparisons were justified. Again, I believe those comparisons are an example how the setting and the visuals were in fact distracting. I'm not saying the visuals weren't bad in the least, or even anything less of great. but I'm thinking people focused on that and only saw that alone. In my humble opinion, they could have taken away the spaceships, the monsters, the aliens, the surgically enhanced night vision eyes.and it still would have been the same movie to me. It could have easily been set on Mt. Everest with a modern-day plane crash, instead of a wayward spaceship, and it wouldn't have been a different movie. I resent the invalidation of this film as being just an Alien-type movie.<br/><br/>Well, basically, Pitch Black had the old idea of survival, with an incredible, interesting  and refreshing portrayal. Despite others' ignorance of the long lost art of character development in a special effects movie, I whole heatedly recommend this film."
"RBongo","6","0","0","21 February 2000"," Pitch Black is salvaged by some excellent ideas and Vin Diesel!
","I have just gotten back from my local multiplex and after seeing it all I can say is that before seeing it, recognize that what you are about to see is no sci-fi classic.  That being said, it's also important to note that Pitch Black is still a very entertaining ride, even if you don't remember why you liked it after the film.<br/><br/>This film, directed by David Twohy (The Arrival), has a very good concept but it is executed in a way that makes the film fall below what it should have been.  The film has an odd mix of trying to flesh out each and every one of the characters while trying to keep the momentum of the film going.  Suffice it to say, that doesn't work to well, at least not in the context of this film.<br/><br/>Unfortunately I missed the first ten minutes of the movie, due to the fact that I was in line picking up a large soda, who knows those 10 minutes might affect my review, but I doubt it.  When I got into the theatre, the main vessel carrying the cast of this film had just crash-landed onto a barren planet and the passengers were just noticing their surroundings. It appears that the ship was carrying passengers to the ""New Civilization"" in addition to carrying a maximum prison escapee Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), but because of the crash, everything is messed up.  The new captain, Fry (Radha Mitchell), is very unwilling to fulfil her newly appointed post, the officer that captured Riddick, Johns (Cole Hauser) is a hot-tempered morphine addict, and the aforementioned Riddick has escaped. Not soon after the crash, there is a huge twist.  One of the crew members goes to explore a suspicous cave, and gets killed by something that isn't human.  This begins to bring a whole new slant to things in the film and it introduces the nocturnal, carnivorous aliens.  Even worse, to benefit the nocturnal aliens and to horrify the crew members, it has been 22 years since the last eclipse on the planet, and therefore, its about time for another one.  From here on in everything goes crazy.  The aliens appear on the surface, an allegience (or is it?) with Riddick must be made, and something has to be done to get off the planet before everyone gets killed.<br/><br/>I'll hand it to Twohy and Ken Wheat, the concept of the film is very good.  On the other hand the direction of Twohy is very lopsided, the first 20 minutes are trying to flesh out characters and setup the rest of the flim, but it is a series of bizarre shots and milling around.  From the first attack on, the film loses the look it had for the first twenty minutes and becomes a run of the mill action film, but with some very cool set pieces.  The same could be said for Wheat's screenplay, which is lopsided throughout the whole film, giving some excellent lines to the truly menacing Vin Diesel, or giving cornball one-liners to the various others.  The acting on the whole doesn't benefit the film either.  Radha Mitchell, last seen in the great Ally Sheedy film High Art, gives a performance that could be comparble to Sigourney Weaver's Ripley from the ""Alien"" films.  Cole Hauser, from Good Will Hunting, is the dark law official who gives the deepest performance of the film, but that isn't saying much.  Far and away, the best performance in the film is Vin Diesel's.  Well actually, it's really just the character that Vin plays that makes him standout, along with his gravelly voice and incredible strength.  All in all, Diesel's Riddick is one of the most indelible sci-fi characters in quite a while,possibly since Schwarzeneggers Terminator.<br/><br/>My final say on this film is that it is recommended to someone who wants to be entertained by a movie that doesn't make one think that much, but to just witness explosions and violence.  I would say to catch this film at a matinee bargain price, but it could be enjoyed just the same if you waited for it to hit DVD or VHS.<br/><br/>My Rating : 6/10"

","I love sci-fi action films so I figured Pitch Black would be right up my alley - but I was totally blown away. This movie is even better than I expected. The cast was made up of mostly unknown actors and they were all excellent - Vin Diesel was especially good. The plot was great, the cinematography was really well done, and the aliens were just gorgeous!"
"pseudo9","10","0","0","16 February 2000"," The most suspenseful science fiction movie since ""Alien""
","WARNING SPOILERS THROUGHOUT REVIEW!!!<br/><br/>I was fortunate enough to see a screening of ""Pitch Black"" last night, and the overall impression I left with was astonishment.  Not since I saw ""Alien"" have I been this involved in a suspense, and it is suspense not horror, movie. It starts off quietly enough with the ubiquitous shot of the ship passing through space.  A nice effect in as it's quiet, simple, not flashy and noisy (this is space you know).  Vin Diesel has a narrative voiceover that introduces us to some of the other players in the movie and helps establish the tone of the movie; dark, edgy, and menacing without being directly threatening.  Diesel's ""Riddick"" is definitely not the type that you'd ever want to cross.  Most people would get nervous being in the same hemisphere, and Riddick likes that.  He's a loner, a survivor and definitely not a hero. He doesn't concern himself with questions of right or wrong, but operates at a more primal level that doesn't recognize the need for social niceties. The ship is pierced by meteorites, causing catastrophic failures and forcing them into the gravity of a nearby moon.  The chaos and confusion of this scene is extremely well filmed.  As crewmembers fall from their chryo chambers they are confused, scared and bewildered, a palpable air of panic is established.  This leads to the crash sequence being one of disorganization as nothing can stop the ship from going down.  The use of the personal point of view for this scene really helps to amp up the tension.<br/><br/>What ensues next could easily have been the stuff of cliches, a group of survivors of different ages, sexes and backgrounds gathers around the remains of the ship and begins to assess their situation.  What keeps this from becoming trite is how well the characters are created.  We have Fry an inexperienced pilot who's forced into decisions she's not prepared for, Abu al-Walid a Moslem and his charges who are on pilgrimage to New Mecca, Paris a hedonistic importer/exporter, Riddick a convicted murder who escaped from maximum lockup and is so dangerous that his jailer keeps him manacled hand and foot, blind-folded and gagged, Jack  a young kid who's impressed with the menacing Riddick, Johns the man charged with bringing Riddick back to the slam, and a couple of incidental characters who aren't fleshed in as well.  What facts we do gather about the group are picked up on the fly as director David Twohy doesn't allow a lot of wasted time for long character explanations before he starts cranking up the suspense.<br/><br/>As things would go, the survivors soon come to realize that they have limited options, negligible rations and are trapped on a dessert world in orbit around three suns.  The use of sepia tone during the exterior shots on the planet creates a definitely distinct look and feel to this movie.  As the other suns rise the color changes and the effect is startling and eerie. They also soon realize that they aren't alone and that something nasty is hiding under the surface.  This is one of the more stock moments in the movie, when one of the characters goes tunneling after one of the survivors disappears.  Perhaps they stopped watching horror films in the future and don't know any better.  Twohy manages to keep this pretty spooky, though, and gives us our first glance at the menace that lurks below.<br/><br/>The alien creatures are used extremely well in this movie, and as the moon begins to fall into an eclipse (a beautiful effect) they come up to the surface like demons erupting from hell.  This forces the crash survivors to change their frame of mind from escape to survival.  This is where the writing of the characters begins to really shine through.  Each one is a representation of a different aspect of human nature and as the crises worsens those traits come more to the front of things.  Riddick and Moslem each wrestle with issues of faith and belief, and we wonder if the allegiances of the characters are what we think they are, or even if they are who we think they are. As they literally race through the darkness trying to reach their ship one can't help make the comparison of Ripley racing through the Nostromo in ""Alien"" trying to reach safety; but again,  Twohy is ahead of us on that one and manages to plant some nice surprises in the plot for us to find.<br/><br/>Whether or not they make it I'll leave for you to find out.  And believe me it's worth finding out.  This is a movie that I went to expecting to merely be entertained, and I was, but what I didn't expect was to be dazzled, frightened, and intrigued.  Credit has to be given to the entire cast, though Diesel clearly stands out, for creating a group of people that you're interested in and root for. Some problems exist in this movie, such as their initial need for using breathing devices that quickly seem to be forgotten and disappear, but the overall style, story, character and level of suspense more than make up for any trivial faults.  A highly enjoyable movie that rates a high four out of five."

","I went into this movie thinking that it was going to be a rather typical special effects sci-fi flick trying to get money without having to write much of a script.  To my surprise I was right for the most part, but there was something in the movie that made it a lot better than the regular no plot sci-fi movies. Usually I dont go to Sci-Fi movies for the direction but the way this movie was directed intrigued me.  The lighting was perfect, there were many cool shots and camera views, and great integration of special effects and characters.  Which brings me to the characters in the movie...they were great.  It would have been nice to get some more character development for most of them but the ones that did get some charcater development made terrific characters...and the actors did well playing their characters which helps.  Van Diesel especially...I'm sure we'll be hearing from him in many more movies in the coming years. So much potential in this movie that just didnt get used at all.  At the end it felt like it was just a bunch of stuff that happened.  I didnt see a point in it...nothing really tied in to anything else.  I gave it a weary 6/10 because it did intrigue me...and I suggest that if you really like Sci-Fi you should check it out.  Otherwise it would probably be a good idea to see the re-release of American Beauty instead! <br/><br/>>(8(l)"

","After walking out of the film, I had the feeling that followed first viewings of films such as ""The Matrix"", ""Dark City"", or ""Aliens"".  Yes this is a formula film, in its most basic overview. People are trapped in a confined location, not able to get help, and must survive attacks by an alien force.<br/><br/>Though the plot is formulaic, the execution is anything but. The first 10 minutes of the movie, as many have pointed out, is a sensory overload. You feel the excitement and confusion that would result from a crash landing of this nature.<br/><br/>In the time before the blackout, the director makes great use of lighting, filters, and wide angled lenses to portray the desolation of the desert. I never thought that watching a movie could actually make me feel the heat of a desert. This is probably the best use of color and lighting I have ever seen. (Plus, it is somewhat ironic that this has some of the brightest scenes ever filmed, and the movie is called Pitch Black)<br/><br/>The characters are great too.  The team is filled with anti-heroes. They are not the people you would expect in a blockbuster film, but are similar to people you might meet in real life. Also, the choice to not use marquee actors and actresses makes the characters that much more believable."

Sometimes I will refuse to see a movie if the advertising is poor, even if my friends tell me it is a good movie.  Well the advertising for Pitch Black got me, sadly.  I did not know what to expect going into the movie, but after the first twenty minutes or so, I pretty much knew how I was going to be disappointed.  The characters are all very weak, do not expect any great performances, or good development of any of the characters.  And the character that made me want to see the movie, the creatures or big chickens, thats what they looked like to me, were not any better.  The main problem I guess that made it bad was the story and flow of the movie.  It seems like it is not going anywhere, just dragging along.

","Pitch Black is a healthy dose of Aliens with a twist of Mad Max thrown in to boot.  The plot was solid - a ship crashlands on the surface of a forbidding planet where darkness means death from the creatures who live underground (or aboveground during total eclipses).  The characters were simply developed, yet interesting enough to provide surprise for some of the movie's character development twists.  Vin Diesel as Riddick is a true movie tough guy who saves the day, and Radha Mitchell plays the softer side of Lt. Ripley from the Alien series as Cpt. Fry.  A solid supporting cast is assembled as well, but this all gets lost in an ending which becomes formulaic and anti-climatic.  Special effects were also well done, which makes this a good Sci-Fi/Horror movie, but not a great one."

","This movie was everything that ""ALIENS"" was not.  How many times have we seen a film like this before.....  A number of people (all stock characters) end up stuck somewhere with very little in the way of weapons, food, and shelter and they must try and survive while dealing with the inhospitable landscape, as well as a large number of computer generated enemies...  As I sat there (luckily for free) I knew it was going to be a major flop from the first few minutes.  The writing is absolutely stagnant and could have been written by grade school kids....  It seems that on this planet a total eclipse happens every 22 years, and guess what...they crash there just in time for all the fun... Even how they find out about the eclipse is utterly stupid....    The special effects weren't all that 'special' either.  It seems that the producers of this film 'borrowed' the over exposed film tactic of ""THREE KINGS""  and pushed it to the point of looking bad....not to mention the countless unnecessary shots that were obviously just thrown in to give it some 'style.'  Plain and simple this is a great example of how to do nothing right while making a film. There is just not one reason to see this movie!!!

"Buddy-51","Null","2","5","17 February 2001"," mediocre sci fi entry
","`Pitch Black' is a ha'penny, two-bit science fiction film that plays like a hybrid between `Lost in Space' and the much-imitated `Alien' and `Jurassic Park' films.  In this film, a space ship carrying a cargo of commercial passengers is forced to crash land on an unidentified planet, which, although there doesn't seem to be a shred of animal life anywhere to be found, still manages to be somehow inhabited by swarms of carnivorous birdlike creatures that only come out at night.  Ask not what these animals must feed on when there isn't a crew of fleshy earthlings conveniently placed there for them to nibble on.  Such rigorous application of logic is not one of `Pitch Black's strongest selling points.<br/><br/>Neither, in fact, is the cast of characters it has managed to assemble for the occasion.  Here we have the typical `cross section of humanity' routinely called upon to make its appearance in films of this type.  The ship's crew and passengers include two feisty young women, a hardnosed law enforcer (is he really a hero or a man with something to hide?), an effete wine-guzzling coward, an androgynous teenager (the `revelation' involving this character comes as a surprise only to the dimwitted characters in the film), a family of Muslims and a truth-seeing, muscle-bound serial killer who becomes the group's physical and intellectual mainstay. <br/><br/>
The story, though simpleminded and derivative of any number of other better films, nevertheless, manages to border on the murky and incoherent quite often.  We often aren't sure who is doing what or why (though, in all honesty, we don't particularly CARE either).  The special effects are generally sub par for a film of this genre and the only real attempt to create an otherworldly atmosphere consists in applying various types of light filters to the camera lens.<br/><br/>Completely lacking in suspense, excitement or originality (although the ending has a slightly unexpected twist), `Pitch Black' is strictly one for the video graveyard."
"BA_Harrison","5","2","6","5 December 2015"," The plot has more holes than the hull of Fry's spaceship.
","A deep-space passenger ship is hit by meteorites that breach the hull, forcing pilot Fry (Radha Mitchell) to crash-land on a nearby planet capable of sustaining human life. Incredibly, Fry and a handful of her passengers survive the impact, including mercenary Johns (Cole Hauser) and his extremely dangerous prisoner Riddick (Vin Diesel).<br/><br/>After investigating their new surroundings, the survivors come to the conclusion that they are on a dead world, all indigenous life having long been wiped out. In fact, there is one species still very much alive: flesh-eating, light-sensitive creatures that live below ground, away from the deadly glare of the planet's three suns. Unfortunately for Fry and company, they are about to be plunged into darkness by an eclipse that occurs once every 22 years, and which signals the emergence of the aliens from beneath the surface.<br/><br/>The survivors only chance of making it off the planet alive involves transferring energy cells from their downed craft to a functioning ship discovered at a nearby deserted mining colony, a task that requires putting trust in Riddick, whose surgically enhanced eyes enable him to see in the dark.<br/><br/>I'm willing to forgive the whole convenient 'breathable atmosphere' issue (as I do for one of of my favourite sci-fi films, Enemy Mine), but sci-fi horror Pitch Black throws up one unbelievable plot contrivance after another, completely ignoring logic in favour of thrills, thereby making it hard for me to rate it very highly despite some well handled action from director David Twohy, a memorable turn from gruff star Vin Diesel, and sexy Radha Mitchell in tight clothing.<br/><br/>The silly plot simply leaves too many awkward questions: if the aliens have long eradicated all animal life on the surface, what the hell have they been eating ever since? How do creatures that burn up in daylight but which must come to the surface to feed evolve on a planet with three suns? Why do they even bother to come to the surface if they've already eaten everything? Just a few of the head scratchers that this poorly scripted flick fails to answer."

","I was hoping, perhaps I will finally stumble upon one of those real science-fiction movies with an actual, thought-provoking story-line, which movies like ""Dark City"", ""Event Horizon"", ""Zardoz"", ""Solaris"" (1973), or ""2001"" have - but nay. It's just another dull, predictable, seen-it-all-before ""Alien"" re-hash. Even the creatures look like the ""Alien"" monsters, except that they have wings.<br/><br/>I mean, here we have a ship crash-landing on a planet with three suns (now there's some real unscience-like nonsense, but okay: it's just a movie) and one might be forgiven to hope that maybe something unique and original will happen story-wise. But no. The survivors are threatened by bat-like creatures who suck blood. YAWN! The rest of the movie is about how the ten little crash-landers try to survive the onslaught of the totally uninteresting flying alien draculas. The first half-hour or so is not even that bad (though hardly super), but once this movie's raison-d'etre materializes in the form of little ""Aliens"", it was strictly sleepy-time for me.<br/><br/>The movie isn't even visually exceptional. The dialog is your standard crap; ""sly""/""cool"" one-liners mouthed by characters created by a PC ""visionary""; the last four to remain alive are two females and two black guys. Need I say more? The blonde is supposed to be some kind of Sigourney Weaver toughy who is more than a match for many men, while the main Anglo-Saxon male turns out to be both corrupt and weak (he's a dope-addict). All the while, the mass killer, with his deep booming voice, is Vin Diesel who isn't such a bad guy after all, and even has his heart-of-gold won over eventually by the blonde to the extent that he risks his life to save people who normally/logically he shouldn't care less about (or would kill, right? Considering he's supposed to be a psychopath and all). The continuity of the blonde's character is also faulty: at the outset, she very willingly wants to sacrifice dozens of people to save her own heiny, but by the end of the movie she is prepared to give her life for just two. Where's the logic in that? The more years pass since the making of the ""Alien"" trilogy (or quadrology) the less tolerant I get towards its numerous clones. True science-fiction movies, in the tradition of famous writers' sci-fi novels or stories, are so rare, and that is why it's frustrating to see even a single dollar get spent on a trite, cliché sci-fi horror story when there are so many unique plots that are out there, begging to be filmed."

","Nearly 20 years on, Pitch Black still shines as a compelling, original piece of science-fiction film-making, which ended up spawning 2 and a bit sequels. Of real interest is seeing the introduction and early positioning of our favourite Furyan, Richard P Riddick, as very much an anti-hero for much of the movie's length. In the sequels, the spotlight positions him more as a traditional hero. Pitch Black is also notable for both a fine performance from Radha Mitchell as Pilot Carolyn Fry and the contribution of the desolate terrain around the South Australian desert town of Coober Pedy, very effectively passing itself off as the three-sunned barren planet.<br/><br/>Indeed though Pitch Black is ostensibly an American production, it has a very significant Australian element, besides the locations. Radha Mitchell and many of the cast members are Australian, as is musical director Graeme Revell, not forgetting the very talented cinematographer David Eggby. Mention of the cast members reminds me that Pitch Black is much more of an ensemble piece than subsequent Riddick episodes. As such the various characters are given differing back stories which do pique our interest. No one, least of all Riddick, is totally heroic. Even Mitchell's Fry (her best screen role IMHO), contemplates ditching her passengers, to better ensure her personal survival chances, in the film's harrowing opening scenes.<br/><br/>The story, though reminiscent of parts of Alien, confidently treads its own survivalist narrative path, once the damaged space ship crash lands unexpectedly mid-journey. Good to see, the creatures when they appear aren't Alien inspired clones, like so many other examples from creature features over the past few decades, such as the very recent, disappointing Life. The spine-tingling night time odyssey back to the repaired drop ship in the film's second half is a mini-masterpiece of suspense, pitting the disparate, rag tag humans (+Riddick) against their horrendous extra terrestrial hosts.<br/><br/>Vin Diesel arguably has achieved greater fame and financial success through his involvement in the Fast and Furious franchise. But for me, up till the present, the most interesting character he has brought to the screen is the always enigmatic Riddick, as first seen in Pitch Black."

","Which shows just how much mileage you can get from top-of-the-line production design and special visual effects, particularly when combined with inventive camera angles and lighting. To be fair, in a film which relies so much on 'make-the-audience-jump-out-of-their-seats' shocks, quality acting probably wouldn't have made a huge amount of difference, but it might have made those 'internal conflicts' of the group dynamic so much more credible. Too often, those conflicts smacked too much of 'Primer' calibre 'pulled punches', which fizzle out before they've built up a sufficient head of steam, at least until the next unconvincing argument rolls around. It didn't help, also, that the group's character profile smacked too much of quota-filling and genre stereotypes.<br/><br/>Story-wise, we've probably seen it all before, probably dating back 60 years and more: a spaceship crash-lands on an uncharted, unforgiving planet, and its motley crew - including one dangerous criminal - recognising that compromises need to be made, and unlikely alliances formed, if they are to make it off the planet alive.
Story-wise, too, you can probably fill in the blanks although, to be fair, you can probably do likewise with the best of that sub-genre.
Except that from early on, I frequently found myself comparing it unfavourably with far superior films, made by longer-established, if not also superior filmmakers: like the 1950s 'creature-feature' 'Them!' which, perhaps benefitted from being more homebound, and its creatures being a product of radioactivity, and from the presence of a lead actor of considerable and plausible gravitas; and 'The Thing', whose director, John Carpenter had acquired a certain facility in the short sharp shocks department; he was particularly well-served, though, in that film, by an ensemble of actors who knew their place and their roles, and rose to the occasion, no matter that the subject matter might have been just a little hard to swallow for them.

Lewis Fitz-Gerald supplies some comedy relief as Paris; sexy Claudia Black, John Moore, and Simon Burke round out the cast.

","Pitch black tells the story of a group of 12 people who survive a forced landing on a deserted planet. It's about survival and trying to escape a hostile environment. This plot has been used often before, and one could compare this film to The Thing or the Alien quadrilogy. What makes this film work are well written characters and great casting.<br/><br/>This particular group of people consists of individuals with widely varying backgrounds and mentality, which makes trust a big issue. Not only do they have to deal with the situation being stranded on a strange planet but the biggest threat could be their fellow survivors. You can really feel the anxiety building up during the movie which is augmented with a number of highly tensional scenes between characters.<br/><br/>As mentioned earlier the characters are what makes this a good film. Early in the movie the audience gets to know the characters enough to have feelings for them. Vin Diesel plays one of the main roles as Riddick, the physically strong, bad ass, prisoner, anti-hero, who still seems to have some leftovers of humanity. Cole Hauser plays Johns, a mercenary with a medical drug habit, who is responsible for Riddick, and the tension between those two is exciting to follow. Then we have Radha Mitchell playing the vice-captain of the ship who has to step up as a kind of a leader and keep the group together, while struggling with her own conscience. Other characters get less attention but are important, the most memorable ones are three Islamists who believe god is responsible for every happening but have to admit that god isn't always nice even if you pray; Jack, a boy with a secret and a rare items collector who is not exactly the kind of person you would pick in your survival team.<br/><br/>The cast fits very well into the characters; they look believable in their roles. Especially Riddick, who comes off as a bad person but still you oddly start to care for him. You get really drawn into the storyline and can easily picture yourself there with the survivals. It has a nice build up where you get to know the characters as they try to understand the planet they find themselves stuck on, followed by some faster-paced, exhilarating scenes where you don't want to look away. There are no scenes in particular that stand out, but you can find some clever dialogues. <br/><br/>The visual display is nice, with nice looking scenes ranging from intensive scenes happening in complete darkness to very bright POV's. The editing is very tight, including no scenes that don't matter or last way too long. Sometimes you need to do something else while watching, but this is not the case with this film<br/><br/>To summarize this review: This is a film that no fan of Sci-fi movies should miss, or anyone who enjoys action thrillers in general. Not the most memorable of movies but who was expecting that? A good movie with a great cast and interesting characters. <br/><br/>In one word: ""verymuchenjoyable"". - 8/10"

","I watched this movie simply because of nonstop positive reviews in IMDb about this movie. I have seen a pretty good amount of movies (including B grades) with this sort scenario where a group of travelers who get deserted somewhere due to a crash or something. I have enjoyed most of them. But here, since the beginning, it looked quite stupid. Characters does not fit together well. They seemed quite distant. Specially, the Muslim father and his sons who run around every where after the crash as if nothing has ever happened yelling ""Allah u Akbar"" looked really dumb and an insult to a certain religion. Other characters too (except for Riddik and Carolyn) were very uninteresting. Kid's character is so irritating. In short, most characters failed to get an impression on me. Only positive fact is the last 40mins or so which was somewhat thrilling compared to very dull 1st half. Once in a while, there is a movie which makes you relieved when it finally ends. This is a movie like that."

","Pitch Black is a decent movie. Because this fits the genre that I love the most, I thought I would love this. When I saw the concept, I thought there was no way this would be a bad movie. I was right in a way. It's not a bad movie but it's nothing spectacular. The first fifteen or so minutes of the movie actually sucked minus the superb crash landing. By the end, I was enjoying the movie though.<br/><br/>This is about a group of survivors who crash landed on a barren planet and its up to a convict to lead the group away from monsters and off the planet to safety.<br/><br/>The acting is not so bad. I think this is the movie where Vin Diesel makes a name for himself. I liked him here. The other actors were decent, nothing special.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a decent sci-fi film that is enjoyable except in the torrid beginning. I also liked the design of the monsters. They were very creepy. I rate this film 7/10."

","This movie is based on a classic stereotype of SciFi (unknown planet, alien monsters, a hero, ...) but special effect are not intrusive at all; from many points of view it remembers to me Alien saga and there is a good level of tension. In the story high importance for women roles: an action movie for female public? I don't like Vin Diesel as an actor and this movie is not an exception (even if it is his first relevant movie) but the story and the directions are very good and make this movie very interesting. Interesting are also some ideas: the dark sight, the monsters (even if the way they see is really weird), the bad guy that became ah hero and save everyone."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","5","1","2","5 October 2008"," Good directing and a great anti-hero keeps ""Pitch Black"" out of sci-fi cellar
","Science-fiction films can be some of the most entertaining and intelligent films ever made and they can also be the cheesiest. ""Pitch Black"" falls somewhere in between, caught between the desire for alien horror flick entertainment and an intriguing concept for suspense and drama.<br/><br/>Basically a group of space travelers awake from hypersleep to find their ship crashing. Their captain, Fry (Mitchell) manages to land them without killing them all on an unknown planet with perpetual sunlight. Man-eating aliens inhabit the underground though they are afraid of light, which isn't a problem until the travelers realize they will witness a total eclipse before they can repair a ship to escape on. They've also got a convict named Riddick (Diesel) as cargo.<br/><br/>Riddick makes this film, in honesty. Everyone loves a good anti-hero, a guy with a bad rep that lays a beating on everyone and uses others' prejudices about him against them to look really clever. Oh, and a dude with night vision. Diesel gives Riddick the on-screen command his character requires. He comes off as brutish, but somewhat trustworthy. It's strange, but it really works.<br/><br/>The rest of the characters aren't so great. Mitchell is a pretty good protagonist, but Cole Hauser, who plays Johns, the arrogant cop, acts like he's intentionally trying to be a poor man's Josh Lucas or Matthew McCoughnahey. It also doesn't help that the characters are under-developed, including Riddick, though that adds to his character in ways despite us wanting to know his past.<br/><br/>The concept for this movie is cool, the way it goes from light in the first half to complete darkness in the second and the way that transition corresponds with our thoughts about Riddick is interesting. The plot, in general, is pretty lousy. For some reason, the writers opted to go with the disaster/horror movies formula of the 90s--kill off one person from the group at a time so only the characters that are well-received survive. Yes, there's that and the ""get the fuel back to the ship on time and don't leave anyone behind so we can escape"" cliché. <br/><br/>David Twohy really saves the plot in those regards by keeping things interesting. He does some interesting shots that involve a lot of quick, simultaneous cuts and close ups--a more radical style that definitely works for sci-fi. In general, the color palette is very carefully chosen with the light and dark contrast and overall the special effects were very satisfactory for 2000<br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" is not a consummate suspense or sci-fi thriller, but it does keep you interested enough to want to know more about Riddick or what else the imagination of ""Pitch Black"" has drafted. Basically, what could have ended up really ""b-movie-esque"" and terribly cliché and awful ends up solid thanks to some good decisions by Twohy."

And to the guy who didn't like the science. You know nothing of astronomy. Everyone knows that an eclipse of the moon is when the sun goes between the moon and the earth, and you get the ring of fire, and other places. Her, the planet does an extended figure of eight - an extra loop- around the third sun, therefore a figure of twelve (loop*2=(figure of) 8 \ loop*1 = 4 \ loop*3 = 12). Perfect. Just makes you permanently nauseous, and of variable height - which is costly in clothes, but makes your girlfriend happier now and then. One of the better sci-fi movies.

"jimmy-328","10","1","2","30 March 2006"," Why I love Pitch Black...
","I saw Pitch Black in the theaters when it first came out. I didn't know Vin Diesel then, I just thought I was going to see another sci-fi ""Alien"" type movie with no-name actors. I enjoyed it at the time, thinking it was cool how the movie was so dramatically different having the beginning so light and the last so dark. The character of Riddick was cool...about as cool as a bad-ass tough-guy can get.<br/><br/>Now, having seen the movie countless times, preferring the director's cut I enjoy the movie for three primary reasons: 1. Dialogue - Not many Sci-Fi movies have good duologue. Pitch Black has very good duologue with some moments of pure brilliance, in my opinion. 2. Character Development - Sure, the movie has its share of flat background characters...meat for the monsters if you will. But a few are developed nicely. Riddick, Carolyn, Johns, Imam and even Jack are all developed with some depth. You might even argue Paris but he was just an idiot. hehe 3. Story - It's just a cool story! With a great anti-hero...Riddick!"
"dave_gene_pico","10","1","2","22 July 2005"," A great movie.
","This is one of my favorite movies. David Twohy does a great job of setting the environment to make you FEEL like you're on an alien planet. The plot is, a spaceship carrying cargo and a few passengers goes off course and get into an asteroid belt, and then crash land on a desert planet. Vin Diesel does a great job acting as Richard B. Riddick, the cold, ruthless, heartless killer. Cole Hauser makes a great performance as Johns, the black-hearted Bountyhunter, along with Radha Mitchell as Carolyn Fry, who's stuck in the middle between Riddick and John's fighting. My favorite, though, was Kieth David (Imam). Kieth David has played in ""John Carpenter's: The Thing"", he appeared in ""There's Something About Mary"", and has narrated a few things as well. I think he delivers the best performance, followed by Cole Hauser.<br/><br/>There's a lot of speculation that this is a rehash of ""Alien"", but IN FACT, ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was a novel written by Alan Dean Foster in the early 1970's, BEFORE he wrote ""Aliens"". ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" novel had an opening like this (it wasn't an entire separate book called ""Pitch Black"", but it had a prologue like this.) This is a great movie, and has great performances, and all the actors/actresses fit their characters. This is a great movie to watch the the lights off, and while snuggling something. It's very scary, but it has those parts that WILL make you jump. I very much suggest this movie!"

","May contain spoilers. Just to warn you.<br/><br/>So, this movie is basically one of those sci-fi thrillers where some unknown entity is killing off a large cast of characters one by one. It is reminiscent of Red Planet and Mission to Mars in style, and the whole concept of being lost on an unknown and questionable planet, but I feel is much better. The characters are interesting, Vin Deisel's character has great presence and appeal, and it is highly suspenseful. Also, although the general concept may not be highly original, there are definitely elements of this film that are definitely unique.<br/><br/>If you like sci-fi, suspense, and/or horror, I'd recommend it."
"philip_vanderveken","7","1","2","3 January 2005"," Surprisingly enough a good Sci-Fi movie
","I had never heard of this movie when it came out, probably because no-one ever wrote a review on it in the magazines and because no-one ever paid any attention to it before. Let's be honest, who knew anything about Vin Diesel before ""The Fast and the Furious"" and ""xXx""? Probably not many of you and I'm not saying that I did. So when ""The Chronicles of Riddick"" was released I was very surprised to hear that this was actually a sequel. And of course when a sequel is released in the multiplexes, at least one TV-channel will program the first movie and this time it wasn't any different. That's how I first saw ""Pitch Black"" and even though I'm not a fan of Sci-Fi movies, I have to say that I had a good time watching this one.<br/><br/>The story is good. A space ship has made a crash landing on some seemingly lifeless planet, scorched by three suns. One of the passengers that survived the crash is Richard B. Riddick, a convicted murderer who is feared by all the passengers. But they have to find water to survive and a base to get help and they will need all the help they can get so they release him. When they reach the base, there is no-one to welcome them. It's completely deserted. Some kind of animals, who fear daylight, have eaten all the inhabitants. Normally there is always plenty of light, but once in a few years there is a solar eclipse. And this is exactly the time that there will be such an eclipse...<br/><br/>Overall this movie reminded me a bit of Aliens, but I'm already glad that it didn't copy it completely. Somehow it tried to be original and that's not always easy. OK, you'll still encounter many horror and Sci-Fi clichés, but it's all done in such a way that they get away with it. It's all still believable. The different characters were OK, but could perhaps be deepened more. I mean, you'll never really know who the bad guys and the good guys are, but I sometimes wanted to know more about certain people. I wanted to know why they reacted in the way they reacted, I wanted to know what drove them...<br/><br/>However, what I loved most about the movie were the special effects and the lighting. The creatures or aliens or whatever you like to call it were really cool to watch. Same for the lighting. The idea of a blue sun was cool and something I hadn't seen before in a movie. Also the use of different shades and intensities of light, as well as Riddick's night vision were interesting.<br/><br/>All in all this movie was certainly worth a watch, even for people like me who don't like Sci-Fi at all. If I have to recommend it to anyone than it will of course be to the people that adore this genre. I'm sure they will be blown away by it. Personally I give it a 6,5/10 and that's probably the highest score I've ever given to a movie of this kind."
"FilmOtaku","6","1","2","10 December 2004"," Sci-Fi for the regular guy
","Spoilers Sci-Fi films are pretty much anathema to me with a few exceptions (Alien & Aliens are two films that immediately come to mind), but I watched ""Pitch Black"" anyway because it came highly recommended by several people. Directed by David Twohy (""The Arrival"") and starring Vin Diesel, it was a film I ended up enjoying with little criticism.<br/><br/>""All you people are so scared of me. But it ain't me you got to worry about now"" is pretty much the understatement of the year, uttered by Richard Riddick (Diesel), a prisoner being transported with 39 others to New Mecca, another world that is in the process of being settled. When the ship crash lands along the way, leaving about ten survivors, Riddick manages to escape his captor, William Johns (Cole Hauser) sparking a manhunt on an unknown and unusual planet that has three suns. What they soon realize is that they have landed on a planet that is about to undergo a total solar eclipse which will bring thousands of light-shy man eating flying creatures out into the darkness. When Riddick soon resurfaces and agrees to help them try to restart an abandoned ship (from the last human feast that landed on the planet) it becomes a race against time before all of the lights go out. Unfortunately, time runs out before this happens, and they find themselves prey for the creatures as they try to make it off the planet.<br/><br/>Stylistically, ""Pitch Black"" is pretty slick. The use of the color filters was great, and the editing, for the most part, was pretty good. The only thing I thought got really old were the stupid quick edits of two people looking at one another (it was very reminiscent of bad Japanese television shows) or when someone would turn around to look at Riddick and it would be a quick edit of ""Riddick is there to the right! Now quick to the left!"" Those were supposed to be arty shots, and they fell flat  but the basics were good. I thought that the events surrounding Jack were completely ridiculous; I felt suddenly transported back to a Judy Blume novel, but again, it's Sci-Fi  I give it a little more latitude. The CGI was surprisingly good, and the actors (being throwaway characters anyway, this is a Sci-Fi movie after all) were decent. Unfortunately, a big deterrent for me is that I can't understand a damn word Vin Diesel says, so I found this completely annoying, of course. Keith David of course was totally underused, but I'm used to that by now. The shot near the end of Paris spitting alcohol onto his torch, creating a momentary large fire that lights up the dozens of creatures that surround him is the money shot of ""Pitch Black"" and is a shot that I've been told was actually an ad-lib by the actor, but it was a hit when used in the trailer and just as effective in the film. It's almost worth seeing the film just to see that cool shot and the events leading up to it.<br/><br/>Overall ""Pitch Black"" was a good film, and I would of course recommend it to any Sci-Fi lover who hasn't already seen it, and assure most Sci-Fi haters (like myself, for the most part) that it is worth seeing, and not too ""out there"". 6/10"

I am now a fan of Vin Diesel because of this film.  I don't know what some of you other people are talking about, but I think the aliens looked very real.  The only bad thing about the movie, was that it left a lot of questions unanswered.  Mainly being how did they crash there on the exact day of the eclipse (well, technically, we don't really know how long they were there, since there is no day and night).  And did the aliens build the tunnels and caves themselves, or were they just there.  And if they made them, how could they be in the sun digging them.

","This tale of futuristic space travelers crash-landing on a planet and battling vicious beasts that are afraid of light suffers from undeveloped characters, phony special effects and enough plot holes to fill a spacial black hole. Vin Diesel, while a good actor, reads with a too-sophisticated Greenwich village New York theater background that belies his character's psychopathic origins. Radha Mitchell makes no impression as the spaceship's gutsy female captain. Cole Hauser over-acts outrageously as a bounty hunter. The computer-driven special effects are, as usual, cartoon-ish and unbelievable. One character escapes from a cave with a can of worms, literally, (or florescent slugs) which the monsters resist. Other characters are so disposible we feel nothing when they are banished. To see how this type of film is done most competently, see the ""Alien"" series."
"Dark Hellion","8","1","2","18 May 2000"," Good movie...
","Pitch Black isn't supposed to be believable. I mean, honestly, what do people make movies *about*? Not boring, ordinary everyday events, that's for sure. If the ship had crashed far from anything, what would there have been to make a movie about? Nothing. There wouldn't have been one. And it *is* possible to have a system with three suns. Only problem is, it's impossible to predict the movement of the bodies in that system. The only other gripe I had is that Riddick's eyesight didn't seem to be constant...and there was an awful lot of light around at times for a total eclipse. But let's ignore all that. <br/><br/>Problem: Not scary enough. Too few genuine scares. <br/><br/>Problem: Riddick isn't frightening enough, and is too obviously the 'good' guy. <br/><br/>Problem: We don't get enough information on the characters - I didn't get attached to anyone other than Riddick. And Fry, a little. Aliens was much better in this department. <br/><br/>Good: Character *development*, even though we have nothing really to start with. We see Johns sink from the good guy to the merc, Riddick almost redeem himself, and Fry face up to who she really is and try to do something about it. Not to mention Imam's faith. <br/><br/>Good: The aliens. They're cool, and even fight each other like they should.<br/><br/>
Good: Riddick is not a superhuman indestructible superhero. He gets hurt like everyone else. He just has certain...advantages. <br/><br/>Good: The ending. See that for yourself. <br/><br/>Good: There are no clichéd 'I'm gonna die! We're all gonna die!' characters. I'm sick of them. Even the scared guy is kinda like Purvis from Alien: Resurrection. <br/><br/>Well, that's about all. <br/><br/>Recommendation: Go see this if you want to spend a couple of hours thinking about nothing in particular, and you can suspend your disbelief enough to overcome the problems I mentioned and the rather improbable starting point for the plot. If you can do all that, you'll like this movie.<br/><br/>

"Lobo69","2","1","2","15 March 2000"," Hollywood - Get over Aliens, Please!
","Pitch Black - Hollywood, Get Over Aliens Already!<br/><br/>Aliens was a great movie, probably the best sequel ever and on its own one of the best action movies ever made. Having said that, I think its time that Hollywood moves on and gets over it. There will never be another movie in this genre that is as good as Aliens, so any derivative of Aliens is a pointless waste of time and money. I'd rather watch a good movie again than see a bad remake of that movie, so the next time a film like Pitch Black comes along I'll simply pull out my dusty copy of Aliens and save myself the 8 bucks.<br/><br/>This is more a criticism of Hollywood than anything else, I'm sure it must be hard to come up with a premise that involves aliens on a distant planet that does not in some way pay homage to a movie like Aliens or Alien. For me it was hard not to draw parallels between this film and the movies I grew up with, and it was impossible for me to see it as an original plot concept. Do the aliens in these shows ever do anything besides eat people? I mean, is that their sole function in life? Lets think of something more interesting for the monsters to do in the next Aliens rip-off. Maybe the aliens aren't hungry at all, or if they are hungry, maybe all they eat is people's shoes and socks. Now we're getting somewhere.<br/><br/>The premise.<br/><br/>Humans in the future without enough navigational sense to stay clear of solar systems when traveling at near light speed, crash on an unnamed, unknown planet in a strange solar system that for some bizarre reason has 3 suns. I don't know why the producers went with 3 suns as opposed to 2 suns, especially considering the fact that most solar systems are in fact binary, except to maybe make the little ones in the audience say ""Aw cool, 3 suns!"" The survivors, who are not very bright to begin with, are then presented with the extra little problem of having an escaped murder loose amongst them. His name is Riddick and for the first ½ hour of the movie they look around for him instead of looking for food or water! Lets get our priorities straight shall we? First thing you do after crashing on an alien planet is look for food we all know that, then you see how much Diet Dr. Pepper survived the crash of course, then you look for the escaped murders.. Sheesh. Where did these people learn to forage?<br/><br/>Let the clichés begin!<br/><br/>Of course the planet is totally dead with no water and no apparent life or ecosystem, and yet low and behold there is a breathable atmosphere! What a shock. Also with 3 suns it's only just a little hotter than Earth in summer, how convenient! I'd think that 3 suns might make for some interesting plot twists about the crew fighting over the shady spot, but sadly nothing that interesting occurs in the film. At one point the survivors come across a vast field of bones, presumably from the herds of animals that once roamed this planet with 3 suns and no water. Exactly how vast herds of giant herbivores would evolve in a desert is not as interesting to the crew as how the skeletons are all lined up, as if they died at the same time standing up. Foreshadowing, what a concept! The high school English teacher of the movies writer must be so proud. Later on we find out that there is a whole species of underground carnivores who are just waiting for the lights to go out so they can feast upon the multitude of juicy humans who crash land on their nasty little planet every so often. Oh yes, I can see how 6 or 7 dehydrated humans every few years could sustain a huge group of meat eating, shade loving monsters for years to come. Humans would have to be pretty filling for that to be true, especially when you consider that these voracious creatures have seemingly eaten all other life on the planet. Wouldn't they have eaten themselves into extinction? Apparently not. The monsters are also afraid of light, or are harmed by it or something, the bottom line is they just don't like light ok? So our humans are safe as long as there is a lot of light, and in a 3-sun solar system that doesn't seem to be a problem.<br/><br/>But luckily for us the crash happens just hours before a once-every-22-year eclipse that the beasties have been waiting for so they can get out of their shady holes and eat all the starving, dehydrated, hapless, defenseless humans that have crash landed on their dusty little planet. This eclipse does not cover just one sun, or even 2 suns. Astoundingly it covers a remarkable 3 suns, go figure. That coincidence is not as great as them crashing only a few yards from an abandoned mining camp, where they learn all about the impending eclipse from a home made model of the solar system made by the previous owners of the camp. The miners were also in the process of leaving the camp in a spaceship they had, but didn't quite make it. These people had a spaceship, A Spaceship! And they had to build a little mock solar system out of foam balls and coat hangers? Isn't this supposed to be the future, couldn't they have figured out the alignment of the planets from the computer on their.. Spaceship??? Did I mention they had a spaceship? If I had a spaceship I don't think I'd go be a miner on some weird planet with no water and lots of monsters. I'd keep looking till I found a planet with lots of water, and no monsters. Then I'd relax and get a job making web pages, or their future equivalent. This is supposed to be the future right?<br/><br/>So the crew is then eaten one by one in various gory but uninteresting ways, and since the characters are so profoundly un-heroic and uninteresting, we really don't care. In fact we want them to get eaten so we can see the creatures do their thing some more. At one point you start rooting for the monsters so you can hear the gory body breaking noises.<br/><br/>Here comes another criticism of Hollywood, can't they think of something more frightening than being eaten? People just aren't as scared of being chewed on as they were back in the 70's when Jaws came out, and they have been getting gradually less and less terrified of it for the last 30 years. I personally am not very worried about being swallowed whole or ripped apart by a huge beast in my every day life. Maybe if I was a Lion tamer or a Crocodile wrangler this movie might scare the pants off me! But as I am a graphic designer by trade I'd be much more scared of a movie about computers that come to life and start making artistic designs on their own, putting me out of work. Well its more likely than anything that happens in Pitch Black.<br/><br/>How could this movie have been made better?<br/><br/>I'm glad you asked. Well for starter lets stop making the bad guy in movies look like a wrestler. I know wrestling is very popular right now and all that, but in reality no one looks like these people. And people who look like the bad guy in this movie are generally speaking not very tough, they just work out with weights a lot. The toughest people I have even seen are bikers, and if you have seen what they look like you know they don't spend too much time in a gym. Or conversely you could make him look like a totally normal person, that way when he does turn out to be an exceptionally talented murder the audience would be forced to say, ""Gee, he looks like a totally normal person. How could he be such an exceptionally talented murderer?""<br/><br/>Too much foreshadowing!<br/><br/>They spent so much time at the beginning of the movie trying to make the planet look scary that by the time the scary stuff happened, it wasn't a surprise. It would have been better if there were hints of something bad that had happened in the past, but making it obvious that something bad had occurred made it very anti-climactic when it all came down. I would have liked to see the ecosystem in some state of recovery from the last time there was an eclipse. That would have given the nasty critters something else to do besides harass our hapless crash victims, they could have chased around the other animals and wreaked a little havoc on the environment rather than just play chase the humans. That might have made the creatures seem more real rather than just 2 dimensional hapless human harassers. Also, I think the creatures should have been in hibernation waiting for the next eclipse, rather than skittering around in the tunnels. How would they find<br/><br/>enough food between eclipses with all the animals that did live on the surface being dead and all?<br/><br/>Live humans are more interesting than dead ones.<br/><br/>For example the people from the mining camp would have been more interesting if they were alive, like walking around and doing stuff. Maybe they would have seen the crash and gone out to rescue any survivors, now that sounds like something live humans would do. This would have been better than the cliché of ""we crash landed only feet or inches from a settlement, lucky us.""<br/><br/>We crash-landed, we have no way home.sob, sob.<br/><br/>This is such a tired premise, especially when 30 minutes into the film they do find a way to get home and it becomes a plot device. (i.e. we have to drag the power cells from the crashed ship to the new ship, etc. etc. etc.) Come on! Make it a scientific mission that's there to study the eclipse or something, that would have defused the cliché of ""Hey cool, we arrived here just in the nick of time to witness a once in a thousand year cosmic event"".<br/><br/>How are the Special Effects?<br/><br/>I have no idea, I couldn't see them. Basically the plot revolves around the fact that these nasty critters only come out when its pitch black... need I say more? Literally there is not one shot of a full monster in the light, so all you ever see is them in silhouette.<br/><br/>In closing I'll just say this, its not a scary or entertaining movie but if you can get into a matinee for $3.00 I say go for it.

Way to go Vin, you sure showed that alien who is boss. But who cares? The special effects in this movie were a terrible attempt to make up for lousy acting, and they weren't even very good. The best effect they probably had was the extremely high-key lighting to give the effect of multiple suns. But the acting and even the story were definitely mediocre.<br/><br/>If you find yourself sitting in the theater and Pitch Black is about to start, you might as well sit through it.

","Am I the only one who thought this was a ridiculous movie that is not even science based even though they call it sci-fi. A dominant species that never comes above the surface except once every 22 years? What did they feed on in between? I highly doubt a species evolved on a planet with 3 suns and stays underground, and there's not a species alive that can feed for 1 month then hibernate for 22 years. No. And no water? The only water on the planet comes from a man made machine. So these aliens dont need to drink anything apparantly. Also, a planet the size a Jupiter would have a HUGE gravity pull on this planet, making it more likely to be a moon not a planet. I felt like they threw every scientific principle out the window here and I hated this movie because of it. Give me one single plot point I can believe in the story!!"

","perhaps mild spoiler-alert.<br/><br/>OK so I'm a little late to the party, this movie is 10 years old. I never got around to seeing this new but post now because given its rating expected something a whole lot better.<br/><br/>I realize anyone under 14 may not know what ""cliché"" means but while I had small hopes this wouldn't be as bad as its cast of nobodies, headed by a poser lead more suited to brief bit-work indicated it should be, it was. ""cliché-laden"" is all that comes to mind. I could only watch about half the movie - nothing is any fun when every strand of a film is nothing but one overworked cliché priming the next overworked cliché.<br/><br/>it was often nonsensical as well. a body is savaged to the point the area he disappeared was awash in blood. yet the 'villain', clean as a whistle moments after, is still ridiculously and repeatedly accused of knifing the victim to death, ostensibly only because the movie's lameness required it.<br/><br/>where I gave up is their mad dash to do something before the solar eclipse occurs. you see, bad things happen when it gets dark. so our band heads to another site (for some reason) to madly collect all their gear (for some reason), and get back to where they started (for some reason), before the eclipse occurs. why? I have no idea. I've never been in an eclipse but do know they last for minutes then viola! sun and light are back to normal. so my best guess why someone didn't just say ""hey, we'll lockdown for a few minutes and *then* at a leisurely pace go get our gear"" is because that would only use up 10 seconds of film.<br/><br/>cliché-ridden, mindlessly contrived, a lead for whom saying he's one-dimensional is too kind; this is a 4, maybe a stretch as a 5. the current 7? not even close."

","When Sci-Fi blends with Horror, it's wonderful. I liked Alien and I liked this, because of the survival plot is just so viscerally appealing. Diesel had some nice lines, and a dollop of self-realization and even a bit of vulnerability when he admits to an error in judgment; he took baby steps towards more sympathetic a character, nice and slow. He could have had them all killed one by one, just to take over of their resources, *well with the exception of Johns who may have given him a moment of struggle* but did not. The effects added a lot of rawness to the film, stark colors and dry sand. I did not quite get how the vehicle came into being, which was an important bit of plot, and having 3 suns to deal with, I had no idea whatsoever how that would play out; these were stumbling blocks, easily disregarded in view of the fascinating character interplay. Fry, Imam, Jack, even the non-English speaking characters I came to care about deeply, the result of excellent storytelling."
"breakdownthatfilm-blogspot-com","8","1","3","15 July 2014"," A well developed sci-fi horror film
","Sometimes being known for only a few things can benefit an individual greatly. Vin Diesel has the luxury of this phenomena. Most of time, when actors become known for doing the same roles, they become forgotten and non-existent. So in order to break free of that, the actor takes on new and different roles to either round out their skills or grab their fans attention. Jim Carrey was like this early on in his career. Originally, he was the funnyman with hits like Dumb & Dumber (1994), Ace Venture: Pet Detective (1994) and The Mask (1994). But then he went on to do The Truman Show (1998) which was a totally different step for him. Again, Vin Diesel hasn't had any problems sticking to what he's good at. This franchise and The Fast and the Furious (2001) series continue to cement him in Hollywood fame without having to take on completely different roles. He has tried but they never took off.<br/><br/>Here, Vin Diesel plays his second best known character to that of Dominic Toretto - Richard B. Riddick, a convicted killer who's got nothing to lose. While being transported, the ship ends up crash landing on a foreign planet with flying Dracula hammerhead shark like creatures. The catch is that they only come out at night. And the crew that is stranded is just in luck because a full eclipse is on its way. Ahh,...gotta love how convenient these situations happen. But for writing, convenience is the only problem. The rest is a well-written script that develops its main cast to the point of where they must come to grips with certain events that possibly audiences may not see coming. I know I wasn't, the actions of certain individuals continued to keep me guessing. This is important because that means it can keep the attention of its audience with ease. Plus, with the element of the unknown and high tension continuously keeps viewers on their toes.<br/><br/>Diesel as Riddick is convincing enough. He has snarky dialog and definitely has a presence that's hard to find boring. In charge of the rest of the crew is Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) and although at times she's not sure of herself, she does become strong over time. Then there's her second in command William Johns (Cole Hauser) who has a grudge to settle with Riddick. His interactions with Diesel are comical at times because of how much they resent each other. Adding to the story is Abu 'Imam' al-Walid played by Keith David who adds a bit of a religious agenda into the mix. For him at least, he too as a character is tested, not only by the creatures but also by his peers. It is these kinds of moments that are critical in defining characters and not making them feel all the same.<br/><br/>The special effects for 2000 are good at points. The alien creatures don't look recycled but visually, they do look fake at times when it came to CGI. There are physical props but most of it is CGI, which makes it less frightening. The action and gore are commendable. Vin Diesel has the chops for such requirements. The cinematography by David Eggby looks great. For the planets terrain, it looked and felt very dry. I do question the color scheme at times. It would swap between yellow and blue. Both looked great but just one should've been picked. Graeme Revell's score to the film is interesting. It incorporates tribal drums to match Diesel's prologue of animal instincts but other than that, it feels light. No theme or tune was memorable. Come on Revell, you're better than this. Altogether still a very satisfying franchise entry.<br/><br/>The writing contains highly developed characters that will keep its audience guessing until the very end, along with its unique creatures. The only parts that feel weak are some of the visuals and Graeme Revell's musical score."
"chaos-rampant","Null","1","3","31 October 2012"," The machinery of retooling sleep
","I have been following the Alien trail starting with Jodorowsky's collapsed attempt to make Dune, it seems so interesting to me, and this is very much an Alien film. The filmmaker's involvement with Alien 3 - prior to the Vince Ward phase - is pretty well known in fan circles, it seems at least the prison planet idea was his.<br/><br/>And this does take place in the same universe of deep-space corporate exploration and lurking horrors, though of course the fact cannot be openly acknowledged. Which means, with a small tilt, you can enjoy the film both as an effectively revamped Aliens as well as pretty clever cinematic annotation of those films post-Cameron.<br/><br/>A few things. Among several shifts from Scott's to Cameron's vision, a pivotal one was the transition of Ripley from a person who survived on the basis of steely-eyed reason and sense, to obsessed and emotionally damaged woman, the whole plot about motherhood also mirrored in the creature, much less abstract this go around both in terms of narrative and presentation.<br/><br/>Aliens 3 and 4 sought to extend this notion of locally internalized narrative opposed to the original's abstract fabric, both failed because of either a poor set of metaphors or creative dissonance among the filmmakers. The fans however seem to have made a pretty cool observation. A theory that has some traction in the Alien community is that both those films are cryosleep hallucinations of Ripley.<br/><br/>And you should know this was originally written around a female protagonist. What is the film about?<br/><br/>The film begins with the protagonist having a cryosleep hallucination as the vessel he is on board with others shoots through the 'back roads' of space. It is said that, in the inner space of cryosleep, only the animal side of the brain is active - so we encounter on the journey a lot of impulsive horrors and ugliness, both 'xeno' and moral.<br/><br/>He is a bad guy, but not completely without conscience. So the journey is about desired redemption and salvation, this is mirrored in both the Islamic passenger's hajj to New Mecca and the pilot's desire to redeem herself for an unscrupulous decision early-on - you will see during the crash landing shots of rapid eye movement inter-cut with disaster, reinforcing implied dreaming.<br/><br/>More. This is a desert world of three suns so perennial day, but complete darkness every 22 years - the catch is that 'horrors' can only roam the surface when it is night, and our team crashes hours before it happens. The coincidence will seem far-fetched and fated, unless of course you keep in mind this is his journey through his own back roads.<br/><br/>And all of that is nicely capped off by having our guy be able to 'see' in the dark where no one else can, because - karmic chain - he was in prison and had surgically enhanced his sight to keep alive.<br/><br/>Both his night-vision and newborn aliens have as their base a sort of bioluminescence, which is the way Twohy and his team envisioned the interiors of consciousness - writhing patterns of light in skulking darkness.<br/><br/>The catch is that, depending on what viewing skills you have honed, the above will either not register at all excepting the 'redemption' arc, or will seem slightly obvious and sophomoric.<br/><br/>The desert world is a big plus here, real sand and diffused light opposed to the usually fabricated studio space of Alien films. The creature on the other hand is much less memorable."

","First I have to say I never give ANY movies a 10 out of 10. Unfortunately, since so many people have trashed this movie just because they didn't understand what they were watching, or claim it's a ripoff of other movies, it has a lower rating than it should have.<br/><br/>I would give this movie an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>Overall, excellent acting, effects, story and script.<br/><br/>The crew and passengers of a space ship crash land on a planet with three suns. One of the survivors is a chained criminal who manages to escape shortly after the crash.<br/><br/>The survivors find an old research camp a short distance away from their crash site (unlikely on such a large planet). Here they find a machine to reclaim water from the atmosphere, a small shuttle-like spacecraft and all the belongings of the people who inhabited the camp.<br/><br/>By now, the criminal has agreed to rejoin the rest of the group in exchange for a promise of freedom. This criminal (Riddick) makes everyone else realize that the original occupants of the camp never left, but were killed by some animals that earlier killed another of their party.<br/><br/>Their task is to bring back some energy capsules from their crash site to power the spacecraft at the camp.<br/><br/>Throughout the story they discover that the planet goes through an extended period of darkness due to an eclipse every 27 years (unlikely they would crash during this time), and soon discover that sightless animals come out to eat anything they can find including each other during this eclipse. Our group has to retrieve the energy capsules while avoiding getting eaten, with Riddick leading the group.<br/><br/>Many people claim this movie is a ripoff of the Alien series, or even Jurassic Park. This is utter nonsense. There are hundreds (if not thousands) or monster movies out there, and if this movie is a rip off then every monster movie ever made is a ripoff of whatever the original monster movie was.<br/><br/>What do monsters do? They chase you, they rip you apart, they eat you. So, in so far as the monsters in this movie do those same things (as every good monster should) then it is a monster movie ripoff as much as Star Wars is a ripoff of Star Trek.<br/><br/>The monsters (I prefer animals) in this movie fly, they have no eyes but ""see"" using a type of echo location like a bat does. One person asked how Riddick could stare down one of these animals without getting eaten. This person should have paid more attention as the movie clearly shows Riddick examining a skull of one of these animals and finding a ""blind spot"" where the animal could not ""see"" what is in that spot.<br/><br/>Of course, this movie has a couple of unlikely things like most scifi movies do. One is that the planet has a breathable atmosphere, one is that the gang should crash so close to the research camp on such a huge planet, and of course they happen to crash just before the eclipse takes place.<br/><br/>Come on people. If the story was, ship crashes, people die because of a poison atmosphere there wouldn't be much of a story, would there? Same goes for people crash, people wonder around and die of thirst. And, of course, people crash, people find camp with water, people fix small spacecraft and leave. None of those plots would make much of a movie.<br/><br/>The way the people are portrayed is perfect for the situation they are in. The animals are quite unique and not intelligent as the aliens are in Alien and Predator. It's a fast paced intense action movie that will give enjoyment to anyone who sees it.<br/><br/>If you are a scifi fan and have not seen this movie, you are in for a treat. If you're not a scifi fan, go watch something else."

","Pitch Black starts sometime in the future somewhere deep in outer space where 40 commercial passengers are in cryo-sleep aboard a spacecraft waiting their destination. Unfortunately the spaceship is caught in a meteor storm which breaches the hull, after a bumpy ride Officer Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) manages to land what's left of the ship on the nearest planet. The only survivors are Fry herself, bounty hunter William Johns (Cole Hauser) & his bounty Riddick (Vin Diesel) along with religious Islamic nut Abu al-Walid (Keith David), intergalactic antiques dealer Paris Ogilvie (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), Sharon Montgomery (Claudia Black), a guy called Zeke (John Moore) & some young boys including Jack (Rhianna Griffith). Together they must work to survive the chances of which improve dramatically when they discover an old abandoned settlement complete with spaceship, unfortunately it seems that the planet is infested with flesh eating creatures that can only survive in complete dark which is OK considering the planet has three suns. However by some amazing coincidence the day they happen to crash on this particular planet the first eclipse in 22 years that plunges the entire planet into total darkness occurs, now that's unlucky...<br/><br/>This Australian American co-production was co-written & directed by David Twohy & I have to admit I liked it a lot more than I thought I would. The script by Twohy along with Ken & Jim Wheat is surprisingly good & intelligent, at it's heart Pitch Black is an Alien (1979) clone but it's certainly one of the best. The character's make this film what it is, they are very well written, there aren't any real clichés among them, they all have an edge to them & unbelievably I actually cared for these people. Because there are no major a-list actors in Pitch Black it make the who's going to die & who isn't question a lot harder to call. The film starts off a little slowly but once it reaches the 40 odd minute mark & the flying creatures are let loose it never lets up, although having said that the first 40 odd minutes are used well to set both the character's & situation up so when the creature do start to attack it actually means something. I'm sure many other's have questioned this but why would an animal such as the one in Pitch Black evolve which can be hurt by light when the planet it's living on has three suns & has an eclipse every 22 years? Also what would these things feed on since the planet is pretty much dead? Don't give me that cannibalism rubbish either, I mean eventually they would all eat each other & there would theoretically only be one left who would eventually die of starvation anyway.<br/><br/>Director Twohy does a good job, there are no massive CGI effect scenes & he instead keeps things quite low-key & understated. The special effects that are here though are excellent & the scenes of the suns going behind the large ringed planet are cool. I'm not sure about the bleached colour in a lot of shots but at least it creates a pretty good alien environment & atmosphere. The film is lacking in gore, there is a rotten skeleton, a severed foot, someone injects a needle into their eye & someone has there head bitten off but that's about as nasty as it gets.<br/><br/>Apparently shot in 60 days on a budget of about $23,000,000 Pitch Black is well made with that Hollywood polish to it. The acting was pretty good from a mostly unknown cast although Vin Diesel has gone on to be a major Hollywood star & I have to say I thought he was great in this & played his part brilliantly with great menace.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is a great sci-fi/horror film & better than I had expected. In 20 odd years time I don't think anyone will look back on Pitch Black with the same regard as we do with Aien now but it's good solid entertainment that gets the job done. Well worth a watch. Followed by The Chronicles of Riddick (2004) & the straight-to-video animated film The Chronicles of Riddick: Dark Fury (2004)."

He put a pretty good performance in for his screen time in Saving Private Ryan, and was also in the hottest movie of 2001, The Fast and The Furious. His only bad (REALLY BAD?!) performance, and movie, for that, was A Man Apart. But this couldn't be that bad...could it? Defiently not. This is not a great film, but it's a pretty decent action/horror (definitely better than A Man Apart, anyway). It's reasonably exciting as well, and it's only dragged down slightly by the occasional corny script. The fact is, although this may disappoint some horror fans, it definitely serves as a welcome antidote to a stressful day. Silly, dumb fun, Pitch Black is a above average thriller that will probably please most Diesel Fans.<br/><br/>Final Analysis: *** out of ***** (3 out of 5)"

I wish I hadn't bothered.<br/><br/>The odd thing is, a lot of people really like this movie. They think it's a low-key, suspense-filled sci-fi classic, in the mold of Alien. They're idiots, mind you. This is just dull.<br/><br/>The idea is that a ship crash lands on a strange planet, killing most of the crew. Among the survivors is Riddick, a murderer being transported back to justice. The planet in question has a strange arrangement of suns, such that there is perpetual daylight. The place is a constant desert. The survivors discover a ruined settlement where the previous inhabitants were all eaten. It seems there are aliens that live in the dark beneath the surface of the planet. And that's when the eclipse comes...<br/><br/>What follows is a story where the small band of scared humans tries to harness what little light they can while trying to repair a small spaceship to get them off the planet. And what about Riddick? Is he friend or foe? Well, I'll tell you what he's not: a very good actor. Vin Diesel grunts and rasps his way through this film with little or no effort at all. Sometimes he does a sort of evil chuckle which is really quite rubbish. And, for a film called Pitch Black, there is really quite a lot of light about, despite the supposed eclipse. While frantic extras are trying to huddle around a small flame from a Jack Daniels bottle, there's loads of light illuminating the hills behind them. Where's all that coming from?<br/><br/>Unscary CGI aliens, identikit cannon-fodder humans, poor one-liners. This is the sort of action movie I thought we had left behind.

","This film IS a cheap imitation of Alien, and ISN'T actually an excellent movie all round.   And a good indicator (for me), to what is a bad film, is when I just want it to end, and that's exactly what I thought, not even halfway through watching this.<br/><br/>It's hairthin plot, - spaceship crashes on a desert planet, and the survivors attempt to find a way off it by endlessly traipsing across sand dunes and deserted townships looking for another ship to fly home in (which is conveniently provided for them).  And then there are the alien creatures (uninventively handicapped by an aversion to light) who pose a constant threat to the would be space travellers during the night.  But in comes Vin Diesel (whom I havent seen in a decent film yet... yes, XXX sucked) who, averse to the light but, attired in his shades that look more like diving goggles, eventually comes to the aid of the others with his ability to see in the dark.<br/><br/>Anyway, in a nutshell, Pitch Black suffers from a poor script, a substandard cast (Radha Mitchells' American accent is one of the worst I've heard), but most importantly, an unoriginal premise, unsuccessfully rehashed.  It is substandard fare, prosaic with very little going for it except for some nice special effects here and there, but ultimately hard to sit through to the end."

","PITCH BLACK is a film that suffers from being "" overdirected "" . Overdirected ! What`s that Theo ? Overdirected is when the director goes over the top and starts getting overly intrusive on screen and tries to be the star of the movie . Examples of these films are NO BLADE OF GRASS , THE LIMEY , the CAPE FEAR  remake JFK , NIXON and possibly THE PLEDGE and TRAFFIC but whereas these films  had their good points or at least potential PITCH BLACK is nothing more than an irritating ALIEN clones B movie no matter how much David Twohy tries to disguise it . What`s with the MTV visuals ? or the picture turning to negative ? or the blue and yellow tints ? Why`s there slo mo scenes ? Can`t we watch a film without MTV gimmicks ? And has anyone noticed the amount of scenes where Riddick is in full view of everyone but no one seems to notice him ?<br/><br/>Talking of Riddick I couldn`t help noticing the amount of people praising his performance and well buffed physique which led me to believe the reason for the film`s popularity is down to females drooling over Vin Diesel ,ie for sexist reasons . But David Twohy evens up any sexist score by casting Radha Mitchell as the lead heroine , she`s well fit and the director knows it , notice the amount of times her character leans over exposing her ample cleavage . As a red blooded hetrosexist did I enjoy these cleavage scenes ? I sure did . Did these scenes endear the rest of the film to me ? No. PB still sucked<br/><br/>***** MAJOR SPOILERS AHEAD *****<br/><br/>As suffocating as the direction is it`s the script that`s the main fault of this lousy film . Some reviewers have pointed out the lack of logic and plot holes and I`m surprised more people haven`t because they`re so obvious you can`t miss them , for example what were this cosmopolitan band of humans doing on the spaceship in the first place ? If there`s no signs of any life then what have these flesh eating aliens been eating all this time ? An eclipse how inconvenient . Oh hold on the serial killer has had an operation a while back where he`s able to see in the dark , hey maybe he can read the future and found out he`d be crashlanding onto a planet populated by nocturnal flesh eating monsters . How convenient  , as is the fact that these monsters suddenly turn into cannibals every time the humans are low on light and it`s also very strange the amount of scenes there are where it`s very dark and no one gets attacked compared with the amount of scenes where people are attacked when it`s not so dark . Oh and you just know that the serial killer won`t kill anyone unless they`re a corrupt law enforcer and will make it all the way to a sequel. Hmmm , just how distasteful is that ? the serial killer survives while anyone commiting the sin of wanting to stay alive meets with a brutal end .<br/><br/>Did I like anything about this film apart from Ms Mitchell`s breasts ? Not really except the alien sound effect which seems stolen from DOCTOR WHO . Watch the 1973 adventure PLANET OF THE DALEKS and compare the jungle sound FX to the ones used here. They both sound identical"

","Why do so many writers insist on taking a fairly good sci-fi story and screwing it up by creating an air-headed, dizzy, incapable female lead character, then casting a female actor who can't act? Then, to make matters worse, they create some sub-characters who are not only ridicules, but actually detract from the main story. I guess they need victims (food) for the monsters. This is a good sci-fi story with all the right elements and a strong male lead. However, it falls short in the female lead and in the minor characters."

","Topline is that if you are a Vin Diesel fan, don't bother reading this review; just go and watch the movie. If not, read why you shouldn't waste your time on this.<br/><br/>This is a slipshod action/adventure science fiction movie that does neither science nor fiction right. Get this straight through you before you sit down to watch it: This movie was made for one and one reason only, which is to massage the larger-than-life survivalist persona of Richard B. Riddick (the comic character) and the bossy persona of Vin Diesel (the actor). Everything else is in deference. Fan worshippers of Riddick and Diesel will doubtlessly be enthused--even fascinated--as other things probably won't matter to them, while the rest will be disappointed.<br/><br/>Plot: A spaceship carrying the prisoner Riddick crash-lands on an unknown planet where survivors face-off with herds of alien creatures who hunt only at night. Guess what, a solar eclipse is just around the corner.<br/><br/>Needless to say, Riddick does the lion's work of fighting the aliens and dispatches them to their deaths with corny disdain and one-liners while others end up being meal. Invincibility is always forced upon the lead role whenever it becomes larger than the whole movie.<br/><br/>Visual effects aren't much with first half significantly better than the second. Alien design is nothing to moon over either. For most part, the feeling that I was staring at a cardboard set and not an exoplanet hung heavy on my mind. Poor job by camera department.<br/><br/>Most characters are boring and have nothing useful to contribute to the story. Dialog is average with few one-liner comebacks allocated to Riddick.<br/><br/>Movie's plot is nothing fresh; entire Alien franchise was built upon it. Problem is it has too many holes. Rules are set in the beginning for planet's environment and alien creatures but are subsequently flouted with impunity. Writing is banal and barren.<br/><br/>Worst part of the movie is its action sequences which suffer from shaky camera and too many cut scenes, making it impossible to make sense of anything on screen until the flurry of movements stops. This is a deceptive tactic that many filmmakers use to conceal their lack of skills and imagination. When you don't know how to choreograph a scene, bury the action with fast moving visuals.

I don't mind using my imagination but I think this movie requires just a bit too much... in a universe this size, some things are just too convenient:<br/><br/>It just so happens that there is a planet waiting for a crash land after micrometeorites damage the vessel irreparably.<br/><br/>It just so happens that it has a breathable atmosphere, pressure and temperature are within tolerable limits to sustain human life.<br/><br/>It just so happens that the landing site is flat, soft and free of obstacles.<br/><br/>It just so happens that on a planet so large that they crash land within walking distance of an apparently abandoned installation from previous visitors.<br/><br/>It just so happens that the previous visitors left behind a near fully operational spaceship escape craft. <br/><br/>It just so happens that they crash land almost exactly at the time the 22year periodic eclipse occurs so that the hungry monsters can come out to play..<br/><br/>implausibility rating : maximum .... but if you accept the convenient factor necessary to make an exciting storyline, and the rest is well done."
"dr_foreman","4","1","4","24 May 2007"," sorry, folks, but it's distinctly mediocre sci-fi
","I love ""B"" science fiction...but I don't love ""Pitch Black."" The first half of the film is turgid junk, and the second half - while exciting - feels like a sub-sub-sub-standard version of ""Jaws 2."" In other words, you've seen this kind of scary movie a million times before, and it was done better 900,007 of those times.<br/><br/>I must confess that Vin Diesel is an arresting screen presence, and Radha Mitchell is as lovely and compelling as ever. They often carry the movie when the expletive-ridden script falls completely flat.<br/><br/>Aside from their performances, though, there's not too much to recommend this movie. The villainous creatures look like exactly what they are - modest special effects - and fail to generate sufficient tension.<br/><br/>Really, the most intriguing aspect of the film (to me) is that it features several religious Muslim characters, which is practically unheard of for Hollywood. But, as you can tell, I'm really stretching to find points of interest if I'm reduced to remarking on that.<br/><br/>Amazingly, this bog-standard movie was followed by two sequels - one animated, and the other a shiny CGI spectacle. Together, they form the so-called ""Riddick Trilogy"" - which will, unless I miss my guess, never become the ""Riddick Tetralogy."" We must be thankful for small mercies."

"jimbo-53-186511","3","1","5","7 January 2017"," Pitch Black is another example of a film where the special FX are the real stars of the show
","A transport ship carrying around 40 passengers crash-lands on an unknown planet and only 11 people survive the crash. The survivors of the crash are initially concerned about one of the survivors of the crash namely Richard B Riddick (Vin Diesel) as he is a dangerous and violent criminal that they have been transporting who manages to set himself free after the crash. However, when the planet that they crash-land on is plunged into a month-long period of darkness, the survivors soon learn that Riddick may be their only hope of survival when a group of flesh-eating aliens try to take them all out one by one...<br/><br/>To me, Pitch Black is an example of a potentially good film that unfortunately has been placed in the hands of the wrong director. In order to work, films like Pitch Black need to have tension, suspense, dynamism and strong characterisation and it's clear from a very early stage that you are not going to get any of that here.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is clearly trying to set itself up as a modern day Alien type film, but Twohy has none of the skills that Ridley Scott or James Cameron were able to serve up with the first two Alien films. I'll admit that the first 20 minutes or so were relatively suspenseful, but it's clear that after Twohy's rather clichéd 'cloak and dagger approach' in respect of introducing Riddick to the story that he had nowhere really to go and completely fails to develop or improve upon the story. When watching Pitch Black there is just no spark, no dynamism and nothing interesting about the story or the characters. Even the character of Riddick is poorly developed and I'm sure that he could have been made more interesting with a better director or writing crew.<br/><br/>The last few lines in the above paragraph really sum up the problems with this film; if your narrative's success is dependent on its characters then it's generally a good idea to make at least one or two of them interesting - this is what made Alien and Aliens both work because you cared about the characters and actually gave a damn about what happened, but in Pitch Black the characters are as lifeless as the planet that they crash-land on and if I'm honest I found it a bit of a struggle getting to the finish line with this one.<br/><br/>The performances aren't great either with no-one really making much of an impact (no pun intended). Vin Diesel should have been great in this sort of role, but I felt that he was slightly hampered by being a rather poorly written character. Everyone else here was just as bland and unmemorable.<br/><br/>One final thing that made me laugh about this film is its ridiculous plot contrivance; our prisoner happens to have had his eyes surgically altered so that he can see better in the dark after being denied sunlight for lengthy periods. He then finds himself crash-landed on a planet that ends up being plunged into darkness for a month??? I can suspend some disbelief, but that is quite a ridiculous coincidence don't you think??? <br/><br/>Pitch Black is rubbish, but it's not even enjoyable rubbish and in my opinion you're better off watching either Alien or Aliens because they at least are both entertaining, tense and rewarding pieces of cinemas which are qualities that certainly cannot be attributed to Pitch Black."

","A spaceship with various colorful characters crash-lands on an alien world full of monsters who come out in the dark and try to eat them. Lots of chasing and fighting ensues while tensions rise between a law-enforcement man, a criminal, Muslims on a pilgrimage, and a selfish pilot.<br/><br/>That's it for the plot. Being a visually exciting sci-fi action movie from Hollywood, you would expect to be entertained. And you are, but you end up feeling like you just had a very cheap one night-stand.<br/><br/>The elements of the story are all inferior copies (extreme dark planet cycles from Nightfall, monsters from Alien, dangerous but helpful outsider from Waterworld), there is never any feeling of an impressive imagination at work or that they sat down to work out the ideas. In other words, a copy-paste quick blockbuster.<br/><br/>Beware spoilers: <br/><br/>The writing is unforgivably lazy and terribly coincidental: They land on a huge planet right next to a previous colony, they land exactly at the end of a 22 year cycle, they crash land on a hard surface but survive, etc.<br/><br/>The monsters never make any sense: They are hyper-sensitive to light but pull a man off the surface in broad daylight, they evolve on a planet that is mostly light but can't stand any light, they have nothing to eat except each other, they fight each other when in flight but somehow live in claustrophobic caverns for years, they attack only the people that the writers want to get rid of, and they give birth to light-emitting babies? <br/><br/>And on a personal note, any movie that kills off Claudia Black early is simply stupid."

","PITCH BLACK / (2000) **<br/><br/>Starring: Vin Diesel, Radha Mitchell, Cole Hauser, Keith David, Lewis Fitz-Gerald, and Simon Burke Directed By David N. Twohy. Written by Jim and Ken Wheat. Running time: 108 minutes. Rated R (for violence and language).<br/><br/>By Blake French: <br/><br/>	""Pitch Black"" probably combines over a dozen horror clinches and surprisingly ends up providing us with a premise that is somewhat original. The only reason it fails is because, of all the recycling this film attempts, it forgets to include message, moral, and depth. The concepts are too simplified. This requires the audience to park their brains at the theater entrance before they will be able to thoroughly enjoy the production.  Whenever a story requires no logic or thought, the writers, Jim and Ken Wheat, show sings of laziness. If they cared about the film's overall theme they would have further developed certain conflicts, characters, and notions in a method that relates to the story. That would demand hard work and long hours, however, and that is something the ""Pitch Black"" filmmakers would rather replace with special effects and computer animated visuals. <br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" takes place in the future as a high tech space ship blasts through the outermost layers of the galaxy. This space vessel is carrying an assortment of passengers. Most of these characters have one syllable names that are easy to shout out loud. They include Fry (Radha Mitchell), a determined woman and unwilling leader after the captain is killed, Johns (Cole Hauser), a morphine addicted  bounty hunter, Imam (Keith David), a Muslim who coexists with three youthful pilgrims, Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald), an antique merchant, Shazza (Claudia Black), a geologist, Jack (Rhianna Griffith) an influential teenager, and Riddick (Vin Diesel), a muscular convicted killer who has night vision. <br/><br/>	As the movie opens, the space craft crashes on an obsolete planet where there appears to be no food or water. (We never really learn what made the vessel plummet to an uncharted land mass, or receive much character development.) The survivors then learn that Riddick, whose intentions may be murderous, has escaped from concealed captivity. The crew then discovers the remains of a desolate assortment of people who may have crash landed here around twenty years ago. Without further ado, an unknown creature mutilates a crew member. They later learn that aliens inhabit the planet but are afraid of the light. So, no problem, right. How can carnivorous invertebrate that are terrified of bright substances cause a threat in a world with three suns? The filmmakers place the characters in a time era in which a solar eclipse is prone to occur. Their only hope: racing across the planet to find several fuel cells that belong to a spacecraft that will take them out of their horrible experiences. <br/><br/>	Isn't it kind of coincidental that the luminous body in which the band collapses contains oxygen; the only mistrusting character is able to see in the dark as a solar eclipse befalls; an eclipse just happens to transpire at the worst time? I also question the aliens' presence. They are frightening and well crafted. However, why do they kill the astronauts? Do they feast upon their physical existence? If so, what did the creatures eat for twenty years after the last victimized crew crash landed. The selected planet contains no vegetation, recourses, other animals, or even water. It is a deserted desert-like landscape. So how do they manage to survive--especially being afraid of light on a planet with three suns? Why do they fear the light? Perhaps they chow on each other? There is a sequence in the film where the aliens attach and kill one another--but why? Nothing here is answered or clarified.<br/><br/>
 The characters in ""Pitch Black"" are your usual monster movie characters, some lacking personality and interest, and others who have no construction of shape, all whose instincts are instantly obvious. The picture does have enough intelligence to become fearless in its victimizing. It's not alarmed to pick off any of the characters--even some of the big starring roles are killed. I am impressed to witness some decent and well-cast performances here. Although the filmmakers do not take advantage of Vin Diesel's physical composition, he handles the role of a secondary villain with endurance and strength. The rest of the cast also performs with appropriate character traits.<br/><br/>There is a sequence in ""Pitch Black"" where a mesmerizing collage of spellbinding visual effects makes a solar eclipse. This visually arousing sequence combines of the best technology of special effects I have ever witnessed. The movie is smart with the construction of the aliens, and we are able to induce our imagination a little with those creatures. In a movie of such piercing optical stimulation, however, it should have not wasted time in developing a human conflict, although it interacts with the character twists and adds a nice touch, but evolved more on the interesting alien beings. But ""Pitch Black"" does not take advantage of either component.<br/><br/>

","Right from the opening I knew I was going to end up hating ""Pitch Black"" just because I have a unfair lack of interest for the sci-fi genre. So we're in a space shuttle and everything seems all futuristic and weird, the camera's making a lot of use out of the hand-held, shake to create a feeling of panic and we crash land on this deserted planet with three suns, creating an extremely off-putting filter, you'll be wishing it would just hurry up and turn pitch black! <br/><br/>The filters are really awful and in bad taste, the range from an over exposed goldy filter to a strange black and white looking blue filter which doesn't really make sense, it's as if the directors just putting them there because he can. We are then introduced to far too many characters that we lose track of and therefore don't particularly care about! The least one being the ""hero"" Riddick, played by the lack-luster Vin Diesal who thinks that he looks cool by wearing swimming goggles in the middle of the desert! I thought he was about to jump into a pool or something! Anyway, he's annoying and egotistical there's no way we can like him especially as the other characters make out he's the bad guy anyway!<br/><br/>After a long wait (about an hour) the film eventually revs up a bit, the planet plunges into darkness so we can get rid of the blinding filters and we're treated to poorly animated aliens and the film then plays out as one big rip-off of ""Aliens"" in the dark! This swarm of creatures attack the group as we egg them on to, however Imust admit there were times of excitement and some parts were well-paced.<br/><br/>But when all is said and done ""Pitch Black"" is ""Aliens"" with a clunky screenplay and just plain weird directing! It's full of unlikable characters and an empty ending. Although there are times of suspense and exciting action, there needs to be more substance to find it engaging."

Director David Twohy does his best but the screenplay is just another retread of Alien. Characters are airheads who fall victim to special effects. Only Vin Diesel as a captured criminal seems fitted for better material. He will attempt to lead them out of danger while winning over the airhead heroine and her band of merry men. We know that he will survive and that many of the others will not because they are morons. Radha Mitchell, Keith David and Cole Hauser play idiots. These creatures are afraid of light so when these morons band together to haul electric lights one idiot breaks from the group thus savaging the lighting. It is not difficult to guess his fate but it is likely that he came in last in any academic programs growing up because he is bloody stupid.

This movie is essentially a movie comprised of better films! Alien comes to mind immediately when you watch this film. It does have a mind of its own, and there are things to enjoy about this movie. The production design is very impressive, as are the special effects. The creatures are unsettling and offer up plenty of suspense. They did what they could with the modest budget, and I thought they did a good job for the most part. The movie is pretty serious, but there a few times where the humor shines. My favorite is when the crew keeps looking for Riddick, but Riddick keeps one-upping them. There is gore, but a lot of it consists of CGI. I prefer the real thing. The acting is very solid. Vin Diesel will never be considered a great actor. That being said, he has the presence. Riddick is the perfect anti-hero, and I enjoyed Vin's show. His body language is perfect. He is the main reason why I enjoyed a lot of this movie. He was a blast to watch. Radha Mitchell does fine as the heroine. She showed off toughness when needed, as well as the right amount of vulnerability. She conveyed all emotions perfectly. Cole Hauser does what he does best, play a jerk. He's good at it! Keith David is very awkward as the religious person. He's annoying, preachy and has an awful accent to boot. <br/><br/>I had a decent time with Pitch Black.

","I recently saw the 2013 ""Riddick"" movie, and enjoyed it for the type of Sci-Fi entertainment that it is. But it is obvious that there must be some story preceding this one, so I looked up the earlier movies. Fortunately I found 3 of them on a 2-disk DVD set at my local public library. <br/><br/>This one, ""Pitch Black"", was the first in the series. It starts after criminal (Vin Diesel as) Richard B. Riddick has been captured by a bounty hunter and is being transported, along with a number of non- criminal passengers, via spaceship to a distant penal planet. It is far enough that everyone is placed in a type of cryo suspended animation state and the ship is on some sort of automatic trajectory and the crew would be awakened as they neared the destination. <br/><br/>The spaceship encounters some unexpected debris, probably some asteroid remnants, that pierce the hull and causes it to lose pressure as they near an unknown planet. They get sucked into its gravitational field and as the hull starts to burn we know there must be oxygen in the atmosphere. After a very rough landing which destroys the spaceship and kills most occupants, a core of 10 survive, including Riddick and Radha Mitchell as pilot Carolyn Fry. The bounty hunter is Cole Hauser as William J. Johns.<br/><br/>Most of the movie involves these crash survivors trying to survive on a hostile planet. They end up involving Riddick in the escape attempt as he has skills they need. The planet is occupied by some vicious alien creatures that only come out when it is pitch black, and are very efficient killers. They find remains of a geologic expeditions 22 years earlier, plus a small spaceship that they may be able to use as an escape vehicle if they can get it in working shape.<br/><br/>I always imagined Australia to be an uninviting place, and it sure looks like it in this movie filmed in various locations that look like an alien planet. This earlier movie is not up to the standards of the most recent one, but is still entertaining.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: In the end a few more die at the hands of the alien creatures, including Johns and Fry, but Riddick and a couple of others manage to avoid death and the movie ends as their spaceship has taken off and is headed away from the planet."

The movie has great visuals and great special effects. the only problems i really have with this film are the characters and the beginning. i thought the film had a bit of a slow start when the spaceship crashes on a strange planet. as for the characters i thought they could have been developed a little more. some were developed and some weren't. I thought Vin diesel was great as Riddick and i thought his character was cool he's an escaped convict and a killer.I also really liked Radha Mitchell in this film i thought her acting was good and i found her character likable and interesting. I also found the Riddick character interesting, the character had a certain mys-teak about him which is probably why i found him interesting.Another thing i found interesting about Riddicks character is that he could see in the dark with his strange bright eyes,i thought that was a cool idea for a movie.<br/><br/>I liked the idea of a group of people all being stranded out on a forbidden planet and having to survive. you have these Arab men and two women a few other men,some kid and of course Riddick,and the kid seemed to like Riddick and find him interesting and i thought it was funny the way the kid kept copying Riddick and wearing sunglasses just like him. I just found this film quite exciting especially later on in the film because we are introduced to these Evil winged Creatures which i found fascinating. these creatures only come out during the night which is another good idea the writer had. so the group of people are safe while the sunlight is out but the moment the sun goes down that's when everyone is put in danger and everyone will have to work together to survive and escape and i really like that idea its a good idea for a sci-fi movie and i Love sci-fi films which is probably why this film appealed to me because it has all the right elements to make an exciting story.<br/><br/>I thought the film was Written and Directed very well.The film is sometimes suspenseful and even a little creepy at times during the night scenes. the creatures were creepy and i thought they had a fantastic design and they looked very ferocious. all the people had to run and hide from these creatures. i must say i found the creatures very interesting and they were cool to look at.some people get killed by the creatures and some survive and the key to surviving is to stay in the light because later in the film they find out the creatures don't like light, so they carry lights around with them to keep the creatures away. <br/><br/>Vin Disel had some really cool dialogue and some really cool BadAss moments in this movie. there was a very cool scene toward the end of the film were Riddick killed this creature when he saw it attacking Rada Michelle. Riddick just went crazy! and knocked the stuffing out of the creature! and stabbed it repeatedly! and i love the line of dialogue he gave after. (It did not know who it was f**king with!.) that was one of the coolest moments in the movie and that is definitely one of my favourite scenes of his.<br/><br/>All in all i thought this was a Fun sci-fi movie. I like Radha Mitchell and i like Vin diesel and if you want me to be honest i think the guy is a Badass in every film he's in.the guy always plays cool characters and in this film he's kind of like an anti hero which is interesting. to sum things up is this film perfect, No but its one hell of a good Movie its one that i found very exciting and involving and i got sucked into the story,and anyone that hasn't seen this film should definitely give it a watch i thought it was a very well made sci-fi film."

","This is a cool sci-fi flick that still holds up today, despite the slight corniness. The main standout aspect of this movie is of course the introduction of a iconic badass anti-hero named Riddick. This film has two stages. The first is when the ship crash lands on a planet with creatures that are afraid of the light. And Riddick escapes from the ship and everyone is on a manhunt for Riddick. The main disappointment with this, is the fact that Riddick gets caught easily. Especially when most of the people in the ship are tourist. The second stage is Riddick and the crew trying the survive and get off the planet. Few parts seem underdeveloped but overall this is a cool and fun sci-fi flick. Thanks to a dangerous, formidable and interesting anti-hero Riddick. Riddick is this stealthy badass ninja like character that can see in the dark. And a lot of the interest comes from not being sure the level of his conscience. This is Vin Diesel's first iconic movie character for a reason, and Vin nails it. To be honest I wouldn't be shocked if the makers of Kratos from ""God of War"" was inspired by the character Riddick when designing the game.<br/><br/>7.4/10"

It's actually the mystery surrounding the character, not knowing what he's really up to and if he has moral values or where they lie.<br/><br/>While Riddick does takes stabs at religion, the director and the movie itself do not really show any indication they have anything against it.

","Director David Twohy and scenarists Ken & Jim Wheat have fashioned a grim, claustrophobic but exciting sci-fi, horror chiller about a commercial vessel in space that is struck by meteor shower. Not only is the ship Hunter-Gratzner knocked out of its shipping lane, but also the captain dies. The spacecraft crash lands on a desolate planet inhabited by some weird looking creatures that can fly, resemble Pterodactyl with forked tails, and have hammerhead-shaped heads with a mouth full of steak knife teeth. These ravenous critters will munch you in a minute and they will even eat each other if the occasion arises. Our heroes are the ship's surviving pilot, Kyra (Radha Mitchell), a bounty hunter named Johns (Cole Hauser), Muslim Imam (Keith David), a little boy masquerading as a little girl named Jack (Rhiana Griffith), and convict Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel) who is in restraints. They locate an alternate spaceship to get them off the planet. Other than being a convict, Riddick is a little different because he can see in the dark. One by one these characters are whittled down by the ugly monsters. Part of the problem is that we never get to clearly see what the lethal bird-like monsterys. Twohy stages with action with enough expertise and never lets up on the suspense. Vin Diesel is perfectly cast as an murderer with a gravel voice. There are enough surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat."
"Al_The_Strange","7","0","2","7 September 2013"," ""You're not afraid of the dark, are you?""
","When a starship crash-lands on an arid, desert planet with three suns, the survivors are left in quite a predicament: should they fear the serial killer who's been let loose among them, or fear the monsters systematically stalking them from the dark? Pitch Black is a pretty unique thriller, and a lot of it is in its visual storytelling: it's a brutal universe with oppressive planetscapes, freaky alien monsters, and a whole cast of cut-throat characters.<br/><br/>However, the film has always felt like a mixed bag to me. A lot of it is simply because it's split evenly down the middle. The first half of this film is a survivalist story, with the characters moping around, getting their bearings, and trying to figure out what to do with themselves. With some hushed dialogue and so many character beats to run through, these acts can be rather dry. When the solar eclipse finally hits and all the nocturnal beasties come out, things pick up quite a bit, with frequent chases, fights, and thrills. The experience is marred by the film's style though: a lot of the more exciting parts have some of the most erratic editing and flashing images ever put together, and it can be unnerving.<br/><br/>The film does tell an inherently interesting story though. Most of the characters are pretty dry and flat alien fodder, but one character stands out: Richard B. Riddick, the strong-bodied low-voiced serial killer who doubles as both the story's nemesis and hero. His progression as the anti-hero provides the best dynamics to the story, and it is ultimately interesting how this dark character is pitted against such dark monsters (in essence, using a monster to fight monsters). The film overall is pretty decent and original sci-fi material, but aside from Riddick, it doesn't really have many characters to like or root for.<br/><br/>This film does its best to be stylish and hip. It boasts some pretty decent photography, but it gets really erratic with the editing at spots, using a few too many flashing images and fast cuts for my tastes. Weird color schemes are also dispensed liberally throughout the film's first half. Acting is okay: everybody plays it tough in this picture, especially Vin Diesel, whose performance matches up pretty well with the character. Writing is not bad. This production has okay-looking sets, props, costumes, and locals. Some of the special effects haven't aged well, despite being well-conceived. Music is pretty standard.<br/><br/>This film has an unrated director's cut available on DVD and Blu-Ray, which offers a few extra minutes of dialogue and character-building scenes. To me, the differences between the director's cut and theatrical cut is very slight, and I find it hard to really tell them apart.<br/><br/>There is a lot to like about Pitch Black, except for the supporting characters, some of the long drama, and the gaudy editing. Horror and sci-fi fans should enjoy it the best, but for most, I'd recommend it as a rental.<br/><br/>3.5/5 (Entertainment: Pretty Good | Story: Pretty Good | Film: Pretty Good)"
"Bruce722","8","0","2","5 September 2013"," One of the best sci-fi/horror films of all-time.
","Pitch Black meshes the sci-fi/fantasy genre with the horror genre better than any other movie, including Alien. Vin Diesel's character is amazing. His highly questionable moral compass combined with a strange sense of principles creates a very interesting character dynamic. The supporting cast is solid too, with Radha Mitchell possibly seeing even more screen time than Diesel's Riddick. The cinematic effects, however, are what make this movie stand out. The camera effects are sometimes a little overdone but the color palette used throughout most of the film is done to great effect. The plot suffers from a couple of clichéd episodes of stupidity that plague almost all movies (most notably Paris' ridiculous act towards the end). It also wraps up a bit too suddenly. It feels like the movie is building towards a climax and it ends rather abruptly. Nonetheless, this is an instant cult classic that has held up well over the years and I highly suggest checking it out."
"AMar_rom","Null","0","2","9 July 2013"," Pitch Black is such a big surprise
","Pitch Black is a sci-fi adventure with strong horror elements.<br/><br/>We initially see a spaceship crashing on a remote planet due to a malfunction. The survivors include the notorious (but wrongly accused) convict Richard B. Riddick (played extremely well by Vin Diesel) his guards and several other travelers, entrepreneurs, a father and his sons in search of a better life. The planet appears at first uninhabited but soon the survivors discover human-made installations but no sign of life. Eventually they come to the conclusion that the previous occupants had to abandon the planet for some unexplained reason.<br/><br/>Pitch Black is clearly a film that takes certain elements from the 'Alien' trilogy, especially the presence of extraterrestrial specie(s) that attack humans. There is also a considerable drama and tension here between the actors. Richard B. Riddick is a multi-faceted character whose ability to see in darkness and survival skills prepare him better and help him to assess the dangerous situations much sooner than anybody else. The other survivors have to work together with Riddick in order to make it through and escape. The exploration of the planet (at least near the crash site) was also very nicely shown. <br/><br/>This film was a big positive surprise for me. It was also a very good introduction of the Richard B. Riddick character that we saw again in the more ambitious but less satisfying 'The Chronicles of Riddick' in 2004."

","The opening scene starts off action filled as we watch a cargo ship carrying a group of diverse passengers run through a meteor storm. Its all the assumed captain Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) can do to try and land the ship in one piece. While the passengers gather their wits they learn they are stranded on a desert planet with a convict, Richard B. Riddick (Vin Diesel), a cop, Johns (Cole Hauser) and no water. After a death and a sighting they realize they are not alone on this planet and trying to find a way off becomes a priority. As the story unfolds they learn that every 22 years the planet goes through an everlasting darkness and as fate would have it, that time is now. The crew not only struggles with what the darkness brings but they struggle with themselves as they fight to survive, with their hero coming from an unlikely source.<br/><br/>Every actor fit their respective characters to a ""T"". They portrayed exactly what director David Twohy was trying to get across. They each have their own little story surrounding them and integrated it into the flow of the movie spot on. The character development is so in tune with the events of the movie you feel a connection with the characters as they progress. You watch as they all start out as somebody but transform into somebody else at the end of the film. <br/><br/>The cinematography and lighting throughout the movie is exceptional. The planet they are stranded on actually has three suns, each with their own set of colors mixed on the different pieces of scenery.<br/><br/>Onto the aliens. They are original, creative, well designed for their environment and extremely ruthless. Their origin is unclear but their intentions are well known. They destroyed everything on the planet and are blood thirsty for more. Their mouth full of large teeth, ability to fly and movement/echo based vision easily put them at top of the food chain.<br/><br/>Pitch Black quickly entered into my top 15 of favorite movies after viewing it. It has something for everybody. Very well written, sci-fi feel to it, action and some gore. Its the type of movie you can sit down and watch many times over. I can't recommend it enough."

","Pitch Black is science-fiction movie with space monsters, and as with every other such flick, it's a bad rip-off of Alien.

The creatures are poorly designed with bad CGI to boot. The lighting is wrong most of the time. The characters are at best unidimensional. The ""natural outdoor"" set pieces obviously fake when it comes to rock formations. The story is extremely simple, and finally, the scenario as well as its implementation have a number of logical flaws.<br/><br/>Then, what has it going for itself? Well, the mood for one is excellent, its strange and tight. The main ideas about the setup, how the characters go there, and the environment, are refreshingly interesting. The fact that the action takes place in the dark and mostly without sets is a stroke of pure. genius. Now, if only they could have made the lighting ""real"", to correspond with the light sources available, it would have been perfect, and the mood entrancing.<br/><br/>If you're a sci-fi lover, it would be worth a watch, it's different.

","Pitch Black is entertaining, but it feels underdone . It is a great looking film, no doubt there. Twohy has a great eye for color shape and texture, and he directs the film quite nicely, with a mindset toward mystique and subtlety, (which helps generate shock moments, because they come harder). However, there are still a lot of blanks to fill in. The storyline is shallow, and the characters (despite being likable people) are poorly defined, especially Vin Diesel. There is also a fairly strong sense of anti-climax. When all is said and done, Pitch Black is entertaining as a sci-fi, but it could probably use some energy, and a slightly stronger screenplay."
"immanji","10","0","1","30 January 2010"," Vin Diesel gives a good performance here
","To start with, I'd like singling out Vin Diesel because he gives a stand-out performance here. Most notably in the warm-intimate to cold-interrogating scenes. He commands the screen when it comes down to it. Even in his short monologues, he holds your attention with paralyzing coolness. I would not say that the special effects to be excellent throughout, but there sure are times of beauty and artistry. Such as the Landscape-like scenes of the alien world; and then there are minor things that don't get much credit but add to the visual recipe of this marvelous movie. I enjoyed the scariness of this film and the science fiction idea; but it is the character development that is the most impressive and lasting element of this film. It took some time for me to watch this film (A&E not the movies) and it is one of my favorites. Again, it has strong character development, SOME good special effects, and overall it is a Very good movie that works."

They float over what looks like a black hole, but which I guess is intended to show a planet with rings and a large moon or planet (?).<br/><br/>The spaceship flames into the planet/moon's atmosphere. Flames everywhere tearing the ship apart. The Captain jettisons entire compartments from the log and threatens to eject the passengers, as well - to save weight, 'tail-heavy', sumpin like that.<br/><br/>Eventually, the glass breaks and the flames hit her right in the face. Oh, yeah, spaceship lands. And she's fine - not even a blemish on her face. Miracle of miracles, or continuity of continuity error.<br/><br/>They find large dinosaur-like skeletons all over. And they find a base where some small crew had set up a small drilling rig. It's a breathable atmosphere, if a bit thin - which plot point is quickly discarded. Three moons, but not all at the same time.<br/><br/>And one of the passengers is Diesel. At first he seems a maniacal killer guarded by some marshall-type. Turns out he's a lunatic guarded by another lunatic playing at being marshall for the bounty on Diesel. Vin can also see in the dark. So is he the monster, the antagonist? Nope. The seeing in the dark comes into play when they discover that little corner of the planet is infested with man-sized flying killer bats, or whatever. They look more like the 'warrior bugs' from Starship Troopers, or least have that head but more a pterodactil's body. But they are stricken with any light source. So they 'only come out at night'.<br/><br/>The ringed planet causes an eclipse which just goes on and on, and all the flying critters take to the skies, thousands and thousands of them. The group find a small shuttle in need of some 'power packs'. Said packs are on their crashed ship. Shuttle is some distance away. It's dark. Critters flying - what to do? So they find whatever point light or glowing light they can find and set out. Diesel drags the power packs. The others stumble and bumble and cry and argue every step of the way. And of course they periodically fall down. Worse - it starts to rain (kid you not).<br/><br/>In fact, the whining and stumbling and delaying is so annoying that you start to root for the 'warrior bugs' to finish them off and for Diesel to get away. But there's something even worse than that. And that is, the Captain is always carrying on. And with the pitch black of the eclipse, she's always for going ahead here or going back there, and taking five minutes to make her point out where the 'bugs' can swoop down on her. And you keep saying to yourself - puh-lease . . swoop down . . end it already. She's suicidal, though the writers probably didn't intend it that way. And the happy ending is that as our annoying 'heroine' begins yet another five minute soliloquy about heroism and let's move forward and let's go back and I'm not afraid you're not afraid, choke, gasp, etc. one of the 'bugs' swoops in and stabs her, hangs around for half a minute so Diesel can look longingly into her eyes, and off it goes with her body. Yay! Thank you! Finally! Case ended. Diesel installs the packs. And he and the two remaining survivors take off and head for well-traveled space trading routes for a rescue.<br/><br/>Moral of the story. You can be weak and slow and stumble on obstacle courses with thousands of flying killer 'bugs' that can see you but you can't see them. That's okay. But to start a darned fireside chat every time you think of heading out to save the company, or going back to save them, that's what you do when you WANT the monsters to get you."

","This movie had some science fiction elements to it, and it did not look cheap in any way. However, it was a much more simple movie than the sequel and to me that made it better. It also helped that this movie did not totally focus on the Riddick character. Granted he was an interesting character, but the fact there was so much mystery with him is what made him so cool. In the sequel you just found out a lot more than you really wanted to. It also helps that this movie has more horror movie in it than anything else. I always enjoy a good science fiction horror movie and this one was another in a long line of good ones. The story as a ship that crash lands on a strange planet that is very hot as it has three suns. To add to the difficulty of the situation they are transporting a rather dangerous individual. Pretty soon he escapes and soon after someone dies. However, it is not the escaped prisoner, rather there seems to be something living within the planet, something that is hungry. The good news is these whatever they are do not come out in the harsh sunlight, so no problems right? Wrong! Even with the many suns the planet is about to go into a stage of darkness and the creatures are going to come out and feed. So they now have to rely on each other to escape and that includes the escaped prisoner who has had a special procedure done to make it so he can see in the darkness.

"vip_ebriega","6","0","1","21 June 2008"," All lights-off for ALIENS lite.
","My Take: Derivative yet entertaining. <br/><br/>Slick but inferior, David Twohy's PITCH BLACK, even with its slickness, is just another monster movie, and quite a decent one at that. Although it won't break the sci-fi barrier, even if it doesn't have an A-list cast and even without some great special effects work, it makes for a worthy twist to the age-old ALIENS formula. You know the set-up, a spaceship-load of passengers crash land on a desolate planet system. Without the benefits of communication and refuge, they are forced to fight for their lives against the planets hostile inhabitants, this in case, ALIEN lookalikes.<br/><br/>To benefit from the charisma of the lead character of the ALIEN films, PITCH BLACK also has a female heroine to lead the brigade of survivors. She's Carolyn Fry (Radha Mitchell) who assists a batch of plucky to bad-ass characters, including a convict named Riddick (Vin Diesel) who plays hero later on in the picture. They arrive on a bizarre world which has a strange weather condition: It's approaching a season where everything gets dark. The time where the planet's inhabitants, strange creeping Alien-types, start crawling out of their crawl-spaces and stalk everyone. You know the rest! There's not much plot to speak of, as the film goes on as a typical creature-feature then on. But the movie is not nearly as bad as it might be. Derivative enough, PITCH BLACK still satisfies as an enjoyable attraction, even as a simple time-passer. Diesel is a satisfying anti-hero, who actually proves he can act. He's cold and emotionless, but I guess that's a plus. There's no character development whatsoever, even if the film spends enough time with them. The plot is empty and derivative, but as a creature feature, the film is slick and enjoyable. Even if it's not quite as unbearably seat-gripping as those in ALIENS, Twohy manages to create suspense in the most unexpected of places. There's enough action and decent acting to provide a sufficiently enjoyable action fare.<br/><br/>Rating: *** out of 5."

Like all movies of this type, something horrible happens, in this instance, a spaceship carrying them on one leg of separate journeys, a handful of people survive, and they strike out to find out have to get off of the rock they've been stranded on. The catch? One of them is a stone cold killer, who has no regard for human life, and will kill them before he even introduces himself to them or the audience.<br/><br/>I know, that's a cliché of the most intimidating proportions, but you have to understand, the evil man that kills people isn't their biggest concern. Being stranded on a deserted planet with no signs of civilization isn't their chief concern. While digging graves for those who didn't survive, they stumble across what causes the desolation. That's when things get good. You see, Diesel's character, Riddick has a unique ability which, coupled with his incredible abilities to kill, can save everyone, or doom everyone.<br/><br/>Ultimately, this twist, along with a superb acting job from Vin Diesel, Cole Hauser, and Radha Mitchell. I know, Vin Diesel isn't known for his acting, but this role suits his skills. Namely, looking and talking tough.<br/><br/>All in all, throw in a superb unexpected ending, a thorough fleshing out of characters, and you have this little gem which almost launched a trilogy. Fortunately, the second iteration was so grandiose and extreme, it failed miserably in the box office. I say fortunately, because I sincerely don't like Vin Diesel."

","I think the best thing in the movie had to be that there was never any hope for these people to being with, you knew they weren't going to make it. Some may say that's not a good thing, but then you have the fun game of picking the ones who will live. Unlike a ""Final Destination"" movie where you know they are going to get killed off and you know who will live. <br/><br/>I like how the move doesn't tell you anything about what really is going on in the future, which make it easier to watch. If they had told us the year, the place and if aliens life had been found yet then it would have been harder to take in.<br/><br/>Riddick is rather a show off at the start of the film when he sneakily hides behind a bone and comes right up close to Fry without her knowing just to cut of a bit of hair. Also when he steals the seat from Paris (Lewis Fitz-Gerald) and drinks his drink.<br/><br/>The aliens in the film are quite amazing in the way they look and they way they move.

","This movie came as a nice surprise. I thought I had just about sampled everything: Strange worlds, beastly aliens, and the almost obligatory morphing. What else was left? Well, with 'Pitch Black' its more of the same. But the flavour and the texture are refreshingly original.<br/><br/>The opening moments are formulaic enough, but they're neat and accomplished. A spaceship in space - yes. Even the director didn't care for that, which is a good sign. But it's all okay, and the camera doesn't linger. There is a very well chosen music-score that has a satisfying metallic quality about it suggestive of catwalks and airlocks that bodes well for the rest of the movie. It immediately feels like a complete package - you're there, right with them, out in space. Excellent.<br/><br/>Vin Deisel has a rare and remarkable voice, it compares with that of James Mason or Richard Burton, and his silky, cynical narration at the outset carries a chill.<br/><br/>Things begin to happen very quickly. There are interesting angles on old effects. Tension and conflicts arise and develop well.<br/><br/>And that's how the movie proceeds. It's the old formula again: a group of people go somewhere remote and find something nasty they don't know how to deal with. But every take has a sly, new angle that keeps you guessing.<br/><br/>Some very clever work is done with light - there being a world in a planetary system with three suns. And the special effects, although by now almost certainly CGI, offer plenty to admire. A developing eclipse is extremely well-observed and fascinating to watch. Check-out the contra-rotating rings around the planet, and the aurorae in its high atmosphere. Someone put an awful lot of thought into this. It's one of the most visually beautiful events I have seen in a sci-fi movie. And I do assure you, I have watched it a lot of times.<br/><br/>The sudden appearance of the aliens is another surprise and spectacle. They go on to be suitably hideous and badly-behaved.<br/><br/>One of the other real treats is the disparity of characters and the quality of their acting. I am only slightly familiar with two of them, but they all give a sterling performance. They are the best case yet for using cheap, hungry unknowns rather than squandering megabucks on big-name stars who can ultimately do no better. The slick, terse script brings conviction to each player. You are moved to care for all of them, despite their obvious vices. And you come away wondering what you would do in their shoes.<br/><br/>On the surface of the planet, the incidental music changes to a kind of aboriginal percussion riff. It's simple, even minimalist, yet once again it suits the circumstances perfectly well.<br/><br/>The whole thing hangs together as a piece so well that movie-making looks easy. It's only when you see some of the other pigs that you realise it's not. This one isn't perfect, but I don't intend to nit-pick; I like it too much.<br/><br/>Excellent directing, good story, well-chosen music, solid script, believable acting, beautiful special-effects, sound and lighting. Just add popcorn."

The Terror From Beyond Space_ (and much more explicitly, too).<br/><br/>Acting is across-the-board solid, though Radha Mitchell has some trouble covering her Aussie accent (it doesn't affect her performance). The effects are good: in a way I have to admire a ""little"" film that simply processes various scenes in different-colored light -- to suggest the light of different stars -- as a ""special effect."" :^) I won't say anything about David Twohy's direction except to note that I have a very strong feeling he has a desperate crush on actress Radha Mitchell. The camera quite literally caresses her body, and especially her rear end, in a way that someone (not me) could describe as ""near pornographic."" Or maybe it's just my liking of short-haired blondes.<br/><br/>That said, there is no nudity in this film. Lots of blood and cussing and nerve wracking suspense, though.

"oshram-3","6","0","1","16 January 2005"," Not bad for a little cheapie matinée
","I got into this movie ass-backwards  basically, I went to see the sequel and then had someone lend it to me to watch on DVD. Pitch Black is the first movie in the 'Chronicles of Riddick' series, and while it has nowhere near the scope or vision of its follower, is nonetheless an enjoyable film, for what it is.<br/><br/>Part bughunt movie and part low budget sci-fi matinée, Pitch Black follows the story of a group of people stranded on a hot desert planet with three suns and only intermittent periods of darkness. Adding to the threat level is that one of the characters, Richard Riddick (Vin Diesel) is a prisoner, apparently a killer of some sort who cannot be trusted. One of the younger characters, Jack (Rhiana Griffith), takes a shine to him and begins imitating his every move, much to the dismay of his would-be jailer, William Johns (Cole Hauser). The group stumbles on a deserted mining colony and soon discovers there are evil nasties that only come out  you got it  after dark. When they need to make a run to an equally deserted outpost to obtain supplies to fix their damaged ship, however, that's when things get interesting.<br/><br/>Pitch Black isn't great film-making  it's a cheaper version of an Aliens flick, let's be honest  but the rough and gritty universe is fun, and the ambivalence of Riddick is fun to watch. As darkness sets in and his special ability to see in almost total blackness comes into play, people become more reliant on his uncaring character, which adds a nice twist to an otherwise average if serviceable script and story. Much of the meat of the story revolves around Riddick, which was a smart decision.<br/><br/>Diesel will never be considered a great thespian but he's fine here as Riddick, his basso voice and rough edges fitting into the harsh landscape and story perfectly. Keith David plays an Imam with an appropriately reverent air, and the rest of the cast all does a fine job.<br/><br/>Pitch Black's worth a rental, if for no other reason than to cast a little more back story on Riddick so you can enjoy the top-notch sequel a but better. It's a decent enough movie in its own right, though a little cheap and a little predictable. But as cheap sci-fi goes, it's pretty good."
"Antagonisten","6","0","1","14 January 2005"," Decent SF
","I saw this at a press showing in Stockholm back when it was first released. Back then i thought it was a decent Sci-fi action movie. Recently i saw it again on DVD (after seeing the horrible train-wreck of a sequel ""The Chronicles of Riddick"") and actually liked it more on the second viewing.<br/><br/>A ship containing a mixed group of settlers, traveling businessmen, pilgrims and one dangerous captive (and his captor) crash-land on a deserted planet. The planet is a desert wasteland and the survivors try to survive first the heat and then nasty beings that awake when all the planets' three suns are blocked by a total eclipse.<br/><br/>""Pitch Black"" is nothing special really. It doesn't break any new ground and is not very innovative. Rather the strong point of the movie in my opinion is how much they manage to make out of so little. The ingredients are simple. A crashed ship, a bunch of survivors with different skills, a dangerous convict that creates tensions in the group and finally an alien species bent on killing them. And considering how many movies are made with themes like this ""Pitch Black"" feels clearly above average. There is suspense, action, crappy one-liners and CGI to go around and it never really becomes boring.<br/><br/>Of course there are weak points as well. I have a hard time accepting Vin Diesel who becomes almost like comic relief with his deep voice and flexing muscles. Also the story is nothing to cheer about although i think it does the job.<br/><br/>I would recommend ""Pitch Black"" as a Friday night entertainment. It's a lightweight and entertaining no-brainer without being overly stupid or weak. But stay away from the sequel however, it's a completely different experience and shares nothing with this movie except the main character. Goes to show that a large budget can never get you farther than a good script. I rate this 6/10."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","6","0","1","27 November 2004"," A fun, disposable sci-fi flick
","I'm not a fan of Vin Diesel. His ego has inflated to a size his talent cannot match. He's better off in smaller movies and in smaller roles. I refuse to watch utter crap like xXx or A Man Apart but he's better than average in Pitch Black. <br/><br/>He plays Richard B. Riddick, a convict for massive, infinite crimes that are never defined in the slightest way. This was probably done to add mystery but I say it's bad writing. He's being transported on a spaceship on his way to spacejail but the ship crashes on a desert planet (as the original series of Star Trek proved, most planets are deserts) and he escapes.<br/><br/>But hold on, the planet is just entering an extended eclipse that only happens every 22 years. And when pitch blackness falls upon the nameless rock zillions of hungry bat-type thingies come out of hibernation to gobble-up whoever they can. So guess who the motely crew of survivors call on to help them.<br/><br/>Most of the film is simply going through the motions of killing the characters off one by one and it's nothing new. Sure it distracts one's attention for 110 minutes but it's nothing new or astonishing.<br/><br/>The best thing about the film is the presence of Keith David. Let's be honest, the man is 10 different kinds of cool.

","Pitch Black was the inauspicious ramp into public consciousness for both director David Twohy and star Vin Deisel. Although nobody knew who they were before Pitch Black, nobody who paid attention during the credits would forget later. Twohy has since gone on to direct several B-level features along similar lines, whilst Vin Deisel has gone on to appear in a number of upstart action franchises, for good or ill. Indeed, one of the features planned for next year is called Hannibal. What the hell, it cannot be any worse than the last film I saw that was called Hannibal.<br/><br/>In this rather strangely-plotted piece, Deisel portrays what appears to be a vicious criminal. It's only after we're introduced to the rest of the cast that we discover there is more than meets the eye. Once Riddick is introduced, we are given a shallow, but curiously engaging Aliens-style premise. The use of bleach bypass in order to make the desert of Coober Pedy look like an alien world was a master stroke. Indeed, Deisel aside, the real star here is the cinematography.<br/><br/>Keith David gets an underdeveloped, underutilised turn as a Muslim cleric who, in spite of having three tenths of nothing to say, is strangely sympathetic. As tragedy befalls him, his dialogues about faith and belief with Riddick give the whole affair an ironic undertone that is strangely enjoyable in spite of being at times a little too confronting. Don't bother looking for other big names in this feature, however. I think they must have pillaged every location they shot in to find people who will play the (very) minor characters. Their artificiality makes it clear that they are from the Antipodes, and they won't be working in much else any time soon.<br/><br/>According to the trivia entries, Pitch Black was shot in the same desert as Mad Max. This doesn't seem right, given that Mad Max was short in locations to the North of Melbourne. Mad Max 2 was shot in a place called Broken Hill, a bit of a ways away from Coober Pedy. In fact, no Mad Max film has ever shot in a Queensland location, and the only possibility would be Mad Max: Beyond Thunderdome being shot in Coober Pedy, which still makes this statement a little inaccurate (apparently more shooting on Mad Max 3 took place in New South Wales than South Australia, where Coober Pedy is).<br/><br/>Nonetheless, this film shows a clear reason why many productions are going to Australia rather than shooting in America or England. For one thing, in spite of all the horrid things I say about them, when an Australian in the film industry tells you they're going to keep quiet about your production, they mean it. George Lucas shifted production of his last and about-to-be-released Star Wars films to Australia for this very reason.<br/><br/>Another advantage of working in Australia, locations notwithstanding, is efficiency. An Australian crew can be trusted to get things done without delays or labour disputes, provided you don't abuse them. That shooting Pitch Black only took sixty days should convince one of this fact when they consider that films like this can often take twice as long. The film's estimated budget of a mere twenty-three million is also a mild shock when the opposed impressions of the shooting location and the strangely elaborate special effects are taken into account.<br/><br/>I gave Pitch Black a seven out of ten. It's not a classic, and it may not even be remembered in another ten years, but it is entertaining enough to watch a few times. This is an excellent example of how sometimes the smaller budgets produce better films. I'm glad I took the time to see it theatrically."

Diesel played Riddick, your average meathead/murderer/rebel/loose cannon/outlaw character. A generic Hollywood schmoe, Riddick was a convict, whom the crew of a crashed ship had agreed to free on the condition that he helped them escape the strange, hostile planet. He sulks around like a bitch on her period, acting tough and spinning cheesy one-liners. Yawn.<br/><br/>So, how much did this film want to be Alien? I score it 7/10 on the trying-to-be-like-Alien scale. I would give it full points, but the other three points were spent trying to be like Sphere. Man, this film just wanted to be every good sci-fi film, and instead just ended up recycling typical science fiction B-S. The writing was just lazy.

She's entering a foreign atmosphere with red heat completely enveloping the ship.  The window breaks and glass shatters all over her. There's no air, she recieves NO injuries, and she survived a super heated entry.

Even then, there were only 2 or 3 decent scenes with them.<br/><br/>#4- What's up with making Jack a girl? If they wanted her to be a female, they should have kept her as Jackie from the beginning. This revelation came out of nowhere, had no point, and gave no positive contribution to the movie whatsoever.<br/><br/>#5- The pilot, Carolyn, used a LOT of foul language. I wasn't offended by it, but it looked COMPLETELY forced. She does NOT look like somebody with a mouth like that. They would have been a lot better off if they either 1) Left the profanity out of her dialogue or 2) Had a ""harder"" looking woman play her role.

","I have seen Pitch Black two times and am still not sure that I completely understand everything that happened within it.  I saw this movie thinking that it was in the same vein of classics like Alien and Aliens.  However, it is a very intense sci-fi movie that is a lot more than it seems.  Many of the main characters seem like they may have a certain agenda, but they have underlying ulterior motives for their actions, which made it very interesting to see how they progressed throughout the film on the remote planet.<br/><br/>Radha Mitchell did a great job in the film as the crew's reluctant captain who at first wants to pitch the civilians in the spaceship in order to save herself and then learns to accept the leadership of the others that she has come to take charge of.  The other minor characters were good as innocent civilians placed in a dire situation to deal with.  But the film belongs to Vin Diesel as convict Richard B. Riddick, who manages to be menacing to the ship's passengers for the first half hour without even uttering a word. While this film does not showcase all of Diesel's talents, it proves that he is a rising star within Hollywood.<br/><br/>While I did enjoy this movie, there were a few plot holes that I couldn't seem to overlook.  How does Riddick know so much about these aliens on the planet?  How plausible is it that the spaceship would crash land on the planet on the very same day that an eclipse that happens once every 22 years occurs?  How in the world is Riddick able to stare down one of the aliens when any other character's heads would have been snapped off immediately? Why is it that these characters that need to stick together in such a dire circumstance always seem to be losing each other, always asking ""Where's so and so""?  And did you notice how quickly the sun(s) seemed to set in the movie?<br/><br/>Overall, entertaining, but a few minor plot holes.<br/><br/>7/10"

The fact is, it has nothing new to offer and a combination of dinosaur movies and sci-fi flick with poor characters.<br/><br/>***spoliers ahead****<br/><br/>Among the flaws, what immediately depressed me was the ordinariness of the planet (looks like earth), with breathable air and a deserted  colony with drinking water and food and a truck all ready and waiting, within walking distance of the crash site. A far cry from, say, Red Planet where an alien landscape was painstakingly presented. The adventurers face only one problem, to cope with the monster creatures which come out during the utterly dark eclipse period (which coincidentally happens exactly when they crash) and are scared of light.  The creatures are also typical Alien or Jurassic park rip-off's, looking like pterodactyls and dinosaurs. Sci-fi is really scraping the bottom of the alien barrel - cant they come up with something new?<br/><br/>Many of the scenes are simply not convincing, like the one where bottled glow-worms are used to scare off the creatures...jeeez you can barely see their glow.  In a planet brilliantly lit with 3 suns, I thought creatures having such an adverse reaction to even feeble light could not exist in the<br/><br/>first place. The characters are also generally pointless and shallow, with the typical Hollywood trend of glorifying serial killers as keen intellectuals.<br/><br/>This movie could have been better made as a thriller set on Earth without the sci-fi angle and avoided many flaws.

Extremely weak performances by much of the cast, excluding Vin Deisel (who portrays Rennick, a notorious convict)leave much to be desired.

","Yep-this was good. It's not ground breaking or anything (how many movies ARE?) but it's very entertaining for what it is- a romp through the world of SciFi. The characters were planned very well; because of this, the writers were able to make complex twists in the script based on the humans, and not just on the aliens (the humans were their own causes and effects, essentially). That's quite unique in the movie world- usually, characters are designed to REact, and never to actually think. Besides the writers, a lot of credit must be given to the actors (Vin Diesal especially; his work was, and still is, amazing). If the actors had failed to bring strength and attitude to their characters, all of the writing in the world would not have been able to save this movie.<br/><br/>Go rent this movie if you like Scifi, psychological thrillers, etc. Vin Diesal fans will also get a kick out of this! (spoiler) I might have solved one of the plot holes: What would the flying aliens eat if the humans hadn't shown up? Answer: themselves! They cannibalize, remember? They probably ate all the other inhabitants, so, now, they have to eat themselves! And, from the numbers of them, it wouldn't affect their population too much."

The survivors include an escaped convict (Vin Deisel), his captor, and a bunch of devout Muslims among others. This unlikely collection of people have to team up together when they realise that the planet they have landed on not only has no water, but it is also infested with a bunch of nasty aliens intent on eating them.

There is one good performance from Diesel, who was given a poor script and crap, newcomer co-stars with no potential or future. There are no scary or tense scenes in the film, just a mix of moving shadows, slimy tenticles and objects going through people's stomachs, which isn't disgusting at all, just, embarrassing, try-hard horror.

","My neighbor told me ""Pitch Black"" had been well reviewed, so we were both looking forward to it.  Within half an hour of the start of the film, after we'd both started snickering at the trite dialogue, unnecessarily flashy cinematography and editing, and mediocre to below average acting, he admitted he must have been thinking of a different film. ""Pitch Black"" feels like it was written by talented 18 year-old boys. While the plot is fairly complex, the characters are one-dimensional and cliched. Their motivations are sometimes incomprehensible, often engaging in the most irrational behavior simply to further a plot point.<br/><br/>For example, when the villain of the piece is bound and gagged, he seems to be capable of talking people into coming within arm's reach of him -- people who are then surprised when he attacks them.  Ding-dong!<br/><br/>And when two characters suddenly crawl out of their safe circle of fire and out into the dark, where they are attacked by the wild creatures that are chasing them -- why on EARTH would they do such a thing when they know their only safety is the light?  And the motivation for their doing so is SO WEAK as to seem contrived.  If you are surrounded by thousands of creatures nipping at your heels, and your only safety is the torches held by the rest of your group, there is NOTHING that would make you leave that group for even one second.  The stupidity of it all took me right out of the movie.<br/><br/>The dialogue was... well, it WANTED to be clever.  But you could FEEL it trying to be so.<br/><br/>There was also a definite lack of originality in some of the dialogue -- ""the 'company' wants us to do so and so"" seems to be lifted straight out of ""Alien.""  The tied up villain telling the female captain of the ship to ""come closer... closer..."" seems to be stolen from Hannibal's line to Clarece in ""Silence of the Lambs.""  The half-in-shadow lighting of the villain's bald head in the same scene, combined with his monotone mumblings, takes me right back to ""Apocalypse Now.""  Maybe this was supposed to be a ""tribute"" to these films.  My advice the filmmakers is to make their work good enough so other filmmakers will want to pay tribute to THEM.<br/><br/>The one saving grace -- although it doesn't quite save the picture -- is the special effects, which really are well done.  The pterodactyl-like creatures are quite well executed and genuinely creepy, and they were the sole reason I did get somewhat involved toward the end of the picture.<br/><br/>Had it not been for them, I would have given the picture 2 stars instead of the 4 I gave it."

We are also introduced to the crew of the ship, all one-dimensional characters who we could care less about.  Just for the heck of it, we also see children in danger.<br/><br/>Director by David Twohy, Pitch Black could have benefited from more chaotic, gripping scenes of the crew attempting to survive the hideous, stealthy beasts.  Instead, he tries to make the film brainy and it fails miserably. We are treated to excruciatingly dull dialogue interspersed with long pauses, outbursts of profanity, and gore aplenty.  Vin Diesel, the only actor amongst the sun-bleached cast, is the only one who comes off as somewhat intriguing and appealing, but it's mostly because of his physical attributes.  The special effects also fall curiously flat, with the aliens coming off as cartoons.<br/><br/>Pitch Black could have been a wild, thrilling, even scary movie if Twohy had decided to make the dialogue terse, added more action sequences, or given the characterizations more weight.
