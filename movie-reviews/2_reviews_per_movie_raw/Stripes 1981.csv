"jbartelone","6","37","41","6 May 2008"," Great First Half. But Than, Stripes Loses Comic Punch.
","Stripes begins as a fine and very funny military service farce with Bill Murray losing his job, girlfriend, and apartment, all in the same day. He decides, with his good buddy Harold Ramis, that they should both join the Army. Some of the funniest parts of Stripes are in the beginning of the movie with Bill's character trying to do push-ups, exhausted as he is trying to do as little as 5. Ramis cracks, ""I think your ready for the Special Olympics!"" Harold also shines in a bit-part in teaching English to a class of all foreign students. He finds out that there are only a few in the class that speak any English at all. He asked a student who raises his hand, ""You speak some English?"" The student answers back ""SOB and $hit"" and the whole class than repeats it.<br/><br/>The Basic Training sequences are very funny. Warren Oates shines as a tough drill Sergent, and in addition to SCTV alumni Ramis, John Candy joins the fun as likable, lovable ""Ox."" There are the typical sex gags, simple jokes, visit to a strip bar, that you would expect in this type of movie and Murray, Candy, Ramis, and Oates keep the comedy fun to watch. However, this is probably due more to the talents of these actors, rather than the storyline, which was done a year earlier with Goldie Hawn in another similar Army movie, Private Benjamin. There is nothing new or original about Stripes. Its best parts are in the first hour.<br/><br/>After the graduation from Basic Training, our likable recruits are assigned to man a top secret vehicle on a special assignment in Europe. Here is where this great comedy falls apart, because at this sequence of the movie, all the good parts have already happened, so the viewer has to spend about 40 minutes watching the group operate the machine, having silly one-lines like, ""Wow!!! let's see what this thing can do."" rescue some of their group who get temporarily captured in Czechoslovakia, and than arrive home to the predictable hero's welcome. The film goes from funny service farce to a bad Robocop sequel. It's almost as if the European mission sequence was needed, because the producers didn't want to end the film at 90 minutes.<br/><br/>I suppose that it was needed for the recruits to do something with their Army training. The problem is that once the team gets to Europe, the things they do aren't funny anymore and the plot wears thin because of this. The first half of Stripes gets a solid 8, the second half (a generous) 4. Therefore, my overall rating of Stripes is a 6."
"Leofwine_draca","5","11","12","29 November 2014"," Scattershot comedy with a great cast
","STRIPES is a film that I wanted to like a great deal, given that it's an 1980s comedy (one of my favourite eras) with a fantastic cast who among them have appeared in some of the funniest films made in Hollywood. And yet it left me disappointed; it's not poor, exactly, just lacklustre in comparison to other '80s comedy hits like CADDYSHACK, GHOSTBUSTERS or the later PLANES, TRAINS & AUTOMOBILES.<br/><br/>The problem with the film is twofold; there's a scattershot approach to the narrative which means that it drags in various places (particularly in the last third, which descends into meaningless action out of place with the earlier comedy), and in addition the script just isn't that funny. It's just going through the same kind of jokes as in CARRY ON SERGEANT, made some 34 years previously, with some added T&A to spice things up.<br/><br/>The best thing about the production is unsurprisingly the cast, headed by an on-form Bill Murray. Harold Ramis is predictably decent, and there's a nice role for John Candy before he adopted the lovable goof character of later years. PJ Soles and Sean Young are here too, but I found their characters annoying, getting in the way of the army situation. Warren Oates looks a bit battered but it's still good to see him in one of his final roles."

","Stripes is firmly planted in my vernacular as one of those films that helped shape me as a twelve year old boy. It is also one of those films that made me become the film lover that I am today. I know films like Star Wars and it's two sequels, First Blood and Rambo, Jaws and it's sequel, Halloween, Back To The Future, Ghostbusters, Raiders and it's sequels and Stripes ( there are many others but this review has to be under 1000 words )taught me the beauty of how a movie can make you feel. And Stripes was the first movie that me and my best friend at the time ( Gary ) ever memorized word for word. And I think that it is this movie that established Murray, Ramis and even guys like Candy and John Laroquette as comedians. It also has a small role for Bill Paxton in it somewhere. It was also a great stepping stone for the three amigos ( Murray, RAmis and Reitman ) to get funding for a bigger project like Ghostbusters. And if you were an executive at Columbia you would probably hand them a blank cheque for that project after seeing this film. Simply put this film is a classic in every sense of the word.<br/><br/>Stripes tells the story of how John Winger and Russell Ziskey ( Murray and Ramis respectively ) are two losers in life. Winger is an inept cab driver that hates his job so much that he throws his keys off the city bridge one day while driving an annoying lady to the airport. Ziskey is a terrible English as a second language teacher. And he is so inept that he tries to get is class to sing songs during class as their lesson. "" I met her on a Monday and my heart stood still "" Ziskey sings, and his class responds "" da do da da da da da da da do da da da da, "" and the he congratulates them and dismisses them until next week.<br/><br/>After Winger informs Ziskey that in the last three hours he has lost his job, his car, his apartment and his girlfriend, they decide to join the army. And then all hilarity breaks loose. It is here that we meet an assorted cast of hooligans and misfits that add to the enjoyment of the movie.<br/><br/>You have Ox ( Candy ) as an overweight guy who thinks the army is a perfect place to lose weight for free. There is Francis Sawyer, but everyone calls him Psycho, as a nut that thinks he is in Vietnam or someplace. You also have Cruiser, who joined the army because his father and brother were in the army and also because he thought he should join before he got drafted. Then there is Elmo, who is played by a pre-Fast Times Judge Reinhold. He is a wasted jolly stoner who is jjst looking to get stoned. Why he is joining the army is a little perplexing, but really, who cares? He is fun to watch so little details like this are overlooked. And of course we have Sgt. Hulka played with absolute earnestness by the late great Warren Oates. Needless to say, it is an interesting bunch of characters.<br/><br/>The film works for various reason, but mainly because Ramis and Dan Goldberg have written a hilarious script that puts the misfits through one twistedly funny situation after another. If only the army were this fun, everyone would want to enlist.<br/><br/>The first half of the film works because of the basic training scenes. The second half works because the misfit recruits are assigned to protect a secret R.V. that the army has concocted. Winger and Ziskey of course can't stay bored for long and they take the R.V. out for a run to Austria to go pick up their girlfriends.<br/><br/>Stripes is one of the funniest movies ever made and it should be checked out by younger people that were born after 1980. I was about 12 when I saw this and my dad laughed at this just as much as I did. And if all you have to go on for comedy is things like Waterboy and Big Daddy ( very funny movies in their own right ) you are missing some great older comedy. You should really check this out."
"bkoganbing","6","16","21","15 December 2009"," It Can Stand Up To Goofballs.
","Despite the fact that there is no way on God's green earth or this country's army that such a set of circumstances could ever happen, that's still no reason not to enjoy Stripes. The film is in a long line of service comedies that date all the way back to Charlie Chaplin's Shoulder Arms and further than that. Even Shakespeare found some humor in army life, just read how Falstaff made do in the service of his king.<br/><br/>Of course Falstaff wasn't a drill sergeant like Warren Oates who had a platoon of underachievers with the likes of Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, and John Candy as recruits. As is usual the service comedies make a mistake in that the basic training company stays intact with the same sergeant. In real life Oates would have taken a drink when the eight weeks was done and gone on to some fresh young trainees.<br/><br/>But some brain in the Pentagon decides that what a new type urban assault vehicle needs is some fresh recruits to maintain it, reasoning if the vehicle is worthy it can stand up to goofballs. The vehicle looks like your ordinary average camper, in fact Murray and Ramis while they're guarding it decide it would be a great chick magnet. So they pick up a pair of female MPs in P.J. Soles and Sean Young. <br/><br/>The officer in charge is John Larroquette who isn't much better than the recruits he has and when the vehicle turns up missing, he sounds the general alarm worthy of the Captain in Mister Roberts. He leads the whole troop after Murray and Ramis right into at that time Communist Czechoslovakia and some nasty Russians. Good thing they didn't have their A team playing either.<br/><br/>Stripes is your typical armed service comedy with a nice Eighties twist from Bill Murray and a crew from Saturday Night Live just coming into their prime as players. John Larroquette is the best in the film, imagine ADA Dan Fielding in an army uniform and you got Larroquette's character. You notice the New York County DA's office never gives Fielding any really big cases to handle.<br/><br/>And yes that vehicle can withstand anything and it has more tricks than James Bond's Astin-Martin. To see what and how much, you have to watch Stripes."
"RNMorton","9","39","58","29 May 2003"," Great Murray
","May be THE classic Bill Murray movie, with Murray, Ramis, Candy and other oddballs making it in the Army.  There are three general sequences - Murray pre-Army, basic training, and the mission (occurring after Murray and Ramis ""borrow"" Army test vehicle with their MP girlfriends).  Each of the sequences are funny, I personally like Murray pre-Army best and the mission least.  Warren Oates as ""Sgt. Hulka"" is a modern classic.  Over twenty years later and this is still the reigning service comedy."

When it comes to comedy Bill Murray is a winner hands down.<br/><br/>Add in John Candy; John Larroquette as the peeping Capt. Stillman; Judge Reinhold; Harold Ramis; the quick peep at Roberta Leighton; and the hot Lois Hamilton and you have a military comedy of errors that will keep you in stitches.<br/><br/>Of course there is a lot of beautiful scenery in this film in the showers and in the mud pit."

","Stripes is a raunchy, adult comedy from critically acclaimed producer/director Ivan Reitman (Evolution, Kindergarten Cop).

That is his job, his apartment, his girlfriend, his car. So, he decides that he's had enough of his pathetic life in New York, so he decides to join the army. He also talks his friend Russel Ziskey (Harold Ramis) into joining with him.<br/><br/>When they finally do join, they are both put into a platoon drilled by Sgt.

Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), two beautiful MP's who have their eys on Russel and John.<br/><br/>As the story moves on, they go to battle in Germany and end up in more hilarious confilcts.<br/><br/>I must say, I think that Warren Oates was a perfect choice for Sgt. Hulka, and that he was so brilliant and funny with the character. I give him graditude. 1921-1982<br/><br/>
This is not a movie for kids, but teens may enjoy it if they are looking for a hilarious comedy. STRIPES is 100% classic and comedy!"
"jack_thursby","3","36","67","9 July 2009"," Long, boring and unfunny. Should be left back in the 80's.
","I didn't like this Bill Murray vehicle when it was originally released in the 80s, so I tried watching it again to see if my distaste for this film was down to my movie-going tastes in the 80s or was it that ""Stripes"" is simply a bad movie. Well, the verdict is in and ""Stripes"" is a bad movie.<br/><br/>Now, ""Stripes"" may have been innovative comedy in the early 80s, and it may appeal to people who have gone through basic training or who are Bill Murray fans, but its still a bad movie.<br/><br/>Why is it bad? Mostly because ""Stripes"" is supposed to be a comedy but it's just not that funny. There are some laughs, but they are few and far between. Most of the movie is consumed by the dramatic plot which is incredibly convoluted and not very interesting. This lack of comedy is especially noticeable if you're used to more contemporary comedies such as ""Anchorman"" which strive for laughs in every part of the movie.<br/><br/>""Stripes"" further suffers from Bill Murray and Harold Ramis's lack of acting ability. Bill Murray is a great comedian but he was not a very compelling dramatic actor at this point in his career, and Harold Ramis is playing Harold Ramis. These two are just not good enough as actors to carry the dramatic arch of the movie.<br/><br/>Lastly, most of the comedy that there is in ""Stripes"" revolves around Bill Murray's self-centered, smart-alec man-child character so if you don't find that character funny (like I didn't) you're not going to find most of what little comedy there is in ""Stripes"" funny either.<br/><br/>""Stripes"" is very much a movie of its era, it hasn't aged well and is not worth watching. If you want to watch an early 80's ""buddy"" comedy I would recommend ""Stir Crazy."" Like ""Stripes"" the humor in ""Stir Crazy"" is not as fast-paced as in contemporary comedies, but unlike ""Stripes"" it has aged much better and as a result is still watchable."
"TheLittleSongbird","4","12","19","18 June 2011"," Didn't do much for me
","I do like Bill Murray and I love John Candy, so I thought this could be at least a decent film. But I found it uneven and it just didn't do much for me. The film is well made, the score is wonderful, Warren Oates is excellent and there is evidence of good direction. But here come the downsides, overall I just didn't find it funny. The script does have weaknesses feeling rather sporadic and ramshackle in the laughs, complete with jokes that feel forced and flat, and while the story starts off well the second half has a change of tone into a kind of a very generic action film that jarred with the rest of the movie and some scenes especially the mud-wrestling match and any scene involving PJ Soles and Sean Young that fell short on credibility. Oates is great, the other acting isn't that good in my opinion, Bill Murray plays a very obnoxious and unlikeable character and unfortunately he isn't very funny which is sad, Harold Ramis' character is interesting but is rarely built upon, both John Candy and Judge Reinhold with some weak scenes and dialogue are dull sadly and the best said about John Laroquette the better. All in all, has the odd bright spot but I was left cold. 4/10 Bethany Cox"
"mvanhoore","2","18","31","11 March 2014"," Embarrassing
","I watched this movie after the demise of Harold Ramis. Although I didn't expect to see a masterpiece I had the feeling I could look forward to two hours of humor and relaxation. In fact the cast (beside Ramis there are Bill Murray, John Candy and Warren Oates) was promising. As were the first couple of minutes. Everything goes wrong in the life of John Winger (Bill Murray), within a couple of hours he loses his job, his apartment, his car and his girlfriend. Out of total frustration he decides to join the army together with his friend Russell (Harold Ramis). From that moment the film doesn't escape the depth of Police Academy for example. What's supposed to be a comedy dives into a vulgar and tedious movie. When the squadron enters a nudie bar on their free evening the film reaches a low point where I have to admit that I seldom saw a more embarrassing and vulgar scene which is meant to be funny and titillating. From the moment that the action moves to the East Bloc the film turns to ridiculous. Of course the film isn't meant to be art house but the talents of the cast are completely wasted here. From later collaborations between Murray and Ramis we learn that they are capable of creating a really humorous movie but this is total crap."
"Bernie-56","2","18","31","9 November 2002"," Dated. Plagiarised.
","Perhaps this film was regarded as original and rather humorous in its country of origin way back in 1981, but it's now dated. Two idiots join the army and get knocked into fine servicemen -- wow, I'd never have thought of a plot like that! Come to think if it, I have heard of it before.  It's a cheap knock-off of Boulting Brother's Private's Progress' (1956) in which an all-star cast playing a squad of misfits is knocked into fine servicemen, watched over by a tough, gruff about-to-retire drill sergeant.  This downmarket US plagiarised version is just not in the same class.  Bill Murray is just a dull pain-in-the ass who self-centred child-like persona is supposed to be comic.  Warren Oates and John Candy in supporting roles are acceptable, with Oates almost reaching the standard set by William Hartnell."

This is supposed to be a personal development type film (insert applicable cliché) but his character merely transforms from useless lay-about to annoying, arrogant (American) jock.<br/><br/>We realised it was crap by 30min in, the missus lost interest at 60 min and I gave up with the Yanks victorious over the bumbling Ruskies and about 5min to go...!

","*****WARNING, MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS WHICH WILL BE MORE ENTERTAINING THAN THIS TRIPE.**** <br/><br/>Heres some good advise to anyone living in the U.K. Whenever Channel 5 has an old 80's comedy on late at night, read a book instead. I am currently in the process of recovering from a seizure, due to reading some of the comments on this film on here. I am actually shocked at the fact that someone actually said this film was realistic! All I can say is thank god the Cold War never escalated or else we might as well have given the Commie's our borders... I found this film dire in the utmost pretence, maybe it is just my British perception of what makes a film funny, who knows? But in all aspects, this film is not just awful, its teeth grindingly terrible.<br/><br/>I've never been a fan of Bill Murray, and its rubbish like this that justify my feelings towards him. Don't get me wrong, I loved Ghostbuster's, which was made only three years after this film. But this just sums Bill Murray up really. I can safely say that I haven't wasted my time so blatantly like this since seeing the first running of Operation Delta Force over here, though these two films have more in common than you would think. For 1 thing, they both have terrible action sequences from beginning to end, and 2nd. They are both riddled with cheesy Cliché's, throughout.<br/><br/>Heres one thing, these guys are supposed to be in the ""U.S Army"". Yet they are allowed to wallow around their Camp, Willy nilly, seducing female Military Police Officers, and subsequently shagging them silly in the Generals Quarters. Talk about Random! This film is just terrible for this I'm afraid. Now don't get me wrong, I'm no feminist sympathiser, but the fact that these two women actually fall hands over heels in love with the two characters shortly after arresting them, letting them go free... Twice, is just insulting to the female race. The fact that one tatty haired, fat lipped bum (Winger) and his hapless sidekick Ramis can simply sweet talk themselves into into the MP's underwear, to which they fall madly in love with the two of them is nothing short of ludicrous.<br/><br/>Then there is the training scenes, where you get to meet the Squad ""Phycho"" who unconvincingly threatens to kill anyone who touches him or his stuff, followed by the overweight bloke (played by the late and great John Candy) who claims he joined the army to ""avoid paying $400 for anger management classes"". Leading to loud mouthed Murray paying tribute to the ""Giant Toe,"" (WTF?) 'Drill Seargent' who honestly couldn't organise a pi$$ up in a brewery, let alone his band of recruits. All this scene serves to do is to prelude loads of fight scenes, with people saying ""way to go ass hole'!"" all the time, etc etc.<br/><br/>The scenes then carry on showing the rag tag bunch making utter tits of themselves on the Assault Course, leading to a scene where one of them shoots wildly into the air at some passing birds with an assault rifle, peppering a watch tower with bullets. (Just like that. Yep, told you this film was random...He miraculously escapes undisciplined as well...) Eventually Leading up the the passing out parade, where the hapless squad make a magic turn around within the space of two hours. (Bugger me, Miracle!) Thanks to some wise words from Murray, to which they then direct a massively none military like dance routine in front of a Geriatric 'General' in front of the rest of the squads. All of this to the immense pleasure of their two Girlfriends on the stand, who really should've been arresting them... Everyone laughs it off though. This bit is nothing short of amazing though. He then chooses them to guard a new Multi-Million Dollar Prototype Armoured Vehicle in Italy (which turns out to be just a mobile home painted green with loads of gadgets on the inside), claiming ""This is exactly what this Army needs!"" righto...<br/><br/>Then there is the dire finale, where Murray and Ramis decide to steal this top-secret prototype Military Vehicle to pick up their newly acquired and somewhat Hyperactive MP Girlfriends in Germany. To which the Hapless Captain (John Larroquette) then finds out and leads the Squad of fresh recruits on a retrieval Mission for this vehicle. To which they then take a ""wrong turn"" en-route and end up in Soviet Held Czechoslovakia, where they are captured. (Like we didn't see that coming...) Thus begins a rescue attempt by Ramis and Murray + Birds in hand, to which is where a big fight, loads of shooting from the hip and blowing tanks up. With them coming back as National Heroes, humiliating the Russians by calling them ""pussies,"" etc etc. The end. Thats right. No Courts Martial, nothing. They only just stole a prototype Military vehicle, drove it into a Warsaw Pact country and almost caused an International incident which could've sparked WW3!<br/><br/>This film is honestly more fun that being diagnosed with a terminal illness. I know its meant to be a Comedy, it got all the right actors for it, but where in the hell is it? Have Channel 5 cuts those bits out? The only redeeming feature in this film is the repetitive use of naked women taking showers, and female Mud Wrestling. (like I said, Random) Not that it helps to divert from the fact that this is an utterly crap film, of course. This film should realistically be aimed at immature 9 year old's, sadly, we have to watch it instead. 1 star out of 10 - Total Tripe. My advice, do something a little more useful with your time. Like Castrating yourself..."
"twelvewaystodie","2","20","37","3 March 2005"," Worst film ever?
","Possibly not, but it is awful. Even the fantastic cast cant save it. OK, I admit it started off quite funny but it seemed to plummet downhill as soon as they jumped those girls in the Generals house. Bill Murray turned from being a quick witted, humorous guy into an arsehole who was shouting things at people in the street that just weren't funny, its like he was trying too hard to be funny. His character stole a weapon (an RV? come on...) and ends up being a national hero after invading another country and killing god knows how many soldiers, for a laugh. One good point is that this film shows the inadequacy and incompetence of the US Army and shows how arrogant and imbecilic they really are, albeit unintentionally. I actually felt disgusted that this kind of propaganda crap could really be released."
"corynye-1","10","17","31","20 February 2005"," Extremely funny movie, another Bill Murray classic
","Everyone is funny in this film. Every performance is first-rate and each character adds something to the humor of this movie.<br/><br/>Stripes begins with Bill Murray losing his job, his car and his girlfriend all in the same day. His buddy Harold Ramis is also leading a lackluster life teaching the English language to foreigners who know only curse words. These depressing circumstances set the stage for Murray to convince Ramis to come with him and join the Army.<br/><br/>Basic training, a hard-ass drill sergeant, female military police and naked mud wrestling consume the rest of this hilarious film. Anyone who appreciates smart-ass humor should see this. However Murray and Ramis are the focal point of most of the humor in Stripes and are very easy to relate to. Also stars John Candy, P.J. Soles, Sean Young, John Larroquette and Judge Reinhold."
"jzappa","7","4","5","7 September 2011"," A Hundred-Dollar Shine on a Three-Dollar Pair of Shoes
","I understand the enjoyment of it. The prolonged and arguably dignified ancestry includes Buck Privates, Duck Soup and the like. This cheeky young Bill Murray is firmly anchored in Groucho, the clue I'd consider an early scuffle with a Manhattan matron. The idea is recapturing the same timbre but with a clear post-SNL hipster slacker derision. And like those vintage vehicles were for the classic comedy teams, storytelling amounts to little more than piecing together various sorts of obligatory scenes, cycling through the kinds that entails.<br/><br/>You look back on all the moments and not so much the transitions between them. Who needs them? That's supposed to be the attitude one brings to one of these sorts of movies. It has that Animal House feel. Take a rigid institution of authoritarian discipline and formality and throw a big pie in its face. And fart on its head for good measure. Just as John Vernon was the anal-retentive square lording it over our slacker heroes in John Landis' film, Warren Oates plays Sgt. 1st Class Hulka, who gives Murray the most discipline he must've ever had in his life, making him the closest character in the film to give the film cohesion. Otherwise, this lazy but likable classic wastes most of its time overstressing situations contradicted from the start by Murray's character. The star act and his material are essentially misaligned until the tedious, scattered script ultimately labors past basic training.<br/><br/>The blessing I think Stripes brings to the golden-age slapstick template is a more vivid ensemble. Yes, In the Navy and A Night at the Opera had plots, but with the attention to detail and ripeness in dialogue and characterization of a present-day cartoon. The peripheral people around the stars of the act were virtually prevented from having too much presence or distinction for fear of upstaging the deal-breaking stars, but in Stripes, others clowning in basic-training include Judge Reinhold's head-bobbing stoner, Conrad Dunn's broad-stroke acknowledgment to Travis Bickle (likely more of a Harold Ramis contribution), and John Candy's soft-hearted fatso, who finds the Laurel to his Hardy in southern boy John Diehl. They all have the kind of indelible character we hope for in especially young performances of actors who later became more prevalent. And yet P.J. Soles and Sean Young are there for one reason, the same one reason all us young guys wanted them in it. Other than that, there is absolutely nothing else. Not a single realistic action is allowed from them.<br/><br/>Director Ivan Reitman is a sure merchant. He knows that the cheap laughs are the most certain, that we like to see bunglers get it together without losing their ungainly style, and that it doesn't harm business to slot in a sorority shower scene or nude mud-wrestling competition every 30 minutes or so. Vietnam was by now a bygone phase, and this is Reagan's Good Army. When Ivan Reitman wants to ambush the Eastern Bloc in a Winnebago crammed with rockets, he has the certified OK for dozens of tanks, explosions, shootouts and hand-to-hand combat moments. But believe me, it was a great deal funnier when we were ten."
"jhclues","10","21","40","11 June 2001"," With These Guys on the Front Lines...
","In one of his funniest comedies, Bill Murray takes on the U.S. Army, and without question, with guys like this on the front lines, we can all sleep a little easier at night.  `Stripes,' directed by Ivan Reitman, is the story of John Winger (Murray), who in one day loses his girl, his job, his car and his apartment.  So what's a guy to do after that, but join the Army?  But he doesn't go alone, oh no-- he also talks his best friend, Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) into joining with him.  And just like that they find themselves at boot camp, face to face with one of the most formidable Drill Instructors every to grace the silver screen, Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates), and surrounded by as motley a group of raw recruits as anyone could imagine. Among them, there's Dewey Oxburger (John Candy), known as `Ox,' who plans to emerge from boot camp a `lean, mean fighting machine'; and `Cruiser (John Diehl),' who joined up to beat the draft (Hulka:  `Son, there isn't a draft, anymore.'  Cruiser:  `There was one?'); and Francis Soyer (George Jenesky), known as `Psycho' (`Call me Francis, and I'll kill you.  Touch my stuff, and I'll kill you.  Touch me...and I'll kill you.'  Hulka:  `Lighten up, Francis...').<br/><br/>	The pressure is on for Hulka and his men, when Colonel Glass (Lance LeGault) informs Captain Stillman (John Larroquette) that the `General' is looking for a squad of crack new recruits to man a special project, and Hulka's boys have been chosen.  The project involves a secret weapon, an `urban assault' vehicle, that is to be unveiled on their base in Germany shortly.  But first, Hulka has to get his troops through basic, which will be a minor miracle in itself, even though Winger goes `Out on a limb,' and offers to be their leader.  And things proceed just as badly as you would expect, not only on the obstacle course, but off, when Winger and Ziskey get mixed up with a couple of female M.Ps., Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), and Ox gets coerced (by Winger, of course) into taking part in a female mud-wrestling event at a local night spot.  <br/><br/>	Along the way, Reitman sets up the situations for some serious laughs, and keeps it all on track with a good pace and excellent timing.  Murray is terrific as Winger, with a performance that puts a generous helping of `dry' in the expression `dry humor.'  He plays it all so straight, so serious, from his quips and one liners (watching a TV promo for the Army, `This looks pretty good--'), to his full blown inspirational speech to the troops on the night before their final test at basic training (`We're all very different people.  We're not Spartans, we're not Watusi, we're Americans, with a capital A.'  That means our forefathers were thrown out of every decent country in the world--'), that it makes it all the more hilarious.  He never tries to be `funny,' or fish for laughs, which is really what makes this movie work so well.  Murray is perhaps the best in the business at playing this kind of humor and putting it across (Ben Stiller would be a close second).  <br/><br/>	Harold Ramis and John Candy also make invaluable contributions that make this one fly.  Watch Ramis, reacting to what Candy is saying as `Ox,' as explains why he joined the Army; it makes what Ox is saying twice as funny. And Ox, talking about what a `shy guy' he is, and how `You may have noticed, I have this weight problem--'  And Oates, as well, gives a singular performance that makes Hulka a real person, beyond the typical stereotype of the hard-nosed D.I.  His portrayal, taken out of context, is one that would stand up even in more serious fare, like Kubrick's `Full Metal Jacket.'<br/><br/>	The supporting cast includes Judge Reinhold (Elmo), John Voldstad (Stillman's Aide), Roberta Leighton (Anita), Antone Pagan (Hector), Fran Ryan (Dowager in Cab), Dave Thomas (M.C.) and William Lucking (Recruiter). From beginning to end, `Stripes' is a fun-filled laugh riot that's filled with memorable scenes and a plethora of lines you'll be quoting forever. This is one you can watch over and over again, with a bunch of characters you're never going to forget.  Winger and Ziskey, Ox, Psycho, Cruiser. These are the guys who Demi Moore, as Galloway in `A Few Good Men,' could have been talking about when, in response to the question of why she likes these guys so much, replies, `Because they stand on a wall, and they say nothing is going to hurt you tonight, not on my watch...'  It kind of makes you think.  Or, as Cruiser might say, `Yeah...  About what?'  I rate this one 10/10."
"wtsimmons","10","25","49","8 September 2006"," Best Comedy of all times.
","This is by far one of Bill Murray's best comedy efforts. John Winger the character played by Murray is the best one liner character I have ever seen. Harold Ramis and John Larroquette bring up the levels of character acting to above par for any comedy lover. John Candy and Warren Oates are also very good in there roles that they played. The visuals, and directing were superb for the time frame the movie was made. A great movie, plenty of action, one liners. The commencement scene is by far on of the best directed and acted scenes in a comedy in a long time. I love the movie and recommend seeing it, some scenes may not be suitable for all ages, the TV version takes away from the classic comedy, get the DVD and enjoy the extras and commentary that are available. A MUST HAVE for any movie fan. Comedy lovers must see this one. GREAT! GREAT! GREAT!"
"zetes","4","12","21","29 April 2011"," Shockingly bad. I can't fathom how people found this funny
","In some circles, this is considered a classic of 1980s comedy. I'm something of an aficionado of 80s comedies, having grown up in that decade (though admittedly 1981 is a bit early for me). I must say, this is no classic. It's a boring piece of crap. Bill Murray is somewhat charismatic as a bum who joins the Army along with his best friend, played by Harold Ramis. Together they lead a rag-tag group of losers under the command of Warren Oates (who died less than a year after this film was released). Among them are John Candy and Judge Reinhold. John Laroquette and Sean Young also appear. There's barely a laugh in the picture (Candy made me chuckle once in a great while), and the heroes are such unlikeable douches you almost can't wait to see them courtmartialed for their ""hilarious"" antics (of course it ends with them receiving medals for actions which, I imagine, would have begun WWIII in 1981). Just awful."

","By today's standards, Stripes probably doesn't hold up to such comedies like Wedding Crashers or Old School where there are laughs every minute of the film. But Stripes is a classic comedy that paved the way for such modern films, and fans of Bill Murray should check it out.<br/><br/>As a kid, I used to watch this movie over and over. My friend and I would rewind the scene where the guys were sitting in the barracks telling each other their stories about why they joined the army. This scene is one of my all-time favorites in any comedy I've ever seen.<br/><br/>Murray's performance is vintage in this film. He is awesome as a smart-alec loser who you just have to root for because of his charm and sense of humor and his ability to not care about anything at all. Ramis is also very good as Murray's best friend; the two have great chemistry together.<br/><br/>Anyone who has ever been in the military will find this movie hilarious. The film does a great job with all the secondary characters such as Ox (John Candy), Elmo (Judge Reinhold), Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates, and Psycho (Conrad Dunn). The two MPs played by PJ Soles and Sean Young are also sexy and great.<br/><br/>With its 1970s/80s humor and its classic soundtrack, this movie is probably not something anyone under 30 would enjoy. If you like Bill Murray or have been in the military, then you should give this one a look. Rating 8 of 10 stars."

Most of the rest of the film concerns their platoon of misfits (including John Candy), sadistic drill sergeant, mad egotistical captain (John Larroquette) and a couple of improbably attractive MPs. There is a rather silly plot tagged on the end involving a top secret armoured car disguised as a camper van, presumably to give the whole exercise some point, without conspicuous success. Not particularly funny, but has some amiable performances."
"preppy-3","1","17","33","9 January 2011"," Unfunny, boring and sexist
","Inexplicably popular ""comedy"". John (Bill Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are two idiots who have no direction or reason in life. They decide to join the Army thinking it's a way to make easy money. They get stuck with a group of utterly annoying and unfunny guys (who the audience is supposed to find hysterical) and a tough as nails drill Sgt (Warren Oates). Naturally John is constantly cracking ""funny"" one liners and screwing up deliberately left and right. None of it is funny at all. Then, at the end, it inexplicably turns into an army drama!<br/><br/>This was a huge hut in 1981 and its popularity totally escapes me. I didn't like it back then and I still don't like it now. I should point that, personally, I never found Murray that funny. His blank face and obnoxious manner made me annoyed with him more than anything else. This movie does nothing to change my view. Basically the movie just isn't funny! I didn't smile (let alone laugh) once! Each joke fizzled out completely or they give us these somewhat interesting characters and NEVER build on them! When you get John Candy and Daniel Stern in a movie and even THEY'RE not funny something is seriously wrong. Worst of all is John Larroquette as Capt. Stillman. EVERY scene with his is terribly unfunny. And WHAT was the thinking of turning it into a generic action film at the end?? <br/><br/>It's also incredibly sexist. You have the incredibly beautiful women P.J. Soles and Sean Young as MPs. Naturally they meet Murray and Ramis and let them get away with murder and almost immediately have sex with them. That's just pushing credibility WAY too far. The absolute low point is a pointless and downright revolting mud wrestling match when Candy is wrestling with five bikini clad beautiful women. Naturally he (inexplicably) gets ALL their tops off and waves them around! The two good points are Oates (giving a GREAT performance) and a bombastic score. Why this movie was such a big hit is beyond me. A 1 all the way."
"GarBrup","2","14","27","20 May 2014"," Stripes - Action & Propaganda All in One
","The soul purpose of this movie is to make the military, specifically the United States Army, seem like a breeze. The two main characters, John and Russell see no point in living life like lazy sleezeballs so they join the military for ""some fun"". This is where the stupidity starts.<br/><br/>John and Russell and put in a recruit squad including other morons. Sgt. Hulka is the typical ""hard-ass"" drill instructor who seems to always be punishing the two main characters for trying to act ""funny"" and ""cool"" (obvious cliché). There are many instances in this movie that I found completely ridiculous. The first one would have to be basic training when the recruits are with the mortars and ""accidentally"" almost kill Hulka which results in him just being hospitalized. The recruits don't really receive any punishment (like kicked out or court martial) but strong resentment from Hulka. Secondly would have to be when John and Russell are found breaking military law which obviously causes two female MPs to magically fall in love with them, sneak into an officers nearby house, and immediately have sex. Sexist and disgusting? Check.<br/><br/>When the recruits realize that they are pretty much idiots, and graduation is coming soon it serves as a time for John to finally act like a leader. This sounds good that they may actually take the army seriously, but they don't. John makes some stupid over-patriotic speech about how ""We are in the U.S. Army, the best army ever. We've been *kicking ass for over 200 years*"" (lol; don't you remember the Korean War and Vietnam, John?). Anyhow, this ""speech"" encourages the recruits to then do a one-night transformation for the next day which is graduation. They show up at the ceremony late, marching in like a bunch of kindergartens, and do a completely awkward, and un-military like march singing pop songs. This is supposedly their ""one night transformation"". Yet even with this stupid display, the high ranking officers pick John and his recruits over EVERY OTHER RECRUIT PLATOON which acted more military than they did. They are sent to a NATO country on a special assignment which is testing a ""new"" EM-50 Urban Assault Vehicle (in reality a GMC motor home lol!).<br/><br/>This assignment is too much for Russell and John, and they decide to go to Germany by stealing the EM-50 UAV to meet up with the pretty female MPs they screwed with back in the U.S. Sgt. Hulka finds out what John and Russell did, and take the other recruits to retrieve the EM-50 motor home back. Somehow, they take a wrong turn into Czechoslovakia and are captured by the occupying Soviet Army. Russell, John, and the MP girls go to Czechoslovakia to rescue the men. This movie tries to portray how ""easy"" it is for American troops to invade a Soviet-bloc nation by just ""smashing through"" a roadblock. Not to mention, these idiots could have started World War III for their dumb actions! Russell, John, and the MPs enter the town the recruits are held in, rescue them, defeat a huge army of Soviet soldiers, blow up tanks, and survive rockets and grenades all thanks to the GMC Motor Home being super protective (okay?). They all then return back to the United States being ""heroes"" and calling the Soviets ""pu--ies"" which is an over-exaggeration because how could a motor home beat an entire Soviet division? Pro-American anti-Soviet propaganda is why, then again this film was made 3/4 way through the Cold War.<br/><br/>I do not recommend this movie, it is boring, absurd, and ridiculous. If you like watching a film where buffoons become heroes in an unreal way, then this is for you."
"policy134","6","3","4","5 September 2005"," Nowhere as funny as the similar Animal House but quite good if you are in the mood for a no-brainer
","Everyone knows that Bill Murray has come a long way from his SNL days and the mostly embarrassing movies he made through most of the 80's and 90's, but it is still fun to see him as just a goofy guy as he plays in this one. Harold Ramis made his first joint appearance here with Murray and I must say that they make a pretty good team. Many of their collaborative efforts like the 2 Ghostbusters movies and the Ramis-directed Groundhog day was simply shear hilarity. However, Stripes is not nearly as easy to sit through as those marvels. I don't know what it is but it seems that this kind of material has always been beneath both Murray and Ramis. If every major player in this film hadn't made better films than this one you would probably have forgotten about it in little time.<br/><br/>There are some vaguely familiar faces scattered across every minute of this film. John Diehl from ""Miami Vice"" plays a rather dimwitted character, as does Judge Reinhold from ""Beverly Hills Cop"". Then there is of course the great John Candy who was a little bit embarrassed to do one particular scene with a pair of not so dressed women but of all the supporting players he is the one who makes the most of what he is given here. Last but not least there is Warren Oates as the gruff but kind of decent Sgt. Hulka. He has his greatest moment when he tells the totally idiotic character ""Psycho"" to lighten up. Oh, and I almost forgot the love interests of Ramis and Murray who are quite good looking but never rises above their decorative parts. It is funny to think that Sean Young as one of the ladies was completely forgotten after only 10 years in the movies, especially when she lost two choice roles in the 2 first Batman movies.<br/><br/>There is not much more to say than this is only entertaining in the first part of the movie, mainly because there are so many great one-liners from Murray but the whole second part involving a missing tank falls flat because this is not ""War Games"" and to make this into something that it's not is just a shame."
"gbill-74877","6","4","6","9 July 2019"," It was better in 1981
","A movie that starts off strong, with lots of little humor between Bill Murray and Harold Ramis in the way they talk to one another and see humor in the face of life's struggles, and then on a whim join the army. The early scenes in boot camp are good too, with help from John Candy and others in the supporting cast. Unfortunately the film descends from that point on, first via gratuitous nudity and objectifying scenes that go on for far too long. The way the female MP's behave is cringe-worthy, and not redeemed by their heroism towards the end. The second step down is in the rescue sequence from Czechoslovakia, most of which is silly and worse, it's not all that funny either. For all the talent of Murray and Ramis, two guys I love, I have to say, this one hasn't aged well."

","The first act is great, Bill Murray's character is witty but kind of a jerk. The setup for an 80s comedy classic is done well.<br/><br/>During the second act I was excited: usually the authority figure in these movies is the bad guy and you're just hoping they get taken down a peg. In this movie the authority figure (the drill sergeant) is 100% in the right and Bill Murray's character is insubordinate, lazy, and irritating. I loved the twist on the formula and I was looking forward to him going through his arc and to learn what it meant to be a good soldier.<br/><br/>It never happens.<br/><br/>Murray's character becomes more of a jerk, commits multiple crimes, drags the love interest (a career soldier/MP) and his best friend down with him, endangers dozens of people, and is rewarded for helping clean up the mess he made. The end.<br/><br/>Maybe time has ruined this movie. Maybe the line between lovable scamp and actual garbage person has moved in the last 37 years. Bill Murray is perfect for these types of characters, but I actively disliked his character by the end of the film.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the first 2 acts, so I'm giving it 3 stars instead of 1."

","The story of a man who wanted to keep the world safe for democracy...and meet girls<br/><br/> Bill Murray and Harold Ramis star in `Stripes,' a military satire which went on to spawn many copies, including the horrible `Police Academy' series.<br/><br/> John Winger (Murray) is a down-on-his-luck cabbie. Russel Ziskey (Ramis) is an equally unfortunate friend of Winger's. After finally losing his cabbie job, Winger decided that the military is the best place to go, so he coaxes Ziskey into signing up as well. <br/><br/>I remember hearing a lot about `Stripes.' It was supposed to be a really hilarious movie. So, you could say I had high expectations for the film. I was more than pleased when it finally played on TV not too long ago, and after all these years I finally got to view it for the first time.<br/><br/> Bill Murray uses his smart-aleck persona to a great advantage in this film. This was one of his first post-SNL films, and it's no wonder this film spawned a film career for him. Harold Ramis is funny as his complete opposite of a friend. In the film, Murray is a big pain for Warren Oates (great as Sgt. Hulka). If you've never noticed, Steve Guttenberg completely ripped Murray's character off in `Police Academy,' but I already mentioned that.<br/><br/> There are some big laughs in this film, and I'd give it four stars, however, I felt that the end was thrown together a bit crudely. The plot kind of went haywire. <br/><br/> `Stripes' was a bit disappointing for me; however, it is a good comedy, and a clever satire on the army/military. Plus, there are some excellent actors and co-stars in this film, including the hilarious John Candy as Ox. Overall, I'd give the film a 3.5/5 stars. Not great, but worth watching for sure."

Growing up in the 80's I love Bill Murray (Ghostbusters I&II, Groundhog Day and I even enjoyed him in Space Jam and Osmosis Jones), but this boring old thing? No.<br/><br/>The start of the movie is so slooooow and serious, but I thought to myself; ""Just hold on, it will get better"". But it didn't. And comedy? Not much to laugh about here. I mean the scene in the toilet were Winger and the Seargent ""fight""?! Not funny but serious!<br/><br/>And what's with the nudity? It has no place in this movie. Like the scenes were the captain watches girls shower, and the whole strip-club thing...? Foolish!<br/><br/>And the last third of the movie takes it all to a whole different level.

","worth 10 stars for several reasons. bill Murray at his best (uncle Hulka?) Harold Ramis who gets without a doubt the BEST line in the entire movie (I once got the sh*t kicked out of me in Wisconsin!) - and also acts his posterior off, this is most likely his best performance in anything he's ever been in, the man just shines. John Candy - the legend, the big man making a little part very huge, again he is excellent (especially in poker sequence). He steals every scene he's in, gotta love the guy. Elmer Berstein creates an excellent and hugely memorable score, my favorite has to be the tune behind johns girlfriend leaving. Looking across all the tunes elmer created, his legacy is them, most definitely. The chap playing Sgt Hulka is also excellent. Makes a lot of his character. Drill Instructors are definitely like this guy. I should know! I can watch this until the cows come home, well worth a look if you like SNL, Candy, Ramis, Murray.<br/><br/>OK, I've now seen the extended cut. And wow is that a different (and better!) movie. The whole extra scene in John's girlfriends apartment about the Winnibago which adds more to John's motivation to actually join The Army. Every time I watch this I totally fail to notice Sean Young (Rachel in Bladerunner) as one of the female MP's but she looks amazing!<br/><br/>There's also an extra scene of dialogue in the barracks between John & Russell which leads to a huge cut segment of John & Russell aboard a plane with Special Ops guys, jumping out, getting captured by bandits and almost getting killed (I assume this was cut for pacing) but saving themselves by getting the bandits high on acid and singing ""Quando"".<br/><br/>Having seen where the scene was cut from, I totally understand why it went (it spoiled the flow of the film, it didn't make any sense, it took up too much time). It does upset the following scene where Hulka asks about men leaving the base but at least explains why that happened.<br/><br/>Stillwell briefing the men about Hulka's accident is a new scene which explains their reason to go to the mud wrestling bar better. There are also a few extra small insert shots inside the bar as well.<br/><br/>The rifle drill sequence for graduation is longer with more moves than the normal cut. I'm still quite annoyed that they take Hulka to Italy with them. That just wouldn't happen, He was drill training staff. The likelihood of them posting him with that squad would be very low indeed. The fact that the female MP's (Stella & Louise) were posted to Germany at the same time John's Platoon had been sent to Italy is too contrived a plot device as well.<br/><br/>The scene loading the EM-50 (An armoured Winnebago!) with shells is another new scene which explains why John & Russell are guarding it alone before they borrow it. Combine that extra scene with the Winnebago scene near the start and this scene now makes even more sense to the plot!<br/><br/>There are extra scenes of John in the bedroom with Stella and Russell in the bathtub with Louise, cutting quite a bit of nudity from both women! The shots of the tanks blocking the road into Czechoslovakia has been added. The conversation about Russells sister is new too.<br/><br/>I did notice once in the Czechoslovakian base the soldiers stopped speaking Russian and some of them were speaking German? Good goof! The bits that were added on the whole do improve the movie and make the scenes that follow them make a lot more sense. I prefer this version I think. I am annoyed about the press cutting they use for Louise in front of the EM-50, it's supposed to be Top Secret but it's appearing on the front cover of a magazine?<br/><br/>Russell's headline is wrong as well ""Zitzsky rates The Russians"", actually they were Czechoslovakians! In general the whole ""welcome home"" ending is wrong, this was supposed to be a deniable mission, no-one back home would have even know it had happened. Also Hulka shouldn't be saluting John (and vice-versa) as neither of them are Officers. Watching the end credits I saw Bill Paxton played a soldier.<br/><br/>My final words? Gentlemen, It's Party time - Italian style!"

We may complain, but there it is.<br/><br/>The Marx brothers are still funny, but for different reasons. It would be better to say that they are funny again. When I first saw `Stripes,' I thought it hilarious. Now it seems not even campy.<br/><br/>Why is this? My own theory is that Bill Murray learned his craft just when overt irony was fashionable. This was after Lenny Bruce could be pure by being profane and before we got into nostalgic humor. So he developed his routines around the notions of not being the character.

Like the boot camp comedy from the previous year (""Private Benjamin""), this fitfully funny film works best when dealing with the rigors and characteristics of basic training, and gets a bit tiresome away from it (at least the rescue mission in Czechoslovakia that caps this movie is far briefer than the post-graduation affair drama in the second half of ""Benjamin""). Murray is in fine form here, though not quite as inspired as his slob from ""Caddyshack"" or his deadpan wiseacre from ""Ghost Busters""--consider his character here to be a cross-section of those two types--and Ramis achieves a laidback poignancy when reacting to his friend's quips and shenanigans, while the rest of the cast get their moments here and there; Oates and Dunn stand out as the hard-bitten drill sergeant and an unhinged recruit named Francis respectively. Oates is so good, in fact, that the film suffers when he disappears for a long chunk of the movie and the screenplay is at its sloppiest (and sleaziest, as the mud wrestling bar scene will attest). Diverting enough to be enjoyable despite its weak patches, it's probably fitting that a movie about disorderly cadets needed a little more discipline to really work. Features numerous soon-to-be-popular-actors in early roles, including Reinhold, Larroquette, and Bill Paxton (blink and you'll miss him next to Candy in the bar).<br/><br/>62/100"

","Three giants of American comedy Bill Murray, John Candy and Harrold Ramis star in this often funny, occasionally hilarious tale of misfits joining the army. This is along the lines of Police Academy in plot but slightly less zany in delivery due to the deadpan delivery of Rammis and particularly Murry who plays the ultimate slacker.<br/><br/>It has to be said there are some comedy misfires in here and the ending is maybe a bit much, but overall this is a good little comedy. Murray is of course excellent as is most of the supporting cast, John Candy is maybe a little underused as Ox. Also the film is definitely of it's time (the cold war still in full swing, boo ruskies and reds etc) but that wont spoil your enjoyment.<br/><br/>7/10 - Not up there with Murray and Ramis best (Groundhog Day and Ghostbusters) but worth a watch on cable or rental."

","How to best describe this movie? Like ""Police Academy"" set in the army...only than about a million times funnier.<br/><br/>This movie shows once more what an incredible comical genius Bill Murray is. I can't imaging how this movie would had been without him...the answer probably is just plain bad. Murray is able to say the weirdest and silliest things with a serious face, I absolutely love it! I also just love the way he's improvising in some scene's. Murray is helped by mainly three other great comical actors; Harold Ramis, John Candy and Warren Oates. They are really the one's that carry this movie and make it a hilarious one!<br/><br/>As for the story itself, it isn't that good or appealing. The movie is beginning good and also the whole basic training is just hilarious and highly enjoyable to watch. But after that the movie maybe is taking itself a bit too serious and the story only distracts from Murray's antics. I also wouldn't had mind seeing Stella and Louise being cut out of the movie.<br/><br/>Still none of that prevents this movie from being one of the most enjoyable one's ever made. It's not just constantly funny, it's also absolutely hilarious at times!<br/><br/>The Elmer Bernstein musical score is underrated and worth listening to, if it was more world widely available for sale.<br/><br/>I have yet to meet a person who didn't like watching ""Stripes"".

"gab-14712","8","2","4","13 March 2019"," Bill Murray Steals the Show!
","Stripes is everything I want from a movie involving the director/actor tandem of Ivan Reitman and Bill Murray. The movie is raucous, irreverent, and just a silly movie in general. Towards the end, the movie loses some steam, but I cannot deny how involved I was for the first hour or so. As a movie that pokes fun of the military and basic training, I was reminded of 1980's Private Benjamin which I was lukewarm on. That particular movie featured some fine comedic moments but Goldie Hawn's romance sidetracked the film. This film, however, stays true to the military from start to finish as it antes up the comedy level. It's not every movie that features explosive weapons where we can find hilarious, albeit questionable uses of kitchen utensils!<br/><br/>If you went into this movie blind, you would be forgiven if you thought this was a National Lampoon movie. The same kind of raucousness you might have seen in Animal House is seen here. The writer behind that film, Harold Ramis happens to be one of the writers for Stripes. He took his experience from Animal House and Caddyshack and made it work here. When the film is at its best, the jokes are a hoot! The tandem of Ivan Reitman and Bill Murray return after the success of Meatballs (which I still need to see given the talent involved). A bigger budget allowed them to do bigger things here. Maybe the money could have been spent more wisely considering the third act of the movie.<br/><br/>John Winger (Bill Murray) is having a horrible day. Within a few hours, he lost his girlfriend, job, car, and home. Having enough with his miserable life, he enlists in the army. He convinces his best friend, Russell (Harold Ramis) to do the same. They are clearly going to be the misfits of the military. When they begin basic training, they are paired with other misfits. The class is led by the hard-headed Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates). As basic training moves forward, Winger and Russell keep finding themselves bailed out of sticky situations by Stella (P.J Soles) and Louise (Sean Young). After training ends, the men find themselves in Italy to test a new urban assault vehicle. When they take a test drive with the vehicle to visit the women, who were stationed in Germany, the rest of the platoon and Sgt. Hulka finds themselves in communist territory.<br/><br/>Bill Murray excels at comedy to say the least. He was funny in Caddyshack, but he was even better here. My favorite scene with him is when he goes on a rant about ""Old Yeller."" Prior to this film, Harold Ramis was known only as a comedy writer and not as an actor because of his unconventional looks. Murray and Reitman made Columbia allow him to act on the project, as the studio did not like his audition video. It was an excellent idea to bring a veteran like Warren Oates to the cast. He traditionally acted in many Westerns and Reitman wanted to bring those strong sensitivities to the movie. There was a fine dramatic scene between him and Murray that worked well because of that and it allowed Murray to get his feet in the realm of drama. PJ Soles from Halloween and Sean Young have great chemistry. The supporting cast is loaded with talent. John Candy, John Larroquete, Judge Reinhold. A great list of household names!<br/><br/>The movie does not completely derail in the end, but it is a small disappointment what happens. The movie has a very strong first half with the basic training and character moments. By some golden rule, every movie must have an extravagant third act. There is nothing wrong with that, but not every movie needs it. Stripes is a prime example of that. While the production was well-made, I did not think the whole communist part of the story worked well with the rest. I just wanted my basic training farce, which thankfully the movie spent a good hour plus on. Speaking of character moment, the one scene I loved took place in the beginning. This dude named Psycho is telling everyone that they would die if they touched his belongings. Sgt. Hulka's response? ""Lighten up.""<br/><br/>Overall, Stripes is a good comedy that could have been better if the third act was changed. Bill Murray and his merry gang definitely had a great time making the movie as they know how to be funny! I loved the basic training material and although I was lukewarm on Private Benjamin, these two would make a good double feature. The movie was a great success for Ivan Reitman, Murray, and Ramis. The trio would reunite three years later to create one of the most successful movies of all time, Ghostbusters.<br/><br/>My Grade: B"
"tony-walton","5","2","4","14 January 2004"," Peaked too late
","This movie took too long to get to the point, for me. The start was too predictable - Murray doesn't fit in in the Army - and it only really got going with the Daring Rescue in the Armed RV. The references to the USSR and Czechoslovakia also mean it's a bit dated nowadays. They coul have cut the whole mud-wrestling scene and made more of the rescue, I think. 5/10"
"oscarc","10","2","4","5 September 2000"," This is not your grandfather's Army.
","An excellent comedy with performances by stars before they were stars.  It is Bill Murray's movie from beginning to end, but seeing John Larroquette, John Candy, John Diehl and Judge Reinhold early in their careers provide good background characters is great.  There are scenes early in the film that I cannot tear away from no matter how many times I have seen them.  The funniest sequences and quips in the film stretch from Sgt. Hulka's blowup to his return in Italy.  This won't make you join the Army; this won't make you appreciate the soldiers in the Army.  This will just tickle your funnybone whether you know anything about military service or not."
"thehappychuckler","8","0","0","6 January 2020"," Great Early Bill Murray/Harold Ramis/John Candy Comedy
","In what was originally supposed to be Cheech and Chong Go To the Army it became a great early 80s comedy that showed Bill Murray could carry a big picture, showed more of John Candy to American audiences and gave Harold Ramis a chance to show some of his acting chops on the big screen.<br/><br/>With a plot that honestly ain't too plausible cab driver John Winger (Murray in a great role) has lost his job, his car, his apartment and his girlfriend decides that perhaps he should join the army. Of course he brings his friend Russell Ziskey (Ramis) along for the ride. To me both Murray and Ramis have funny introductions to their characters. So, while in the army they are given to a wonderfully cast Warren Oates as Sgt. Hulka who will try and get his recruits into shape. Also enlisted is John Candy as Dewey Oxburger (who ends up in a mud wrestling pit) and Judge Reinhold as a pretty dopey dude named Elmo. John Larroquette is also very good as the villainous Cpt.Stillman.<br/><br/>There is also an extended version that clocks in at just over two hours that I own and would suggest maybe watching that version. I mean it doesn't add any need to see moments, but it does tighten up some of the material. Written by Len Blum, Dan Goldberg and Ramis. Directed by Ivan Reitman who had made MEATBALLS with Murray already. As expected has some very good music by Elmer Bernstein. Both P.J. Soles and Sean Young play MPs that Murray and Ramis take a liking to and also starring SCTV members Joe Flaherty and Dave Thomas. Has some very adult situations and littered with nudity so not for the younger audience like GHOSTBUSTERS which Reitman would make in a few years with Murray and Ramis. I really enjoyed this film and put a smile on my face while watching it. A must-see for any Bill Murray fan out there to see him in one of his earlier roles."

He is comical, full of life, and brings his character alive. This is a movie that will make you laugh out loud. Bill Murray have some funny one liners as well as an inspirational speech. There are a few parts of the movie that I thought could have been done a bit better since some parts are corny and could have been funnier but it is good to watch just for Bill Murray's hilarious performance."
"Tweekums","7","0","0","15 December 2016"," A bit too silly at times but plenty of laughs make this military comedy worth watching
","John Winger's life is not going to plan; he quits his job, his car is repossessed, his girlfriend has left him and he is about to lose his apartment it is time for something different so he persuades his friend Russell Ziskey that what they need to do is enlist in the US Army. They find themselves in a platoon of similar misfits under the instruction of Sgt Hulka commanded by Capt. Stillman. Hulka is unimpressed by his platoon; especially Winger whose attitude is not what the military expects. Somehow they manage to pass basic training and the platoon is posted to Italy where they are to be the first troops to use the Army's latest vehicle an armed and armoured RV! While there Winger and Ziskey decide to take the vehicle to see their girlfriends, a pair of female MPs, in West Germany. Stillman thinks they must be working for the Russians and takes the rest of the platoon to find them; unfortunately a map reading error takes them into Czechoslovakia it will be up to Winger, Ziskey and their girlfriends to rescue them; preferably without starting a war in the process.<br/><br/>This film is pretty funny most of the time even if it does get a bit too silly at times. If one hopes for a vaguely believable story you will be disappointed; just about everything is played for laughs and with the exception of Sgt Hulka it is hard to believe that any of the characters would progress as far as they have in the Army; the recruits don't get moulded into believable soldiers; Capt. Stillman is clearly incompetent from the start and it is unlikely that the two female MPs would keep getting Winger and Ziskey out of trouble this isn't really a problem though because they more than enough laughs. Bill Murray and Harold Ramis are on good form as Winger and Ziskey and Warren Oates impresses as Sgt Hulka. The rest of the cast, which includes quite a familiar faces, is pretty solid too. The story has the sort of gags that would probably appeal to all ages but some swearing and gratuitous nudity mean it is only really suitable for older viewers. Overall I found this to be good silly fun, not a must see but worth watching if you are a fan of Bill Murray.<br/><br/>These comments are based on watching the 'Extended Cut' version of the film."
"gattonero975","7","0","0","26 July 2016"," Was Almost Titled ""Stoners""...
","This film was originally conceived as a vehicle for Cheech & Chong. Even a nine-minute sequence was filmed in which ""John and Russell"" characters take LSD and accidentally end up on a mission to fight rebels in the Colombian jungle. Columbia Pictures thought it was the best scene in the film but Ivan Reitman deleted it because he felt that it did not fit the film's tone. Plus Murray & Ramis are no Cheech & Chong and the drug humor would have been more appropriate with Cheech & Chong. And according to the DVD special features, Ivan Reitman has also stated that the reason this fell through was because their manager insisted (without the pair's knowledge) on a 25% share of Reitman's next five films, which he wasn't willing to give up or do. The script was then rewritten for Bill Murray and Harold Ramis, and most of the ""stoner"" humor was shifted to the ""Elmo"" character played by Judge Reinhold.<br/><br/>Part of a mini-cycle of Hollywood movies made during the early 1980s centering around military cadet training. The pictures include: Private Benjamin (1980), Up the Academy (1980), Taps (1981), An Officer and a Gentleman (1982), The Lords of Discipline (1983), Heartbreak Ridge (1986) and Full Metal Jacket (1987), Biloxi Blues (1988)and Cadence (1990).<br/><br/>I truly believe this film influenced An Officer and a Gentleman in many respects. The story of two ""loser"" friends in basic training, the two woman they fall in love with, the rebel cadet versus the tough sergeant. All there. While Stripes is stupid/silly comedy, Officer is way more serious. And while Murray and Ramis are friends before they join, Gere and Keith becomes buddies once they meet inside. Soles and Young in Stripes are M.P's, Winger and Blount are local girls trying to snag an officer. Plus I also see Hollywood knew a good thing when they saw it because Stripes made unexpected millions , so Hollywood had Taylor Hackford make a real serious ""Stripes"" per say and make money. The gamble paid off big time as Officer and a Gentleman was the blockbuster that summer of 1982.<br/><br/>It also must of had a major influence at least in one scene to Stanley Kubrick as he used the same situation scene in the latrine in his own military film , Full Metal Jacket (1987) According to Ivan Reitman in the DVD Commentary, Columbia Pictures wanted to cut out the scene where Sgt. Hulka and John Winger have a confrontation in the latrine. They felt the scene was 'too serious'. But Reitman insisted that it be left in to truly establish Sgt. Hulka's strength and authority. Kubrick used that same situation but to a more deadlier effect. <br/><br/>I also want to say that what while it was great to see Murray and Ramis with director Reitman, pre-Ghostbusters, it would have been awesome to have had Dan Aykroyd in there also. He could have easily done the John Larroquette role or the John Diehl one. and to some extent the John Candy role. maybe Aykroyd was busy filming with Spielberg his Indiana Jones cameo, or just didn't ,understandably, want to play third banana to Murray and Ramis. Either way Larroquette, Diehl and especially Candy did a great job in their respective roles. I like that Candy even invoked Curly of the Three Stooges in the mud wrestling scene, doing the same mannerisms of Curly Howard when Curly would get upset and mad."

Filmed just a year before I was born, this movie was always on the shelf at home, and when the parents were out, my brothers and I would put this on and laugh our butts off! Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy, and plenty of other well known actors started their cinema roots with this off kilter homage to a military that was still pristine in image and was known for making men out of even the most wimpy souls in America.<br/><br/>If you had nowhere else to go, no ambition, or nothing better to do, the army would put you through basic and make a man out of you! It was the perfect stage for a comedy like this one. A bunch of life's miscreants join up for their own individual and mostly stupid reasons, and come together to form one of the worst, miss-guided and downright terrible troops the U.S military ever produced. Not for lack of trying however, it's just... when you get bunch of lemons, it's hard to make champagne.<br/><br/>The jokes are silly of course, some fall flat, and most are out dated by most comedic standards, but that is what makes it so damn good! And for some reason this movie has like... 6 acts (It's a bit like 2 movies in one to be honest, the original in the first half, and a sequel covering the second half of the film). Yet it still holds its edge and lightheartedness against the rude and crude comedies of the 2000 era.<br/><br/>Grab a few beers, sit down, and try to remember that there was life before terrorism, mortgage bubbles, and Justin Bieber.<br/><br/>6/10"

","To me I feel that ""Stripes"" reminds me a lot like the classic Army comedy ""Private Benjamin"" with Bill Murray taking the place of Goldie Hawn with only a few distinctive differences. Hawn didn't really know very much about the Army or the many regiments and training you have to go through to make it in the Army. While Bill Murray's Pvt. John Winger seems to know a lot about the Army protocols and the many ways he could outsmart and outwit his superiors. To me, his sardonic humour is played quite effectively and might be one of the reasons why this movie is really good. <br/><br/>Back in 1981, Illinois native Bill Murray was pretty much in his third year gracing the silver screen with witty charm, cynical humour and manipulative tactics to outsmart practically anyone crossing his path. After donning his craft on sketch comedies like ""Saturday Night Live"" and the Canadian equivalent ""SCTV"", Murray has churned up a string full of off-the-wall comedies like ""Meatballs"", 'Caddieshack"" and ""Stripes' being his third one shows that his flair for slapstick comedy is just a natural thing for him. Why spoil a good thing? Right?<br/><br/>The opening scenes features Winger who after a few hours loses his job as a cab driver, his girlfriend dumps him and a basketball ricochets through his window. Feeling like there's nowhere to turn to, he enlists in the Army. He also tries to persuade his brilliant friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) who's an English teacher to foreign students. The duo collaborates and writes their own set of Army protocols much to the chagrin of the hard-nosed Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates who hasn't acted in while due to poor health). <br/><br/>Murray seems to be permanently liberal in points of view towards the people surrounding him, both superior and inferior to him. He's not afraid to speak his mind out about you, even if it's not very flattering. When Hulka get shot, Winger arbitrarily steps up to the plate and commands the other recruits and these are where the funny bits of the movie comes to effect. <br/><br/>Unfortunately, like ""Private Benjamin"", ""Stripes"" gets lost out of focus near the middle of the film. In ""Private Benjamin"", the film lost its charm once the feminist message comes across while they were in Europe. In ""Stripes"" the film gets bogged down one he goes on a mission in Europe. If they would've stuck to the slapstick elements it was intended for, the movie would've been much better. <br/><br/>Winger's initiative was to operate on the very first mechanized armoured vehicle, before it gets underway, Winger and Ziskey hijack the RV and goes behind the Iron Curtain and they become lustful towards two female MP's (Sean Young and P.J. Soles). If the focus was on these four characters, it would have worked out in the long run. Instead it concentrates on the ridiculous mud wrestling scenes and the RV hijacking. The final product becomes deplorably infantile and takes away the intrigue that both Murray and Ramis carry throughout the film as likable obnoxious characters. I liked it when Pvt. Winger verbally lashes down at the recruits and belittles their background upbringings.<br/><br/>The late John Candy a long-time alum from ""SCTV"" fame comes here on his own as Pvt. Dewey Oxberger and he's more than just a friendly heavy- set guy, he's an ally of Winger's and his comedic wit is equally effective and rivals nice with Murray's."
"estebangonzalez10","6","0","0","17 July 2015"," The first time Reitman, Ramis, and Murray collaborated together
","""We are the wretched refuse. We're the underdog. We're mutts! But there's no animal that's more faithful, that's more loyal, more lovable than the mutt.""<br/><br/>Comedies have changed drastically over time and some of the humor that used to work in the past doesn't anymore, but there is something nostalgic about revisiting that unique style. During the early 80's there were a number of films centering around military cadet training such as Private Benjamin, Taps, Stripes, An Officer and a Gentleman, and so on. These irreverent comedies weren't afraid of being politically incorrect, so some of the jokes might feel offensive and incredibly sexist in today's world (which was the case in Stripes). Coming off fresh from his success in Meatballs, director Ivan Reitman decided to team up once again with Bill Murray for this military comedy. At the time, Murray was mostly known for his work in Saturday Night Live and the National Lampoon Radio Hour. He had gained some recognition for his roles in Meatballs and Caddyshack, but he was just getting warmed up with what would soon be his big break: Ghostbusters. Murray convinced Reitman to hire Harold Ramis to play his sidekick in Stripes, and despite having collaborated in writing the scripts for Animal House and Caddyshack, he had no prior experience as an actor. Reitman gave him the opportunity in Stripes and it marked the beginning of a successful collaboration between the three. And that is why I think Stripes is an important film because it helped pave the path for what was to come. It doesn't hurt that Bill Murray is the star of this film because he is an actor who always elevates the material he's in with his charisma and charm. He also shares great chemistry with Harold Ramis, who also proves to have a great sense of comedic timing. A lot of their dialogue was improvised and it helped the two were good friends before filming this. Include a funny supporting performance from John Candy and you have yourself a decent comedy with some hilarious and memorable scenes. <br/><br/>The film introduces us to John Winger (Bill Murray) a struggling photographer who is working as a taxi driver. When a passenger begins getting on his nerves, he decides he's not going to take it anymore. He stops the cab in the middle of a bridge and throws the keys out to the river. Things don't get better when he arrives home and discovers his girlfriend is walking out on him for being a slacker and not going anywhere in life. John isn't sure what to do with his life, so he convinces his best friend, Russell (Harold Ramis) to join the Army with him. They don't do it out of a sense of patriotism or anything, but because they know men in uniform are attractive and they also want to get in shape. Once they enlist, their training begins under the sturdy hand of Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). John doesn't take this army thing seriously and that gets him and the troop in trouble most of the time. What he does find is romance, as he and Russell begin escorting two female MPs, Stella (P.J. Soles) and Louise (Sean Young), which makes the experience all that more fun for them, but this eventually will lead the platoon inadvertently into enemy territory. <br/><br/>Bill Murray proves he's always been an expert at playing these wisecracking cocky characters and he does it in a very charming way so it's easy to sympathize with him. The film does seem a bit unbalanced however with a final climactic act that seems taken out of another movie, but I still enjoyed its dumb humor. Stripes isn't as popular as some of Murray's later work, but it's interesting to see his beginnings and realize he always had his charm. Stripes is an irreverent comedy, but it is unique in that it is quite restrained for what it is trying to say and do, and that is because of the way Murray and Ramis downplayed their characters. Stripes might not be one of Reitman's best films but it is still an enjoyable watch."

","Stripes is a great movie with a well written storyline and a brilliant comedic cast. It's simply a fun comedy and it dosen't need to, nor does it want to, be looked at beyond that, it's very funny and there are a ton of scenes where you can tell the cast was improvising and having fun together. It's definitely much longer than it needs to be, running for nearly two hours, I found that unnecessary and there were definitely several parts that could have been trimmed to be make this a more suitable ninety minutes, that's as long as I feel a movie like this should be. Bill Murray shines in the lead role, this is very early in his career but it is clearly evident that he already had the confidence and charisma to play the main character and was very capable of holding the whole movie. It's not a flawless film, but Stripes is very enjoyable to watch and I would recommend it to anyone looking for a good comedy. <br/><br/>A pair of slackers join the US Army with the hopes of getting their act together. <br/><br/>Best Performance: Bill Murray"
"ginocox-206-336968","6","0","0","7 April 2015"," A mildly amusing film that fails to be all it can be
","I saw ""Stripes"" years ago, but didn't remember much of it, aside from the ice cream scoop gag, not because it was unusually hilarious but because it was weird and nonsensical. Watching it again with high expectations because it is considered a comedy classic and a fairly open mind, I found it disappointing. It has some funny lines, but my general impression was that it missed many opportunities to be much funnier than it was. <br/><br/>It has a formulaic three-act structure, but it's weak. It's not what Blake Snyder would have classified as a fool triumphant, fish out of water, institutionalized, buddy love, coming of age or road trip, nor does it seem to fit easily into McKee's more detailed taxonomy of structures. John declares he wants to join the army to dry out, get into shape, acquire martial arts and earn enough money to purchase a Winnebago RV to impress the girls. Russell counters that he has a warped idea of the army as a sort of health club with neat uniforms. Later, Sergeant Hulka says he hopes that one day John will understand that soldiering is about discipline, duty, honor and courage. But of all these noble goals, the only one that gets any play is the Winnebago. At the end of the film, John is the same irresponsible, out of shape screw-up he was at the beginning, while Russell remains his reluctant but reliable sidekick. They don't achieve their goals or overcome any obstacles by acquiring new skills. John does deliver a motivational talk to his platoon, but he uses the same glib used car salesman tactics he used to persuade Russell to enlist. He later throws caution to the wind to come to the aid of his comrades, but this is the same attitude that led him to enlist. <br/><br/>Several scenes struck me as mildly amusing when they could have been much more. At one point, Hulka, who has already proved his superior skills, climbs a rope. I remember climbing the same type of rope in gym class as a teenager and I was more of a nerd than a jock. It's not a particularly difficult task, but it seems daunting to the group of misfits for some reason. The scene would have had much more impact if Hulka had used only his arms and kept his legs extended. At another point, a soldier is interrogated by unfriendly adversaries. The scene is dramatically dead, as the soldier had no secrets to protect, and it wasn't funny. There are dozens of ways the scene could have been made humorous. The soldier could have developed a serious stutter or insisted on giving his serial number but unable to recall it. They could have threatened him with bizarre forms of torture or a grasshopper (as in ""Ronin""). Their interrogation techniques could have gone awry. They could have administered a truth serum with unexpected consequences. <br/><br/>The platoon is somewhat diverse physically and ethnically, but they're all misfits. They could have achieved much more comedic and dramatic potential by giving each of the soldiers a special skill that John is uniquely able to elicit to overcome the final obstacles. Instead, half a dozen are given one-liners or an occasional pratfall or sight gag, but they're mostly tangential to the plot except for Candy's encounter with a door. <br/><br/>A lot of attention is lavished on John and Russell's love interests. As with most comedies other than rom-coms, the attraction of the straight character to the foolish character is not intuitively obvious. Here the attraction seems particularly improbable. Not only does the Army assign two petite girls to MP duty and later send them to Italy for no apparent reason, but these girls who are surrounded by physically fit young men, are irresistibly attracted to a couple of physically inept, irresponsible doofuses who lack the qualities the girls themselves consider important enough to pursue military careers. Not only do John and Russell need to do nothing to win their love and devotion, but they can't seem to do anything foolish enough to discourage them. At the beginning of the film, John's girlfriend leaves him because he is irresponsible, but he doesn't need to acquire responsibility to find love. <br/><br/>The film has a few good moments and some funny lines and gags, but could have been much better and squanders a talented cast in underdeveloped supporting roles."

","I really enjoy watching this army comedy from the early eighties with Bill Murray and John Candy in top form.<br/><br/>The story is about two misfits, Murray is a cab driver who decides to dump an irate woman in his cab on a freeway and is sacked from his job, while Howard Ramis plays his friend, who is a useless English teacher and whose job is on the line. Broke and desperate, Murray's girlfriend has dumped him, they decide to join the army.<br/><br/>The film for me is more memorable for its lesser characters. John Candy is hilarious as a massively overweight recruit, Ox, who joins the army to lose weight and Cooter, who joined up to avoid being drafted only to be told the draft ended nine years earlier. Also good for a laugh is the platoon commander, Captain Stillman, an incompetent buffoon who plays with toy soldiers and loses a top secret weapon.<br/><br/>For me my favourite parts are the mud wrestling competition, where Ox takes on two lady wrestlers and wins, the graduation parade where the recruits start dancing and win over a senior officer, and the secret weapon they are assigned to guard in Italy, a Winnebago which doubles up as a tank and ends up behind the Iron Curtain by mistake.<br/><br/>Apart from looking a little dated now( someone appears in an anti disco t shirt), Stripes is a hilarious comedy that has Bill Murray in top form and its mixture of comedy, romance( two very attractive female MPs) and a war film is top rate entertainment."

","As to the passing of the late Ramis, we lost not only a great actor, but a screen writing genius, like losing a diamond in the rough. Here in one of his more successful comedies, where he can be forgiven for the fizzer, low on laughs, Club Paradise that saw Robin Williams return to the big screen, after a two an a half year absence, we have comedy, army style. This movie's a great hit, that pays off, thanks not only to the great Bill Murray, but the quirky, no hope, delinquent army trainees, who prove in the end, prove they're not as useless as we think. Warren Oates is a plus here, as a hardened ""take no s..t"" drill Sergeant (aren't they all) who laid back, overweight ex cabbie, Murray, gets off on the wrong foot with. The start, prefore to our two, joining up with the army, has insulted cabbie, Murray leaving an old crusty woman, stranded on a bridge. With the dejected Murray coming back into his apartment, if as a tease shot, we see a momentary shot of Murray's younger girlfriend's t..s, leading us to question if it was purposely intended, or just a last moment decision by Ramis. This movie is truly a magical hit and works wonderfully as a hoot and a half comedy that will have you in titters a few times over, while showing you the serious side of, what the army training is really like and dedicated you have to be. The characters the talented actors brought to the screen, really impressed me, especially the psycho who hates being called Francis, providing one of the highlighted comedy moments. Sean Young and P.J Soles as sexy female privates, love interests of Ramis and Murray, provide some nice scenes off the base. In fact, Soles has never been sexier. Stripes forever remains a successful timeless hit, and one I definitely recommend, if never giving it a view. But I can still feel my nuts, when that trainee, misjudges that log, before keeling over."

","Bill Murray and Harold Ramis play two friends who find themselves jobless, broke, and out-of-shape, so impulsively join the army, only to find out that their lark has ""serious"" consequences for their lives.<br/><br/>Marginal comedy is really bolstered by Warren Oates' turn as tough Drill instructor Sgt. Hulka, who isn't remotely going to put up with their immature buffoonery. John Candy also shines as an overweight but game recruit in their platoon, who is ready for anything. Undeniably funny at times, but goes wrong when the platoon takes on a serious rescue mission behind the Iron Curtain,; the tone of this is all wrong, not to mention absurd.

"Chrysanthepop","Null","0","0","31 August 2012"," One of the most ticklish military films
","Ivan Reitman's 'Stripes' is among the funniest military comedies to come from Hollywood. This is also the movie that established Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Laroquette and John Candy as comedy actors (and introduced many like Judge Reinhold and John Diehl). Since then, Reitman has reunite with Ramis and Murray to create films like 'Ghostbusters' (which was a smash hit).<br/><br/>The key ingredient that makes 'Stripes' work so hilariously is Ramis and Goldberg's script. Reitman, his producers and writers originally wanted to make another Cheech and Chong film but things didn't turn out as expected and they left it to Ramis and Goldberg to readjust the script for actors Bill Murray and Harold Ramis. Now the writers just knew the actors very well so it was easy to rewrite for them and there was plenty of space for improvisation which added to the spontaneity of the humour.<br/><br/>The entire cast shared great chemistry and work excellently off each other. Murray and Ramis give some memorable scenes and who could forget their conflicts with Warren Oates's 'Hulka'? And John Candy's unforgettable mud-wrestling scene? One can easily tell that they had a great time filming (which the cast and crew admit to in later interviews). It's been a while since I last saw a film that had me laughing constantly.<br/><br/>The first half of the film focuses on the training scenes and the second half on their 'mission' to protect a military R.V. which leads to a little 'battle' in what was then known as Czechoslovakia. Throughout the characters remain consistent, never out of place and I liked that there wasn't too much focus on the final battle scene, leaving the humour balanced.<br/><br/>To conclude, this is one of the most ticklish films I've seen. Even memories of it have me laughing. An awesome film to enjoy with friends."

He drags his friend to join the military and they plan to show the military what it is like to have a good time.<br/><br/>When this film was released in 1981, the cast was unknown with the exception of Bill Murray.

","Ivan Reitman is the Mel Brooks of his generation, which means he takes nothing seriously, and this film is the perfect example. Bill Murray is his typical ""everyman"", just a plain Joe who is in his late 20's who has no clue what to do with his life. Harold Ramis is his buddy, and the two of them together make enlisting in the Army akin to signing up for Little League. The movie is resplendent with little side jokes and plots. John Candy and his ersatz side kick, played by John Diehl, are constantly doing the Stanly and Ollie routine. John Larroquette plays the typical college graduate who joined the Army to lead men and blow stuff up, and has no clue whatsoever how to do either (Don't laugh too hard, I actually worked with junior Ensigns in the Navy with the same problem). Warren Oats is the only truly straight up character in the entire film, and his attitude is very similar to Bobby Troup's in M*A*S*H (G&* D#$% Army). But you have to love this film, simply because it does what no other film can do, makes a very dangerous and serious profession and turns it into a reflection on the human condition. The film is rated ""R"" for slight nudity, language, and inferences to drug use, but I think most teenagers can watch this without being corrupted. Definitely a must for any collector of cinema."

"oneguyrambling","Null","0","0","25 September 2011"," Great 80s comedy with Bill Murray in his sarcastic prime.
","I am on record as saying Bill Murray is a comedy God. He ruled the 80s (Caddyshack, Stripes, Ghostbusters, Scrooged) stole the 90s (Groundhog Day, What About Bob? Rushmore), and remained relevant in the dubbos by interspersing more serious roles (Lost in Translation, Broken Flowers) in between the funny stuff.<br/><br/>Though it must be said that the funny stuff is getting harder to find, Garfield 1 AND 2? In reality a minor cameo in Zombieland was the decade's best effort – I'm not a fan of either Tenenbaums or Steve Zissou.<br/><br/>Over the last weekend one of the more retro channels had a mini marathon of classic 80s movies, so over the course of a weekend I sat down and watched Colors, Angel Heart, Enemy Mine and Stripes.<br/><br/>Stripes follows the classic strategy of putting funny guys in unexpected situations and letting them act accordingly – Will Ferrell has made a career out of it (whether I think it a worthy career is another matter) – in this case John (Murray) and Russell (Harold Ramis) are down on their luck average joes who decide to enlist in the army to make a few bucks After all what could go wrong? Right? This lends itself to various scenarios that show John, Russell and a cavalcade of disparate characters (including John Candy and Judge Reinhold) as they bumble and fluff their way through basic training under the watchful and vigilant eye of one Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates).<br/><br/>Now as much as I love Murray and this film wouldn't exist without him, Sgt Hulka is what sets Stripes apart. His dogged determination and blunt dealings with his trainees creates a great juxtaposition with John's carefree and anti-rules position, and the two are often at odds with each other over anything remotely pertaining to discipline.<br/><br/>Being an 80s comedy there is an inept Captain in charge who has no idea how the army really works, some quasi-hot female MPs who are there to provide John and Russell with something to have sex with, and a variety of non-standard situations to create laughs – a mud wrestling challenge with nubile young women anyone? So after the troop half arses their way through basic training a ""could only happen in the movies"" event sees them all not only pass but get given the plumb job of guarding the army's new super secret weapon – which looks like a medium sized bus with some cheap metal riveted onto the side panels.<br/><br/>Will they get up to mischief and inadvertently set the US on the brink of international conflict? You'll have to watch and find out.<br/><br/>Murray shines in his deadpan, dry, I couldn't possibly be more sarcastic – no, wait, yes I can way, Ramis is solid as the straight man reacting to his new surroundings in quite a reasonable way, and Hulka is always there to yell just loud enough and to create enough friction to stir things up and keep the plot moving.<br/><br/>As good as the soldiers are, Hulka drives them and the movie to greater heights. His role is truly one of the defining supporting roles of comedy in the 80s.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 7 / 10. Stripes is funny, lighthearted, painless and likable in every way. It also has just enough gratuitous 80s nudity to top everything off"

Anyone who was in the U.S. Army during Vietnam or a little later will identify with many of the insider jokes, and dialog by the Drill Seargents. The Reception Center where the guys first went when they got off the bus was the same place I went and the atmosphere was the same. Even if you were never in the military, you must see this one.

","Working class schleps John Winger(Bill Murray)and Russell Ziskey(Harold Ramis)decide,on a whim,to join the Army,much of the reasoning to escape the humdrum lives they lead in the big city. Probably not the best reasoning,but if we had good reasoning added to the mix of many comedies,they'd seem to cease being comedies now,wouldn't they?<br/><br/>Thus we have the seedlings of this largely enjoyable comedy that mixes many of the ingredients of National Lampoon's Animal House and Meatballs(which were directed and/or written by director Ivan Reitman and Ramis),which follows the two protagonists thru basic training on through their first deployment in Europe. And if you're guessing that there's more to the story than merely passing basic training and their deployment well,you'd be guessing correctly.<br/><br/>A friend of mine who's been in the Army(around the time this movie was released,in fact)told me that the film isn't based in much reality--and I'm sure most people who been in the Army would probably agree--but I have the impression that this has JUST enough real element in it to make it roundly palpable AS WELL as a lot of fun.<br/><br/>A fantastic ensemble cast features Warren Oates in one of his last roles(as their drill Sergeant),John Larroquette(as a preening,weaselly superior),John Candy(as the gregarious,heavy-set recruit with JUST the right amount of rage issues),John Dietz,P.J.Soles(a sympathetic MP who has a thing for Murray's character),Sean Young(same as SOles' character,only for Ramis),Conrad Dunn and John Volstead(pre-""Other brother Darryl"" from Newhart,as Laroquette's oft-put-upon aide)among others to fill out as big,loud and enthusiastic ensemble. Three years later,Reitman,Murray and Ramis(to name possibly just a few)would tone this formula down to ""PG"" for the even more successful comedy Ghostbusters. Here,they keep it loose,kinetic and light as a quasi-Cold War,broadly patriotic usage of about 100 minutes of film viewing.<br/><br/>A great watch no matter the medium(big screen,TV,video,DVD). The more recent DVDs have plenty of back-chatter,tributes and story about the making. Well,well worth the price if you're up for it,as well as this show."
"tavm","7","0","0","30 June 2010"," Bill Murray's Stripes can still be pretty entertaining to me after all these years
","Having just reviewed the first three movies that was co-written by Harold Ramis, not to mention the first three of his that also starred at least one SNL cast member-former or present at the time-we're now at his fourth of both categories and also his first in which he also appears. As with the previous two-Meatballs and Caddyshack-Stripes also stars Bill Murray. Also, as with Meatballs, Ramis' co-writers here are Len Blum and Dan Goldberg with Ivan Reitman once again directing. They make a good team here, Murray and Ramis, as they end up joining the Army mainly because of the former's bad luck in his last two hours as a civilian. Among the people they encounter in basic training: Judge Reinhold and John Candy who was familiar with both Bill and Harold since they all worked for Second City during the '70s while Candy and Ramis were on SCTV together as well. Anyway, they have a tough sergeant in Warren Oates who provides at least one serious scene with Murray when he tells him what he really thinks of him. But there's also John Larroquette as a bumbling captain who's threatened with Artic duty if he doesn't shape up. Oh, and besides Ramis and Candy, other Second City/SCTV members in this movie include Dave Thomas as a mud wrestling host and Joe Flaherty as a Russian guard. And finally, Ramis and Murray fall for a couple of female MP's played by Sean Young and P. J. Soles, respectively. Okay, with all that out of the way, I'll just say that I found Stripes hilarious up to the graduation and not as much after that but still pretty entertaining. Now, despite that earlier confrontation scene between Murray and Oates, one doesn't really expect too much learning about Army life on the former's part but part of me did feel he genuinely respected the sergeant and vice versa at the end. One more thing, while you can no longer be asked if you're a homosexual when applying for the military because of ""Don't Ask, Don't Tell"", I still found it hilarious hearing Bill and Harold's replies. Okay, so on that note, I definitely recommend Stripes. And, remember, ""There she was just a-walkin' down the street singing ""Doo Wah Diddy Diddy Dumb Diddy Doo..."" P.S. Larroquette is a native of New Orleans which is a two-hour drive from my current hometown of Baton Rouge, La. And his assistant is played by John Volstad who is best known as one of the Darryls on ""Newhart"" and unlike there, he has lines here which was interesting to hear. Update 7/2/10: I've just seen the extended version with 18 minutes of cut footage. There's a funny scene of Bill and Harold ending up in another country when they go AWOL. There's also a sexily funny one of them with P.J. and Sean in Germany. Those I wished had stayed. The others I'm glad they cut."

","Having spent my childhood in the 1980s, I am somewhat partial to films from that era; with this in mind, I like to re-acquaint myself with popular titles of that vintageor, conversely, catch up with ones I missed out on (for instance, I recently enjoyed that Thanksgiving 'classic' PLANES, TRAINS AND AUTOMOBILES [1987]) – even at this distance. This military comedy, then, falls in the latter category: unfortunately, it is not among the better comedies to have emerged during this time. As indicated, I watched the extended edition of the film which, at 123 minutes, is grossly overlong for this type of fare – even if the added footage (about 16 minutes' worth) is not merely filler material. Also, it deals with a milieu which had been treaded all-too-frequently over the years – which makes the whole exercise somewhat predictable, tiresome and downright pointless! Besides, I have never warmed to Bill Murray's arrogant, narcissistic and self-satisfied personality; the supporting cast includes other exponents of '80s comedies – namely Harold Ramis (serving also as co-writer and who would re-unite with Murray and director Reitman for the GHOSTBUSTERS movies), John Candy and Judge Reinhold (from the POLICE ACADEMY series). Somewhat surprisingly, Warren Oates takes on the predictably tough role of the D.I. – who, naturally, engages in a battle-of-wills with the rebellious Murray and even has to contend with an incompetent superior of his own. Again, it comes as no surprise at all that Murray (and Ramis) become involved with a couple of girls (HALLOWEEN's P.J. Soles and a pre-stardom Sean Young respectively). The last third of the film resolves itself into an elaborate action sequence as the two couples, who had decided to take a holiday in Germany driving a bullet-proof van armed with missiles (the army's latest secret weapon), find themselves having to rescue the rest of their unit who had gone after them and have ended up incarcerated in Communist Czechoslovakia! Mind you, the film is watchable enough for what it is – even if one could hardly call it memorable or even hilarious – but the various elements do not really jell together."

Plenty of great training, a bar scene involving a mud wrestling arena and a heroic rescue. Of course, the movie is at its funniest during the training scenes and their adjustments to army life.

Sitting in the theater, I had little idea that a few weeks later, I too would be marching in step while singing Manfred Mann's ""Doo Wah Diddy, Diddy"" with 80 other recruits in late 1981. I should note that this movie had absolutely nothing to do with me joining the service. That would be another comedy altogether.<br/><br/>---- John Winger is a New York City cabbie having a bad day; he gets ripped off by one fare, incessantly berated by another, run over by the Repo Man in his own car and has his pizza dropped in the alley... upside down. Just to top things off, when he tells his girlfriend that he's quit yet another job, she decides it's high time they call their relationship quits. ""It's just not fun anymore, John.""<br/><br/>Russell Ziske is a smart guy. Trouble is, he doesn't have the job to prove it. Russell is just getting by, teaching Basic English to a fresh group of immigrants from God-knows-where. Learning their sole knowledge of English consists of words you could never use during the Oath of Allegiance, he decides on another tack that soon has them singing backup during his rendition of Phil Spector's ""Da Doo Ron Ron.""<br/><br/>While splitting the last remaining beer at Winger's apartment, a commercial for the United States Army comes on the television. Making a bet that he could still do 5 push-ups, it occurs to John that maybe the Army isn't such a bad idea. He gets Russell to drive him down to the recruiting station. Winger hesitates when they get there, looking at Ziske and saying, ""Well... are you coming?"" ----<br/><br/>FAST FORWARD 25 YEARS<br/><br/>Stripes is a military film staple. Having seen it a zillion times while serving aboard a variety of ships (I did 23 years in the service... who knew?), it has sat in my meager DVD collection for some time. But recently, I took the opportunity to watch it again with my new bride, who, being an immigrant herself (Though capable of much more English than the ""Do Ron Ron"" group) had never seen it before. I was prepared to sit through it with a jaundiced eye. She, however, was soon giggling and laughing at parts exactly as I had those many years ago. Her laughter reminded me of how truly good this comedy is. Murray does a respectable turn as the reluctant soldier learning what life in the military means.

It was OK and you knew what they were trying to do to make it funny but it just couldn't make you laugh as much as during the basic training scenes. The final scene with the Soviet newspaper propaganda and the American magazines was nice but couldn't make up for the stupid climax. I think it would have been better just to leave the movie to the Army camp and edit the little RV thing out. But, Stripes is a Man's film when it comes down and is just hilarious at times.

","Stripes starring Bill Murray and Harold Ramis has a low life named John Winger and his friend join the army after their lives go down the tube in two hours. Under the order of Sgt. Hulka, the army under goes a five week training class till Hulka is in an accident. This causes John to train his team before graduation, and at graduation his team performs gun marches that wows the whole supreme. They are so good, they are assigned to look after a top secret military truck that John takes into his own hands and has his team kidnapped. Now it's up to him and a few friends to rescue his platoon!<br/><br/>Now my first impression of the film, could of been better. The cast is made perfectly but there are to many nudity jokes and slow scenes that drags this film by the roots. But that doesn't stop Bill to stop being funny. He gives a great performance as Winger who doesn't care what happens to him in the army. Harold does a good job acting as the careful and hectic best friend Russell but the best person in this whole movie is John Candy as Dewey 'Ox"" Oxburger. His scene at the strip club in the mud wrestling pit is priceless. ""I'm a lean, mean, fighting machine!"" This film may drag but it reaches it's goal with a good supply of action, tons of one liners that work, and love relations between two MP's and the two stars. The whole plot at the beginning switches totally when Bill and his platoon have to guard the army vehicle but the real action is in this sequence. You'll love the ending with the newspaper headlines in magazines like Penthouse and Romance Finders. Stripes gets the big 7, could of been better but it works in it's own way. Now that's the fact Jack, go out and watch a copy of Stripes! You'll love it, enjoy."

However if you've been in the military you can feel the emotional undertones appreciate the tongue in cheek as well as the seriousness at times but more importantly which one of us vets here NEVER wanted to do any of those things while we served c'mon you know you did. (who here hasn't seen 'OL Yeller?...Yeah thats what I thought) We all served with everyone of those guys at one time or another and I think it was captured in the best light possible for the time. Before I went in I loved this movie and after I grew up and then got out I appreciated it more. I still use the lines from it as humor but now my kids get them its really weird. Like telling my wife after 17 yrs of marriage ""are you kidding me I've got to read books on the side just to keep up with you..."" Its slow and a bit cheesy but if it was made as one of todays ""big budget"" pics it would been more appealing to todays audience just because I can see them updating the effects and camera-work.

With great comedic acting from Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette, Warren Oates and others, you just have to laugh, no matter haow bizzare or Politically incorrect it is.<br/><br/>John Winger (Murray) and Russell Ziskey (Ramis), two bummed friends, are bored and tired of their lives...so they join the US army.  Not really a wise choice, in a post-Vietnam War backdrop it presents.  Hilarity ensues when the Winger and Ziskey join up with a platoon of misfits and rejects, which includes Candy, Oates and a young Judge Reinhold. Capt. Stillman (Larroquette) plays a grumpy officer intolerable of Winger's men (a slight wink to the film's staggering number of ""National Lampoon's Animal House"" references) After promoting from basic training, the team is sent to a European country (I believe it's Italy at first) to guard and secure a new armed transport automobile that looks more like a RV than a tank.  Unable to hold him, Winger takes Ziskey to West Germany (remember the time) with him to go see his girlfriend, a fellow officer.  During this time, the platoon makes a dumb mistkae by crossing the 'Iron Curtain' of Czechoslovakia (at the time still under the control of the former Soviet Union) to do a covert mission and the team is captured by boarder guards.  Feeling a sense of duty, Winger and Ziskey cross the boarder to rescue the crew from Russian control.  Of course, laughter is served.<br/><br/>""Stripes"" is a hilarious film, even though it's, wihtout any doubt, extemely dated for the time.  Not dated meaning Murray and Ramis' younger looks, but of the politics in the film...the entire army still wears the Vietnam-issued green uniforms (compared to the enventual brush fatigues that was issued at the beginning of the 80's).  It's kinda silly still seeing Germany spilt into West and East (remember, the wall didn't come down until 1989, so it would be another 8 years before Politically correctness would step in), along with a Soviet control Czech republic.

The opening is in Louisville; Winger stops his cab in the middle of the 2nd street bridge and drops his keys into the Ohio River. (Ironically pointing North, on the opposite side of town and heading AWAY from the airport.) The entirety of the military sequences were shot at Fort Knox, about 30min down the road. (So it was a short bus ride after all.) Czechoslovakia was, of course, rural Kentucky. I actually had the pleasure of stumbling onto the Czechoslovakian camp a few weeks back while in KY.

Sure, in Stripes, or any other movie Murray has ever made, he works from a script, but among all big-screen comedians, only Murray has the ability to make those carefully memorized lines seem like he came up with them on the spur of the moment. Stripes was the first movie which used this aspect of his screen persona to its best advantage.<br/><br/>The appeal of Stripes is plain. Can aging hipsters get it together and fulfill the promise that they once saw in themselves without becoming squares? The movie says, ""Yes,"" and places Winger and Ziske in that veritable graveyard for hipness, the armed forces. The hook: They're too smart to be grunts, but not too smart to learn some lessons.

Here, Murray and old pal Harold Ramos enter the military and fond themselves getting away with all sorts of pranks, with Candy and Judge Reinhold among the others they encounter in an attempt at becoming soldiers that seems to be a major implausibility. <br/><br/>This farce isn't reflective of army life in any way, shape or form, just a scathing commentary on the silliness of the seriousness of it all.

Forget about any sense of reality with their characters, thrown in along with some innocent T&A for sexy thrills. Having already explored slobs vs. the preppy's and slobs vs. the snobs, this is the slobs vs. humorless authority, making along with ""Animal House"" and ""Caddyshack"" a trio of slob comedies that started a new genre of comedy and one that is still ripped off today."

Looking at their directionless lives, both John and friend Russell decide to enlist in the army to become men.  Despite hating the regime, both men do surprisingly well - a fact which leads them to a project in Italy.<br/><br/>The plot here is pretty basic and has been done many times before and since - wise ass joins the army and mocks it before eventually making good in his own way.  The film is split into two; the boot camp being the first and the mission in Italy being the second.  The first part treads familiar ground reasonably well without ever being very funny.  The second part is absurd and is far too silly to really be funny.  Plot didn't so much matter to me as long as I was laughing quite a lot but sadly I wasn't and the scripted gags and scenarios just felt tired, daft or both.<br/><br/>What saved the film from being bad was a great lead from Murray.  He shows himself to a great comic touch and this film was part of his breakthrough to films.  He doesn't have that many great lines but his delivery and his wise-ass delivery really does the job.  Ramis looks less assured and doesn't seem to be taking it very serious (but not in a good way).  He seems unsure of himself in front of the camera and gives a poor performance.  Oates is good and both Candy and Reinhold are pretty funny.  Young has a small role and isn't annoying - so that's good then!<br/><br/>Overall this is a silly comedy that might win you over if you are really in the mood and happy to accept less.  However I found it to be rather too daft to be funny and didn't laugh at great deal.  If you aren't sold on the silly comedy during the boot camp then the second half with a mobile home acting as an urban assault vehicle will just leave you cold.

","You look at the cast and you have to be impressed. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis, John Candy - throw in John Larroquette and Judge Reinhold and a couple of others. It's a good cast of SNL veterans and others who would become fairly well known. You look at the plot and you realize it's nothing particularly original. It's about a group of misfits in the Army. There are lots of similar type stories. But the cast draws you in, because you expect a fair bit from them. And for the first half of the movie they deliver reasonably well. The story revolves around John and Russell (played by Murray and Ramis) - who both find themselves in dead end jobs, going nowhere and decide that the Army looks like an easy gig. So they join up. And it turns out to be not so easy. That's one surprising thing about that fairly good first half - it's funny at times, but it also has its moments of seriousness and John and Russell discover that the Army isn't all fun and games. It was decent enough. But then came the second half of the movie. Something happens at the point of the platoon graduating from the military academy - especially when this joke of a platoon ends up being given responsibility for a top secret new military weapon. After that I thought ""Stripes"" descended into silliness and started to take on almost a slapstick quality that just didn't appeal to me as much. It's not so much that I didn't find it believable - really, none of it is believable - but that it wasn't interesting and it stopped being fun.<br/><br/>The female characters in this are mostly there for window dressing. Even the female leads (PJ Soles and Sean Young) don't have a lot to do and really can't be taken seriously - they play cute MPs who end up as playthings for John and Russell, although Young gets to do a wee bit more serious stuff in the latter stages of the film. But most of the women you see in this are for eye candy more than anything - there's a lot of toplessness but little substance.<br/><br/>It's a middling sort of movie. I give it a 5/10."

","Stripes is my favorite movie from comedic genius Bill Murray. Stripes is hilarious from start to finish and this is in my opinion director Ivan Reitman's finest film work as well. Harold Ramis has excellent chemistry with Bill Murray and his character and rapport with Bill Murray is a crucial component of making this film work. Murray and Ramis give some of their most memorable performances on screen and play off each other wonderfully. Plus, I am sure behind the scenes, his writing made this excellent(when combined with Murray's brilliant improvisation). The support cast is amazing with John Candy,PJ Soles,Sean Young,John Larroquette and Judge Reinhold. Also, let's not forget about Warren Oates in a very memorable role as Sgt. Hulka. Warren Oates gives the role and film some credibility and is excellent in this role. Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and company party all the time in this comedy classic and if you don't find this movie to be funny, you probably would'nt know a good time if it was sitting on your face."

","For me, ""Stripes"" is one of the great '80s comedies; mostly because it's been funny over the years, and still holds up today. It's over-stuffed with a terrific cast, beautiful women and the comedic stylings of Harold Ramis (man, that guy could write 'em). There are some John Candy lines I still quote every now and then, and I get a kick out of watching Ramis try to keep it together in his scenes with Bill Murray. And speaking of Murray, he is plying his smartass likability to the nth degree here. The whole movie brims with it.<br/><br/>And even though the movie completely switches gears into wacky misadventure during the second half, that first half is comedy gold.

","From director Ivan Reitman (Ghostbusters, Twins, Evolution) is this modest army comedy. Basically John Winger (Bill Murray) is a quick-witted cab driver, well mainly ambitious loser, and his friend Russell Ziskey (alos co-writing, Harold Ramis) is no different as a foreign people's English teacher. They see an advert for the army, and decide to join more as a joke than a career. They soon start basic training under the hard-nosed, impatient and no nonsense Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates). Other 'goofballs' of this platoon include overweight Dewey 'Ox' Oxberger (John Candy), naive Cruiser (John Diehl), constantly stoned Elmo (Judge Reinhold) and appropriately nick-named Francis 'Psycho' Soyer (Conrad Dunn). After an accident causes Hulka to be unable to lead, Winger takes over, and with a new (obviously humorous) demonstration they impress the generals. Winger and Ziskey also find time to romance two pretty female MPs, Stella Hansen (Halloween's P.J. Soles) and Louise Cooper (Sean Young). Later, they commandeer a high-tech military vehicle disguised as a camper van fro a weekend away, and doing this stumble into an international incident. Now they are obviously fighting the enemy, and trying to get out alive, and in the end are all obviously praised as heroes, and individually put on magazine covers. Also starring John Larroquette as Capt. Stillman, John Voldstad as Corporal, Stillman's aide, Lance LeGault as Col. Glass, Roberta Leighton as Anita and Antone Pagan as Hector. There may not be many hilarious jokes, but I can see what the critics mean by this being Murray's breakthrough, and the platoon marching and singing Manfred Man's Do Wah Diddy Diddy is fun. Worth watching!"

Now, I will admit that there were some un-funny lines (like some of the first few lines that John Candy says) but this movie is really pretty funny.

He also gets dumped by his girlfriend.

Animal House had some amusing set pieces and an underlying satire about Frat Houses and its linked with social status.<br/><br/>Stripes see Murray making not very clever or funny quips which sets him at odds with Sgt Hulka and gets his squad into bother. If I had to do a 10 miles run instead of a 5 miles one on my first day in the army, I would had given Murray a good kicking and the rest of the troops will had joined me.<br/><br/>The third act where they squad goes to Europe to test a new vehicle which John and Russell borrow to go off with their girlfriends is even more silly but just tagged on so they can be accidental heroes and Stillman can get his comeuppance.<br/><br/>Of course looking back at it this was just an updated version of the first ever Carry On film made in Britain in the 1950s."

","Bill Murray made his name with this early '80s comedy from director Ivan Reitman (the pair of them would later enjoy an even bigger box office hit with Ghostbusters). Stripes also ""inspired"" later films like Police Academy, Spies Like Us and Combat Academy, with its simplistic plot structure showing inept recruits going through training, irritating the hell out of their superiors, and finally coming good in the end. In itself, Stripes is harmless fun for the most part, with obvious jokes and pratfalls and occasional flashes of foul language and nudity. Of its type it is a passable enough time-filler (there are, without doubt, FAR poorer examples of movies of this kind).<br/><br/>Lazy layabout John (Bill Murray) realises his life is going nowhere and time is running out for him to make something of himself. Joined by his pal Russell (Harold Ramis), he decides to sign up for the army. Initially John and Russell expect this to be a ball, believing that they're in for the kind of action-packed, globe-trotting escapades shown on the army-recruitment TV commercials. Soon they realise they're in for a much tougher time than that as they begin the gruelling training under the leadership of the sadistic Sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates). After various misadventures and crazy pranks, the wannabe-soldiers under Hulka eventually get their act together and earn their qualified stripes.... whereupon they are promptly sent off to Europe to safeguard a top-secret new armoured vehicle. John and Russell take the vehicle for a spin, little realising that the rest of the U.S. Army think they've stolen it to hand it over to the Communists. The rest of their platoon are ordered to find them, kill them, and return the vehicle to its rightful place, but they are captured by the Communist forces and locked up in a Czechoslovakian prison camp. John and Russell do the only decent thing, and use their army training to bust their pals out of jail.<br/><br/>The film not only brought Murray's comic talent to the fore. A quick glance down the cast list shows other future comedy superstars like John Larroquette, Judge Reinhold and John Candy also given this early opportunity to show their skills. Oates also scores as the absurdly larger-than-life NCO, giving a performance of comic flair that is a million miles from the sweaty, dirty anti-heroes he used to play in old Sam Peckinpah movies. The storyline is totally predictable and implausible, and little effort is made to adopt any form of subtlety or wit, but for what it is Stripes works well in its broad and simple-minded way."

","Drinking comedies run the risk of being stupid when viewed by the sober. That's the problem with Stripes. The entire film is a Bill Murray ego trip, and if you are in the right mood, he can be quite entertaining. Otherwise, you wonder what else is on TV or if you have any better, funnier movies in your collection.<br/><br/>I generally think highly of Murray's comedy: Ghostbusters, Groundhog Day, What About Bob?; these are all great comedies. The problem with Stripes is that Murray seems to think that any anti-establishment behavior in the Army is going to come off as totally off the wall when really it's just an extended SNL sketch. Harold Ramis is actually much funnier and more careful with his comedic timing. Murray is all over the place, passing punch lines and belaboring others. While Murray plays with confidence, his performance has such indecisiveness that he seems to have just said whatever came to his mind and gave up on the script entirely.<br/><br/>Conrad Dunn's small part as Psycho was perfect. He made a cartoon out of his character quite successfully. Murray won't take that risk, because no matter what role he's playing, he's never ""acting."" You never forget it's Bill Murray saying those lines or doing that crazy thing. Murray has the Jack Nicholson disease where any character he plays pales in comparison to his own personality, which can be an asset. In this film, it's problematic. Murray gets better at creating characters later in his career, but this film is a dud, and when you sober up, you'll likely agree."

Murray plays a New York cabbie down on his luck, who has had enough of dealing with annoying customers like a lady he is driving to the airport one morning, and he decides to quit his job. Afterwards his car is repossessed, and his girlfriend realizes he is headed nowhere in life and he loses her and his apartment in the process. Ramis is his best friend an unsuccessful teacher teaching English as a second language. Needing direction in life, they see an advertisement for the U.S. Army on television, Murray wants to go all in for it and enlist in order to get into shape and have some stability while Ramis is more hesitant. Eventually Murray talks him into enlisting, and after a visit with a recruiter they are sent off to basic training. Fellow recruits consist of slobs, like John Candy who has joined the Army to lose weight and get into shape, a stoner played by Judge Reinhold, a dim-witted idiot played by John Diehl, and a crazed recruit played by Conrad Dunn who is obsessed with killing people. In charge of all of them is the tough as nails Sgt. Hulka (legendary character actor Warren Oates, in one of his last film roles, he died the year after this film was released), and their commanding officer is the incompetent Captain Stillman played by John Laroquette. The first half of the film mostly deals with Murray's rebellious behavior and attitude conflicting with Oates' no-nonsense by the book way of doing things, and there are a lot of laughs between those two, as well as with Ramis and the other recruits. There are some laugh out loud moments and quotable lines in the first hour alone. The second half consists of Oates' getting injured in an explosion, leaving the platoon to train themselves, Murray and Ramis falling in love with two single, attractive MP Officers played by PJ Soles and Sean Young, and consists of the platoon going to Italy to be in charge of an urban assault vehicle and getting captured by Russians in the process. The second half has it's moments and the scene at the graduation parade is classic, but after that Stripes starts to fizzle and goes downhill. It seems that Reitman just somehow forgot after the parade sequence that he was making an irreverent comedy and then turns the movie into a routine military, action picture. Some movies can balance those elements together nicely, but Stripes fails to balance both elements together at the same time during those last 30 minutes leaving it rather boring up until the finale which is redeemed by a few big laughs. If Reitman had been able to focus on the film being a comedy the whole time, and didn't focus any attention on the last half being an action picture, the film would easily be a flawless, comedy masterpiece. As a result the movie is worth seeing for at least the first hour alone. That hour has some truly classic comedy moments that still entertain all these years later. It's just a shame the last act couldn't have been as strong. Still Stripes still holds up better in my personal opinion than Caddyshack does, and because of the strength of the first hour, and fine comedic performances by everyone in the cast, this is definitely one 80's comedy classic no to be missed. Rest assured you will laugh and get a kick out of it, maybe more in certain parts than others, but there are definitely laughs and enjoyment to be found here. Parents be advised: There is lots of nudity, swearing, drugs and irreverent humor in this film the whole way through. This is not one for the kids, even though teenagers will probably love it for the edgy, goofy humor. If you want to show this to your teen, the movie has played on television a lot over the years so find a TV edited version, or watch this with a Clearplay machine."
"SimonJack","7","0","1","22 October 2016"," Adult comedy is very funny in parts
","Most folks who have served in the military should enjoy this film. But for certain parts and embellishment or extension of others, it could be a great comedy. The gratuitous Hollywood sex scenes don't add to the comedy, but detract from it. I suspect that the scenes of bikini- clad women mud-wrestling would be a turn-off for many people. I'm aware of the generational and specific cultural appeal this film seemed to be designed to reach. Still, it's too bad that the filmmakers couldn't see the great possibility for a dynamite film around this plot – sans the detracting sex element. It had potential to be a very funny comedy and spoof of the military and satire of the Cold War period. The main male stars of ""Stripes"" are hilarious in their roles. Bill Murray is John, Harold Ramis is Russell, Warren Oates is Sgt. Hulka and John Larrouquette is Capt. Stillman. John Candy is wasted in the role of Ox. <br/><br/>Three superb scenarios make this movie worth viewing by adults. The drill routine of the platoon for the formal military review is outstanding. The misadventure of Capt. Stillman leading some of the platoon into Soviet Czechoslovakia is hilarious, with the subsequent rescue effort by John and Russell in the secret urban assault vehicle. And the ending scene is very funny with results of the escapade for the individuals as the credits role. <br/><br/>The plot of ""Stripes"" could have been developed into a great film. Instead, it provides a few hilarious sketches amidst the humdrum riffraff of sexploitation."

","Within several hours, John Winger (Bill Murray) has lost his job, girlfriend Anita (Roberta Leighton), automobile, and apartment. Going nowhere, he convinces his friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis) to enlist in the US army with him. The two buddies wind up in Ft. Arnold (Get it?), where the focus is on basic military training: hiking, running, rope climbing, grenade throwing, shooting, mortar firing, etc. The drill instructor is Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), who teaches about ""discipline, duty, honor, courage."" But as the brash and outspoken Winger gets under his skin so often he gets to do many push-ups. <br/><br/>Of course, much of the dialog and happenings are fanciful. Winger's group, the 3rd platoon, Bravo Company, features more than a few misfits and includes the heavy-set Ox (John Candy), Psycho (Conrad Dunn), dimwit Cruiser (John Diehl), stoned Elmo (Judge Reinhold), and others. Hulka's superior is the inept captain, Stillman (John Larroquette). The commanding general at the fort wants a crack platoon to man the latest project, the army's prototype, the Urban Assault Vehicle (EM-50, which looks like an armored motor home). Captain Stillman is assigned the task; if he fails, he will be sent to a post north of the Arctic Circle. Meanwhile Winger's troubles continue and he tries to desert before he is foiled by Ramis. When our heroes finally escape KP, they go to town; the situation at the local bar ends in a brawl. Along the way, Winger and Ramis hook up with two WACs, Louise (Sean Young) and Stella (P.J. Stoles). A minor miracle occurs when the men of the platoon finally graduate from basic training. <br/><br/>They eventually wind up in Europe. When the platoon blunders into Czechoslovakia, then still occupied by Russians since the end of World War II, they are captured. So it is up to John Winger, Russell, and their girlfriends (hard to believe) – Louise and Stella – to rescue them with the EM-50. Why World War III did not start there and then is . . . well it's a comedy. Will anybody get promoted? HINT: See the title. One of the movie's last images is the press cutting of the Newsworld Magazine article: ""The New Army: Can America Survive?"" One does wonder. <br/><br/>The plot is thin and the comedy spotty, but the film has its moments, such as the slapstick basic training scenes at Ft. Knox (not Arnold!). Then again, jumping the girls' bones in the general's house, the mud-wrestling match, and the skirmish with the Russians? Hmmm . . . Bill Murray's humor is sardonic and effective; it suits his personality well. Some will be turned off by his self-centeredness (and his haircut). This is an early effort by many actors, including John Candy, John Diehl, Judge Reinhold, and Sean Young. Late in his acting career, Warren Oates does very well as Hulka, whom he plays so straight that he can practically pass as a real DI. The women are all very attractive. By the way, the striking blonde girl with those gorgeous legs in Stillman's convertible at fictitious Ft. Milano in Italy is Lois Areno (née Aurino, a/k/a Hamilton). Note that in later years the movie director included an Extended Cut, which is almost 18 minutes longer than the released version, and includes several nude scenes. The movie was so popular that it made millions at the box office. <br/><br/>""Do-wah diddy-diddy dumb diddy-do . . ."""

","I guess this is one of the classic T&A movies from the eighties. As my friend said last night there is a fine line between T&A and rip off porn. Personally I am not a fan of porn, especially how the plot is non-existent, and the only one I ever saw, the guy who was watching it simply fast forwarded most of it and goggled at the explicit sex scenes, which I really did not appreciate.<br/><br/>Anyway, that has little to do with this movie. Stripes is basically about a loser who gives up on his job because he can't stand the customers and loses his girlfriend because she wants somebody who can grow. So, in a fit of despair he and his friend decide to join the army. Then it simply goes through the incompetence of his squad during basic training who end up getting into trouble in Czechoslovakia and getting out alive.<br/><br/>Really there is little more to this movie. It makes a bit of a joke of the army, suggesting that general infantry are simply incompetent fools that manage to survive through pure luck, and the lieutenants are idiots. The only competent soldier in the entire movie (other than the other brigades) was sergeant Hulka. And he gets stuck with the worse brigade of all.<br/><br/>I guess this movie is okay, if you simply want to turn your mind off and watch something that is really, in the end, meaningless. It does star John Candy so I guess that is an added bonus."

","If you know me in real life, you'd test me constantly on movie trivia, pretty much all of my friends do. But one of my favorite things they do is ask which movies I haven't seen and try to stump me, which my boyfriend did the other day with Stripes. I was a bit confused because I thought it was a movie I would have seen but never did. So he bought the movie and we watched it, from what he was describing, I was expecting one of the funniest comedies. After all it has Bill Murray, Harold Ramis and John Candy, some of the funniest actors of all time. But honestly I wasn't all that impressed, not to put the movie down, it does have some funny moments. Bill and Harold have excellent chemistry and make for great best friends on screen. John Candy is always a pleasure to watch and honestly I think that he stole the movie, he is just one of the most lovable actors in history and naturally you can't help but adore him. I watched his biography the other day and apparently the mud wrestling scene was very uncomfortable with him because of his weight, but he did it anyways just for the laughs and that's what makes him so wonderful, he is willing to do anything to put a smile on a person's face. But as wonderful as his presence is, Stripes is still over rated.<br/><br/>John Winger is a slacker in his late 20s who experiences the worst day of his life as, in the span of just a few hours, he quits his job, his car is repossessed, he drops his pizza on the street, and his girlfriend dumps him. Realizing that his life is a failure, he decides he needs a new direction. At that moment, a recruiting ad for the U.S. Army plays on the television, and he decides that is just what he needs to get in shape. Talking his best friend Russell into joining, they quickly drive to the nearest recruiting office and are soon off to basic training. Moments after arriving, Winger has already offended their drill sergeant, Sergeant Hulka, and stands out as a misfit throughout basic training. So throughout training, Winger keeps messing up and continues to be a goof as others are punished for his actions. He starts to question if the army really was for him all along or if there is still a strong possibility to over come it all and be an adult.<br/><br/>So did I hate the movie? No, I did like it. One of the scenes that I did really enjoy was when Murray finally gets his act together and pulls his troop in for the graduation and shows off. It was well put together and really excited me. I also loved how Murray makes some of the drills into a joke and as they're marching they start singing the ""do-a-diddee"" song. There are some memorable moments in the movie that definitely make it worth the watch. But over all I have to say that the script isn't one of those ""non stop laughs"" stories. It's one of those movies that I saw once and am more than happy with seeing the one time. So for nostalgic reasons, I would recommend it big time, plus it has an excellent cast that I'm sure you'll love. Though I admit, these were the good ol' days of dirty comedies and didn't apologize about it, I miss those and at least with Stripes I got a little of my traumatic childhood back.<br/><br/>6/10"
"zardoz-13","8","0","2","6 May 2010"," One of Bill Murray's First Box Office Action Comedies!
","""Meatballs"" director Ivan Reitman scored his first major hit with this formulaic adventure comedy about a pair of civilian misfits who momentarily take leave of their senses and join the U.S. Army. Cab driver John Winger (Bill Murray) experiences one hideously terrible day when he loses his job, watches helpless as his car is repossessed, and his girlfriend walks out on him. In a fit of lunacy, Winger persuades his best friend Russell Ziskey (Harold Ramis), who teaches English as a second language, that they can ""be all that they can be"" if they enlist in the U.S. Army. Essentially, this uneven but hilarious spoof about military service succeeds because of Murray's outlandish sense of humor and ""Magnificent Seven"" composer Elmer Bernstein's exhilarating score. No sooner have Winger and Russell gotten to boot camp than they confront their worst nightmare, crusty old drill sergeant Hulka (Warren Oates of ""The Wild Bunch"") who hates Winger's smart aleck sense of humor. Hulka has Winger doing push-ups to straighten him out. When our misguided heroes try to go A.W.O.L., they encounter two sexy Army MPs, Stella (P.J. Soles of ""Jawbreaker"") and Louise (Sean Young of ""Blade Runner"") who bring them back alive. Meanwhile, our heroes have an incompetent officer, Captain Stillman (John Larroquette of ""Blind Date""), doing his best to berate them. The platoon that Winger and Russell land in consists of misfits, such as the overweight Ox (John Candy of ""Spaceballs""), witless Cruiser (future ""Miami Vice"" regular John Diehl), wacky Elmo (Judge Reinhold of ""Beverly Hills Cop""), and sneering Psycho (Conrad Dunn of ""Jumpin' Jack Flash""). <br/><br/>Most of what follows is predictable. Nevertheless, Bill Murray's improvisation skills serves him splendidly, particularly his ""big toe"" speech in the barracks. Of course, Sgt. Hulka and Winger don't see eye-to-eye, and Hulka uses Winger's insolence to punish the entire platoon. This is about the time that they have their first date with Stella and Louise. At one point, pompous Captain Stillman wants to make our heroes repeat boot camp, after they embarrass him during a fight at a nightclub that sponsors mud wrestling with bodacious babes in skimpy attire. The night before graduation, Winger and Russell train their Army buddies how to perform complicated rifle movements so they can impress General Barnicke (Robert J. Wilke of ""The Hallelujah Trail"") and they succeed in amazing the general with their adept rifle spinning skills. Indeed, General Barnicke is so impressed that he orders Stillman and his men to fly to West Germany and participate in his top-secret project involving a multi-faceted EM-59 Urban Assault Vehicle. Hulka gives everybody else weekend passes, but he orders Winger and Russell to remain behind on base and guard the EM-59, a 1970s GMC recreational motor vehicle equipped with technology galore, including a missile firing system. Stillman takes his blond babe of a girlfriend to show her the vehicle late one evening and discovers to his horror that the vehicle is missing. Winger and Russell have appropriated the recreational vehicle so that they can take Stella and Louise on a date. According to the sentry, Winger and company took the vehicle out to get it washed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Stillman rounds up the platoon and they pursue Winger and company, except that they take a wrong turn and wind up in the Soviet Bloc where they are captured and subjected to torture. Although he advised Stillman against a rescue operation, Hulka joins Stillman but later leaps off the truck transporting Stillman and company after Winger and Russell. Our heroes pick up Hulka's distress signal and plunge into the Soviet Bloc in their souped up, military SUV, blow up a guard tower, and rescue their buddies. This action-packed finale marks ""Stripes"" as an anti-communist movie as out heroes along with Stella and Louise get the drop on the poor border guards at the Czechoslovak Socialist Republic and Winger ties them up and puts on a Czech uniform. A pitched battle rages as Winger and Stella, armed with machine guns, breaks Stillman and the platoon out, and hightail it back across the border. Along the way, Sgt. Hulka leaps onto the roof of the motorhome and rides out with them. Ultimately, Stillman is transferred to to a weather station near Nome, Alaska, while Winger, Russell, Hulka, Stella, and Louise come home to a hero's welcome. Ironically, in ""A-Team"" fashion, nobody is seen either getting shot-up or killed during Winger's raid."

"cariart","Null","0","1","19 August 2003"," Bill Murray Shines In Brilliant, If Uneven Comedy...
","STRIPES, the best service comedy of the 80's, was released during Bill Murray's halcyon career years (1979-1984), and has moments of absolute lunacy and imagination, faltering only during the last third of the film. A showcase for many rising stars (Harold Ramis, John Candy, John Larroquette, Sean Young, Judge Reinhold) and featuring Warren Oates' funniest performance on film, it nevertheless is primarily Murray's show, and he delivers, brilliantly!<br/><br/>
As an arrogant but likable loser who thrives on twisting the 'rules' to suit him, Murray combines physical humor, sly one-liners, and an anti-establishment point of view to establish himself as the logical successor to the anarchists of ANIMAL HOUSE. His character, John Winger, is not only a jerk, but charismatic enough to make being a smartass desirable! After losing his girl, his job, his home, and even his pizza (""Then depression set in,"" he announces), he sees a TV commercial for the Army, and convinces his friend Russell Ziskey (sweetly played by Harold Ramis), an English language teacher who's better at teaching cuss words to his students than English, to drop everything and enlist with him.<br/><br/>
Basic is a challenge for Winger, as the Army expects him to be a soldier! In a unit comprised of idiots, psychopaths, potheads, and an overweight recruit who enlisted to ""shed a few pounds"" in a 'Club Med'-style environment (John Candy, who is very funny), Winger immediately attempts to take charge, only to be put down by gruff drill instructor, Sgt. Hulka (Warren Oates), who is wise to all of Winger's scams. Not that this interferes with Winger and Ziskey's social life; the pair soon have MP girlfriends (P.J. Soles and Sean Young) sharing trysts in the General's quarters!<br/><br/>The film's highlight occurs after Sgt. Hulka is incapacitated by an exploding grenade. Faced with having to start basic training all over again, Winger coaches the unit overnight in HIS kind of drill for the final Review and Parade. Unfortunately, everyone then oversleeps, and arrive at the Parade Ground in all manner of dress. Winger's unorthodox marching routines are a hit, however, and the General, thinking he is watching a crack outfit, addresses Winger in one of the funniest exchanges ever recorded on film!<br/><br/>Unfortunately, STRIPES doesn't end with Winger's completion of basic training, but moves to Europe, where the unit (and Sgt. Hulka) are assigned to guard an attack vehicle that looks suspiciously like an RV. While there are a few amusing moments in this final chapter of the film, it lacks the inspired madness of basic training, and drags, a bit, until the famous 'Magazine Cover' postscript.<br/><br/>
All in all, STRIPES is a memorable, if flawed near-classic, and paved the way for Murray and Ramis' blockbuster, GHOSTBUSTERS. If you're a Bill Murray or service comedy fan, it should not be missed!"
