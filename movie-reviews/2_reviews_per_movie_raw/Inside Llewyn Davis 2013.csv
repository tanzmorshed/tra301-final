","This is the first time I've felt compelled to write a review for on IMDb. There are only a few movies in history that have impacted me as much.<br/><br/>The first time I saw Inside Llewyn Davis, it left me feeling empty and confused. While I appreciated the music, the acting, and the cinematography, I couldn't understand why anyone would love this movie (and I am a huge Coen fan). After all, it's just scene after scene of a jerk getting beaten up by life with no real plot progression and no real reason to care about any of the characters.<br/><br/>I then came across the movie again on TV and decided to give it another chance.<br/><br/>After this second viewing, the movie's themes connected with me in a big way. After my third and fourth viewing, it shook me to my core.<br/><br/>This movie is almost too realistic. It follows none of the conventional ""rules"" and there is no winner or hero. There's no real drama. There's no ""silver lining"". There's only struggle. And then acceptance.<br/><br/>For every one Bob Dylan there are myriad Llewyn Davis'. Really talented musicians and artists that work really hard and simply don't catch the lucky break. People go under the radar, under-appreciated and overlooked. People that never make it big and therefore question whether they should be doing it at all.<br/><br/>This is a film for the everyday folk; a beautiful empathetic look at art, music, and everyday struggle."

","Greetings again from the darkness. If you are a follower of the  filmmaking Coen Brothers, then you are quite aware of their complete  lack of artistic interest in any traditionally successful character.  Their work is inspired by life's obstacles and tough luck, even if  brought on by a character's own poor judgment. Coen Brother stories  revolve around those who carry on and have (blind?) faith that their  approach, no matter how ill conceived, is the only option ... the only  path worth taking. Their main character this time out seems to think  life is filled with only careerists (sell-outs) or losers (those who  can't get a break).  The titular Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) is introduced to us  onstage at the Gaslight singing a beautiful folk song. Moments later he  is lying in the back alley after taking a whipping from a mysterious  stranger. It's not until this scene is repeated again at the film's end  do we understand the cause of this effect. See, Llewyn is not a very  likable guy. We learn he is still grieving from the suicide of his  musical partner (as sung by Marcus Mumford), and that he bounces from  sofa to sofa amongst acquaintances and family members. Llewyn has no  friends, only acquaintances too kind to throw him out ... even if he  might be the father of an unwanted baby, or if he accidentally allows a  beloved pet cat to escape.  The story is based in the folk music scene of 1961 Greenwich Village in  the pre-Bob Dylan days. The Coen's were inspired by the memoirs of Dave  Van Ronk entitled ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street"". So while the songs  are real and the characters are often inspired or based upon real  artists of the time, Llewyn's story is pure Coen fiction. That means  cringing, levels of discomfort, uneasy chuckling and moments of rapture  ... such as John Goodman evoking a drugged out Doc Promus spewing harsh  poetic diatribes.  We never really know if the Coens are making a statement or tossing it  out for us to debate. Are they saying that even the ugliness of  Llewyn's personality can produce something as beautiful as music, or  are they saying that we get tricked by beautiful music into thinking  that the artist must also be pure? Carey Mulligan (as Jean) has one of  the film's best and most insightful lines when she tells Llewyn he is  ""King Midas' idiot brother"". Her pure disgust (and expert rendering of  the F-word) and anger contrasts with her angelic onstage persona with  husband Jim (Justin Timberlake).  As always, the Coens provide us a constant flow of interesting and  oddball characters. In addition to Goodman's jazz hipster, we get  Garrett Hedlund as an ultra cool (til he's not) valet, Adam Driver as a  cowboy folk singer, Troy Nelson as a virtuous Army folk singer (based  on Tom Paxton), and Llewyn's Upper East side cat owners, his spunky  sister, and best of all F Murray Abraham as Bud Grossman, the owner of  Chicago's Gate of Horn club. Based on the real Albert Grossman who  discovered Peter, Paul and Mary, and managed Bob Dylan, Grossman is the  lone witness to Llewyn's audition. This may be the most touching  musical moment of the movie (""The Death of Queen Jane""), but it's  clearly the wrong song for the moment.  Oscar Isaac is exceptional as Llewyn Davis. He captures that crisis of  self that's necessary for an artist whose talent and passion is just  out of step with societal changes. We feel his pain, but fail to  understand the lack of caring he often displays towards others. We get  how his need for money overrides his artistic integrity as he  participates in the novelty song ""Please Mr Kennedy"". Why Isaac's  performance is not garnering more Oscar chat is beyond my  understanding. It's possibly due to the fact that the movie and his  character are not readily accessible to the average movie goer. Some  thought and consideration is required.  If you are expecting a feel good nostalgic trip down the folk singer  era of Greenwich Village, you will be shocked and disappointed.  Instead, brace yourself for the trials of a talented musician who  believes the music should be enough. Speaking of music, the immensely  talented T Bone Burnett is the man behind the music and it's  fascinating to note how he allows the songs to guide us through the  story and keep us ever hopeful of better days. This is the Coen  Brothers at their most refined and expert."

","""If it was never new, and it never gets old, then it's a folk song.""<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have worked together over the past couple of decades delivering some inspiring work. Their films are extremely varied (ranging from dark comedies to westerns or thrillers) and that is why people rank their films so differently according to their own genre preferences. What these films tend to have in common is that they focus on an unfortunate main character (the Coen brothers don't seem to be too interested in successful characters) and they also include a lot of quirky characters. The Coens are also great at writing interesting characters that despite being unpleasant at times still capture our attention, and they also include a lot of dark and sharp humor. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films where we are forced to follow an unpleasant guy in the course of a week and somehow hope he recovers and achieves his goal. This is a film that you probably enjoy more when you think about it once it's over or on a rewatch because it's philosophical and sad, but rewarding none the less if you stick through it. It is also open to many readings and interpretations. You can think of this as being an honest film about someone who doesn't achieve his dreams. We've been saturated with so many films that focus on following our dreams and never giving up on them, but it is rare to see a film focusing on someone who doesn't achieve them. Like Llewyn, we sometimes throw away other possibilities for success because we are too blinded on pursuing our own thing. That is exactly what happens here (and in this way it differs from A Serious Man where the main character suffers misfortune from things that he can't control). Llewyn could've listened and taken good advice, but he's so narcissistic and blinded by his own ambition that he misses several good opportunities. Another way you can read this film, and this is the one that worked best for me, is that Llewyn is learning to cope with the loss of his partner. He was a better singer when he wasn't on his own and now that he has lost his partner he doesn't seem to know what to do next. He is a tortured artist struggling to cope with grief. It's as if the Coens were admitting that they wouldn't know how to make films without each other. They inspire one another and that is where their success relies. Perhaps if something would happen to one of them they would feel like Llewyn, lost and unable to move on. This is just brilliant filmmaking and the Coens prove once again that they are on top of their game.<br/><br/>The film takes place in the course of one week as we follow a struggling folk singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaacs) across Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. He has recently released a solo album that isn't selling. With no money and no apartment, Llewyn spends his days jumping from couch to couch at friends houses while performing small gigs at local Cafes. One of the places he crashes in is at fellow musicians, Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean's (Carey Mulligan) apartment. Llewyn isn't really a guy anyone wants to be around much, but he continues to pursue his dream of becoming a solo artist. In a way he's his own worst enemy as many of the obstacles he faces are his own doing. <br/><br/>I'm not a fan of depressing films, but somehow the Coens captured my attention through their smart script and beautifully constructed film. The gray cinematography is gorgeous and really sets the melancholic tone of the film. Somehow despite not liking Llewyn, Isaacs manages to portray his character so well that we do root for him and want him to succeed. It's an impressive film that succeeds thanks to Isaacs heartfelt performance. We also get to meet some of the quirky characters that the Coens always include in their films. John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund were the chosen ones this time around and they both added the dark humor in this otherwise sad and melancholic film. The soundtrack is also a lot of fun to listen too and Isaacs has a great voice."
"saschakrieger","10","129","172","17 December 2013"," Don Quixote with a guitar
","No doubt: Llewyn Davis is a loser. First, his career as a folk singer  is going badly: his duet partner committed suicide, his record isn't  selling, he makes so little that he cannot afford his own apartment but  has to move from friend to friend, or rather from acquaintance to  acquaintance. Secondly, as far as human relationships are concerned, he  is a total failure. His ex girlfriend despises him, one of her  predecessors faked an abortion to have him out of her  and the mutual  child's life  people who are sympathetic to him, get a rather rude  treatment on a daily basis. After A Serious Man, the Coen brothers have  again chosen to depict a man on the wrong side of luck. Only this time,  one might say he deserves it.  Or maybe not, for he has one redeeming feature. The film opens with a  long scene in which Davis (Oscar Isaac) performs a sad old folk song.  The camera gently hovers around him, catches the hushed, intensely  attentive atmosphere of the smoky basement club, while he sucks his  audience  us  into the dark, sorrowful world he creates in his song,  hinting at a depth he so often will not show in ""real life"". It is this  contrast, the dialogue between the sadly funny tale of a modern Don  Quixote and that other, older, tenderer story, the music tells. For as  much as this is Llewyn's story, it also is that of the redeeming power  of music. For even if Davis is the same at the end as the story comes  full circle and returns to its opening, as he once again gets beaten up  and is succeeded on stage by a young, cocky folk singer with a nasal  voice who will soon change music  and not just folk music  forever,  there is just the tiniest hint that this Llewyn Davis might have some  sort of promise after all, maybe not as a successful singer, but as a  human being.  Inside Llewyn Davis is inspired loosely by the story of Dave van Ronk,  a star of the Greenwich Village folk scene around the time of Bob  Dylan's arrival there in 1961. Dylan learned a lot from van Ronk and  stole some of his most promising songs, but that is a story to be told  another day. This one is about a man lost in a world that hasn't been  waiting for him, who has a mission that is entirely his own. The  lengths to which he goes to show the world he doesn't care are  astounding. And yet he craves love. Oscar Isaac is a miracle: even in  his most repelling state, in his most rejecting attitude, there is a  flicker of sad longing in his face, his eyes, a face the Coens show us  much of. It is one you need to dive into, closed to the casual observer  but hiding so much pain and uncertainty and desire to live one  sometimes thinks it must explode. The Coens' cinema is one of subtlety,  of nuanced, of shades of grey between the black and white. In Isaac,  they have found their perfect actor, heading a stellar cast including  Carey Mulligan, John Goodman and Justin Timberlake.  As so often, the Coen brothers are masters at creating an atmosphere, a  universe of its own, unique as well as absolutely consistent. It is a  world of the night, in which grey shades reign, days are pale and dust  is everywhere. Even in the open there is a sense of narrowness, of  tight spaces, lightless basements that are cage and protective space in  one. It is the tiny holes that provide the only rooms for creativity,  for the soul to speak. And so it is that the dark world of the  underground gradually regains some warmth and coziness, the dark  becomes a zone of comfort, while everything else becomes cold and  distant.  Having said all this, Inside Llewyn Davis is first and foremost a  comedy in the Coenesque sense of the term. It is a Quixotic tale full  of quirky characters at time bordering on the fairy-tale like   especially true for the sequence around Goodman's character, a  trodden-down mixture of villain and clown that calls up associations of  the expressionist nightmare world of their earlier film Barton Fink.  The other foot of the film is firmly on the ground, in the existential  struggle of a man the world won't welcome. But there is still that  third element: music, that timeless realm of love and pain and  suffering and hope. It is here the film is anchored, it is here this  Don Quixote conquers his windmills, armed solely with his guitar. It is  here it all comes together. Tragedy, comedy, fairy tale, social drama,  held together by the softest of touches. Another Coen brothers  masterpiece. What else could be expected?"
"dfranzen70","9","95","136","11 December 2013"," Fantastic sound, atmosphere, acting.
","Inside Llewyn Davis is an intimate, well-executed, and honest slice of life. It features a humanistic, heartfelt performance by Oscar Isaac as the titular folk singer, arresting cinematography, and a sharp, tight-fisted script by the Coen brothers, who also directed.<br/><br/>It's Greenwich Village in the early sixties, when folk music was either coming into its own or ready to be usurped by a more mainstream genre. Llewyn has no home, drifting from gig to gig and crashing on couch after couch as a matter of design; is vagrancy is his life's plan. Llewyn is at turns a noble soul who exists for the sake of making the music he wants to make and a resentful twerp who mooches off friends just to sustain his unsustainable lifestyle.<br/><br/>The movie is only somewhat linear, with closing scenes mirroring opening scenes, and it is told entirely from Llewyn's point of view. The Coen brothers masterfully show us not only Llewyn's perspective but also an outside perspective; this allows us to feel both empathy and loathing toward him.<br/><br/>Llewyn is nothing if not complex. The movie does a terrific job of avoiding the usual clichés, such as a down-on-his-luck musician catching a lucky break, or a bitter man having a quick change of heart. It's not that Llewyn is constantly sneering at everyone, holding his poverty up as both a shield and a trophy, it's that he is so multilayered that when he does a kind act or offers some praise or thanks, we don't feel that his doing so is in any way out of character. Llewyn is a self-tortured soul, but unlike caricatures of wandering folkies, he is at his center a realist, albeit a prideful one.<br/><br/>During his travels and travails, Llewyn encounters people ranging from the genuine (his singing friends Jim and Jean, played by Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan) to the absurd (a rotund, blustery John Goodman). Oh, and a cat that travels with Llewyn - at least until he can get him or her back to the owner. The encounters with the genuine folks feel just as normal as if you or I encountered them; those with the more absurd of the lot feel perfectly surreal, and when they do end one almost wonders if we've all imagined the encounters through Llewyn himself.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful and moving. Isaac himself performs Llewyn's songs, with a sweet, vulnerable voice that offers a touch of soul to Llewyn's otherwise-bleak surroundings. When Llewyn is really on, you can feel his pain leap right off the screen into your brain; when he appears to be going through the motions and not singing from his heart, you can feel the lack of depth that his intended audience also feels. Isaac is just flat-out terrific.<br/><br/>Ultimately, it is Isaac and the music that push this film into the territory of great cinema. The story itself is stark, moody, unyielding - just like a New York City winter, really. And the movie, like Llewyn's own life, appears to have no point - except to illustrate just how pointless Llewyn is making his life, through his stubborn marriage to his craft and a desire to stay uprooted"
"kgkacan","9","121","180","20 November 2013"," Beautiful Cinematography, Captivating, Worth Seeing Again
","Saw the prescreening at the Michigan Theater in Ann Arbor, MI with average expectations, this is my reaction:<br/><br/>This film is an experience, but not for any sort of superficial special effects, action or CGI. It's an experience in which you will feel fear, joy, hate, hope, sorrow and contempt all within an hour and 45 minutes that feels more like 15 minutes. We are sidelined, watching a short snippet of Llewyn's seemingly dismal life, drudge on by, yet we are drawn. We connect with Lleywn's anger and struggles, as if we too are burdened by his failures and challenges. But amongst the bad, there are moments of cheer, and laughter and peace reminding us that good still exists. What dominates is power, balanced by music, money and pride, yet this movie is better served as a reminder that life is an experience, and individualistic. We are reminded that more often than not, things do not fall into place and luck is rarely on our side. But no matter how many times people fail you, one should never fail, before one's self. This movie is an experience, it indirectly breaths life into each of our souls, and should appeal to anyone in touch with the most crucial human emotions: compassion and empathy. Hold on tight, because it is one experience that will remain with you long after the credits are through. Perfectly casted, perfectly scripted, perfectly filmed; perfectly entertaining."
"paultreloar75","9","50","70","4 February 2014"," Marvellous musical masterpiece
","There have been movies made about musicians, both real and imagined, from End of the Century through I'm Not There, taking in The Future is Unwritten and A Mighty Wind. We've had almost every conceivable approach, from straight-up documentary through imagined version of events as well as completely invented bands, singers, songs, and concerts. Yet, I don't think that anyone has ever managed to do what the Coen Brothers have produced with this tragic, comedic, touching piece.<br/><br/>Which is to essentially transport you into the grooves of an LP, Inside Llewyn Davies, and bring you a beautifully realised portrayal of the eponymous hero as he trudges his weary way through the greys and greens of Greenwich Village in a cold New York. And it is so reminiscent of the experience of listening to your favourite vinyl album from track one, side one to the final track of side two, whilst curling up on the couch with a cat in your lap, listening to a selection of melodic, melancholic, traditional, and new folk music.<br/><br/>The music binds this movie together and Oscar Issac inhabits the title role in a world-weary way that aches with ennui and longs for something never expressed. We follow his tramping travails through a range of vignettes that build subtly towards creating a quite compelling picture of the man behind the music. He sometimes does what we expect and at other junctures, veers off in a mad new direction. There is little explanation for any of the decisions that he does, or doesn't, take. He's searching without any clear idea of the quest.<br/><br/>Along the way, we meet a wonderfully diverse bunch of supporting characters, from the biting Jean, acerbic tongue and acid looks, through the snoring bully Roland Turner and his valet Johnny Five, as well as Mitch and Lilian, the Upper West posh couple, but especially Ulysses, our hero's apparent companion over the week (or was s/he?). They all offer opportunities to understand Davies' psyche slightly more, albeit admitting that not even he appears to be fully cognisant himself.<br/><br/>It's a lovely looking film, beautifully shot and much more enjoyable that I would have believed possible from watching the trailer previously. T Bone Burnett has done a sterling job on the soundtrack, it's so affecting and the way that the songs are all allowed to play out saw the audience in the cinema in which I saw this mainly remaining seated through the end credits as well. Which brings me back to the vinyl album sensation. You don't pick up the needle when your favorite record is playing the final track, because you want to get on with something else instead. No. You let it run right to the end of the groove and then your heart fills with an equal mixture of pleasure and joy, sorrow and sighs, as the last bars fade to quiet and all that's gone before becomes a memory that's so strong and so addictive that you want to turn it over and put the needle back into the groove all over again.<br/><br/>This movie is precisely like that sensation and I loved it, from first frame to last. A quiet understated tragi-comedy, dark in places, and shadowy in others, but with a humanity and a compassion that you cannot avert our gaze from. Hell, it's even got a coda of a scene to be dealing with, which at the end takes your mind back to the start of the production and forces one to reexamine what has just passed before your eyes. Recommended."
"ericjams","7","133","201","11 December 2013"," Another ""Not-Easy-to-Watch"" but altogether Impressive Coen Bros movie
","I saw Inside Llewyn Davis in a sold out matinée in Union Square, NYC last weekend. The city was cold and dreary, much like the 1960s Manhattan depicted in this film. I sat with my friend after the movie and basically railed against the film for the first ten minutes before slowly admitting that my criticisms were obviously the intended result and that the Coen Brothers have once again made a great movie that is simply not easy to digest and certainly not fun to digest. <br/><br/>I'll lead with the greatness. The underlying takeaway of this film is that the actual creation of music - the sound, the beauty and the lyrical story - can embody some of the best attributes about humanity and yet, the creator of such music can nonetheless lack all such attributes and essentially be as ugly a person as his music is beautiful. That is the takeaway, and the Coen Bros intentionally force this upon the viewer. The folk songs song by Lleywn serve as calming beautiful interludes and as stark contrasts to the plot driven by a character who is simply put, a terrible human being stuck in an extremely frustrating, self-made vacuum of an existence. <br/><br/>I assume that most people, like me, gravitate toward wanting to root for the struggling artist. There is a nobility in pursuing your dreams when such dreams consist of the pursuit of an art form. Here, folk music is put on a pedestal and LLewyn's pursuit of it is from the outset, something the audience implicitly will support. In the course of 90 minutes, the Coen Bros force you to question this support, hate the lead character and eventually cheer when he gets punched in the face. <br/><br/>The problem is simple. I did not want any more of LLewyn Davis after 90 minutes. I did not want to hear his music anymore because the lyrics he sung were fraudulent, the beauty of his playing, a guise. And due to his self-made failings throughout the film, I no longer cared where his story went. The Coen Bros could have taken the plot line in any number of ways to give the viewer some foothold to hope that Llewyn may end up on the right track one day. They do not give you that foothold, and for that reason, I was pretty ready for this movie to end when it did. This is admittedly a criticism, but more an observation. I certainly do not need films to end with rainbows and hearts, but this script really forces you to watch a man stuck in a static world where his own actions cause him to go nowhere, and that is a frustrating world to inhabit for 90 minutes.<br/><br/>The best parts of the film are not the Manhattan scenes, but the drive LLewyn takes to Chicago. The Coen Bros have used the theme of ""driving at night"" time and time again to make some great scenes, usually emotionally charged personal voyages. This is no different. Their cinematography and over all character driven story telling shines when their lead characters hit the road. The bit characters are fun and unusual in the Coen Bro's way, but do little to ease the 90 minutes of crass, immature, self-defeating, out-of-touch and eventually just pathetic life movements from Lleywn's character<br/><br/>For Coen Brother fans, its worth the journey; for general movie fans, be warned, as this is an interesting film, but arguably not an enjoyable one."
"chaos-rampant","Null","45","64","11 March 2014"," The anti-Dude
","At some point of this the folk singer we've been following is stranded at night by the side of the road in a car with possibly a dead man and a cat, another man has just been arrested by police for not much of a reason. He gets out to hitch a ride and there's only a cold, indifferent night with strangers in their cars just going about.<br/><br/>This is the worldview the Coens have been prodding, sometimes for a laugh, sometimes not. I can't fault them, it does seem to be inexplicably cold out there some nights. They're thinkers first of all, intellectuals, so it stings them more so they try to think up ways of mocking that thinker who is stung by the cold to amuse themselves and pass the night. <br/><br/>So this is what they give us here. A joyless man for no particular reason, who plays decent music that people enjoy or not for no particular reason, who the universe has turned against. The Coens don't pretend to have any particular answer either of why this is, why the misery. It might have something to do with having lost a friend, something to do with not having learned to be simply grateful for a small thing. It might have something to do with something he did, the initial beating up in the alley is there to insert this. Sometimes it's just something that happens as random as a cat deciding to step out of the door and the door closing before you can put it back in. Most of the time it all kind of snowballs together.<br/><br/>It's a noir device (the beating - cat) bundling guilt with chance so we'll end up with a clueless schmuck whose own contribution to the nightmare is inextricable from the mechanics of the world. The Coens have mastered noir so they trot it here with ease: the more this anti-Dude fails to ease into life the more noir anomaly appears around him.<br/><br/>Of course the whole point is that it's not such a bad setup; people let him crash in their apartment, a friend finds him a paying gig, somehow he ends up on a car to Chicago where he's offered a job. It's not great either, but somewhere in there is a pretty decent life it could all amount to, provided he settles for less than his dream. (This means here a dream the self is attached to). I saw this after a documentary on backup singers, all of them profoundly troubled for having settled for less, all of them nonetheless happy to be able to do their music.<br/><br/>Still, 'The incredible journey', seen on the Disney poster, may in the end amount to no more than an instinctive drive through miles of wilderness. The Coens are cold here even for their standards. I wouldn't be surprised to find it was Ethan, the more introverted of the two, ruminating on a meaningless art without his partner.<br/><br/>Is there a way out in the end? Here's the trickiest part, especially for an intelligent mind. You can't just kid yourself with any other happiness like Hollywood has done since Chaplin. You know it has to be invented to some degree, the point of going on, yet truthful. Nothing here. More music, a reflection. It's the emptiest part of the film as if they didn't know themselves what to construct to put him back on stage. Visually transcending was never their forte anyway. They merely end up explaining the wonderful noir ambiguity of that first beating.<br/><br/>Still they are some of the most dependable craftsmen we have and in the broader Coen cosmos this sketches its own space."
"dimoulas-466-176153","10","115","181","19 November 2013"," Another Great Coen Brothers Film
","Inside Llewyn Davis is a hard film to quantify. It is very much a Coen Brothers movie, and it is very much its own thing. I did not know the history of the story. I did not know the story behind the Gaslight club in New York nor did I know of the famous figure who started at the bar back in 1961 when the film takes place. I found out after the film was over. However, not knowing that, I still thought this was an incredible movie.<br/><br/>There are oddly poetic scenes in the film. There is a scene where the main character Llewyn Davis hits a cat with his car. As he watches the cat limp away into the darkness injured, I felt that it was an interesting image that seemed to mirror Llewyn's life in the film. Although I was aware of the poetic aspect of the film, I did not feel that they were forced moments. In interviews the Coen Brothers always seem to play dumb. In an interview for this film the Coen Brothers talked about the cat in the movie, and how they didn't know what to do with the story, so they threw in a cat. Anybody who has seen a Coen Brothers movie can appreciate that this is far from the truth. Every moment and image seems to be very specifically placed, and that was the case for this movie as well.<br/><br/>You can't judge this movie the same way you would judge every other film this year. It's almost as if the Coen Brothers have their own language that they are speaking, that the audience does not fully understand. We catch some things, and even with those few moments, I was mesmerized. Sometimes I really notice their style like in their film A Serious Man, and I find myself confused and bored, but this film felt very true to me. I sympathized with the main character and his struggles, perhaps because I consider myself a creative person as well, so I know how hard it is. At one point Llewyn says, ""I'm just so f-ing tired,"" this line says a lot more than just I want to sleep. It is something we can all relate to, a feeling of just wanting to give up, and in this way, the story is a universal one, but then again it's the Coen Brothers, so automatically I know some people might not like it, but I loved it."

From Joel and Ethan to Bruno Delbonnel, Oscar Isaac, to T Bone Burnett and everyone who enters, even for an instant, this sublime, unique, startling P.O.V. Aware but never condescending to the audience. No explanation as to why this story deserved to be told. The answers are private, deeply personal, enlightening and, at times, chillingly transparent. The face of Oscar Isaac, my God! For me one of the most enthralling discoveries of 2013. At times it reminded me of an updated character in an Italian Neo-realistic film, others one of those images from one of Martin Donovan's sessions. I sat through Inside Llewyn Davis twice in a row. I can't wait to repeat the experience soon again."

","It's amazing how dazzled one can be by so very little these days. There's very little here--a struggling unpleasant man who sings his heart out about standard ""folk"" catastrophes but can't take care of himself as he goes about damaging others, and animals as well. He's your 50's college roommate who cooks on a hot plate and sings about historic heroic starvations. The in- and-out mythic references are unfocused and a game for undergraduates. When the Coens go flat it's not even E flat. We're forced to watch this guy's face for an hour or so without a clue to his demons; he's just a jerk, a driven jerk but a jerk nonetheless. <br/><br/>Best part is the recreation of the early 60's in cars, atmospheres, but then John Goodman shows up from ""Where art thou?"" and spoils the realistic angst. Sorry, but the early folk scene wasn't this creepy and Bob Dylan didn't rescue it from oblivion or creepiness. Without a political or sexual agenda (it got you chicks) it did flounder, but it needed an audience for shifting values and social awareness. One's suffering couldn't just be for one's art, but had to have a social dimension that this guy can't see. A genius before his time? Hardly--a guy who can't take care of himself, or his friends or family or lovers--anything but ""folk."" The times they were a changin', but this guy's a talented pathetic scrounge and lacks the connections to others and society that might propel him to sing for the changing times.<br/><br/>This might be the ethos of the Coens and their films themselves--within society but not of it. Their characters struggle with their messy quirky lives but we see them as curiosities rather than representatives of anything important. There's a certain clown show aspect to their films, which creates their charm and fun but little else."
"Turfseer","4","26","42","17 January 2014"," Some great atmosphere, but story of clueless, narcissistic folk singer, really isn't worth telling
","The problem with the Coen Brothers is that in every one of their movies, they're looking through a glass half empty and never half full. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is no exception. Oh yes, you'll find the usual excellent cinematography, casting, acting, direction and neat recreation of bygone eras. But what you'll never find is sympathy for your protagonist. The Coen Brothers always pride themselves on standing above the fray and looking down on their anti-heroes. In essence, what they're saying is, 'we're good at exposing the underbelly of the dark side of Americana; applaud us.' <br/><br/>The failed folk artist, Llewyn Davis, is prototypical of their one dimensional view of things. Are there really people like the fictional Davis (supposedly an amalgam of real life musicians including Dave Van Ronk, Phil Ochs and Ramblin' Jack Elliott)? People so clueless, so narcissistic, that they never listen to feedback from anyone else, so that they never change. It's a rare individual who is so misanthropic, like the Coens' Llewyn, that you will ever run into him, in real life. But even if there is such a character, does he really deserve to be immortalized in film? I hardly think so. <br/><br/>The Coen brothers had no problem in admitting that 'Inside Llewyn Davis' has little plot. More important is the fact that the story is devoid of a concrete antagonist. The only antagonist is Llewyn's internal demon— which takes the form of myopia, cluelessness, and narcissism. The demon never emerges into Llewyn's consciousness, so that perhaps he can reflect upon where he is going wrong. Instead, we're asked to sit through a 104 minute chronicle of an unlikeable mediocrity, who pursues a wrong-headed quest for fame and fortune in the folk music world of the early 60s. <br/><br/>Llewyn Davis is much more caricature than a real human being. The Coen brothers go out of their way to show just how much of a loser this guy is. Are there really people like this? Consider their catalogue of Llewyn's shortcomings: He originally was part of a Simon & Garfunkel precursor type group, Tom & Jerry, but his partner committed suicide; he has no money and sleeps on acquaintances' couches; he's forced to carry some friends' cat around with him after he locks himself out of their apartment; he impregnates a woman but doesn't have to pay for the abortion, after he learns from the abortion doctor, that a previous girlfriend, never went through with the procedure; he drives all the way to Chicago, only to learn that a music manager never received his latest record in the mail and doesn't think he has any commercial potential; he heckles a woman during a folk concert and is later beaten up badly by the woman's husband, outside in a dark alley.<br/><br/>'Inside Llewyn Davis' is the ultimate sad sack tale. And unfortunately, sad sacks never make for good drama. What the film does have is lots of atmosphere. There are some neat cinematic scenes, notably the one involving John Goodman as a sleazy, heroin-addicted jazz musician, who is a passenger along with Llewyn, on that trip to Chicago. I also liked the attempt to recreate NYC in 1961, particularly various streets in Greenwich Village.<br/><br/>Rather than consulting all the positive reviews from 'professional' critics on Metacritic, you'll find some much more honest and insightful reviews in the review section of IMDb. There, at least, is a sense that Llewyn Davis is not a believable character and if by chance, such misanthropes truly exist in real life, their journeys are certainly not worth being looked at, given the lack of change or growth. If you like a straw man, Llewyn Davis is for you. The Coen brothers are experts at shooting straw men down--but such a maneuver should never bring praise and accolades; that's reserved only for the gullible!"
"bob-the-movie-man","8","10","14","1 February 2014"," One for Coen fans and folk fans
","Oscar Isaac portrays the titular Llewyn Davis in the latest film from Ethan and Joel Coen: surely creating one of celluloid's most memorable losers. This is a joyfully melancholic film, if that makes any sense. Set in 1961 in Greenwich village in New York, Llewyn walks through a series of Dylan album covers, beautifully rendered in washed out colours, trying and heroically failing in just about everything he does. After his singing partner throws himself off the George Washington bridge – never a good sign – Llewyn tries to strike out with his solo career, hampered by a ginger Tom, a newly pregnant Carey Mulligan and an over-inflated opinion of his own ability. The film charts the fall and continued fall of his travails.<br/><br/>As this is a Coen brother film, will there be larger than life characters involved? You Betcha! In Llewyn Davis there are some fantastic parts: Roland Turner (John Goodman) as an in-turns moribund and then loquacious passenger from hell in a tortuous road trip from New York to Chicago that (brilliantly) fills the middle act of the film; Jean and Jim (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake) as the folk-singing duo trying to get on with their music careers; and my own favourite – Troy Nelson (Stark Sands) – as a Forrest Gump-style Army character who is blessed with a great singing voice – ""What do you do now?"" asks Llewyn, after he has noisily woken him up with breakfast cereal eating, ""Plug yourself in?"".<br/><br/>Carey Mulligan is, as always, absolutely mesmeric in her role as Jean. A study in pent up rage at life. She is dressed down and dowdy in this role, but still shimmers and is incredibly sexy (""Most of the men come here because they want to f*** her"" says the nightclub owner. ""I did"".) A scene in a park where she furiously confronts Llewyn about the baby is just superb – ""Everything you touch turns to s***"" she seethes. ""You are like King Midas's idiot brother"". And Oscar Isaac is also extremely good in the title role, with his big laconic eyes suiting the role perfectly.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers written script is beautifully done, albeit a bit confusing in places via a flashback. It is a crime that this was not nominated for a screenplay award at the Oscars. In fact, in general, I don't know what the Oscar nomination team were thinking with its general dissing of this film. Just two nominations – for sound mixing and cinematography. Shameful.<br/><br/>Given the nature of the story, you might expect that this is not a particularly feel-good film, but it never seems to quite feel as bad as it should be. The comedy is dry and nicely played, with a few laugh out loud moments. And you end up rooting for (albeit, you quickly realise, without hope) for Llewyn, despairing as he makes each devastatingly stupid small decision. (Surely after he records the iconic space epic ""Please Mr Kennedy"" with Timberlake and comically bass voiced Al Cody (Adam Driver) a hit and fortune must surely be on the cards?).<br/><br/>In summary, if you like folk music and the pre-Dylan roots of 60's folk music I predict you are going to love Inside Llewyn Davis. If you like Coen brothers movies then you'll also love this movie. Put the two together and this would be your 5* film of the year. Personally, I'm in one camp (the latter) but not the other. For me, the (perfectly pleasant) singing sections went on a bit too long. But this was a masterly film, and one that you unpick in your mind long after the lights have come up. For that reason alone it is recommended, provided you have a tolerance for bad language in film (as you might have already guessed from my review).<br/><br/>(For an archive of my previous film reviews please check out http://bobmann447.wordpress.com and sign up to receive future posts.

"annacatley","9","31","53","25 June 2013"," A soulful and beautifully constructed portrait of a man and his music
","In the mixed up world of Coen works, Inside Llewyn Davis stands as a rather unique piece against the hilarious misadventures of films such as The Big Lebowski (1998), Raising Arizona (1987) and O Brother, Where Art Thou (2000). I'm tempted to compare this latest work to No Country For Old Men (2007), but even then, No Country's morbid tone is at odds with the poetic soul of Inside Llewyn Davis (2013). The film follows a week in the life of Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a mildly known folk singer, embodying a Bob Dylan-esque sort of life in 1960's New York, as he plays little-attended shows at The Gaslight Café in the West Village. Painted as the unsung genius, Llewyn is at a standstill in his life as he struggles to survive on what little money he has, and on what few friendships remain. One such friendship that draws particular focus is the complex ties between Llewyn, and fellow musicians, Jean (Carey Mulligan) and Jim (Justin Timberlake). While Llewyn holds the raw roots of his soulful folk above all else, Jean and Jim test the waters of mainstream accessibility and stardom, a life that Llewyn holds in little regard. At the risk of revealing too much about the plot, Llewyn is loaded down with constant rejection, grapples with his relationship with his father, and eventually drives to Chicago in a last-ditch effort to salvage his meagre career. <br/><br/>Though Inside Llewyn Davis is at its heart, a beautifully understated profile, it has some wonderfully funny moments as well - the best of which concerning the tabby cat who more than once, manages to derail Llewyn's already arduous life. One brilliant scene observes a shouting match over the cat's lack of scrotum. <br/><br/>There are a few fresh faces to the Coen-verse with Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and Oscar Isaac in the titular role, but there's one Coen regular whom I'm always jazzed to see. Barging unapologetically into this reflective space, is the coked-up, crutch-wielding, ass hole jazz man, Roland Turner, played by the large and loud John Goodman. Toss in Steve Buscemi and I'd feel right at home!<br/><br/>Like their 2000 film, O Brother, Where Art Thou, the Coen Brothers took on the talent of T-Bone Burnett to arrange their collection of folk covers. With every soulful performance or every toe- tapping rendition, it's the music of Llewyn Davis that will send you head over heels for the film. Acting as a stark contrast to the grey, frost-licked New York City, the warm passion of the soundtrack is the lifeblood of this beautiful film.<br/><br/>In its running time of 105 minutes, few definite conclusions are drawn in regard to Llewyn's career and with the film ending in the same place as it started, it seems unlikely that he will break free from his cycle of obscurity. But then, the film really isn't about Llewyn's 'career' or his friends, because this is a film about Llewyn. The beginnings of the film highlight a raw, unabashed view on rejection and obscurity accompanied by this nagging expectation that Llewyn's life might blossom into a success story. But ultimately, that's not what the film is about and it's goal is not to satisfy filmic convention. Inside Llewyn Davis is very simply, a soulful and beautifully drawn portrait of a man and his music."
"ClaytonDavis","10","102","197","26 September 2013"," Oscar Isaac is Incredible! Coens Best Since 'Fargo'
","I am completely smitten. I have long admired Joel Coen and Ethan Coen  and what they have offered the realm of cinema. I am in love with  ""Fargo"" still until this day, and they've provided solid efforts on  nearly every outing since. Their newest endeavor that focuses on the  folk scene in 1961 is an absolute dream. Everything from the impeccable  Oscar Isaac to the music that enriches the deepest trenches of the  soul, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is one of the best pictures of the year,  plain and simple. It's the Coen Brothers finest film since ""Fargo.""  Our story begins with a folk singer, Llewyn Davis that has continued to  pursue a music career in 1961 despite being penniless and lacking any  real stability. Migrating from couch to couch, we get a deep look into  a character with a dream that just won't die. As he fights for his  chance to share his voice with the world, following an unexpected loss  of his singing partner, Llewyn is hard to love. He makes poor choices  and seems to lack any responsibility in his life. It's a wonderful  creation of a character that offers insight into a changing time in our  history.  First of all, I can't get the amazing music out of my head. All the  songs used are absolutely brilliant. Oscar Isaac's richly matured tone  is so soothing and authentic; I'm surprised a music company hasn't  nabbed him up to make a record yet. His opening and closing songs are  his, as well as the film's, pivotal moments that encapsulate the  endearing message and theme. ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" and ""Fare Thee Well  (Dink's Song)"" are astonishing records that may not just fall into an  Oscar race but a Grammy wouldn't shock me in the least. It has the same  magical effect as ""Searching for Sugar Man,"" two films that seemed to  capture the innocence and culture of a generation that seems lost. In  terms of performance, Isaac is incredible. So raw and genuine, it's one  of the year's finest performances by any actor. He has made himself one  of the most exciting actors to watch in the coming years. This will  lead him into more challenging and accessible roles. This guy could  become one of our finest actors in just five years' time. This is  something that should land him an Oscar nomination for Best Actor. It's  very much deserved.  In their respective but short screen times, John Goodman, Garrett  Hedlund, and Carey Mulligan are all infectious and notable. Goodman  plays a character similar to his ""Harling Mays"" from Robert Zemeckis'  ""Flight"" and makes the most out of his appearance. Mulligan is volatile  and I loved every second of her. She brings lots of dark humor and fire  to a role that shows the depth of her abilities as an actress who can  perform impeccably in any genre. We even get her singing again which  had me melt two years ago during her ""New York, New York"" in Steve  McQueen's ""Shame."" Hedlund comes and goes but makes his mark as he  often does.  Justin Timberlake has made a seamless transition from musician to actor  and back to musician. Great in roles like ""The Social Network"" where  his star power doesn't distract from the story at hand, in a Coen  Brothers film, where he sings (in a very current pop way), he becomes a  bit distracting. I was very aware that Timberlake, probably this  generation's Michael Jackson, was sharing the screen. More than likely  not his fault, it could be a case of being ""too big"" for your movie.  One thing that the film has taught mewe need to give Adam Driver more  movie roles. Timberlake, Isaac, and Driver put their marks on one of  the songs ""Please Mr. Kennedy,"" and make it one of the year's most fun  and remarkable numbers.  Joel and Ethan Coen continue to show their ranges in directing and  writing. Flawlessly executed in character understanding and keeping our  story moving. Llewyn Davis is such a complex and interesting man and  their screenplay gives Isaac room to breathe and explore the subtle  nuances that make his character unique and real. As their alter ego  Roderick Jaynes, the film moves like a smooth monorail, hitting all its  marks and picking up new and exciting quirks along the way.  An almost silver-green canvas evokes the dark and grey tones of the New  York scene in 1961. Cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel masterfully  captures the ticks and beats of Isaac as he sings with heartbreaking  emotion and walks through the frigid cold streets. Jess Gonchor's  production design places us all in the folk scene, with intimate bar  settings, old-time music studios, and even the classic feel of a  Greenwich Village apartment building.  CBS Films has a gem on their hands with ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" A sure-  fire Oscar contender in several categories including Best Picture. If  there's any justice in the film world, Oscar Isaac would firmly sit  near the top of the finest performances of 2013 in Best Actor and nab  nearly every award he comes in contact with. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is  sensational and an instant classic to be remembered."

","I read the other reviews here and am at a loss for words. When it ended, my wife turned to me and said it was awful. I told her it was very, very dull. A stranger in front of us also hated the film. There was a blow-up of a review of the movie in the lobby, and about twenty or thirty audience members were clustered in front of it, no doubt trying to reconcile the review with the cinematic lobotomy we had just endured. The only things I liked about the movie were seeing Dad's old 1961 Chrysler Newport on the street, and F. Murray Abraham. I respect all other reviewers' opinions, but this is mine. And yes, I've seen other Coen brothers films and liked them."
"lsimon33","3","96","186","11 January 2014"," Massively Underwhelming
","As I walked out of the theater where my friend and I had just paid $11 each to see this film, I thought to myself, ""Well, maybe next time they'll actually make a movie."" Because I would not really consider this a movie. It is a half-baked, moody character sketch of an unbelievable character. As another reviewer pointed out, Llewyn Davis is quite good looking and capable of performing passionately. To think that not one of the women in the clubs he plays would offer him a place to sleep for the night is absurd. That is only one example of how the film favors contrivance over believability. John Goodman's character is another big one. <br/><br/>The movie is a pointless waste of time, a dreary faux-odyssey about a character who is such an awful, self-centered person that you could not possibly care what happens to him. But don't worry, because nothing happens to him. The film ends as it begins, with him getting beaten up for being a selfish jerk. As many have pointed out, this movie does not capture the heady, vibrant spirit of the early 60s folk scene in NYC. If you want that, read Bob Dylan's wonderful Chronicles, Vol. I. <br/><br/>I've enjoyed many of the Coen Brothers films, but they just phoned this one in, I guess. Or they've become so enamored with their own Hollywood brilliance that they can't tell good from bad. And Hollywood is so shallow and moronic that I would not be surprised if this gets nominated for ""Best Film."" Yeah, right. <br/><br/>I enjoy a lot of folk music, from early Dylan to Nick Drake and many others, but the songs in this film were long and boring and unmemorable. Huge amounts of the film are devoted to Llewyn singing ENTIRE SONGS (like five or six minute long songs) that are in no way remarkable. I guess that's the point, since he's supposed to be failure. Instead of devoting film time to character or plot development, to comedy or entertainment, we are supposed to be entranced somehow by the emotion of this fake music. I guess it worked magic on professional film critics. The ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" novelty song was beyond stupid. And when Davis abandoned the cat in the car with the passed out, possibly even dead, Goodman character, I thought, ""Screw this guy! I hate him. I hope he gets beaten up again. I'll beat him up."" <br/><br/>As a work of art, which it clearly aspires to be, this movie lacks intricacy, depth, or insight. The Coens already covered this material with Barton Fink, which I've always enjoyed, but BF was a much more satisfying and entertaining film. I'd rather go see a mindless Star Trek movie than something this pretentious and intentionally pointless. I don't want to see it again, not even for a buck at Redbox. This is the worst Coen Bros movie I've seen."
"KenToo","5","49","90","7 January 2014"," But it didn't go anywhere, what's the point?!
","I loved Oh, Brother Where Art Thou?, so I had high hopes for this flick. I came away very disappointed. It is a slice of life, a week in the life of a struggling folk musician in 1961. My problem is that the main character is pretty much in the same place at the end as at the beginning. Here's the thing: A slice of life, go nowhere movie, with no transformation of the main character, is probably not going to be my cup of tea in almost any case. That said, I do think it can work when it is biographic. Because for a realistic, biographic slice of life, we get to see REAL LIFE, down and dirty, including the reality that sometimes there is no great triumph, no big personal transformation, etc. So, if you give me a window into the true life of an individual, that can be great even without an evolving character, or any triumphant moment.<br/><br/>However, if you give me a phony, contrived fictional piece, and you force me to sit through contrived moments, my ""reward"" is to get paid off with a clever ending where everything comes together and stuff foreshadowed at the beginning is realized at the end. A fictional story allows the writer to create a slice of life that has a great symmetry and harmonious movement lacking in real life. And it's frankly part of the bargain you make when you start shoving contrivances down the throat of the audience.<br/><br/>So, my problem with this movie is that it simply was not realistic / biographical enough, but instead it was full of contrivances...yet it still went nowhere. Contrivances that serve no purpose to move towards a happy (or tragic) coincidence at the end? Why bother? Take some examples: We see this guy perform, and it's clear he has something special, with his guitar and voice. No way this guy does not have some chicks ready to hook up with him after the way he plays on stage. So why is he begging for a couch to sleep on from near strangers? Given how we see he is fine mooching off people, it is frankly inexplicable that he is not mooching of any of the adoring Greenwich Village groupies he must surely have from his performances. So his desperate near homelessness, despite his great musical skill and having been in the area for some time (i.e., not a newcomer) makes no sense to me.<br/><br/>We also see him visiting his father, and his sister, so apparently his whole family is local to the New York area, which again begs the question how he got to be 30-ish and needing to beg strangers for a couch to sleep on, in his own home town. His sort of living seems more appropriate if (a) he was new to the area, and (b) he was not all that good or polished with his music.<br/><br/>Another contrivance: When he loses the tabby cat, and finds a near identical cat right around the corner. I mean, come on! That color, and size, cat, and quality of grooming, eyes, etc., that's got to be pretty rare for cats wandering the streets of New York, it's definitely not your average alley cat, in coloration or size. So for him to find this identical but wrong cat, so we can have a big confrontational moment, is a blatant contrivance.<br/><br/>It seems like the writers were looking for ways to create contrivances to screw with the main character, to mess up his life intentionally, as if to say, ""sucks to be you."" Again, what's the point? I mean, if this were truly biographical, it would tell me something about the nature of the universe. But since it is a fiction -- and we know the guy it was loosely based on was nothing like the character in the film except in the most superficial sense -- we are not learning anything except that the writers can think of ways to kick some one when they are down. But I kind of know that already, so I learn nothing of value.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie, we have now seen the main character find out he probably has a two year old son he never saw, but he decided not to go look for him when he passed by that town and had the opportunity. We see he chose to take a flat fee for music, and there is some hint the song will turn out to be a hit and he will later kick himself for not having any royalty rights, but we never see that develop.<br/><br/>I'd also note that to care about the movie, to be moved by it, you have to identify with the main character. But he is just flat out unlikeable. And with the writers throwing contrived tragedies at him, you don't want to link up emotionally with him. So without that, without caring about this jerk who will heckle a poor old woman just because he's having a bad day, how are you supposed to be moved any direction by his failures and lack of success? It just makes no sense, I don't see how audiences get moved by the pap.<br/><br/>On the positive, I think there is some beautiful music, and some beautiful imagery. There is perhaps some poetry to the audio-visual elements, and a nice timing, variation, with some of the dramatic moments, but honestly that's just too little, like a cake that is beautifully decorated with sweet icing but dry and tasteless in the middle.<br/><br/>Well, that's my 2 cents."

","There have only been a handful of films in cinematic history that are crafted with such subtle nuance and yet still unashamedly devastating. Think Yasujiro Ozu's sentiment in simplicity, Robert Bresson's philosophies of transcendentalism, Edward Yang's everyday life beauty, and Andrei Tarkovsky's poetry on screen. While Joel and Ethan Coen's 2013 feature Inside Llewlyn Davis may not be as minimalistic as the aforementioned, the film echoes some of the poignant and sublime themes found in its predecessors.<br/><br/>A complete cynical outlook on life and human nature has been present practically throughout all of the Coen Brothers' works; they have even stated in multiple interviews they do not plan to ever make a film displaying the good qualities of humankind, which are, from their point of view, nonexistent in the face of all the bad qualities. In Inside Llewlyn Davis, they have pushed their beliefs to the extremes.<br/><br/>Llewlyn Davis, our struggling musician/protagonist, criticizes his Jean for being a careerist, yet still refuses to play a song for the Gorfeins because it's just his job.He lies to them about having their cat, breaks promises about staying at Jim and Jean's for the last time, leaves a cat to die in a car, leaves another animal to die out in the woods, and heckles a woman on stage.<br/><br/>Such is the hypocritical nature of the artist.<br/><br/>Yet we still empathize with him. We start to realize his disastrous fortune; his close friend recently commited suicide, the woman he loves is pregnant with another man, his ex-lover lied to him about getting an abortion, the one song he declines royalties for is an implied massive success, and he drives all the way to Chicago only to be told he doesn't have the talent to make it. Considering how the beginning is identical to the ending, the circular narrative suggests this struggle will only continue, and perhaps worsen. The viewer's strong connection with Davis's loss and pain drives our desire for him to succeed, even when we knew his hopeless situation was doomed from the start. This is the depressing nature of Inside Llewyn Davis- and life, cynics would add.<br/><br/>Like the cat, Davis is lost. He doesn't have a home, much like how the cat wanders the streets of New York City for almost the entirety of the runtime. Though at the end, the cat does find its way back home, offering a glimmer of hope to our protagonist and viewer. The Coens, it seems, are not always so nihilistic.<br/><br/>Behind the forlorn and vengeful Davis is Oscar Issac, a rising actor perhaps better known by his roles in the Star Wars franchise, Ex Machina (2015), and Annihilation (2016). His performance in Inside Llewyn Davis not only showcases his talent as a lead actor, but is more ambitious than the rest of his filmography combined. Take a look at his posture and expression when it is revealed his ex-girlfriend, Diane, didn't go through with the abortion. We see the betrayal and helplessness straight through his heartbroken eyes, and we feel even more for him when he tries to hide it, saying, ""No, no, I knew she was going to Akron, she's from Akron... her parents are in Akron.""<br/><br/>Arguably even more outstanding is the dialogue during this series of revelations; writers often struggle with dramatic exposition, but the Coens seemed to have mastered the craft. For example, ""Her parents are in Akron,"" implies she left him because she didn't think he could provide adequate financial support for the three of them, while her parents can. ""The kid would be about two now...?"" reveals the vast amount of time that has past since her departure, also indicating that Davis's financial and emotional hardships have been transpiring since who knows when. Finally, the doctor first states that Davis does not need to pay, granting the protagonist and the audience a slight relief (a win for the protagonist always means a win for the audience), only to hit us with the devastating truth. This push-pull effect is just the cherry on top for a barely two minute scene, which itself carries more tear-jerking weight than your typical two-and-a-half hour Hollywood blockbuster. Lastly, the scene fits perfectly in the context of the story, leading into his explosion at the Gorfeins.<br/><br/>In other aspects of filmmaking, Director of Photography Bruno Debonnel, known for his work in Amélie (2001) and Darkest Hour (2017), has rightfully prioritized elevating the story over gorgeous, eye-catching images. Notice how in Amélie he has painted the screen with saturated reds and greens to emphasize the protagonist's playful and naive personality, while in Inside Llewyn Davis, we see the complete opposite- a color palette limited to only blue, green, and brown, narrow hallways that symbolize Davis's trapped state, and low light throughout to accentuate the character's hopelessness. A second time around analyzing the film, I found that each scene becomes successively less illuminated; it was at this point I declared this film a masterpiece.<br/><br/>I could very easily go more in depth on Inside Llewyn Davis's soundtrack, ingenious use of dark comedy, and detailed metaphors, but I figured the film is depressing enough on its own.<br/><br/>Fare thee well..."

","Because there is so much wrong about this movie it is hard to choose with which flaw to start with.<br/><br/>It never feels like 1961. It never looks like 1961. It doesn't sound like 1961. It does not deal with the Greenwich Village folk music scene.  It is not a portrait of an artist. It has no story. It has no arc of suspense. It has no character to connect with. It has no development of characters. It has no<br/><br/>Okay:<br/><br/>Let us start with the main character and its impersonator: Oscar Isaac. Every minute of the movie he looks like an H&M-Model of 2014. His stylish beard is 2014. His frustrated and cynical habitus is 2014. Even the way he wears is shawl is 2014.  His central conflict is that he screws up everything. Not to forget about his ex-partner that threw himself of the bridge, but there is no story developing out of this. So the central conflict is that he is a depressed asshole? But not only the script leaves him as a blank sheet of (grey) paper. Also Oscar Isaac is not able to give his character any depth. He seems to be indifferent about anything: his ex-lovers, his parents, his friends, the political issues of the time and even about his music.<br/><br/>And here the roots of next big error are hidden: The folk scene of the early sixties was most vivid, new, exciting, political, enthusiastic, social. People had an attitude! Llewyn Davis has none. <br/><br/>The folk scene in this movie seems to be some dull melting pot for bored ridiculous freaks sitting around in dark cellars doing nothing else except whining and selling out. You never get the feeling of it to be the musical outcome of the beat generations efforts and the preparation for the groundbreaking things to come in the late sixties! In one dialogue Llewyn Davis even says that he considers himself to be part of the entertainment business""! And that is what the folk scene of that time absolutely was NOT! When Dylan electrified his sound in 65 he was accused to go commercial and to become a part of the entertainment business. A lot of people actually hated him for this. In their eyes he became something that wasn't ""folk"" anymore!<br/><br/>Well enough. This movie does not deserve to waste more of my time.<br/><br/>In the end the whole flick looks like it was made to demonstrate how depressing, dull and meaningless live has been before the invention of the smart phone...<br/><br/>I hope the Coen Brothers will recover and create descent movies again."

","I was very disappointed in this movie and I really wanted to like it as I am a fan of the Coen Brother's work. The character arc never occurred and I patiently waited for it to happen, but alas, nothing. There was no real character development and the film didn't go anywhere. Davis was in the same sad, loser position at the end as in the beginning. The usual cast of offbeat characters were here with John Goodman once again in a role that lets him bring out his weird side. Oscar Issac did a fine job and can sing but the music was not too my taste. Carey Mulligan got to play an angry women and pretty well stayed that way throughout the film. I don't see a great deal of growth in what the Coen's are doing now from their start and like the older stuff better as if was more offbeat and unusual. This was just boring. The cat was the best thing about this picture and I'm a dog person."
"bmconfor","5","28","52","11 January 2014"," Not the 60s people, scene, nor music... and a failure as fiction too.
","So let's completely forget that Llewyn Davis is not Dave Van Ronk. Let's forget that there are historical inaccuracies in the scenery and other parts of the film (the Gaslight was tiny, not the cavernous club in the film, there was no alley behind that café, I'm somewhat doubtful that Davis would have been playing a 1928 or 1929 Gibson L-1 that looked so clean, when Llewyn is playing guitar in the car on the way to Chicago, he's using a Shubb capo. The film takes place in 1961; Shubb capos weren't available until 1980, while Llewyn is making a payphone call on the elevated subway platform (Woodside/61st Street), a modern 7 train pulls into the station on the opposite track, despite being set in 1961, Llewyn passes a poster for Disney's ""The Incredible Journey"" which was released in 1963, there is a Lava Lamp shown in one scene. The Lava Lamp wasn't invented until 1963 and wasn't available for purchase until 1965) let's forget everything and just approach this as a complete work of fiction.<br/><br/>Plot: The story doesn't seem to go anywhere. The main character tries to find his way in the folk music scene but doesn't have much success, nor does he seem to put anything resembling a passionate effort into it. He goes through some moves and attempts a few things, but they seem half-hearted. Maybe he's just completely discouraged but he doesn't seem to invoke much sympathy in his attempts. Things just seem to happen to him and the people around him, oft-times for inexplicable reasons. Which may be due to...<br/><br/>Characters and their development or lack thereof: There just doesn't seem to be anyone likable in this movie. Llewyn Davis is just not a very likable character. He's belligerent to the point of being hostile, self-absorbed, seemingly uncaring about the people around him, even his fellow performers. And yet he sings beautiful folk ballads about royalty and people and you wonder how the hell is he connecting to these songs when he can't seem to connect to actual humans? Now maybe that's supposed to be part of his ""mystery"" but I just find it confusing. There is no joy in Llewyn Davis' life, and so it's hard to really care about him. In fact it's hard to care about anyone, they're all pretty self-absorbed and unlikeable.<br/><br/>Jean (Carey Mulligan) is another mystery. We know nothing about her other than she had a brief affair with Llewyn and hates him for it, is married to Jim (whom she says she cares about), but there's no character here... who is she, what does she think, where is she going? There's nothing to really like or dislike about her - she's just there.<br/><br/>Jim (Justin Timberlake) is a cipher. Who is he and what does he want? He floats in and out, sings a song, gets a record deal for a commercial ""folk"" song he wrote (we have no idea how that came about other than to surmise that a John Hammond Sr-like figure had something to do with it)... he's a clean-cut nice guy but why should we care? He seems completely oblvious of what's going on around him.<br/><br/>Troy Nelson (Stark Sands) may be the only likable character in the film because he seems to actually like the people around him. But he's depicted as a Forrest Gump-like simpleton character, so even his likability needs to be tempered.<br/><br/>Jazz man Roland Turner (John Goodman) is a junkie who dislikes everything except for the really bad beat poetry that his ""valet"" Johnny Five (Garret Hedlund) spouts out. It's a relief when he's finally out of the film.<br/><br/>Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), a not-even thinly disguised Albert Grossman, owner of the Gate of Horn club in Chicago, has nothing to make anyone like him... but then neither did Albert Grossman. He's only in it for the money and that's just the way it was.<br/><br/>Pappi Corsicato (Max Casella), the owner of the Gaslight Cafe, is thoroughly sleazy and only books women who sleep with him.<br/><br/>Al Cody (Adam Driver) is another folk singer who Llewyn crashes with and he might be a likable soul, but he's another nonentity.<br/><br/>None of these or the other characters ever really develop a persona other than their surface personalities that just seem to be people you really wouldn't want to hang around with.<br/><br/>Music: Some of the songs are quite nice, but what seems to be missing a lot of the time is the joy and passion that one would expect from this music and this time. Many of the songs are rather syrupy version of songs that originally had more of an edge to them.<br/><br/>In all fairness the film probably does a relatively decent job in depicting the transition from people singing actual folk songs to the singer-songwriter school of folk music that Dylan, Paxton, Neil, Ochs, Anderson and others would soon usher in. But unlike ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"", ""Fargo"", ""The Big Lebowski"", or other Coen Brothers films there's really noting about ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" that's going to make you want to go back and see it over and over again.<br/><br/>Buy Dave Van Ronk and Elijah Wald's ""The Mayor Of MacDougal Street"" , get some of Dave's albums (especially the new Smithsonian release ""Down in Washington Square"") and have yourself a really good time!"

","Most of this movie is watching Llewyn run around trying to figure out where to sleep and where he can get a bit of money. He's a bit of a jerk so it's sort of fitting that he has a hard time.<br/><br/>After sitting through this I tried to figure out what was the point of it all. Why would the Coen brothers want to tell this story? I came up with two scenarios.<br/><br/>First, as someone who is a bit of a jerk myself, I suppose it allowed me to reflect a little bit on how it can be sort of miserable being a jerk. Apart from that, there were a few cheap shots at the square characters in the film, which I guess is a bit of consolation for all the wallowing in your own misery that this film incites.<br/><br/>The second scenario, if you're a bit of a nice person, I suppose you might get some guilty pleasure out of seeing a jerk suffer.<br/><br/>We are given a possible explanation for why he behaves the way he does. It's a minor suggestion of a 3rd dimension to a character in a movie in which all the characters remain flat caricatures.<br/><br/>The backdrop is early 60's Greenwich village, but that seems largely irrelevant. I don't think any effort went into trying to give a sense of what life was like in that particular space in time. Apart from the retro set design, old cars, and prevalence of acoustic guitars, the story could just have well have taken place anywhere. The music is well recorded and the singing is pretty good. They were wise not to stick in any of the cliché folk songs that are often associated with this period in history. But the only song that actually stuck in my head as I made my way home from the theatre was the recording of the Dylan song they played. I suppose there's a few subtle hints that might make people try and connect characters in the film to real people, but there is little substance behind these hints.<br/><br/>It is well filmed, interesting camera angles, and nice cinematography, but that is not enough to make this worth watching."
"randbish","5","27","51","8 November 2013"," The ""Artist"" as a Timeless Cliché
","I was excited to have the opportunity to attend one of the first stateside public screenings (Austin Film Festival) of Joel and Ethan Coen's Grand Prix winning Inside Llewen Davis. Having begun my own professional music career as a 14-year-old, peach-fuzz-cheeked wanna-be folksinger at Café Espresso in Portland, OR, under the mentor-ship of Marc Ellington — who bore more than a passing resemblance to Dave Van Ronk in size, talent, and facial hair — I had a strong personal interest in revisiting the era through the skewered lens of the Bros Coen.<br/><br/>This is the same Greenwich Village described by Bob Dylan in his memoir Chronicles — brutally cold and damp, unforgiving in the way only an urban jungle can be. Llewen Davis, as portrayed by Oscar Isaac, reveals a timeless cliché: the egocentric ""artist,"" careening insolently from one self-induced disaster to the next while flaunting a sense of entitlement that is completely undeserved. The guy is, in a word, an asshole — a fact that bitter, accidentally knocked-up Jean (Carey Mulligan) never lets him forget. As a music guy, I respect that all the music performances were shot and recorded live, not enhanced with post-production tricks. Most music films are so far off base they make my skin crawl. There are some cool songs — most of which are rendered top to bottom — as well as a couple-a funny send-ups. However, I heard nothing extraordinary, composition- or talent-wise. I'd recommend that Isaac not give up his day job. He's a fine actor but an average singer-songwriter.<br/><br/>The performance that justifies the price of a ticket is delivered by John Goodman. With this cane-wielding, junkie jazz musician, the Coens have once again invented a character for Goodman that dominates the screen with unpredictable, genuinely frightening, sickly hilarious power. In this extraordinary turn, Goodman rivals, perhaps even surpasses, his appearances in Raising Arizona and Big Lebowski.<br/><br/>Inside Llewen Davis lacks the charm or brilliant cartoon quality of Oh, Brother, Fargo, or Intolerable Cruelty. It's an expertly made small film with no heroes and some listenable music. If you're hankerin' for a dark, chilly, cheerless tale in which nearly everyone's a self-serving dick, this is just the movie for you."

","What a cruel joke! We thought this was a pretty terrible movie. Perhaps if you are a lover of folk music trivia you can find subtle meanings. It was lost on us and we are big 60's folk music fans although we did enjoy the soundtrack. There were no characters in this film that we liked or cared about. Of course folk singers did have trials and tribulations in pursuing their craft but they were people with values, nothing like the singer portrayed here. The plot meandered from one mean vignette to another. The John Goodman sequence wasn't funny or deep, it was just annoying. The hallmark seemed to be that everyone when off on an irrational rant for whatever reason. The use of profanity was overdone. It further belittled the characters. I'm shocked that the film has apparently gotten some measure of critical acclaim. <br/><br/>I was certainly expecting something clever and amusing. This was not it."
"rubenm","4","23","43","9 November 2013"," Not one of the Coen Brothers' best films
","I hate to say it, but from all the Coen Brothers-films I've seen, I liked this one the least. It lacks some essential Coen Brothers-features, like bizarre characters, crazy plot twists and visual exuberance. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a rather plain film, sometimes even boring. I wouldn't have thought I would ever have to say that about a Coen Brothers-movie, but there you go. <br/><br/>The film shows New York folk singer Llewyn Davis, who is a loser in every possible way. He has no commercial success, he has no money, he sleeps on couches at friends' and friends-of-friends' places, and he constantly quarrels with everyone he meets. This could be entertaining if it would lead to funny situations, interesting insights or dramatic developments, which it does not. There is a sort of running gag with a cat, but these jokes are very predictable and simply not very funny. <br/><br/>The biggest problem with this film is the storyline. There is none to speak of. We see Llewyn riding the subway, walking the streets, sleeping on couches and quarreling with friends and relatives. The only time something actually happens is when he goes on a trip to Chicago, but even that turns out to be aimless. Oh yes, and we see Llewyn Davis singing. There is a lot of music in the film. That's great if you like sixties-style folk singing (men with acoustic guitars in the style of Pete Seeger or pre-electric Bob Dylan), which I don't. Even the actors don't really stand out, with the exception of John Goodman. His performance brings back the real Coen Brothers-feeling, but is rather short. <br/><br/>This film can be appreciated as a reconstruction of the sixties folk scene in New York. The character of Llewyn Davis is inspired by Dave Van Ronk, a long-forgotten singer who was essential to the New York folk scene. I suppose there are lots of references to real-life people and events from that scene, but from the Coen Brothers I expected more than just a film for fans of sixties folk music."
"jmillerdp","5","9","14","11 December 2013"," Aggressively Unpleasant
","*** SPOILERS APLENTY! ***<br/><br/>This is one of those movies that I can't review unless I go into why I didn't like it. So, yes, there will be extensive spoilers.<br/><br/>After seeing this, I wonder if the Coen's have been hanging out with Woody Allen. That's because ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is as purposefully depressing as Allen's ""Blue Jasmine."" I give this movie one more star than the other, since the music is pretty good. But, that's the only reason.<br/><br/>Right from the outset, Llewyn Davis, the folk singer main character, is shown to be self destructive and depressed. We wonder why this is as the movie goes on. We do learn a key reason why that is, the sudden suicide of his singing partner. And, we can sympathize with that to an extent. But, apart from that, Davis gives us no reason to care any further. He does have to deal with a hyper angry girlfriend, who is only able to yell the same line at Davis again and again.<br/><br/>We are given little bits of hope for Davis here and there. Mainly in how he takes care of a cat that got out of an apartment where Davis was crashing. Davis loses the cat, and finds who he thinks is the right cat, but isn't. When he returns to the apartment with the wrong cat to where the original cat lived, we get one hilarious joke that had me really laughing. Davis leaves with that cat who wasn't the apartment dweller's.<br/><br/>But, that seemed to be a turning point in the movie, as the quirky, funny moments that came before stopped. From there, it got more and more dark and depressing.<br/><br/>When the Coen's have the scene where Davis leaves that wrong cat in a car along the road, it's as if the Coen's are telling the audience to go @#$% themselves. It's as if we are being made fun of for actually caring about Davis this whole time. We are shown that he really doesn't care about anyone but himself. So, why should we care? The end wraps this up, where Davis is playing on a night when the New York Times is in attendance. Davis performs passionately, for what seems like the first time. But, as it turns out, Bob Dylan follows Davis, on the historic night when Dylan received a positive review from the Times. So, we are led to believe that Dylan is the one discovered, while Davis is again left out in the cold.<br/><br/>I don't know if this film is supposed to be challenging somehow, or if it is just purposely depressing. My guess is that it is supposed to be depressing. I don't think that the Coen's really care about their audience in this circumstance. It is only that I saw the movie at a free preview that I'm not more agitated.<br/><br/>As for the rest of the movie, the music is good, but fairly low key. T. Bone Burnett, the man behind the music in films like ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?,"" does well again here. But, the music isn't as memorable.<br/><br/>The cinematography in many recent Coen films has been by the great Roger Deakins. Here, it is by Bruno Delbonnel. It has heavily desaturated color, and is pretty diffused. So, it isn't at all attractive.<br/><br/>I would avoid this film until it is on disc or on cable. Paying $13 or whatever to see it is way too much. I am glad that my cost was $0. That seems like an appropriate amount.<br/><br/>***** (5 Out of 10 Stars)"

","Inside Llewyn Davis seems, on the surface, to be making a simple point: creating art is difficult and rarely turns out like the happy tales which adorn the lucky few who become successful and notable. Beneath this thin cover, we have utterly ghastly condemnation of human nature. The repugnant conclusion to the dark and often brilliant existentially despairing Coen oeuvre.<br/><br/>Absolutely none of the characters in the film display any noble traits whatsoever. The protagonist is a fairly good musician, who like so many in real life, can't and don't get the Big Break. From that bitter locus we have radiating out a dismal miasma of horrible people and horrible circumstances.<br/><br/>A cheating agent and his utterly callous secretary. A foul mouthed, perpetually angry and needlessly scathing love interest. A scolding and perpetually angry sister. A father who can't be bothered to speak. A lecherous vile club owner. Vapid, uninteresting contemporaries. Bitter and judgmental characters without punctuation or distraction.<br/><br/>It's an orgy of self-piteous, disappointed and disappointing schmucks. The environment is relentlessly cold, wintry and grey. It is miserable.<br/><br/>The protagonist's musical partner is understood to have committed suicide jumping from New York City's George Washington bridge prior to the events which transpire in the film. The parting shot in which the protagonist shouts ""au revoir"" after the taxi transporting away a shadowy, mephistophelian husband who, moments before, has savagely beaten the protagonist in an alley, can only be viewed as a suicide note.<br/><br/>The character has nothing left. His music is a failure. His family is a failure. His love life is a failure. His day job is a failure. He is utterly friendless and alone in the world. His next option seems but one.<br/><br/>And in a truly vile and reprehensible way, it's as if the authors of the film stand jeering just off camera urging ""jump, you loser"".<br/><br/>Luckily life is not, cannot EVER be, this bad. In many ways, it is deeply irresponsible to bring such a horribly discouraging and depressing work before the public. It is such a lopsided portrayal of living as to be laughably unrealistic.<br/><br/>I for one, have lost loved ones, been homeless for an extended period, lost lovers, jobs, hopes and dreams. There is and always will be some light and joyful counterbalance in the universe even in the darkest moments. Perhaps the Coen brothers need to go to a good church service, or minimally watch a Monty Python movie. Smile a bit. <br/><br/>To display such great contempt for the subject, at a certain point, simply becomes self-referentially contemptible.<br/><br/>""Life is a tale told by an idiot ( or ""King Midas' idiot little brother"" ), full of sound and fury, signifying nothing."" That is the message this film has for you. Avoid it. Sadomasochistic, vicious intellectual smut."

"Robert_duder","5","13","22","19 February 2014"," Definitely made for the critics but misses its mark with me
","Something about Inside Llewyn Davis appealed to me. I saw a few trailers and I was actually really excited about it. I knew it would be quirky, maybe a little bizarre and certainly anything but mainstream. I was okay with that. I know that the Coen Brothers are often an acquired taste but they have an absolutely distinct style that I have enjoyed before. So I suppose my expectations were reasonably high. Simply put, I was let down. The film tries to show us a week in the life of a struggling musician in the Greenwich Village circa 1961. The biggest issue I found with the film is everyone is so damn miserable and unlikable and that especially goes for our main character. How can you care or be intrigued by a guy who is an absolutely selfish deplorable and miserable all the time. Then he visits his close friends who are also selfish, deplorable and miserable and then you get a little folk song here and there. It was extremely disappointing. Its a bizarre little adventure and parts of it were reasonably entertaining but it continually falls apart. The music (which should be the backbone to this film) is haunting and lovely but just when you start to get involved in the music, it ends and there simply isn't enough of it. Why do we invest time into a struggling musician who is a horrible person and hates his own existence? <br/><br/>There is certainly nothing wrong with the performances in the film. Oscar Isaac is our title character and he does the role well. The character is simply awful and unlikable and he does that well. I really wanted to see him find some redemption and it feels like its moving towards that but then the film ends...in the most sudden and abrupt way I have ever seen. Still Isaac is fine in a poorly written role. Carey Mulligan is also good at being a really awful human being. The entire story of their brief romance and pregnancy is ridiculous and their hateful, spite filled banter makes no sense. Her completely misdirected anger is irritating and her character is literally a bitch. I don't know what they were aiming for with her but she is awful but Mulligan plays that awful person well. Supporting cast are all decent and most of them have very small brief but important roles. Some worth mentioning are Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Ethan Phillips, Robin Bartlett, Adam Driver and Garrett Hedlund. Also honourable mention to those darn cats that he chases all over.<br/><br/>I understand that this is meant heart and soul to be an art-house film and I'm okay with that. But I have a problem with film makers specifically go out of their way to be bizarre, artsy and ambiguous. Sometimes its nice to not have to decipher every single scene in the film. What does the cat mean? What does the music mean? What is the meaning of his life? Its okay to ask these questions but the entire backbone of the film are these ambiguous questions. If you look below at the IMDb threads 99% of them start with ""What ___ means..."" ""Deciphering the cat..."" Sometimes that isn't enjoyable. Sometimes you just want an entertaining, nice story. Parts of this show some remnants of being an interesting quirky little comedy but then it quickly falls apart into trying to be deliberately artistic. It is what it is and some people (mostly critics) seem to adore it. I personally think it was a disappointing experience at best. Did not fulfil my expectations. 5.5/10"

","The reason I saw this film is that it's a Coen Brothers film--and I nearly always love their films--whether they are comedies or dramas. However, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was, for me, a completely boring film with very little to recommend it. If I hadn't known it was a Coen film, I never would have guessed it aside from having John Goodman in an odd little role and a reference to Ulysses.<br/><br/>Llewyn Davis is a struggling fictional folk singer. Not only is he only moderately talented, he's pretty much a bum--living off others and hoping they'll let him sleep on their couch for a day or two. Now if he was a nice person, this could be forgiven. But, unfortunately, he's a rather foul-mouthed guy for the early 1960s and there isn't a lot to like or admire. This film is about a week in his life where not a lot happens. And to me, this ALL sums up why I didn't like the film--Llewyn is a jerk and nothing of consequence happens in the movie. End of story. I kept hoping SOMETHING would happen to make it all worth watching but no such luck.<br/><br/>On the positive side, Oscar Isaac's acting was good as the title character. And,....well, I guess that's all there is on the positive side. I rarely have seen a movie so praised by critics that left me this dissatisfied. In this sense, I'd place it among films like ""Tree of Life"" and ""The English Patient"". See it if you want--just don't be surprised if there just isn't much to enjoy in this one."

If you are hoping to see a Coen Bros. film that excites and entertains, unfortunately this will surely disappoint. The settings of the 1960's in Greenwich Village New York are ""spot on"".

(Yeah I get it -- dark screen, dark mood -- how clever.)<br/><br/>2. The music in this movie does NOTHING to capture the vitality of the music of the real 1960s Village folk scene.

","The Coens' Inside Llewyn Davis interweaves two week-long journeys. One is mythic and heroic, the other bathetic but realistic.<br/><br/>We don't recognize the mythic journey till we — with Llewyn (Oscar Isaac) — learn that the runaway cat — who escapes early and against all odds makes it home at the end — is named Ulysses. Earlier Llewyn pondered the poster of The Incredible Journey, a sentimental kids' film about roving pets. This Ulysses's journey stands between the Greek myth and the pop film. The Ulysses myth is like Llewyn's definition of the folk song: ""It was never new, and it never gets old.""<br/><br/>The sad, bathetic journey is Llewyn's, which deflates all our American Idol myths that all you need is a dream, which if you sacrifice everything for, will pay off. Not here. The Coens love to deflate our culture's mindless delusions. This film flies in the face of every Star is Born fiction we've ever swallowed. Happily, it avoids the happy ending.<br/><br/>Something is missing in Llewyn — like that extra Ell syllable one expects in his name. Llewellyn, now that's a good Welsh moniker. Clearly fate has kicked the Ell out of Llewyn. He has a dream, an ambition, a good enough voice, a dab hand at finding offbeat and poetic lyrics, and he even has the true artist's inability to get along with normal people. <br/><br/>What's missing? Nothing more than the validity of the American Dream. Most people with a dream, talent, perseverance, in fact don't make it. Indeed, of all the musical talents that pop up in this film the only success is the odd kid with the mouth organ who slips into the background in the last club scene. And who would have predicted success for that atonal rambling nasal freak? Otherwise the film is a parade of failures.<br/><br/>Not just artists have delusions of adequacy. The Gorfeins are a caricature of Village liberals, who will bend over backwards and swallow all kinds of insults to feel connected to An Artist. Elizabeth Hobby (Nancy Blake), the sad harpist whom Llewyn heckles, has Mrs Gorfein's square, dreamy face and braids, but her husband is free from Mr Gorfein's pretences to culture. He avenges his wife's humiliation by beating up Llewyn, then taking her away from ""this cesspool."" He's no sociologist like Gorfein but he has a clear take on that world. <br/><br/>The free-spirited Jean (Carey Mulligan) spews hatred at Llewyn for knocking her up — but turns out to have slept with the seedy club manager too. Her vicious abuse of Llewyn is self- hatred in disguise. So is the snobbery of Roland Turner (John Goodman), who despite depending on two canes huffs and puffs his superiority at Llewyn till he's found in a heroin stupor on a public toilet floor. That's the guy who sneered at someone committing suicide from the George Washington Bridge instead of the trad Brooklyn. <br/><br/>What's inside Llewyn Davis? The unrealistic optimism his culture has instilled. The only emotional impact he has on an audience is his benumbed father's, unwitting. Llewyn's defeat is so complete that he can't even complete his sell-out, that is, returning to the merchant marine in his father's — and the real, i.e., mythic, Ulysses's — sea faring footsteps.

","The wife and I have been looking forward to this film coming here ever since we saw previews in December. I enjoy most of the Coen Bros. movies and the quirky characters they create. Unfortunately, this contained none of those, and was a chore to sit through. Some of the encounters are entertaining, but overall, the story just isn't that interesting. The music got rather tiresome after a while as well. Something a little up-beat thrown in might have helped keep me from fighting against my eyelids. There was very little to laugh at here as well, which is also not generally the case with the Coen Bros. Hopefully their next effort will be back in form. I don't know that even the die-hards will enjoy this one."
"rcastl2335","4","14","26","4 January 2014"," Llewyn Davis has a very, very bad week
","Because there is no arc to the character--and only a loose and very arbitrary arc to the film, Inside Llewyn Davis is ultimately an empty exercise in black and white photography. (Although it is a great audition tape for Oscar Isaac. If anyone is thinking of remaking Serpico, here's your star.) <br/><br/>Inspired by a biography (""The Mayor of MacDougal Street"") of folk music legend Dave Van Ronk, the screenplay is only a very superficial skim of the scene. And acclaimed music producer T-Bone Burnette is out of his depth in that role for the film.Where he worked with genuine bluegrass artists like Alison Krauss and Gillian Welch on O Brother, Where Art Thou, here he's on his own. He doesn't have roots in folk music (he's an LA rocker) and, like the Coen Brothers, is too young to have been part of the early Sixties NY scene depicted here. It leaves him unable to provide any insights into the music or musicians.<br/><br/>The film picks up Davis at a bad point, follows him through several more of them in a very bad week, including a hellish odyssey to wintry Chicago, then stops--as the opening scene is (without explanation) repeated. If the movie had started a month earlier or a year later, the journey would be totally different. (Five years later and he'd be playing with the Lovin' Spoonful.) This can be read strictly as the fault of the screenwriters. You never see Davis at rest and only fleetingly at work. Davis himself is neither a bad person nor a bad musician. He's good looking, audiences are enthusiastic and he's a terrific singer and picker. He's recorded two albums. He's attractive to women. His personal relationships are a little tangled though he has a set of friends who are more than willing to feed and shelter him. But like most musicians at the beginning of their professional careers, he's sleeping on other people's couches and scrambling for gigs and money.<br/><br/>There are a few interesting acting bits by Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Garrett Hedlund and Coen stalwart John Goodman. F. Murray Abraham has some brutally amusing scenes as an imperious club owner. But in the end, it's a frustratingly wasted look at a pivotal point in American music."
"TotonotinKansas","2","6","9","15 March 2014"," The Inside is empty
","Slow, dull, boring. I can't believe I'm saying such about a Coen brothers movie. After watching I thought what's wrong with me, I love Coen brothers movies, they're among my all-time favorites, what did I miss, why did I not ""get"" this? The setup is so appealing; the Greenwich Village folk music scene of the early 60's, great right? New York in the winter, old cars, subways, apartments, sidewalks, snow, all the visual points were perfect. It appears there was supposed to be some meaning to the cat escaping through the apartment door early and then the same scene repeated near the end but the cat does not escape, the meaning escaped me. A hint of early Bob Dylan following Davis on stage as Davis goes out the back door to get his ass kicked, didn't stir me. By the end I found that I felt entirely apathetic about what I had just watched, there was pretty much noting entertaining about it. This movie offered nothing beyond the period imagery. I wonder if it didn't have the Coen label would there be 9's and 10's in some of these reviews?"
"jacabiya","2","7","11","15 March 2014"," Didn't get it
","My problem with the film is that I didn't get the purpose of telling this story. You are supposed to understand without been told, but I didn't. For example, the music played by Llewyn vis a vis the other performers. Was his music good and the others' bad? Sometimes this distinction was for me clear, other times it wasn't, and I don't know if the auteurs knew that either, or left it as a subjective interpretation of the main character. Some of the music is clearly bad, and is presented as such, as for example the Please Mr. Kennedy song. Other music I'm not sure, including the song about Llewyn wanting to have wings to fly away. The hanging song and the one he sings to his father I believe were beautiful, and I believe are presented as such, but others may disagree.<br/><br/>I also didn't get the historic significance of folk music in the 60's, and whether a guy like Dylan was discovered while guys like Llewyn never got off the ground did not resonate with me. And I agree the film fails miserably to capture this world of folk music. If you are a fan of this music, you might find the Coens' viewpoint cynic, sarcastic, condescending, and downright insulting. Then again, these are the Coens we are talking about.<br/><br/>Back to the question, what was the purpose of the film? I've been a huge fan of the Coens since Blood Simple, but have later begin to tame my admiration since even as the master directors, technicians and story-tellers they are, like Kubrick (except maybe his Paths of Glory) and Hitchcock, they seem to lack a loving soul, as others have pointed out long ago. Their style is detached, with a nihilistic viewpoint from up above, with little to no sympathy. You can say most of his films are dead inside. There's no love in his films, and therefore it isn't hard to believe the Coens are two smart-ass juvenile genius pricks who believe themselves superior.<br/><br/>During the trip to Chicago I thought the Coens were going back to their story telling style in Barton Fink, a film I hugely admire. This film however fell way short. One thing may be true, and that is that the Coens believe they have the knowledge of a superior truth just like Barton. Then again, as it has constantly been their theme, they are not oblivious and emphasize the reality that crashes most dreams. But it would be remarkable if for once we get to see them bare pieces of their souls, if any, or I they will always stay in this very personal but at the end adolescent way and style of art and film."
"bob the moo","Null","7","11","8 March 2014"," There is a creative sadness in here, but it is heavily masked in sporadic plotting, hidden meaning and a dreary tone
","Like almost everyone who loved or hated this film, I do generally like the Coen brothers and am not against having to do work to enjoy and appreciate a film. This is an important thing to say because Inside Llewyn Davis is certainly not a film to come to as a casual viewer just looking to kill a few hours – not as a snobby thing of ""you'll not appreciate it"" but just a reality that the film does almost nothing to help the viewer. The plot involves struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis in the Greenwich Village scene of the early 1960s; he is not particularly commercial, is irresponsible, downbeat and cannot look after others or even the cat belonging to others. We follow him over the course of a week which will change his life and see the world around him change too.<br/><br/>I really did want to like this film because at times there is a certain beauty to it in the pained reality of its lead character, his situation and his gradual realization of where his life is and where it is going. Unfortunately this is generally spread very thin and instead of having a structure that supports this, we instead get an episodic approach that makes the ""week"" feel like months, sees characters just come and go whether we have an interest in them or not and generally doesn't allow you to do more than grasp at metaphors which drift by – usually resulting in the people who love the film the most being those who brought a lot of their own selves to the table, leaving us who look to the film to at least help, feeling left out in the cold and even a little bored.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful when it comes and the cinematography is excellent as it captures and shapes the feel of the film and the character – it is bleak to look at for sure, but it is suitable and effective for what the film is. The same could be said of Isaac's performance because it is what the film needs him to do but the downside is that it isn't really what the viewer needs him to do. His personal journey (physical and emotional) is made harder b the coldness of his character – there is really not much to grab hold of here and he is generally difficult. As often is the case with the Coens, we have characters drifting though the story usually in a colorful fashion – the times it has worked in other films has been frequent but here I didn't think it did at all, with nobody seeming to add much. As writers of the material and directors of their cast the ""blame"" (depending on your view) belongs with the Coens as they have made this film very difficult to get into.<br/><br/>Full of supposed metaphors and with a sadness which is put in the distance look of its title character rather than in his heart or in the audience's line of sight, the film drifts along with a general sense of sadness and change which always interested me but just seemed deliberately out of reach and distant. I'm sure if you ""get it"" then it is a film to adore, but for me it just didn't work at all."

"samkan","5","17","33","15 January 2014"," Profoundly Disappointing
","The Greenwich Village music scene in the early '60's, by identity a folk revival but really a confluence of so many things; e.g., youthful angst, atomic fears, academia, neo-beat, etc., was full of vitality and greatly influenced the anti-war movement, not to mention the hippie era and the evolution of folk rock. ILD is sadly lacking in anything informing or uplifting and instead offers us a melancholy, older and less articulate Holden Caufield. There are several scenes in the film showing the title character performing well but show me just thirty seconds where Llewyn is depicted as loving - or even liking - music itself. Rather, Llewyn is totally self-absorbed when not pre-occupied with finding a couch to sleep on. One gets the feeling that LD would grab any diversion available and folk music just happens to be the one that is there. The ""cat"" subplot is not only pointless but thoroughly annoying. The talented Cohen brothers are in a funk and throwing up (pun intended) well crafted junk. Forget the accolades for ILD. It's mediocre stuff. PS / Dave Van Ronk, allegedly a loose model for the ILD mainc haracter, was an exceptional guitarist; e.g., performing such Scot Joplin instrumentals as THE ENTERTAINER and MAPLE LEAF RAG. The guitar playing in ILD is given zero reverence and I'm sure it was T-Bone Burnett's idea to have the professor friend own a Sears Silvertone to contrast the Martins and Gibsons."

","I love the Coen Brothers for movies like O Brother Where Art Thou and The Big Lebowski and I expected something great from Inside Llewyn Davis, especially because it has received such glowing reviews and has garnered so many award nominations.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is dreary, pointless, and unpleasant. The main character is not likable, and the audience's distaste for Llewyn is solidified when he leaves a cat stranded with a drug-addicted old man on the side of the highway. The other characters are more Coen Brothers trademark oddballs, though none of them contribute in any meaningful way to the main character or the story. John Goodman, for example, is hilarious, but his character is absolutely purposeless.<br/><br/>It seems to me that the Coen Brothers wanted to make a movie about folk music and to work with T Bone Burnett again, but lacked the motivation to make anything truly substantive. Even the music around which the movie is centered still lacks gravity, perhaps because nothing that is presented on screen has any real emotional pull or interest. It has drawn supporters from the art-house crowd who like the avant-garde but who cannot pretend to understand it. The point of this movie is that there is no point, and try though I did to respect this idea, it is ultimately a waste of time to make a movie to present.<br/><br/>If this movie wins Best Picture, I will be very upset. This movie is not innovative, interesting, or remarkable. It is depressing and ugly."

Also, almost all the cast except Oscar Isaac end up as idiotic caricatures. It s very unfortunate. I do not recommend that you see this movie.

Unfortunately, the Coens saw fit to showcase several of these masterpieces, in their entirety. That alone could send you to the bathroom to escape.<br/><br/>But, there was more (or less): An incredibly banal and tedious script, and acting that couldn't rise above it. <br/><br/>I went back to the snack bar for another quart of Diet Coke so I could stay awake while I waited for something to happen.

"zken","1","21","43","24 December 2013"," So this is why I dislike folk music?
","Hate to be the one sour note, and it is great that so many people can enjoy this movie. But from a musical and musicians point of view, it is hopelessly out of tune. And it is the biggest miss for music fans since Scorcese completely ruined a very good idea of filming a story about the swing era, New York, New York. The problem with both films, is that the directors exhibited a tin ear to what was really behind an entire genre of music, and failed to capture almost all of the joy, sweat and tears that goes into musical creativity. If the Coen's wanted to capture the tragedy of musical losers, then they have not even done that. Because the whole reason music becomes an obsession in the first place is because there is so much that is positive about even very small roles in the musical universe. And what the Coen's really miss is the small fact that the folk era was not just the petty lives of secondary artists, but an entire country, even an entire world, singing there heart out about the liberation that was sweeping human consciousness. And there was one other small fact; folk musicians were known for more that silly tantrums and little minds. Many of them, to this day, were satisfied to be historians, mythologists, and keepers of the flame from many cultures and traditions. The shocking glory of Joan Baez, Pete Seeger, Dylan in that style and so many others was pure magic. All of a sudden there was music of such simplicity and beauty, that the world was stunned. If the Coen's had any inkling of this in the making of this movie, I missed it."

For every Bob Dylan, or Elvis, or Beatles, or Britney Spears and Taylor Swift, etc. there are many hundreds/thousands of 'hopefuls'. This is the story of one...<br/><br/>The music is just a part, but it is excellent, and Oscar Isaac plays & sings very well. He showed his real depth as an actor (and musician too!) The film is set in 1961 and was like watching the world of New York, etc., thru a time-machine lens... Oh, God Bless! the Coen Brothers for making films like this that touch the Heart and Funny Bone. To me they are National Treasures and have my deepest admiration and gratitude. Good Work, Boys!!!<br/><br/>The main title character, played excellently by Oscar Isaac, is quite pathetic at times, but has a real passion for his 'Life's Work' of writing and playing folk songs. But how he treats his friends, others and himself (and cats), says more than his music ever does. He is really the 'walking wounded' ever since his singing partner had died by suicide. He appears to just muddle forward in life?
It seemed to me that he lived up to that expression of ""Being one's own worst enemy"", as he insults or says mean things to all those who try to help him, or those that care and have been closest to him, or even made love to him (Jean).<br/><br/>The scene where he played a song to his father (who has dementia, and does not talk?) was very moving, and will hit anyone that has an old parent or known someone with a similar situation. And the plotline about the orange cat really got to me, as a cat lover. When Llewyn abandons the old man (John Goodman) and the orange cat in the car by the side of the road, it was a heart-rending scene, and what happened later when he encounters that cat again on the road. Why does he not help others more? Maybe he feels he is of no use, except for his music. And at the end, he seems to abandon any hope for that as well?<br/><br/>As a struggling songwriter/musician myself, this film really connected with me.
I watched it three times, after getting the DVD, and will watch it quite often... This is a very rich story, of a time in America that had it's own unique magic, when the Space Race had just begun, and JFK was still alive (and the American Dream too!) And it's a film to make you root for an anti-social but likeable anti-hero. For Llewyn isn't really a bum with a guitar, nor is he much different than any of us... He just needs to care a bit more about others & himself... and cats!"
"jjhoops7","Null","2","2","31 December 2019"," Reverberates with life, intimate, sad, and darkly funny
","The power of Llweyn Davis rests on dramatic irony, That a film can be so beautiful, intimate and resonant with the audience, but in the world of the film, Llewyn can't seem to catch a break, struggling at every turn to convince the commercial music world that his art has value, that he has value. Therein lies the black humor of the film and it is encapsulated in one specific scene, where Llewyn performs in Chicago in order to secure a record deal. Here we find just one man performing for another. Llewyn reveals his soul in a haunting folk melody. The camera slowly creeps in, until nothing exists but Llewyn and his music. The camera then creeps in on the music manager, until it's us and his eyes, dead focused on Llewyn. The performance ends, the viewer enraptured, and then the music manager remarks, ""I don't see a lot of money here."" It's a brutal and ironic punch to the gut for both Llewyn and the audience. But there is also a redeeming message here. That your soul, your art, is valuable beautiful and incorruptible, despite what you may have come to believe about yourself by how the world treats you."
"mistarkus","3","11","20","30 December 2013"," Tired Film
","The protagonist has his life sucked out of him due to failure from trying to make it in the music scene. And the only redeeming quality is the connection felt to this character since you will likely have the life sucked out of you after viewing.<br/><br/>Its about a man trying to make it in the folk music scene in new York city. Inside Llewyn Davis needed but lacked something smart to envelopment the audience into the folk scene. It needed to present us with whats going on in that scene. If they couldn't do it technically (since all that was done regarding the setting was showing cold, muted colors and bleak dark environs that do not transport you anywhere except to a place of gloominess) they should have at least tried to put in some dialogue about the scene, a bit of a historical perspective, something about folk music itself, anything to get the audience into the 1960s folk scene setting which was what the movie was about. Perhaps the movie wasn't really about the folk music scene but rather a metaphor for the man who fails in his vocation. The film was about portraying a face that is not able to make it and perhaps the difficulty of trying to be a folk singer during that time period. The music was portrayed and listening to it was a delight and the only redeeming quality unfortunately is was barely discussed. <br/><br/>The reason this film really fails is it exposes the worst of the worst film-making techniques and styles that the Coens are capable of. Quirky and boring caricature like characters that are trying to be amusing or maybe funny but you absolutely don't care about. Characters who are arbitrarily literally dropped out of the story which is OK because you don't care about them. There is really no character study of Lllewyn Davis he is sad, a little frustrated without very minimal backdrop to why he does what he does. <br/><br/>The second major film-making problem was that it seemed put together in a very amateurish way since it has a disjointed feel, lacks flow, contains scenes of random nothingness infiltrated with characters of such banality. This was the worst Coen Film since the random characters which are sometimes amusing in their film were carelessly put in, had nothing of interest to say and completely failed to amuse. The random scenes in their films that usually don't fit in can sometimes have this quirky suspense about them but there was no suspense in this movie. The movie seemed lazily put together, the main character was tired and it may ultimately leave the audience tired. <br/><br/>The only pleasantness derived from this is the actually folk music we get to hear. A complete song was played which is the only enjoyment I can foresee an audience deriving from this poorly put together depiction of bland misery. Devoting significant movie time to playing complete songs is also a problem. So the only good thing about this movie even added to the problems since by having a lot of time devoted to playing the complete song; the character development, the story and the substance were all forfeited."

I almost watched the scene a third time for catharsis, he was so irritating.<br/><br/>From a film-making stand-point, showing the entire performance of a song on camera is generally a big mistake (remember Under The Sea?) and this film is no exception. Whereas the otherworldliness of the music in O Brother Where Art Thou worked, and was entertaining, here the full- length on-camera folk performances were torture. Which was really a shame because the musicianship and sound are unquestionably excellent.

For example a lot of the film is just watching him walk around. Overall it was mildly entertaining but i wouldn't watch it again."

","I swore off their movies with ""No Country For Old Men,"" saying that they used the same formula over and over since ""Barton Fink."" Yet, I once again thought, ""This one looks different.""<br/><br/>Okay, it's different. No blood or crime sprees. No action of any sort. It's a long character study of a character that isn't very likable, and it doesn't seem that the directors want to present him as likable or redeemable or having any qualities whatsoever.<br/><br/>The cameo characters are interesting, but they drift in and out of the movie without much impact at all. What does Llewyn learn from them? Why are they in his life? Reach for your popcorn and you'll miss their appearance at all, leaving nothing.<br/><br/>It's a snapshot, much like a complex painting, one that makes you want to know what is driving the characters or how they came to interact, but you aren't given the opportunity to. It's a sorbet, giving just enough information to create a curiosity, but insufficient exploration to learn from knowing them.<br/><br/>If you love the Coen Brothers and think they're geniuses who can do no wrong - and evidently much of the art-house crowd is precisely that sort of person - please do go find out what is inside Llewyn Davis. If you want to skip it, look on the back of the movie poster and you'll see the sum total of what is revealed in the actual movie.<br/><br/>I too have a peculiar, slavish devotion to art-house cinema. I'm a sucker for off the beaten path, French language, noncommercial, etc. I've seen possibly all Coen Bros films since Barton Fink and they have many moments of brilliance. Perhaps they're now in their Fat Elvis days, riding on their former creativity, or more like their fat Marlon Brando days, clearly once artists but now just confusing author/directors who throw up a performance and expect paying audiences to go see it. Audiences like me. Don't be one of them."
"st-shot","6","8","14","15 January 2014"," Inside Llewyn Davis is half empty.
","For every Bob Dylan, Joan Baez and Simon and Garfunkel in the early 60s you probably had a thousand Llewyn Davis's; semi talented folkies who kept the dream alive by starving and crashing at other peoples pads, straining for that break, the brass ring remaining elusive. Inside Llewyn Davis is a week in the life of one aspirant whose dream is mostly a nightmare.<br/><br/>Davis (Oscar Issac) opens with our protagonist warbling a melancholy tune at a Greenwich Village coffee house where neophytes try their luck. After his set he gets punched out by a mysterious stranger in the alley, finds out he has a fellow folkie pregnant, is being grossly under represented by his agent and has it revealed to him that he is a dad with a two year old in Akron. He is also sidled with a friends cat that he eventually abandons. He decides to try his luck in Chicago when he has opportunity to hitch a ride with a jazz artist and poet. Chicago it turns out is as welcoming as NYC and he is soon headed back after an audition that offers some daylight which he rejects outright.<br/><br/>The Brothers Coen once again deliver a unique and original character in the self absorbed, irresponsible Davis. A moody ungrateful sponger you still find yourself rooting for him as he chases the elusive dream of making it big while refusing to confront reality. The overall narrative itself however is loose and raggedy with a patchwork quilt of stilted scenes and our hero literally going in circles with the contrived road trip, though John Goodman as the zonked out jazz cat does have a moment dissembling folk with his jazz comparison.<br/><br/>The Coens do an excellent job of utilizing the cold harsh winter to emphasize Davis's wearying struggle as well as portray the times by lining the sidewalks and some expansive shots with massive eight cylinder behemoths covered in winter grime. There is also a wonderfully energized scene where Davis and the boys do a studio take of a Ray Stevens ( Please Mr. Custer, Alley Oop) type comedy tune popular back then that lifts Inside from its morose gloom momentarily before Llewlyn once again self implodes by signing away the royalties for cash upfront.<br/><br/>The Coens are once again to be commended for continually going against the grain of formulaic main stream film in both character and scenario but with Davis little of the supporting cast is fleshed out and the ancillary characters that inform their past works with telling incidentals fail to register amid the glum theme here and the film like one of the Oldsmobile 88s mired in a snow bank spins its wheels much of the time."

It's empty amusement with a flimsy script. What may have seemed like a good idea in concept turns out to be merely ho-hum upon its execution. With all the music throughout, it's a huge disappointment to hear only mediocre technical recordings of the songs (And the key singers are marginal—especially Justin Timberlake.) Even as a made-for-TV effort it's tawdry. Sure, there are a few expected tricks of the cinematic trade here and there. But over all, this movie gives lip service to the period and the music culture of the time, and rides mainly on the reputation of the Coen brothers--which is why I wanted to see it.

","Seeing that ""Contains spoilers"" check mark while writing this review I thought to myself - is there anything in this movie that I could write that would actually ""spoil"" anything for other people. The answer I'm afraid is: no. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is a pretentious, pointless and incredibly contrived film by two brothers that have obviously lost touch with reality. This is hipster cinema at it's worst. No plot, no development, no climax and no resolution. Now, I'm no stranger to less known, artistic films. I'll take anything from Korean, Spanish, Swedish, Danish, Portuguese, Japanese, Polish, Czech, English or American cinema. I really do enjoy slow, intricate movies. And I love character studies! Except, this movie doesn't really study this self-destructive jerk of an folk singer that's trying to work his way into music business. Because there's nothing to study. The guy's a talented a-hole with issues. I know a lot of those in person. And they're all the same.<br/><br/>When the movie ended my girlfriend, a musician herself, simply said ""what a load of bull"". And I couldn't agree more. Even though I was desperately waiting till the very end for some kind of a big ""gotcha"" that would tie it all together and show that this movie does in fact make sense, that moment never came.<br/><br/>The only good thing is that the songs are okay and the atmosphere of the 60's seems well portrayed.

","I love many of the Coen Brothers movies including Fargo, No Country for Old Men and A Serious Man. They all look like masterpieces compared to this movie. <br/><br/>I go to a movie to be entertained and this movie, except for the songs, had almost no entertainment value. <br/><br/>If a movie has both a bad story and bad acting, it generally gets bad reviews from the professional critics and nobody goes to see it. <br/><br/>If a movie has a bad story but good acting it might get good reviews for the acting, which for many professional reviewers overshadows the need for a good story and entertainment value. <br/><br/>To me there is almost no story, except to portray a person devoid of common sense who continues to pursue a dream of becoming a singer while his experiences say that dream is nothing more than a dream. Even when he appears to be heading for a real job as a seaman, his past mistakes in judgment make that very difficult to achieve. Thinking ahead is not part of his mentality.<br/><br/>I strongly recommend skipping this movie. Look on Metacritic.com for the user reviews. Currently they are 13 positive, 11 mixed, and 13 negative. But the critic's rating is 92 out of 100. In this case the users were much wiser than the critics. <br/><br/>If you want to see a good character study movie, with both a good story and excellent acting, go to see Nebraska. I am no fan of Bruce Dern, but he is outstanding in this movie and you will get your money's worth."

","The Coen Brothers have impressed me yet again with this dark, emotional, and beautiful comedy-drama about life, love, music, and cats. It's a heavy film at times, and a hilarious one at others. Throughout the film the Coen's show off their talent for filmmaking to much success. Every ingredient of this film is put together in such a way that it forms an impactful, funny, and original masterpiece. A film that I recommend to anyone with a heart and soul, this is one of the most realistic, yet, at times, somewhat surrealistic films that I have ever seen. <br/><br/>The performances are all excellent, especially Oscar Issac who fills his performance as the wonderfully three dimensional character of Llewyn Davis with all of the emotion and complexity necessary for the likable and, at times, horrible main character. Other stunning performances come from John Goodman-whose performance is extremely funny, Carey Mulligan- whose performance is extremely emotional and, at times, downright despicable, and Adam Driver-whose performance is quite brief but is still manages to be pleasingly quirky and humorous. <br/><br/>This is a very different and beautiful film, the type of film that you don't come across all too often, but when you do, it's like buried treasure."

","Some have called it melancholy, I would say dull, lifeless and uninspiring. I'm a big fan of the directors, however this is at best a generous 5/10. The brothers' more recent movies have only offered minority appeal, I'd ask that they start issuing guidance warnings. e.g. 'This movie will only appeal to mid fifties Jewish males who want to laugh at their own shortcomings; once or twice in 90 minutes.'. For a good example of how to do melancholy and still create an appealing and inspiring movie, check out Von Trier's Melancholia. That is a masterpiece. This film is to my mind a little bit of the emperor with no clothes phenomena. Meaning, people feel obliged to praise it because of the directors; not because of the film itself. It may be moody, beautifully filmed and acted. It's still no excuse for such a lack luster overall package."
"kieronboote-134-969472","3","3","4","8 March 2014"," Flatter to deceive?
","I don't know whether this is a 9 out of 10 star film in which the Coen's stick 2 fingers up to critical awareness or a 3 out of 10 star film in which they stick up the white flag of surrender to critical expectation?<br/><br/>This film is either the Coen Brothers most sarcastic in-joke at the expense of the critics or the film that confirms what some of their detractors have always maintained, that they really can't make genuinely mature and emotional films without resorting to little in jokes and post modernist tropes. As someone who has been an avid follower of the Coen Brothers from ""Blood Simple"" onwards, who has loved the masterpieces ""Fargo"", ""A Stupid Man"" etc, been left indifferent by ""Intolerable Cruelty"" and ""Burn Before Reading"" and been appalled by the unwatchable ""The Ladykillers"" I would like to think that this is some great satirical comedy on the misunderstanding of the artistic process but it could just as easily be a big misjudgment made by people who can only operate at the intellectual level of middle brow critics. Frankly I'm confused by this film.<br/><br/>The lazy critical consensus has presented this film as being essentially about ""Losers, likability and luck"", the implication being that the character of Llweyn Davis is a misunderstood genius who if only he could connect with people and if only his sense of timing was right could have been Bob Dylan. The reality, at least as I see it in the film, is that he has limited talent, his songs are all fairly derivative and his voice pleasant but anonymous. Music is obviously critical to the film and I think the extract that we hear from Mahler's ""Das Lied Von Der Erde"", the only non folk music in the film, is key to the Coen's intentions. The extract, I am sure not by coincidence written by a Jewish composer, appears at precisely the point where the lyrics state that ""There is no music on Earth that can compare to ours""? Is this the Coen's saying that this is truly beautiful and ethereal music not the music of Llewyn Davis? If it isn't then this is a serious miscalculation because the moment serves to show just how mediocre the folk music in the film is in comparison to the Mahler.<br/><br/>I'd also like to think that the whole cat theme is an enormous joke at the expense of the YouTube piano playing cat generation and that the Coen's are really smart enough to know that people would come up with theories about the cat being the metaphorical presence of Llewyn. I'd also like to think that the sheer predictability of some of the jokes and plot points - who didn't know that second cat was a different cat and a different gender? Who didn't know that the song would be a hit the minute that Llewyn signed away his royalties? Who hadn't made the connection that Llewyn's merchant seaman papers would be in the box he told his sister to place by the curbside? – are also the Coen's playing with audience expectations.<br/><br/>Are the over familiar Coen Brothers characters such as John Goodman's ""Roland Turner"", an aging and infirm composite of all of his previous Coen Brother's characters, yet another taciturn chain smoking car driver to follow ""Gaer Grimsrud"" from ""Fargo"", F Murray Abrahm's ""Bud Grossman"", yet another sage like deliverer of an anti climactic moment, a comment on the artistic process or a sign that the Coen's really do have to keep repeating themselves?<br/><br/>So far as the casting is concerned Oscar Issac is highly effective in the demanding title role in which he is on screen for virtually every moment. However it is true that he is certainly ideally cast as someone who is not particularly likable as a screen presence whereas you most definitely immediately warm to Justin Timberlake's ""Jim"". But ultimately is the Coen's real point that under the woolly jumpers these ""soulful artists"" are so incapable of making genuine gestures that they aren't even capable of throwing themselves off the right bridge when it comes to deciding to commit suicide?<br/><br/>The casting of Carey Mulligan is the real acid test to me of what their real intentions were. So much has been made in articles and features about Ms Mulligans performance, particularly the singing. Yet this amounts to a fairly flat rendition of a single verse of a dull song. Her ""Jean"" is the girl the men want to ""Fuck"" but she is presented as a plain girl in a shapeless brown jumper. Her character, as it is written on the face of it, is supposed to be a little atom of misplaced rage, but she is a hypocrite and, as performed, is painfully bloodless and flat. It is not Ms Mulligan's fault that she is so adored by the critical establishment or that she has appeared in overrated and clichéd films such as ""Drive"" and ""Shame"" ( where she was supposed to be the self destructive ""Yin"" to Mr Fassbender's ""Yang"" but ended up being the whim to his Wang!). It would be unfair to expect someone with her limited life experience and cosseted Hollywood lifestyle to be able to inhabit characters in the way that actresses such as Jean Moreau or Charlotte Rampling, who can bring their own biography to bare in their performances, do. Yet Julianne Moore in films like ""Safe"" and ""Short Cuts"", that were relatively early in her career, was able to deliver complex and real people in an absorbing and convincing manner whereas Ms Mulligans is just acting. Ms Mulligan may indeed be delivering what the Coen's wanted but what exactly was that? <br/><br/>The climax of the film for me was the moment when Llewyn's father responded to a ""moving"" rendition of one of his songs by actually having a bowel movement. Would the Coen's agree? We'll never know."

","The good: overall very good acting and camera work - with a little Fargo-like feel to it. The bad: the point of the movie seems to be that it is pointless. The Coen brothers have certainly succeeded in convincing me of the latter.<br/><br/>The film at first leads us to sympathize with our flawed protagonist (hey, we've been conditioned to like the underdog) but gradually steers us toward overcoming this mistaken instinct, not with a bang but more of a drawn-out whimper. As they say, the opposite of love is not hate, it is indifference. That is where we end up with our protagonist. Unfortunately, that's also how I also feel about this film: ""meh"".<br/><br/>John Goodman's character seemed out of place and contrived, a bit like most of the film. I expected better from the Coen brothers and it's sad to see them rewarded by most reviewers for this subpar, pointless film.<br/><br/>Despite other laudatory reviews, this reminds me of that fable, The Emperor Wears No Clothes."

","I have just watched ILD and am disappointed. I generally love the Coen brothers, but this was decidedly lacking. Lacking in anything special, or anything particularly interesting. The film craftsmanship is typically good, well shot, well acted etc, but I did not care too much for the well being of our main character... whether he became homeless, lost the cat, lost his mind, I really did not care. For that, I blame the un likability of Llewyn. I wonder why he did not travel to see his 2 year old child? We go the point, him being a loser, early on, and nothing much else happened. I have seen slower paced films which i found far more engaging, for example, LOCKE, which is fantastic, and features simply a man in a car talking on the phone... for the WHOLE movie. That is way more powerful than this film, and I put that down to a lack of empathy one experiences when following the life of Lewyn Davis. His dilemmas, whether to quit or not, and whether to compromise his art to make money, are universal, but we don't really get INSIDE Lewyn Davis, certainly not enough to really care."

","Sometimes when you are with your friends you will go into those 'what if' scenarios. You know things like what if you found a million dollars, or what if you only had one week to live? I always remember someone asking me what would be the one thing you would grab if your house was on fire. Well I want to change that question to this: if you could only choose one filmmaker to always make movies, which would you, choose? How do you decide, when there are so many great filmmakers? Well my choice would be the Coen Brothers. Now I know what you are thinking, I said one filmmaker, and my answer happen to be brothers, but my response to that would be, when they direct and write their films they are like one incredible creative force. <br/><br/>I choose the Coen's because they march to their own drummer and tell stories that always seem special, and memorable. They don't make movies that exist in the normal world; instead they invite you into their world. Now in the Coen's world there tends to be a lot of anger, but with that anger you also get passion and the most unique kind of humor as well. In their new film ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", they tell a story about a young folk singer trying to navigate Greenwich Village in 1961. That singer's name is Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), and if you couldn't guess by the name the story is about him. Llewyn is trying to cope with being on his own after his musical partner jumped off the George Washington Bridge. Although extremely talented things just don't seem to go right for Llewyn, and it is mostly his fault. You see Llewyn does not have the best attitude and always relies on the generosity of others to survive. It could be crashing with his friend's girlfriend Jean (Carey Mulligan) or getting work with Jim (Justin Timberklake) to help pay his debts. No matter how bad his life can get though, Llewyn can always escape into his music.<br/><br/>I know why I love a Coen Brother's movie; to me it is just like comfort food. As in comfort food, you know what you are getting; you will get great characters, a great story, and a little added ""Coeness"" that makes their stories so special. While their movies have those central elements in common, their stories and themes are never the same. With ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" everything is there and as with ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" we get a great soundtrack to boot. Oscar Isaac is brilliant as Llewyn Davis, who learned to play guitar for this role. In fact all of the musical scenes where actually recorded live during filming for an authentic sound. Everyone has a favorite Coen movie, because no two seem to ever be alike. The only thing they have in common is they are always seem to be one of the better movies of that year, and with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" that trend remains.<br/><br/>Brian Taylor <br/><br/>read this and other reviews @ http://the2cinemen.blogspot.com/"

","This film plods along and has nothing other than a mundane message to offer: people try and sometimes lose. The main character is fundamentally uninteresting and has nothing to say and presents no unique perspective on anything. He is presented as being painfully irritable, and the effect is painfully irritating. The story goes nowhere; it stays exactly the same from the first to last frame. The best part of the movie -- the only bright spot -- is Carey Mulligan, who is excellent in her role. She is the lone interesting character with any viewpoint or personality to express, and the only saving grace for this drawn out mess. Mulligan gives a complicated, energetic and trenchant performance and deserves major credit for making this marginally watchable. The Coen brothers, however, are taking a nap on this one. The worst parts are the pointless, stilted and unconvincing musical performances (five or six full songs?) by the main character. This was done to fill (waste) time? This movie needed a full re-conceptualization and a major re-write before filming began. The actors do their best with a meandering, shallow script. Washed out, almost mono- or duo-chrome visuals, watered down storytelling, and diluted speaking parts; this is a wash out on many levels. Some good performances, some good cinematography and interesting shots, but in total a waste of time.

I am not a fan of the Coen brothers and I know them about as well as they know me. When the movie started with nifty rendition of the well known Van Ronk's Hang me I thought I thought I'd hit the jackpot. Well, nothing was farther from the truth. Although the acting was fine, the plot was so depressing that I actually felt like I was watching a nightmare. No one was happy about anything, no one accomplished anything, it just railed on about the futility of life in general. This movie (again, except for the music) is worse than boring, it's downright depressing and upsetting and detracts from my positive images and memories of the 1960's village scene.

","This screenplay seems to extend that joke to a full length film. I'm not sure if the not-so-great music in the film was supposed to be source of heart , or if it was supposed to reflect the losing formula of the character. There seems to be an intention to setup the audience for a moment of character growth for the struggling musician, only to have him turn it down, and continue struggling. These type of depressing films can work if we can sympathise with the main character. Oscar Isaac certainly is a likable actor, but we cannot sympathise at points where he acts like a jerk. I think of a lead character in a film as your friend. Because he's your friend, you will be interested in following his story. But when your friend rejects your advice and starts acting like a jerk around you, you start losing interest in his story.<br/><br/>What Coen brothers films are famous for are their side characters. Here we are treated to some fun moments, and strangely unfunny moments. By the third act, the screenplay's intentions become glaringly apparent, we the audience get to experience firsthand the rough life you go through when you are trying to survive when you are homeless. It is a serious subject, and there a multitude of real stories where in a bad economy, people become lost in finding their place in the world. The main reaction I had was that there were moments I could relate to personally, as a person who suffers from depression, so the screenplay successfully accomplishes it's purpose.<br/><br/>This film rates far better than ""A Serious Man"", another Coen brothers test that does it's best to defy audience's expectations with things like character development, and a traditional ending. I could appreciate this outing for the reason of the deliberate mood painted in poignant scenes. The expression of depression is well articulated. Going on a road trip with catatonic passengers. Fatally striking a cat with your car. Losing your job. Losing your girlfriend. Your music being rejected. Getting screwed with your old job. Losing your valuables. Like a top ten checklist of anxieties that can keep you up at night. The fact we can find humour in spots shows potential for sympathy, but on the whole I was left not wanting anything to do with a story that had no real heart or insight, like a traditional ending. I guess it was because I still believe an audience deserves some expectations fulfilled when paying to see your film.<br/><br/>I'm sure the screenwriter knows the difference. In ""No Country For Old Men"", the screenplay gives you the traditional character arc resolutions in the third act, albeit presented in a idiosyncratic way. Here, Llewyn gives little clue about where he is going, and leaves the audience feeling unfulfilled."

This is as different from True Grit as ""No Country For Old Men"" is different from ""A Serious Man"".<br/><br/>An 8 out of 10 for me.<br/><br/>And one more thing: the trailers make the movie look visually gloomy to an exaggerated extent, which is not the case in the movie theater."

The whole story with the cat was pointless. Actually the whole story was pointless. I should have known it at the start, when they had a scene with 5 minutes of this guy singing a mediocre song.

I have to say- I like simple movies, slow movies, artistic movies, movies about artists, I love 60s music, movies with 1 or 2 main characters- but this movie still didn't appeal to me.

"Hitchcoc","8","3","5","30 May 2014"," An Interesting View of a Character No More/No Less
","The Coen's sometimes make small films. They have a frame of reference that others don't. This is the story of a man. If you don't like him, that's not a problem. He is a folk singer. He is doing his thing in a time when that genre was in great demand. But he is also a self-centered, living-day-to-day jerk who leaves messes in his wake. He wants to work, but has a disdainful view of his own accomplishments. He treats people who do kindnesses for him with the same disdain that he uses on strangers. He does nothing to ingratiate himself with the people who could help him. We don't know where he is going and neither does he. He ends up hooking a ride to Chicago with a taciturn driver known only as Johnny-5. In the back is the scene stealing John Goodman. The ten or so minutes in that car are some of the very best. Goodman taunts and pokes (literally, using a cane) Llewyn, calling him Elwyn. He is absolutely brutal and yet hilarious. When Llewyn arrives in Chicago, he has a brief audition with a producer played by F. Murray Abraham, who basically tells him he's okay, but he isn't hearing any money coming from him. This leads to more sidetracking of the old career, landing on more couches, trying to get back into the Merchant Marine, and more failed efforts. I think if those who are so disdainful of this film were to look at it more closely, there is a black humor that really works. The Coens are known for that. If you think that this is a picaresque offering where the main character learns his lesson, you aren't going to get that. Remember the scene in ""Fargo"" where the guy is putting the leg in the wood chipper and is scolded by Francis McDormand. He didn't learn anything either."

","Some dramas are just plain tragedies. Thus is Llewyn Davis, flawed character. I suppose he is portrayed as the hackneyed starving artist, actor musician, plying his craft, never getting a break. But he is deeply morally flawed. His music is good but as moody as he is. He lacks good decision making skills in his choices, beside the immorality. He disses others, audiences, competing musicians. He takes advantage of friends, trudges through life and fails. He reflects badly on life and life echos that back at him. He doesn't progress spiritually, and perhaps regress and his outside world follows suit. Others are portrayed similarly, acting selfishly, achieving pathos. The experience is basically a downer, and I am trying hard to understand why it is rated so high by users and critics. I suppose because of its cutesy subtle touches here and there. (no spoilers) Nice cinematography. Great music. Well done period setting. Great feeling of depression in script, characterization, and pace. <br/><br/>I suggest going immediately afterward to see saving Mr. Banks to get lifted up again."

","Much like most other movies by the Coen's, this seemed very different to everything else they have done. Before seeing it, I expected it to be a sincere attempt at portraying a Dylan-like figure, with a heavy focus on the music itself, and also with a whole lot of nostalgia. This is kind of true, but these are not the aspects of the film that'll stay with you (even though the music was really good!).<br/><br/>There's not really much of a plot in this movie, but it's so well crafted that you hardly notice. Llewyn has a goal, but it's obvious from the start that this movie is not about reaching that goal, but rather about his every day struggle, and the life as a folk musician in an almost mythical period of music history. Llewyin is an interesting character, flawed but easy to like. His struggle feels real, and plays into an overarching theme of how your fate can be out of your hands, but also how perseverance can lead to something good.<br/><br/>The movie is similar to road movies in that it features a lot of different characters that Llewyn meets and interacts with. Some of these are very much Coen-esque, and I'm always amazed by how Coen manages to establish such layered side characters, despite them only appearing on screen briefly. Bot casting and writing must be stellar to be able to do this, and they seem to do it all the time.<br/><br/>It ends in a way that makes the movie more than just a mood piece, and opens up for some interesting discussions. Once again, they've managed to make a brilliant film."

","Well, actually no-one in this film. I loved the music though and was the last to leave the cinema - so mesmerised was I. The music took me to a tranquil place in my soul - a place I hadn't visited for ages. It gripped me and I felt so peaceful. But the story? Lame. The characters? Ugly and dull. Totally charmless. I am sure everyone wore beige. I know the Coen Brothers do weird, are weird, that is the hallmark of their films but the protagonist has little appeal unless he's singing. He is either a depressive (please get some help) or was born without a personality (so sorry). Either way, should such a charmless character appear in every scene? In similar fashion to the overrated quietly but definitely depressing and thanks-for-edging-me-ever-nearer-towards-killing-myself-Nebraska, this film is emotionally flat - the opposite of exciting (or as exciting as a hen farting).<br/><br/>Unlike the Nebraska protagonist, Llewyn hasn't lost his mind, he has one, I just wasn't emotionally invested in it. He is another loser, and with a personality like his, he will carry on losing. Like his guitar he takes it wherever he goes so no surprise as he courts rejection for the duration. So, as I was saying, everyone's ugly, wears beige or black, the moggy who is orange lends a splash of colour to this otherwise monochrome film. If you go to the cinema, like me, for escapism, this film won't cut it for you. I don't think Llewyn smiles once. Not even ironically or from spite. No smiles here. I don't think anyone actually laughs or smiles in the whole film and that makes for a very dull film in my book. The whole experience was a curious one though (typical Coen Bros), I was bored and depressed for the most part but the music floored me with its beauty. If you're all grown up and miss your dope smoking days, you will be quietly reminded of that mellow high as the music in this film will stir that feeling in your soul but an emotionally moving film this is not."

","Inside Llewyn Davis is the story of a week in the life of an emotionally drained and struggling folk song musician; he travels down a lonesome path in pursuit of his dreams, and hurts most of the people he comes in contact with. Oscar Isaac gives a fair performance as Llewyn emitting immodesty and playing some fine tunes. There's no doubt there'll be Oscar buzz for his undertaking of such a ignominious character. Nothing good comes out of him at all throughout the course of the film, and I was ready for it to end when it did.<br/><br/>We begin the film at the end of the week, where Davis is singing to a small crowd ""Hang me, oh Hang me"" and while it's clear from the beginning of the film Davis has talent he also has problems as well. He exits the cafe and without warning he is beaten by an older gentleman. The opening number and scene was rather depressing and it set the tone of the film quite well. So far I became compelled by Llewyn's talent and was eager to see where the Coen brothers would take me. Over the next 90 minutes I waited for the older gentleman to return and punch Davis in the face; his journey was tough to sit through. He makes stupid decisions, is penniless, lacks responsibility and is void of any compassion for others, even his cat, which he fails to take care for. He has one burning likable factor for the audience though; he has a passion for a career in the music business and is willing to turn against society to make a living doing what he loves. Society is the antagonist of this picture though; no one is on his side. We see some awesome faces; Justin Timberlake makes an appearance as Jim, one of Llewyn's acquaintances, but I didn't find him fitting in the part. On the other side of the supporting coin we have John Goodman as Roland Turner; an insulting Jazz musician who ridicules Davis and his brother's suicide (ouch!) The supporting parts are all nice, especially Carey Mulligan as Jean, playing the ""I'm right, you're wrong"" ex-girlfriend of his. They all fit together in one nice package of people who are not agreeable with Davis, making his struggle even harder to watch than it already is. By the end, Llewyn has done a lot of damage to himself and others and we're back in the cafe again. This time, he's got an audience and people actually like his music, but when he sings, does he have purpose? Is it true? I didn't believe so and the one true factor he had going for himself had been stripped away by his ego and I was satisfied with him being beaten in the end.<br/><br/>This movie is not all unicorns and rainbows; if you can handle the harsh film making strategies of the Coen brothers then by all means give it a go. It features exceptional cinematography and performances and will no doubt be talked about for awards season this year. As wrangling as this film was I still enjoyed it and it was worth the watch."

","There are people in the world who are, quite intentionally, their own worst enemy. This is their story. Alternately, it's about a man and his cat.<br/><br/>Like all Coen Brothers films, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a character study. Theirs is a style that takes a trait of humanity, cranks it up to 11, and puts it through its paces. In this case, they take on people who purposely sabotage their own happiness.<br/><br/>The film follows Llewyn Davis who, recklessly and tortuously, destroys his relationships at every opportunity. Time after time after time, he returns kindness with selfishness; responsibility with irresponsibility; support with abandonment. Grossly judgmental, incredibly unsympathetic, utterly foolish, this is a man who brings on his own suffering with an odd sort of sustained glee. He seems to revel in his own misery, constantly making bad decisions, and then getting mad at those who did what he told them to do.<br/><br/>This is an odd juxtaposition with his chosen artistic pursuit: folk singing. Folk singing is all about empathy and connection, but Llewyn can't empathize, and definitely can't connect. This is pointed out to him time after time after time, but he just doesn't pick up on it. At all. Therefore, he fails. He is very similar to his co-star, Ulysses, a cat who (in a very characteristically cat-like manner) seems disconnected from what is happening around him, until it's time to wake someone else up from a sound sleep.<br/><br/>It's not a bad film, there are some quirky, funny moments in it. But I gave it 7 out of 10 because it lacks that characteristic ""special heartwarming spark"" of a Coen Brothers film. ""Raising Arizona"", ""Fargo"", ""Hudsucker Proxy"", and ""O Brother, Where Art Thou"" had a heartwarming character or situation to help pull you out of the morass of darkness, intentionally acting as counter-point to the misery of life; but ""Llewyn Davis"" doesn't really have this. I suppose the cat is meant to fill this role (there is a neat little moment when Llewyn and the cat track each other's expressions quite effectively), but it doesn't really work as well as (possibly) intentioned.<br/><br/>An OK movie.

"a_chinn","10","1","1","12 August 2019"," A rather moody turn for the Coensis a folk music spiritual sequel to ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""
","Joel Coen remarked regarding the film that it ""doesn't really have a plot. That concerned us at one point; that's why we threw the cat in."" The Coens are notoriously tight lipped about their films, but this offhand remark is a pretty insightful into the type of film they intended to make with ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" Telling the story of struggling 1960s folk singer Llewyn Davis, the film ends up an ode to capturing a specific time and place, as well as a celebration of the 60s folk music scene. Oscar Isaac (""Ex Machina"" and Poe Dameron in the latest Star Wars trilogy) plays the intense Llewyn and spends the film in a wintery NYC couch surfing, trying to reach a wider audience with his music, and wanting to land a record deal or even a gig. The first couch he lands on he ends up losing the owner's cat and that becomes the main narrative thread of the film, such as it is, but the film is really about an artist so committed and uncompromising in his vision that he ends up unable to find success or an audience. Ironically, this is a trap the idiosyncratic Coen Brothers have manage to avoid, finding success in their modestly budgeted films, which has given them a level of autonomy that's allowed them to achieve their vision. There was criticism of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" by actual folk singers of this era that it wasn't an accurate depiction and that it was NOT a happy tight knit community and was more made up of competition and backbiting. Still, it's a gorgeous representation of a time and place, even if it's a bit of a fairy tale. This is the crisp wintery New York City I remember seeing in actual NYC films during this actual period, like ""A Thousand Clowns"" or ""The Pawnbroker."" The film is gorgeously photographed by Bruno Delbonnel, known for working with the likes of Jean-Pierre Jeunet, Tim Burton, and with Peter Bogdanovich on his Jazz Age tale, ""The Cat's Meow"" (the Coens' regular cinematographer, Roger Deakins, was unavailable shooting ""Skyfall""). The production design detail is dynamite! Watching the film I just wanting step onto the screen and be a part of this 1960s NYC, even if it's a fairy tale version that never existed (sort of how I also want to step onto California shore of a Beach Party movie). ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is fascinating in how it holds the viewer's attention despite the lack of a strong narrative. This is in large part thanks to the talents of Oscar Isaac as Davis, making this flawed and at times unlikable character compelling to watch for for nearly two hours, as well as the Coen's deft touch for creating a stylized atmosphere, colorful characters, and filling the film with memorable songs and soundscapes (another element they are often not given enough credit for), in what is probably their best use of music since ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake also appear in the film as successful folk singers Jim & Jean, as does Adam Driver in a funny bit part, and Coen Brothers regular John Goodman makes a memorable appearance as an obnoxious jazz musician. Overall, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" has more heart than most Coen Brothers' films and I would argue stands amongst their finest. FUN FACT! The singing voice of Mike, Llewyn's deceased music partner, is Marcus Mumford from the band Mumford & Sons, and actress Carey Mulligan's husband."
"andrewroy-04316","6","1","1","2 July 2019"," Isaac brings a realistic Davis to life, but the segments don't combine to form anything greater than an ordinary character study
","A question that's always fascinated me is: if you made a movie with all excellent technical elements - great cinematography, strong acting, good direction, and a realistic slice of life script about an ordinary person with no greater ideas in play, how would it be received? This doesn't sound too different to me from this movie, or from Boyhood, and yet both were universally acclaimed. While the quality certainly provides a floor, I do think there have to be some story, ideas, or characters to engage the audience to make it a great movie. In Inside Llewyn Davis, we get the picture of a struggling 60s musician. Isaac is extremely impressive both in the musical scenes and in portraying his complex character. We get several story threads - the cat, Jean, John Goodman in the car, and then his music and career at the end. I didn't feel that these threads tied together to create a defining idea of motif. It's undeniably well made, but is it enjoyable or do I feel any emotional attachment to Davis? Not quite, and honestly I don't even have that great a sense of his defining characteristics, aside from struggling to get by, making people mad, and caring about music. It's a slice of life movie that doesn't go anywhere or do anything new for me."

Because he's such a jerk, I found it impossible to root for Llewyn Davis, a down-on-his-luck, (some of it self created), underappreciated folk singer struggling with his messed up life and flailing career, but whenever he played guitar and sang, I couldn't help but be drawn in; his musical adeptness and passion for it was the guy's redeeming quality, if indeed he had any.<br/><br/>The story is said to incorporate anecdotes based on Dave Van Ronk's life as a folksinger in the early 1960's in Greenwich Village, playing clubs like the Gaslight Cafe, where, in the film, he sees a young Bob Dylan perform one night in what I thought was a perfect film moment.<br/><br/>The film bustles with the Coen Brother's complex character studies; creative dark humor; unexpected plot turns in the anti-hero's odyssey, (including a road trip from hell with a deft John Goodman as a heroin addicted jazz player); adroit cinematography; and a splendid soundtrack by Coen collaborator, the tremendous T Bone Burnett, which is largely filled with songs adapted from traditional folk tunes. Included in the playlist is an outstanding version of 500 Miles, sung by the trio of Justin Timberlake and Carey Mulligan, (who give delightful performances as Llewyn's friends), and Garrett Hedlund, as an up and coming star who, much to the chagrin of Llewyn, is outshining him.<br/><br/>This film is worth watching for the music alone, then add to that this finely polished ensemble of actors and intriguing filmmaking -- it's a great watch, mesmerizing and fun, though ultimately dark... definitely not uplifting."

Yes, the film has beautiful cinematography and yes, the acting is magnificent, especially by the talented Oscar Isaac. But the question 'so what?' still lingers, after watching this film. We were forced to watch a week in the life of a struggling musician who bounces from couch to couch, trying to make ends meet. At times, I even rooted for him and wanted him to get paid because he's a talented musician who's not selling out. Other times, I hated the guy with a passion. Indeed, Llweyn is a jerk but true to his work and music. The movie ends the same way it starts: will not include any spoilers here. Perhaps the Cohen Brothers are trying to show that his Llweyn will never amount to anything; perhaps, satirizing the music business: if you don't sell out, you won't succeed. So, perhaps, he will be stuck in the same predicament even after the credits roll. It is not his music that stands out, however, but his unimportant exploits that take place in various circumstances during the movie. All the characters had their fair share of Llweyn and they demonstrate their feelings throughout the movie, making us aware of his personality; a ruined relationship with Jean (Carey Mulligan), a unfortunate incident causing him to lose his friend and singing partner, and a unsympathetic manager that no longer believes in him. All those things paint the picture way ahead of everything else. It's all regarding Llweyn, and half way through the film, we've found out all we need about his persona. Although the film is shot magnificently, it accomplishes nothing, mainly due to the script's failure to become climactic. The most fascinating part of the film is the road trip that introduces us to a few characters played by John Goodman, F. Murray Abraham, and Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five. The road trip is long as we feel its length through the various shots that depict the icy cold roads of the Midwest and Llweyn's adventures. He witnesses a near death, almost gets arrested, and hits a cat with a car. overall, the film is about a man's life and how he shapes the lives of the people he impacts. His music, although wonderful, play second fiddle to his character. Inside Llweyn Davis is a visual masterpiece but the story needs more."

","** SPOILERS **<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis personally swept me away the first time I saw it and my head was swimming with the events throughout the story and the interpretations of them as I understood it. Please keep in mind as you read this that I'm speaking of art and interpretations are all they could possibly be, not anything concrete. But I have gathered that some people don't take much from the movie while I found at least the overall theme of an endless cycle to be pretty much blatant. Anywho this review is mostly for those viewers. So the most salient theme like I said is that of the endless cycle we follow Llewyn through. The relentless, crushing cycle of Llewyns life and the painful monotony of it all is only magnified by the casual way the viewer glimpses into it, as if it's inconsequential when the story starts or ends. I felt that in the last leg of the movie it was very obvious that this was simply another week in the life of Llewyn Davis. The constant familiar occurrences of a person making the same decisions in the same place, something not exclusive to a struggling musician but relevant all the same. It can be argued that none of these events are actually very significant, but simply tell Llewyns revolving story. The end is a kind of repeat of the beginning, but I feel convinced that some things may have not been there before when Llewyn experienced it. First I found that the poster Llewyn notices before his last gig seems very important. It's a movie poster that says ""The Fantastic Journey"" or something of the sort, a stimulus that to me suggests that Llewyns repetitive misadventures are not the end-all, but instead a means to an end. In other words the idea as I'm explaining it is that perhaps his story was not meaningless and it was a journey taking him to whatever's next. He plays his last gig and is socked by the same or similar goon as he was in the beginning, while Bob Dylan performs at the Gaslight, probably for the first time. If the goon represented the folk scene, or Llewyns environment in general (both of which were constantly ""kicking him down"" or whatever), then Llewyn literally says goodbye to that life at the end as the goon is driven away. This is placed perfectly with Bob Dylans performance because the monumental success of Dylans career was sure to be the final nail in Llewyns coffin. I also like to think that maybe there were signs earlier in the movie that Llewyn was staging his gradual exit. For instance, he got his shipping papers in order but there was a setback. So of course here he is playing The Gaslight again, and the cycle continues. Only now he is one big step closer to moving on and possibly, finally, being released from the cycle. So it can even be interpreted that any other week in this story is similar, but maybe peppered with these small steps. Another example of this is how he didn't let the cat out of the apartment the second time he left. Another small step. (The cat is a whole different review worth of speculation btw). Exceptional film. Perfectly executed I thought, and with a real artistic integrity. I think some people are bored by the music scenes, and I'm a musician so I really can't comment on that too objectively, but at the risk of sounding smug I can't help but say that if you didn't have the patience for the music scenes in this movie, or Treme, or things of the sort, then you really might not love music as much as you probably say you do."

","May Contain Spoilers<br/><br/>""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a film that explores many motifs in 1960's society when looking at the story of a young musical artist. From the beginning of the film, where we see Llewyn performing at the Gaslight, it is clear that his desire is musical achievement. The lyrics in Llewyn's music highlight his desire for a higher position in his musical career, and his continual efforts are shown through numerous scenes of transportation. However, as the story progresses it is clear that a larger variable is influencing his decisions. When confronted with this obstacle, we follow Llewyn in his labors of finding sustenance, whether that be monetary, physical, or emotional. While dealing with familial and other relationship issues, Llewyn's reactions and responses are frankly quite faithful to veracity. Along with his physical plight, the case couldn't be clearer. Inside Llewyn Davis delivers a harrowing and realistic interpretation of reality: Regardless of skill, one cannot achieve success independent of monetary sustenance. I find that the usage of profanity was overdone to an extent, and took away from the film. However, from genuine acting, to emotionally stout direction; this was a film experience that will leave you wordless, following Llewyn's next move as he traverses dangerous urban life as a musical artist trying to further himself. An excellent blend of musical composition and cinematographic perfection: Inside Llewyn Davis."

","Inside Llewyn Davis is an interesting exploration of what it means to be true to your art in a commercialised world. The sixties was the beginning of the recorded music revolution, so it's a great place to meditate on these ideas. Llewyn Davis our main protagonist is an egotistical folk musician, one of many minor stars being churned out in this growing industry. He is penny-less, selfish, lost and traumatised from the suicide of his singing partner. He seems enslaved by his past while running fearfully to some illusive and vague idea of success. He's a man who suffers for his creative ideals but the people he meets and serves as a musician, don't seem to be interested in art but money and status. Or is it his gloomy and selfish outlook that causes him to see things this way, its bit of a chicken or an egg question."
"MeesTW","9","1","1","29 July 2016"," Struggle
","If I had to describe this film in just one word it would be the word struggle. That's what we go through when we go inside Llewyn Davis. The struggle artists have to go through to get out there.<br/><br/>If you're a musician, a filmmaker, a writer, a poet, a painter, an animator or anything else in the creative industry then I highly recommend this film to you, to give you a possible vision of your future. Life is tough, and that's what Llewyn Davis shows us. We go through unfortunate and very relatable events with our protagonist in this story. We all had moments in our life where we screwed up. We all made mistakes and we all have said things we didn't mean to people we love. <br/><br/>Aside from this film being very relatable, it's a really well directed piece of art. <br/><br/>A thing you will notice if you're a fan of the Coen's, like myself is that this film didn't have Roger Deakins as the DP, who at the time probably was working on Prisoners. This time we get Bruno Delbonnel behind the camera's and he does a fantastic job. The lighting is very impressive, especially in the opening scene. The shot-reverse shot can also been seen a lot in this film, which makes it feel very familiar to the Coen's previous works.<br/><br/>The music, acting and overall direction is great. After I watched this, Oscar Isaac instantly became one of my favorite actors working today. John Goodman once again teams up with the Coen's and delivers a solid performance. Other actors and actresses do a good job as well, Carey Mulligan is a great singer and she is a really diverse actress. I hope she appears in more movies from the Coen's.<br/><br/>My only complaint is that the second act in this film had bad pacing. It felt like it didn't fit in with the rest of the film and it didn't do the characters a lot of justice. The third act makes up for it though.<br/><br/>Overall, I feel like this is a very overlooked film with beautiful music, great screenplay and good performances. How this has a 7.4 on IMDb is quite surprising to me, then again I can understand if some people think this movie drags, because there doesn't happen a lot aside from character interactions."
"drqshadow-reviews","7","1","1","23 July 2016"," Music Provides a Gateway to the Hidden Soul
","A somber, often morose walk through the self-imposed daily miseries of a struggling musician at the onset of the '60s folk revival. Strangely paced and often lingering, like many Coen brothers films, it's densely packed with backstory that, while only hinted, reverberates as though it had been fully explored. Llewyn carries several weights with him; a disintegrating family, several failed relationships, a constant need to seek out empty couches for the night and a personal guilt for never quite cracking the big-time. He's a cold character, quick with angry outbursts and hurtful words, but we see a hidden warmth when he wraps his arms around a guitar and steps up to the mic. The film as a whole cherishes such musical interludes, shines them like a flashlight upon each character's innermost spirit: troubled, worried, silly, it's all out in the open on the stage, no matter how guarded the individual may be away from those bright lights. The plot doesn't have a lot of direction - at the core, it's a relatively unspectacular week in the life of a nobody - and that can make it dull and plodding at times. It touches a lot of emotions, though, from laugh-out-loud funny to quietly desolate, and the quality of the music makes up for a lot of its shortcomings. A worthwhile journey, if not a spectacular one."
"midas-jacobs","9","1","1","12 June 2016"," Au Revoir
","Last night I saw this very good movie about a man who is struggling to find his place in the music industry if 1960. We get to see one week of his life. This movie was called : ""Inside Llewyn Davis""<br/><br/>The movie is directed by the masterful duo of Joel and Ethan Coen. These are not my favorite directing and screen writing duo, thought. That would be the Nolan brothers. Johnathan and Christopher. I haven't seen a lot of the Coens movies; I only saw ""No Country for Old Man"", a movie that was a bit dragging, but tense at the right moments, and ""The Big Lebowski"", a movie where the story didn't make a lot of sense, but where the jokes were on point. So after seeing those movies, I was expecting something similar. Maybe a bit boring or so? But I was completely wrong. This movie isn't boring at all! The Coens did an amazing job at directing the movie. They used a lot of steady cam, and close ups. The close ups really showed the emotion of Oscar Isaac (more on him later on in the review). The cinematography was also on point. This wasn't done by Roger Deakins, like in a lot of their movies. This time it was done by Bruno Delbonnel. The shots were all very pretty, and one scene in particular I liked. Well two. The beginning, when Oscars character walks outside, and gets beaten. And I said two, because in the end of the movie is the same scene. This is because this scene chronologically takes place after all the events of the movie, but in the beginning they want you to believe that this scene takes place before everything. That and the directing made this scene stand out for me. The acting was also great and the writing as well. What I also loved is that in the end they used other shots. But enough about that scene. The sound editing was good too. Some sound design was a bit doubtable but I still liked it. The editing overall was done fantastically. I absolutely loved it in this movie. The long takes of Oscar singing were fantastic.<br/><br/>The acting was fantastic, and due to one of the actors I decided to watch the movie. This actor was also the main actor, and this was Oscar Isaac. Last year I saw him act in two movies, where he played two totally different characters. In ""Ex Machina"" he was an asshole-ish character and he absolutely nailed it. And in ""Star Wars"" he was a very likable person, which he also nailed. Thanks to those roles I wanted to see more from him, and I so ended up with this movie. So, how was he? Bloody fantastic, I'll tell you that. He plays an interesting character and is very convincing at it too. I first didn't like him, but as the movie progresses you start to care more. His counterpart was played by Carey Mulligan. She was also very good. In the park-scene especially. The emotion in her face just feels so real. I was the most surprised by her. Justin Timberlake is also in this movie. For the second time he proves he can in fact act. He was very good. John Goodman also makes an appearance. Which wasn't really a surprise knowing this is a Coen movie. When he appeared the movie became better and better. There were some funny lines said by him and he delivers them greatly. I firstly was surprised that Garrett Hedlund acts in this movie. I firstly didn't recognize him, but also by his acting capabilities he surprised me. The only role I've seen him is was in ""Tron"", which wasn't his greatest role. In case you didn't get it, he was very good. <br/><br/>In this part I won't only talk about the screenplay, but also about the songs. So the screenplay was also written by the Coens. This is most of the time a very good part of their movies, and this time it is too. The jokes, when they are there, were funny. This was mostly dark, and subtle humor, the kind I like. I wouldn't classify this movie as a comedy, though. The normal dialogue was also very good, but sometimes the dialogue-less parts were the greatest, just because a picture can tell much more than words, especially if you have the Coens behind the camera. The characters were also very good. Like I've said was Oscars character, Llewyn, interesting. He was unpredictable at times. He had his outbursts, but that's how his ""job"" has made him. He's at the edge of everything. He has potentially made his ex pregnant, he has lost the cat he has to watch. His life has turned into a living hell. And throughout the movie you start to care about him, and feel sorry fir him.<br/><br/>Another thing that surprised me from the movie was the songs. I normally don't listen to this genre, but I absolutely loved the songs. The performances if them were handled greatly, thanks to the voice of Oscar. The lyrics also fitted his character very well. There were also some funny songs, like the Kennedy song, which, in my opinion, was also pretty good.<br/><br/>9.5/10"

"AverageSamwich","10","1","1","8 March 2016"," The best film of the 2010's so far
","Inside Llewyn Davies was one of those films that just stayed with me for days. It was by far one of the best films of 2013 and it definitely should have gotten more recognition during the awards season.<br/><br/>This film was directed by the Coen brothers (who comprise of Joel and Ethan Coen), of whom I am a big fan of as they can incorporate a large amount of different styles into the same picture.<br/><br/>The story centres on Llewyn Davies (Exquisitely played by Oscar Isaac), a budding folk singer who is trying to get out there and known in a pre-Bob Dylan Greenwich Village in the 1960's. In his words he does not want to merely 'exist'. He ends up being tangled in various different forms of problems involving his fiery ex-lover Jean, his overly complimentary friends the Gorfien's and a brilliantly over-the-top song about not wanting to go to space in a 1hr 40min escapade of very fine filmmaking. Now the Coen's have already showcased their talent for film-making as well as writing and this film feels like the most Coen brothers film yet. This film just seems to showcase all of which the Coen's are great at and for that reason I love it to pieces.<br/><br/>The Story in this film is a beautiful flowing narrative of 1 week in Llewyn's life, with none of it feeling forced or added as filler. This film can draw a lot of parallels with their 2000 film ""O Brother Where Art Thou"", with strong uses of music and also the use of the Greek Odyssey for storytelling elements. You know that part in a lot of films where the character is in complete crisis and are back to square one with seemingly no way of things going right for them? Well that is pretty much the whole of Inside Llewyn Davis but trust me, it is fantastic! Now what I loved so much about this film was how the Character of Llewyn Davis is written. He is an incredibly rude man with a short temper, strong use of profane language and a habit of ""Turning everything he touches into sh*t"". Despite this however, the audience can't do anything but feel for him, this is where the amazing use of music comes into the equation, music in this film is where we can sympathise with Llewyn and find something to like in him. Now, I think that is down to two things; 1, these are one of the only times that he seems emotionally open. And 2, how the character has been written for present day audiences, his dry and sarcastic sense of humour and the very subtle taste of contemporary style in the folk songs that he sings. This makes the audience feel the blow when he is told for what seems like the millionth time that he hasn't got what is wanted. The music is performed live which really enhances the feel.<br/><br/>Now the performances in this movie are all fantastic. Oscar Isaac really brings the dry, sarcastic, rude but endearing complex that is Llewyn but he's backed by some real talent. Carey Mulligan's beautiful and blisteringly angry Jean, Justin Timberlake's overly smiley and optimistic Jim, John Goodman's smug elitist Roland Turner and Garret Hedlund's lone wonderer are all masterfully done with hints and nuances that only heighten on the second watch.<br/><br/>The film only really has one issue with it, and that is that there is a scene where an A Capella group sing the song ""The Auld Triangle"". This scene is sold to be live, like all of the others but the group are clearly miming and I have no idea why the original group who sung the song (Punch Brothers) didn't do it live instead. As much as this did take me out of the film for a bit, it did not however dampen my thoughts on it, I still love it! I would also like to add that the film on a purely technical level is also absolutely brilliant, the cinematography is beautiful, with a slightly dulled but effective gradient being used to nicely showcase Llewyn's outlook on life.<br/><br/>This film is definitely worth checking out if you are a fan of Folk music, or interesting stories and I can't recommended it more."
"sharky_55","8","1","1","13 January 2016"," Au revoir.
","Llewyn Davis is nothing short of an asshole. Carey's Mulligan's profane-ridden rant on his due irresponsibilities immediately paints us a not so pretty picture. He makes several choices in favour of his pathetic little career, and they are selfish ones; taking off in search of representation instead of a lost cat, and leaving a sick man in a car in the middle of nowhere. He does not compromise, and that results in a wonderful scene where a goofy upbeat rendition of Please Mr Kennedy tells us so much about the three performers. Adam Driver's dopey, novelty interjections steal the scene; he is so committed to the bit with his big ears and cowboy hat, even as his side career is stagnant. Timberlake's Jim takes no embarrassment from using the gig to make ends meet, and even seems to enjoy himself (he wrote it, after all). And poor, tortured Llewyn Davis, is forced into spitting out his lyrics and muddling up the chorus. Clearly, only one person here is concerned with artistic integrity. And in a cruel twist, this turns out to be his most famous contribution, and he quickly signs away royalties. <br/><br/>Detractors have said that there is no plot, that the story is pointless. This is not true; the unveiling of the fate of his former partner is an act in itself. It is not until almost halfway through the film that we finally discover what happened, and from then on, all instances of Mike being piercing and painful. We begin to perceive, just as Llewyn does, a irreverence of talking of Mike and his fate. A harmony that should be long gone creeps up on him and he finally explodes. The cruellest blow comes after an achingly heartfelt audition for Bud Grossman, which is received with a painfully realistic damnation. In a double blow, he suggests that he reform with his deceased partner, as if the music is not good enough. But what exactly causes Llewyn to concede reality in the car with a loud and demeaning John Goodman? There's a sort of communal acceptance within the music community. They crash on each other couches. They ride together to far away cities, hoping to catch that big break. When Llewyn heckles that poor old lady near the end, he shatters this and is ejected. But what is even more amazing is that he is performing there the very next night. That's all he's got, but it's plenty to go around. <br/><br/>He floats from place to place - existing, he calls it. It must be with total and utter defeat that he resigns to once again ship out with the merchant marine. Some have suggested the cat as a device to mimic his endless wandering; as the poster states, to travels hundreds of miles, but to end up where he most belongs. One of the most heartbreaking moments is his realisation that a former girlfriend has taken off with his son and never even told him. Life has not waited for him. Later, he makes the conscious decision against visiting. Isaac internalises this grief, and trudges on through the snow (as a clear path is right next to him). He looks good and honest Jim in the eye, even as he has impregnated his girlfriend. He endures a furious yet pitiful glare from his sister, whom has a family and a life, which means suffocation. <br/><br/>I have 2 minor criticisms. The first is the sort of ghostly, ethereal glow that seems pervasive in every single shot of the film. Delbonnel seems to suggest a glum, crestfallen atmosphere to match Llewyn's, but what it really does is provide a bloom-like effect that softens all the rough edges of these characters and situations. These bars should be musky and grimy and lived in, but what the effect does is romanticise. The second is a problem that would not have existed in O Brother Where Art Thou, because that was a predominately larger than life fantasy, and even the scariest scene had a sort of ridiculousness to the way the Ku Klux Klansman paraded around. Here, the touches of humour need to be deftly placed, because it takes rock bottom for Llewyn to resort to a resigned snark in his dialogue. The problem arises in the editing. The first example is when Llewyn performs for his father, and the lyrics are full of these ideas about death and mortality and growing old, and we get these pensive reaction shots that make it seem like a profound moment. The error is jumping ahead to the humorous reveal, instead of simply lingering and letting Llewyn discover it for himself and subverting a precious moment. The second example, less prominent, is his outburst in the bar where it quickly cuts to him being shoved outside. It seems these edits are afraid to let a scene and its emotions boil over and develop naturally. <br/><br/>The repeated beginning and ending, with the same events, seem to suggest a cyclical nature of Llewyn's life. He is doomed to continually miss his chance, his opportunity, to be overlooked for younger and brighter stars that can connect with the audience unlike him. He spends his company with the same sort of folk, each belting out their tunes to a world that has already moved on. The brief final glimpse of Bob Dylan foreshadows a boom in folk music, but not in the way that would favour Llewyn. But there is change. A bleak, hopeless outlook, but as he sings what once was a duet, emotional catharsis has shaped something new. The music comes out different now."

","This is quite simply a masterpiece and the Cohen Brothers finest work. Outstanding performances and nice cameo roles. This is a great film for someone who appreciates good cinema and not your run of the mill high budget Hollywood nonsense. The music is probably the best I've heard in a feature film for a long time. I highly recommend this film for fans who appreciate real cinema. A slow burner but instantly has a Cohen Brothers feel to the movie. I'm guessing the Oscars snub for this film for best actor was because the lead was not very likable and not a very nice guy I guess and the Oscar panel like to play it safe and unless you are an American hero you won't be nominated. In my eyes Oscar Issac had produced the performance of his life and should be very proud of his achievement as so the Cohen brothers."
"JohnnyWeissmuller","8","1","1","25 October 2015"," Play it Again, Llewyn
","The Coen brother's Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of its titular character and his woes on the Greenwich Village folk scene during a week in 1961. Starring Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis, the Coens have fashioned a character whose social inadequacies and inability to communicate are his downfall in life and on the music scene. He's talented, but despite the kindness of others, remains stuck in a cycle of despair that leads him from one couch to another. Davis is one of the Coen's more aloof and unlikable central characters; throughout the film he's rarely inviting and, in the snubs and scowls at his friends and colleagues, he's difficult to gauge and remains largely impenetrable. This may be a drawback for some, but I found his story to have a strong allure, especially with the Homeric narrative and vibrant undertones that reveal themselves in the way one may become familiar with a new album. The cinematography is quite splendid here also, and is important to mention, because the colour palette and use of browns and greens make this film look like an old album cover. This is also reflected in the framing of some scenes, whilst there's a certain nod to The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan; something Cameron Crowe also done in Vanilla Sky. In support are Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman, all of whom are memorable in small roles -- Mulligan and Timberlake play a singing couple called Jim and Jean, with the smiling and well-liked Jim being very much the antithesis of Davis. Even when Jim isn't present in the film, he's spoken about in such a way that it's easy to appreciate the subtleties of Timberlake's performance and how it resonates against Isaac's. Mulligan is more scathing, being almost as harsh as Davis, but with good reason, and although Goodman's role is small, it's pivotal given the choices present when Davis is given a touch of his own medicine. Importantly, the music here is quite splendid throughout -- some songs are written and performed with tongue firmly in cheek, such as Please Mr. Kennedy, whilst there's sincerity present given the quality of the music's production and the songs having been sung live in every instance bar one. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of the Coen brothers finest films to date, which is no mean feat, although it's not their most accessible and, much like it's central character, there's depths to be found despite an aloof nature."
"punishmentpark","8","1","1","22 May 2015"," ""So did you bring your dick along too?""
","A second viewing of 'Inside Llewyn Davis' did not leave me as impressed as the first time. The squabbles between Llewyn and Jean felt rather inane; ""It takes two to tango"" must be the appropriate bottom line there especially when in the end, Jean seems to have no problem sleeping with Pappi just for a gig. Then there's the casting of Oscar Isaac, who does not resemble a New Yorker with Welsh roots at all, as far as I can tell. The'incredible journey', as a movie poster in the film suggests at some point, was not all thát incredible.<br/><br/>But, with all that being said, 'Inside...' is still a pretty good, somber and moody piece of slow cinema, taking place in an interesting era in America. The songs are all well done, the supporting roles are just fine (John Goodman's is near perfect even), and Oscar Isaac carries the lead with verve - even if it is hard at times to feel compassion for this wayward wanderer. I read that both his character, based on the actual Dave Van Ronk, and the portrayal of The Village in New York at that time, were very much subject to the artistic interpretation of the Coens. So be it, it is still an atmospheric trip through time.<br/><br/>A solid 8 out of 10, with which I have come to the end of my trip through the Coens oeuvre from 1984 to 2013. I'm not much looking forward to their upcoming effort 'Hail Caesar!' - due to a mostly unpromising cast - but I will at least try the trailer when it's out, and take it from there."
"Quinoa1984","10","1","1","11 November 2014"," the Chilly Blue palette of the folk of NYC
","Once you get used to the washed-out, chilly-blue color scheme, it's another sad-funny tale from the Coens, mostly sad for how much life, bad luck and sometimes his own choices kicks the (albeit sometimes d*ckkish) downtrodden folk singer Llewyn Davis in the teeth. He's a captivating protagonist, possibly for all the wrong reasons (in another hands): he's not a 'cool' person to be around most of the time, he's prickly, he doesn't get along very well with the women in his life (well, certainly one, played by Carey Mulligan, her very best work yet, like revelatory), and yet he's very talented and has some soul.<br/><br/>But it's a soulful film, about a subject that doesn't get touched on enough which is the creative person who just can't seem to breakthrough. What happens to those who have the good stuff but can't get to that one next step, or connect with a wide audience like some of Davis' other contemporaries do? What happens when the Man With The Keys that can get you into the business says, ""I don't see a lot of money here?"" As a creative person/artist myself, this movie had the air of a documentary in that sense. Well... Bob Dylan can rip you off, apparently.<br/><br/>Oscar Issac gets his breakthrough here, I must add. He makes this guy compulsively watchable and even if we don't always like him he is a real person, he's someone with a lot of warts and Isaac doesn't shy away from showing that (via the Coens' blisteringly comic/dramatic script). And for all the moments that spark out as being piercingly funny - any of John Goodman's scenes, talk about stylized, over-the-top dialog being performed with just the hint of humanity and devilishness - it's more drama than comedy. There's a scene where Davis goes to see his father, who isn't doing too well. How this unfolds, how the shots go between father and son as he plays him a song, you almost want to cry watching it. If it's not one of, you know, the Coen's top 5 best or whatever that means, it's an impressive, quality film that will last and be a kind of genuine document of that period in 1960/1961 when folks was a thing that could matter.<br/><br/>And the morale of the story is.... take good care of your cat."

","""Life is a journey"", but if you see anything romantic in that statement, you are not Llewyn Davis. It almost appears like he is on the verge of loving his art, - but without this love he is going nowhere fast. He sings his heart out but is his heart really in it, or is he just trying to scrape a few nickels together; keep on keeping on until he achieves some version of success in the music world? <br/><br/>But I wonder if the desperation portrayed in this movie is merely applying today's negative image of a penniless couch-surfer onto what was a more dynamic, and younger 1960's Greenwich - where musicians sleeping on couches might have been the norm - and might not have been such a bad time (especially if you factor in the marijuana which the movie completely overlooked). In any event, if you're not having fun doing it, maybe you're not in it for the right reasons. The script seemed designed to extract as much emotional punishment out of each scene as possible. Don't worry, this isn't the suffering of child-laborers in Africa. In the end we're supposed to care for an under-appreciated artist - amongst many - trying to make the world a better place, hopefully, like an artist should. Good to acknowledge that. History has lost masterpieces, no doubt. ""Without the flower the branch shall die""<br/><br/>Strange situations and strange people materialize in fun Coen brothers fashion, and we have to draw out some important symbolism. Characters emerge but are left - like his past - not fully developed or explained. This one's got a little of the blues in it. You are better off rooting for the cat."

","I'm a big Coen brothers fan. I also knew Dave Van Ronk and the Village scene in the 60s. While I have no problem with the story, I thought the casting and production was terribly lacking. In those excellent films about recording artists, there is an effort to capture the quality and ""voice"", if I may, of the singer. For example, ""Ray"", and ""The Buddy Holly Story"", others come to mind.. Even if you had never seen or heard those performers before, you would recognize them if you did after watching those films.<br/><br/>That is not the case here. Oscar Isaac as as much like Dave Van Ronk as Cher is like Aretha Franklin. To me, knowing and sitting with Dave Van Ronk, that is a great disservice to his unique and captivating talent. If this film was just about the folk scene in N.Y. in the 60s, it would be a valuable contribution to the Coen Brothers body of work. But making it about a particular performer, and then ignoring that performer's style, voice, and ability.. it really didn't work for me. (The Clancy Brothers was just abysmal. I can't fault T Bone as I know he had nothing to do with casting; but knowing T Bone's work, I can't help but think he was cringing at these performances.) If you are a Coen Brothers fan and know little of the topic, watch the film. If you are a folk music fan and know the work of the people represented in this film.. perhaps you might want to grit your teeth before wading in."

","It's 1961 in Greenwich Village. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a struggling folk singer who lost his musical partner Mike to suicide. His new solo album isn't selling but then neither is anything else he did with Mike. He stays at his friends the Gorfeins but the cat gets locked out. Then he visits his friends Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). She tells him that she's pregnant possibly by him. And Llewyn's life keeps drifting on.<br/><br/>Brother filmmakers Ethan and Joel Coen have brought something different with this original character in this unique era. It's beautifully filmed as usual. Oscar Isaac is a newcomer and an unknown. He fits this character very well. He has a drifter musician quality to him. Carey Mulligan takes a hilarious turn with her angry performance. The movie has a mellow and rambling vibe. It also has its big moments. The music is awright but nothing exciting. It's a man slowly drifting in the world as his musical career tries to stay afloat."

","As a child my family's long, fractious car trips to the seaside in the 1970s would invariably be calmed by long stretches of old sea shanties, ballads and gentle calypsos from Livepool-based folk group The Spinners. So the world lovingly sent up in this gentle, lo-fi film seems very familiar to me.<br/><br/>Llewyn Davies is just another struggling folk singer in a Greenwich Village that is so choked with them that it must have been like being a country singer in Nashville today. What he sings sounds pretty good – sometimes really good. But his music is starkly at odds with the chaos and the casual wrongness of his life. As the film develops you learn just how wrong it is, just how broken, and his erstwhile singing partner Mike's role in his trajectory becomes increasingly important.<br/><br/>Sometimes it felt like this film was little more than an auteur exercise in making you care about someone whose charms, perhaps were mostly superficial. It's pretty effective at that – even when my expectations were being smashed, Coen-style, I did realise that I was starting to care about what happened to this man. There are a million million musicians out there and very few make anything like a solid career out of it. ** Small spoiler** It starts to seem increasingly clear that this musician, despite his nicely crafted material, just doesn't have that transcendent look of being willing to do anything to play – of really not caring whether you like it or not.<br/><br/>I think the Coens had a lot of fun with this film – kicking off their shoes and relaxing at the expense of the boho 60s Greenwich Village set, of folk music in particular, of all the Llewyn Davies' out there, and of every film ever made in New York. I saw glimpses of ""Breakfast at Tiffanys"" and ""Manhattan"", ""Funny Face"" and cinematography in gorgeously muted tones, that brought to mind a number of great available-light films from the late 60s/early 70s Golden Age. But there's a lot of love, for the music, for the genre and for the city.<br/><br/>The folk satire feels pretty spot on, an able ensemble cast drawing the latent comedy from the scenario. I loved Jean and Jim's hilariously cutesy double act, the marvellous Arran sweaters of the Irish quartet, the pretentious audiences, and there are even pointers to that nasal, trumpet-like ""I can't sing but I'm going to anyway"" folk style, still much beloved in British folk circles even today, and of which Bob Dylan was certainly a signed-up member. I remember a (BBC) radio documentary once where an African American musician said of Dylan, ""he did not have what we in the black community would call a Strong Voice, but we all took notice when he had a new record out."" So the fact that I'd rather listen to the fictional Llewyn Davies' pretty, evocative ballads than to Dylan's horn-like dirges misses the point – who made that contemporary audience feel that something new was happening? Who took it to the next level?<br/><br/>Ultimately this film is all about small, nicely observed iconoclastic moments. But I wouldn't get a budding young musician to watch it."

The movie just repeats itself. From the trailer it seemed great, though it's not. I have no explanation as to why this movie had such high reviews from critics and IMDb users.

","I know nothing about the folk music scene in early 1960s New York, yet I found this film engaging, funny, thought-provoking, and moving. The Coen Brothers can be a bit arch at times, and there are hints of clever-clever in Llewyn's (Oscar Isaac) fraught relationship with Jean (Carey Mulligan), but in the end one is left with the sense of a serious and intelligent story with plenty to say about the nature of the music 'biz' back then and now – the Moebius strip narrative structure is there for a reason.<br/><br/>The title character is a struggling musician, recently forced to become a solo act following the suicide of his buddy. Homeless in winter, despondent about his existence yet passionate about his craft, he sofa-hops his way from day to day. He wants to be taken seriously, but no one seems to understand him, inside or outside The Business.<br/><br/>The Coens lucked out with their lead man. Isaac is a talented musical performer and a subtle actor. From Barton Fink to The Man Who Wasn't There, the brothers like to throw their ostensibly passive protagonist into a Mad Hatter's Tea Party of a world, and obsess over amusing minutiae whilst alluding to vast themes of fate, integrity, and free will. Here, Llewyn is drawn toward his destiny by a runaway cat called Ulysses. Along the way, we encounter a variety of cameos, from the likes of John Goodman (obviously), F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake. I had the sense that each represented a different aspect of the essential conflict at the heart of Llewyn's journey: between personal integrity and simply making a living.<br/><br/>Crucially, the music is fantastic, and each song – whether a ballad from the man himself, a comedy pop record, or a quartet sea shanty – is given time to play out in full. It never feels like the Coens are sniggering at the perceived quaintness of the period.<br/><br/>On the outside, this film has the qualities of a comedy; but it's an absurdist humour which leaves a tragic aftertaste. Don't expect the screwball madcap of Intolerable Cruelty or Burn After Reading. Inside Llewyn Davis is closer in tone to A Serious Man – except this the more accessible film, and probably the brothers' warmest film to date."

Van Ronk was, among other things, a merchant marine, a jazz musician and an influential folk performer and guitar arranger.<br/><br/>The plot of your movie was genuinely less-than-zero. Llewellen gets two girlfriends pregnant and he discovers that his current squeeze, or current-ex, has been screwing around with several guys, behind his back. And thus more wimpy whining from Llewellen.<br/><br/>And the MUSIC in this film genuinely sucks., Except fro one song in one moment in this long, self-indulgent tedious movie, what music there is is really grating and purposefully BAD and annoying--whether it is untypically nasal Irish keening or something else. The only listenable music in the whole film is one exact copy of a Van Ronk recording.<br/><br/>T-Bone Burnette did a great job of making and collecting the music for ""Oh Brother Where Art Thou"" and the soundtrack for that has lasted much longer than that movie itself. But whatever input Burnett had to the music for this ""Llewellen"" film must have been minimal.<br/><br/>The viewer--and listener--gets the impression that the Coen Brothers either HATE folk music, or else they are very JEALOUS of folk musicians and wanted to make a movie to put them down or make them look stupid.

","This is an incredible film and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute of it, including the credits. I was immensely pleased by this movie and no amount of trailers could have prepared me for the full experience. <br/><br/>I should warn that anyone who doesn't enjoy either slow movies or folk music will probable not like this film as much as the next person. The Coen style of dark humor is prominent throughout the film, albeit very drawn out. I think it's appropriate for the support of the protagonist's struggle. <br/><br/>The color process, and scenes filmed are generally dim and void of any bright colors like orange, yellow, or red. They have a soft focal effect and much of the movie has a cold feeling. (besides being filmed in winter) Many of the shots are serene and beautiful in a very simple kind of way, which I appreciate because the it lets the film focus on the musical experience and marries the two into something incredibly original.<br/><br/>The last time I had my emotions thrown as much was when I watched ""Her"". That movie deeply upset me and I neither laughed not cried... that's another review. This film made me laugh and cry throughout. By the end, I was... I couldn't describe the type of laugh I had between the tear of joy streaming down my face. <br/><br/>Do you love music? Are you a musician? Are you an artist... any kind? Do you have a primal struggle? Do you feel your life is crap? Do you like cats? Hell, are you a sucker for having a laugh/cry alone in front of your big screen for a quality movie because you already have a bias for all Coen films to be gold... you don't even need this review! <br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film if you answered yes to any of those questions.

","Inside Llewyn Davis is a case study in the beautifully bleak; A gorgeous accrual of the damned unlucky. The fortunes of Llewyn Davis go from bad, to worse, to the awkwardly oppressive; to holy HECK whose temple have you desecrated? The opening scene is immersive. A shallow focus makes pointed commentary as we edge into contact with the protagonist. His eyes are shut to reality. Everything in ""King Midas's idiot brother's"" reach is blurred, undetermined, unstable. The camera flutters over a stilled audience, ash slumps from a cigarette: a testament to Oscar Isaac's eerily stunning performance. Yet this illusory solace is not given licence to last. The scene ends with Llewyn Davis in the gutter, having being subjected to an unexplained assault. Thus ensues a deliriously convoluted anti-plot; a gluttonous indulgence in structural perversion. Inside Llewyn Davis is remarkably open. The glory of the Coens' direction is that the audience is granted the respect to interpret the poetic pit stops as they please. And my-oh-my there is a veritable feast of symbolism on which to chew. One notably meaty motif is the cat, inarguably the cutest exercise in thought provocation à la feline since Breakfast at Tiffany's. Although admirably pernickety in its devotion to period and place, Llewyn Davis' plight is universal, and smattered with moments which tease dark mirth from the painfully blunt. The Coens' deftness of direction filters levity into depth with harrowing immediacy. Yes, this movie is funny. And it traverses many shades of humour. From the space race schmaltz satire ""Please Mr Kennedy"" (Adam Driver I enjoyed you, and that's not just my inner Girls fan talking), to Carey Mulligan's lesson in awkward swearing, to the house pleasing ""Where's its scrotum?"" I challenge you not to giggle in the midst of the morose. Inside Llewyn Davis is a bittersweet ode to the greyness of life; a quality Mirrored in the muted pastels of Bruno Delbonnel's Oscar nominated cinematography which is not only atmospheric, but meditates on Davis' story, making observations of its own. Further praise, goes to the cast. Oscar Isaac is the newly patented face of bitterness. But everyone, and I mean EVERYONE, packed a punch. Watch this movie."
"bobsgrock","Null","3","6","14 January 2014"," Llewyn's The Odyssey
","After finding the greatest mass-culture success and reaction with their searing, post-modern Western No Country for Old Men, the Coen brothers seem to have been on a journey throughout their last four films. As always flouting the expectations of audiences and studios, they went at the pace and direction in which they felt most comfortable. This resulted in a high-energy, excitingly quirky and sometimes violent comedy; a most studious portrayal of a man in 1967 struggling with the greatest Jewish questions; and a straight-on genre piece made with the finest touch of cinematic craftsmanship available. Do any of these projects have a connection? At their basest, one could surmise they all are about the characters' intentions of finding home. This, of course, is a word used so often as to be overstated, yet the meaning has become so varied it can apply to almost anyone and anywhere. Now, the Coens go to a spiritual home of sorts for so many cultural figures in the early 1960s: Greenwich Village.<br/><br/>Intentionally set just before one young man from Minnesota came to New York and shook the whole scene out of its self-conscious doldrums, the story follows the titular character floating amongst acquaintances, sympathizers and fellow musicians as he attempts to put together his own career after a tragic loss. As has been noted, this is a great set-up for the cliché rags-to-riches story, yet the Coens are far too intelligent and savvy for that. They said they began writing the screenplay with the image of folk singer Dave Van Ronk being beaten outside the Gaslight Cafe after a concert, which is what happens to Llewyn Davis. He receives just about everything a down-on-his-luck artist could: physical and emotional beatings which leave him alienated from just about everyone. In most other stories of this kind, this would provide the artist with the perfect opportunity to dig deep within himself and find exactly what was missing previously from his output, resulting in the breakthrough success he was searching for all along. Yet, Llewyn's problems either go too deep or he is in the wrong business at the wrong time. <br/><br/>Like all their films, the Coens show a masterful ability to synthesize exquisite imagery, eccentrically memorable supporting roles and a bleakness that worms its way into your soul. Here, the bleakness comes out the complexity Llewyn Davis gives to the audience. Never ones to make a statement about how we should feel about their characters, Llewyn might be the Coens' fullest and most thriving creation on their resume. A bile-filled, slightly narcissistic, handsome rogue, Oscar Isaac plays him as almost upset by his own actions yet perhaps unable to stop himself from self-destructing. Trying to apologize to an ex-girlfriend, attempting to dine with intellectual supporters, even preparing to perform for a seemingly generous audience; all these instances are pure examples of Llewyn Davis' astonishing ability to screw himself over. He knows the consequences of his actions as soon as he says or does whatever it is, yet there is not necessarily a lack of sympathy for this man. He is an artist, struggling to find not only his voice but his purpose in finding his voice. Should this life-changing decision he has made be a defining time in his life, or is he still drifting, forever doomed to be unattached and undefined?<br/><br/>Other supporting roles are almost as superb as Isaac. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake as a performing duo who reluctantly help Llewyn out in various ways; Ethan Phillips and Robin Bartlett as the academic couple who think they are helping Llewyn by treating him as fodder entertainment for their friends; and John Goodman as a corpulent, slightly sinister jazz musician who reminds one of Robert DeNiro in Angel Heart. His condescension and constant put-downs of both Llewyn and the folk scene express many peoples' feelings as well as perhaps Llewyn's self-hatred of what he has become. <br/><br/>Constantly on the outside looking in, folk music was at this time struggling to maintain its existence amidst the Red Scare but also the up-and-coming rock and roll scene burgeoning throughout the United States. Traditionally, Bob Dylan has been hailed as the savior of this genre, yet just like the concept of home this may be overstated. In the end, with a new figure emerging on the scene effectively rendering him obsolete, what may be most important for Llewyn is the future, rather than the present. His ex tells him he has no concept of the future and he counters by telling her she has no concept of the present. Perhaps they are both right about one another, but as it turns out, which side of this argument would it be worse for Llewyn to come out on? Presumably, the struggle maintains itself for as long as he tries to express it through music. For him, home may be just a five-letter word."

","1960s folk music had a message and often expressed hope and sometimes even joy. It's too bad that ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (R, 1:45), a movie about a fictional folk singer in the early 60s doesn't seem to understand that.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac plays the title character, a singer with talent who can't quite catch a break. Even when he seems on the verge of something good happening to him, it either doesn't pan out or he blows it up. He keeps on trying to succeed, in spite of it all, but as an audience member, I was hard pressed to root for him. You see, Llewyn is completely self-absorbed and joyless. He floats from couch to couch in New York City, staying with friends until he wears out his welcome and has to move on to the next temporary bed, but rarely expresses gratitude. He even manages to alienate some of the few friends he has. He's also constantly trying to borrow money, insulting friends and family in the process.<br/><br/>You'd think that, as hard as he works and as much as he sacrifices for his art that he would have a passion for it, but none is apparent. He never seems to get any pleasure from performing his own music and even gets angry when he is asked to sing a song for friends. The only true friend he has is a cat that keeps popping up in the film, but Llewyn is ambivalent towards the animal, especially when it needs him the most. Things start looking up for Llewyn when he comes into a little cash, which he uses to pay for his share of the gas in a car pool going to Chicago, where he hopes to get a job, but the film doesn't offer a resolution to that part of the story. There doesn't seem to be resolution to much of anything in Llewyn's life, or in this movie.<br/><br/>""Inside Llewyn Davis"" features some good covers of original 60s folk music and a bit of new music but that's about the only nice thing I can say about this movie. Oscar Isaac's performance is uninspired (although he does sing several of the songs in the soundtrack) and some great actors (including Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and F. Murray Abraham) are wasted in this film. They're given little to do and don't seem to want to be there. How can a celebration of 60s folk music be so short on celebration? Joel and Ethan Coen, who, as with most of their movies, share writing and directing credits, made their similarly-themed ""Oh Brother, Where Art Thou?"" somewhat entertaining, but seem to have had all their fun with that one. There sure isn't any on display in this depressing exercise. It seems to me that almost as bad as actually being Inside Llewyn Davis is being inside a theater showing ""Inside Llewyn Davis"".<br/><br/>To be fair, I should point out that some other moviegoers seemed to enjoy this movie very much, although I'm at a loss to understand why. Somehow, this film snagged Golden Globe nominations for Best Motion Picture – Comedy or Musical and Best Performance by an Actor – Comedy or Musical. I didn't realize that 2013 was such a slow movie year. The film also received a nomination for Best Original Song, but I agree with that one. The scene showing the recording of the whimsical ditty ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" and some of the other music is what's keeping me from giving this flick an ""F"". The most I can give this cinematic dud is a ""D""."

","In true Coen Brothers style, Inside Llewyn Davis is five hundred miles away from their last film, True Grit. Unlike the tense revenge western that True Grit was or the screwball comedy that was Burn After Reading, Inside Llewyn Davis is surprisingly down to earth which is refreshing change of pace as today's film market seems to be filled with over blown Hollywood disasters and it is nice to see directors like the Coen's, Scorsese and Winding Refn that don't feel like they have to cater to the lowest common denominator as Llewyn Davis is one of the most genuine, subdued films of the new century. Despite this, Inside Llewyn Davis keeps the quirky and sharp dialogue you are likely to find in any of the Coen's films is still present and correct. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac of Drive fame stars as the eponymous Llewyn Davis (it's Welsh), a down on his luck folk singer who is just trying to find fame whilst barely scarping by. Davis, in true Coen fashion is, no loser, no two ways about it and Isaac plays it with convincing subtly. All the other actors are extremely competent as well. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake star as folk duo Jim and Jean and John Goodman in what is possibly his best role yet as Roland Turner a crippled yet articulate jazz musician who Davis hitches a ride with to get to Chicago. Each of the actors play their roles with their own style of performance. Mulligan plays Jean as a bitter, spiteful woman who cares little for anyone apart from herself and her partner Jim. Timberlake however plays Jim as a caring individual who just wants the best for Isaac's Davis. Goodman however completely steals the show in a role in what could easily have been a cameo but the Coen's expertly extended the role in what culminates to be some of the films best scenes. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is the Coen's best film since Fargo and much like Fargo; Inside Llewyn Davis combines stunningly distinct characters with a compelling story that is very loosely based on a true story or real people. All this makes Inside Llewyn Davis one of the greatest subdued masterpieces ever made and if you only see one Coen Brother's film in your life, make it this one."

But over and over again, all of his experiences and relationships fall away into nothingness, and his music never captures audiences thirsty for the music that moves them.<br/><br/>That's because, Inside Llewyn Davis, is nothing at all. This is brilliantly laid out by the Coens, when Davis goes on a quest to find a Chicago music manager, who might get his career back on track. The manager asks him to play something from his album (oddly enough, the same title as the movie). What does he find? An empty shell, albeit a talented one.<br/><br/>This movie is brilliantly filmed, richly layered with characters, and perfectly plausible as a true story. But this is all just a vehicle for a singular Coen message: if you don't care about anything in this world, if you don't engage life, embrace others, develop meaningful relationships, develop yourself as a human being, then all the talent and opportunity in the world won't help you - your life will be nothing more than a tormented waste of time.<br/><br/>It's a message for the ages, a warning for today's society, a truth that time cannot destroy, cloaked in romance and wonder at the dawn of the most dramatic cultural awakening in North American history.<br/><br/>So, if you're looking for something deeper, not satisfied with explosions, happy endings, and worn-out clichés; if you want a movie that will make you reflect on your own life in a way that might make you clutch to those you care about just a little bit closer, then I recommend you take the ride, and see this film."

","'Inside Llewyn Davis' has quite a small scope: a week in Greenwich Village in 1961 (based on the Dave Van Ronk memoir - DVR released an album called 'Inside Dave Van Ronk') with a short excursion to Chicago: in the dark, which isn't much cinematic bang for your buck these days. But it's definitely a Coen Brothers movie, with all the rich black humour, mystery and tragedy that implies. Quite Barton Fink in places.<br/><br/>Llewyn is an also-ran folksinger on the Village scene who's a complete ratbag; in the first ten minutes he gets beaten up for heckling another performer, loses his university-professor patrons' prize ginger tomcat, and discovers his dead partner's widow is pregnant (possibly not by him). The movie is actually a flashback leading up to the beating, as he couch- surfs and hustles his way from the Gaslight Club to Columbia Records to the Merchant Seaman's Union. Via Chicago.<br/><br/>Of course, you expect the Coens to have been clever, and what is clever is the way that Llewyn (Oscar Isaac, the only Oscar this will get) actually performs his very downbeat folksongs full length in a completely convincing way, except that as Albert Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) in Chicago says, 'I don't see a lot of money here'. Benjamin Pike as the 'young Bob' at the end, and playing over the credits, is actually refreshing and pleasant after Llewyn's self-absorbed misery.<br/><br/>Is Llewyn suffering from grief at the recent suicide of his partner Jim, who jumped off the George Washington bridge? Is Llewyn headed the same way? Is John Goodman really a master of the black arts, able to control Llewyn's life remotely? This is what the Coens do - they put questions in your mind all the time, and don't usually bother to answer. Which is fine by me, I just want to watch ILD again and soon."
"Sergeant_Tibbs","9","3","7","2 January 2014"," A tribute to every aspiring artist in the world.
","It's been three long years since the Coen brothers were enjoying their second peak of their career with the 1-2-3 strike of No Country For Old Men, Burn After Reading and A Serious Man. While True Grit garnered similar acclaim, it simply hasn't held up for me as much, though it does have some worthwhile aspects. I'm overjoyed to see them explore something original that they clearly care passionately for as music is such a key part of their films. Inside Llewyn Davis has a cynical but honest thesis. Not every talented artist makes the green. It's a film that not only makes you think about the origins of folk songs, where the frustrations of surviving feeds into the performance, but also all the great art the world has missed because they don't get exposure. Fortunately, the Coens don't have that problem and they're free to share this fascinating idea with us, as if they're accepting how lucky they are in the film industry.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is like a mix of O Brother Where Art Thou in the focus on music with A Serious Man in its thoughtful deconstruction of conventional storytelling. Plot threads start in the middle, some subplots don't even conclude. It deliberately goes nowhere, mirroring Llewyn Davis' rocky path in life. It's cinematic, but it feels true to life. However, that lack of plot is a blessing and a curse. Even though the film is already relatively short at 100 minutes, it needed some significant trimming. There's too many scenes which didn't feel like they affected Llewyn besides as merely physical obstacles to his doomed goal, particularly John Goodman's character. Granted, in typical Coen fashion, the comedic timing of their side characters is an absolute joy, particularly Stark Sands, Adam Driver and the bark and bite of Carey Mulligan. But this is the Oscar Isaac show.<br/><br/>Despite a challenging and short role, he was a highlight in Drive. For a character I expected to hate, he was surprisingly likable. Ostensibly he was born to play Llewyn Davis. Although he can be mean-spirited, short-tempered and egotistical at times, he's sincere and not delusional, so downtrodden yet determined that we can't help but support him. He's the spokesman for any aspiring artist and watching his dedication and heartfelt passion is satisfyingly reassuring. Only the Coens could get away with a script like this. A character-driven story about a loser who goes nowhere twice. I read it beforehand out of curiosity a few months ago but I wasn't too impressed given its sloppy economy and use of jump cutting. It was entertaining, but not as thought-provoking as the end film. Fortunately their sharp editing of the film makes it more dynamic and the witty lines shine through. It's certainly one of their funniest films in a long time.<br/><br/>However, it still struggles with pacing a little bit, especially as its third act seems to linger rather than payoff. It's surprisingly entertaining and quietly poignant in moments that cut to Llewyn's core. The selection of songs makes it a better experience too, especially their perfect choice of recurring songs in ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" and ""Fare Thee Well."" The original song ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" is ridiculously catchy too. I wasn't sure about the cinematography from the early trailers. It looked too washed out and post-processed even though I loved Bruno Delbonnel's work with Jean-Pierre Jeunet. It grew on me however, especially in incredible wide shots. That rich atmosphere feels like an eternal winter. The Coens have created a wonderful portal to a compelling and creative period, but it's not one I would want to live in, just visit 100 minutes at a time.<br/><br/>8/10"

","A story about a struggling folk singer in Greenwich Village in the early '60s would have to make for a good movie, especially in the hands of the Coen brothers. Somehow, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" doesn't end up as such. The problem is mainly that Llewyn Davis remains a loser and doesn't learn anything from his experiences. But more importantly there's no focus on the folk movement's politics. Their anti-war, pro-Civil Rights stances should be a major focus of any movie about them. This movie is mainly about the main character's crashing on friends' couches while finding time to sing. In the end I was not impressed with it. I guess that I hold the Coens to very high standards, and so when they disappoint, they REALLY disappoint. I don't recommend it."

They have their own pacing and usually stay entertaining to the end. Their humor can be surprising in its off-centered way. Their perspective can be almost myopic, but their characters are usually quirky and interesting enough to drive the story. But for some reason I just couldn't find a way to care about the protagonist of this movie. He was far too low key to ever really stir my interest. He was passionless and without drive. I did not share his pain or his triumphs... and that is the kiss of death for a character-driven movie."

Llewyn Davis played by Oscar was simply amazing, and I think lot of the work was done to the development of this character.The other roles played by Carey mulligan and Justin Timberlake were small but they do leave their mark.<br/><br/>If you just look at the story line of this movie, you would think that this is a sad or depressing movie, which sometimes it becomes.

","Inside Llewyn Davis is the latest film from the Coen Brothers, a drama centred around the Folk scene in the winter of 1961 in New York City, following Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a folk singer who has a amazing ability to rub people the wrong way and sofa surfs around Greenwich Village, attempts to make a living on his music and struggling to survive as he maintains he fulfils his dreams.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis has an incredible cast with the likes of Isaac, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman and Sally Hawkins.

Mulligan was blessed with the best lines and jokes in the film.

"ngmark7","8","2","4","27 January 2014"," For true film lovers
","After watching many of 2013's juggernauts (i.e. American Hustle, 12 Years a Slave, Captain Phillips etc), the Coen Brothers' finest film remains as my favorite for the year. If you are looking for a generic Hollywood movie with a neat plot, perhaps with a 'surprising' twist and other cheap crowd pleasers, this movie is not for you. However, if you truly love film for its core purpose of emotional evocation, your $10 will be well spent on this ticket.<br/><br/>Throughout the movie, I was finding it hard to cling to the slow moving story, as we follow Llewyn Davis through his unsuccessful musical career and life. But I realized that as soon we abandon our conventional approach to the way we watch movies, great films like this can be far more appreciated. This is not a movie that is driven by plot, but instead by mood and its atmosphere. Bruno Delbonnel's melancholy, wintry cinematography was clearly the film's greatest strength as it conveyed the growing sense of futility and gloom that Llewyn had to persevere.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn Davis convincingly as the played-out, morose victim of many life failures. Through the entire film, his character expresses no enthusiasm notably due to his brokenness - however in one of the closing scenes, during his final song (Fare Thee Well), Isaac performs the song with truthful passion. At that point we see Llewyn's only real means of expression are left only through his art.<br/><br/>I saw this movie as a truthful representation of an artist's futile pursuit for success. However others may see it differently and more deeply as futility in one's life or perhaps as an atmospheric portrayal of America's early folk music industry. Such ambiguity is the beauty of great films."
"jackasstrange","9","2","4","22 January 2014"," Coen's best since No Country for Old Men
","Inside Llewyn Davis can be rightfully so considered one of the greatest films released in 2013. As usual, another Coen's great film. The film tells the story of Llewyn Davis, an apparently good singer that somewhat is considered horrible. He has no direction in his life, but he wants to be a folk-music singer. And this is where the film starts. The coens decided to put a more comedic/musical approach in this film, and it was a spot on choice. It has hilarious moments and one liners, it reminds me a lot of the comedy cult-classic The Big Lebowski, and in the way it looks, Inside Llewyn Davis is walking in that same Cult-Classic way. And rightfully so, it has a beautiful and extremely funny story, full of deeper meanings, symbiotic elements (typical in Coens's films) and totally deserves to be watched.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaacs is surprisingly good as Llewyn Davis, great acting performance. He is really funny, and his unusual way turns even a relatively normal scene in an hilarious one. It's a hard thing to accomplish. Llewyn is the kind of character that makes you laugh just by looking at him and his reactions. A great work. And of course, I think I already said that the one-liners were great. <br/><br/>But an aspect that I really want to congratulate is the cinematography/art direction. One of the best that I've seen in a long while. No kidding. The color's scheme and the lightning a la Noir films, the unusual camera angles, I mean, just look at the gallery scene and the tight space between the door of Llewyn's apartment and his neighbor's apartment, and how that image may have an symbiotic importance. There is really no scene in this film that is like ""oh let's do a great cinematography on that scene just for the sake of it"". No, there is always a reason for the things to be in the way they are.<br/><br/>There are other examples as well, like in the 'bust scene' where Llewyn is in the car trying to figure out a solution for his problems, and starts to look everywhere, so as you see in that scene, the night set is terrific and even resembles a bit some kind of Gothic atmosphere. The cinematography is really great and stands out almost as an Oscar-winner work, definitely a top 5 of 2013 in that aspect. Anyways, everything in this film is great, so is really hard to talk about it without paying a compliment. So, what more can I say? Go watch it as soon as possible. 9.5/10"

","I am no fan of expletives. I think there is too much of this going on in society and in movies in general. <br/><br/>So, to use the f-word in this movie is not even attempting to reflect the swearing that took place during the time period represented. Virtually no one used that word as it was certainly deemed too crude (in fact if you go back only 15 years or so in the US, the f-word was not used nearly as much as it is today in general conversation).<br/><br/>I say bad on the Coen brothers in this regard for selling out to contemporary American culture, instead of staying true to the time period.<br/><br/>Otherwise, I enjoyed the film and it was a typical creative Coen brothers work."

","""...And what, just exist?"" Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac)<br/><br/>Folk singing in 1961 was far preferable to working the unromantic Merchant Marine, to which the eponymous hero of Llewyn Davis might have to return at the suggestion of his sister, Joy (Jeanine Serralles) and for his lack of success. The Coens have again crafted a tale of a hero not going anywhere but trudging along waiting for something to happen (think Libowski journeying for a carpet).<br/><br/>Llewyn sings gallows songs in smoky coffeehouses (one is the real Gate of Horn, which also is a reference to one of Penelope's comments in the Odyssey) and finds a place to crash at night, sometimes with a friend and his wife, whom Llewyn may have impregnated. Along the way he's inadvertently responsible for a savvy orange cat named Ulysses, either a symbol of our hero's wanderings to get home or of Holly Golightly's ""Cat"" in need of a home.<br/><br/>The film is aimless itself, mostly a pastiche of possibilities for a singer who is good but lacking a spark to take him to the Bob Dylan level, or even remotely to that peak. He's not even smart enough to forsake a quick pay for future royalties from a song he helped produce, Please, Mr. Kennedy.<br/><br/>The Coens have set the gloomy scene with a grey mise en scene evoking the faded albums and hopes beautifully lensed by Roger Deakins' substitute, Bruno Debonnel (Deakins was doing Skyfall at the time). While Llewyn's songs are very much in the folk tradition, they do nothing to relieve the despair.<br/><br/>Coen Bros fans must see Inside Llewyn Davis regardless of its despair. It evokes an era with gorgeous, somber photography and an eponymous hero in the vein of Libowski or O'Brother. <br/><br/>In all, the film is a Homeric demythologizing of an age when Jack Kennedy was still alive and hope had not yet been checked. The film's ending with the same violent beginning presages the dismal cycle of loss that is Llewyn's lot and ours.<br/><br/>We have been inside Llewyn Davis and it's not all that pretty."

","Glossing over the Coen's filmography confirms my immediate sentiment after finishing Inside Llewyn Davis. I have never been moved by one of their films. That is not what they do. They craft tales that shy the beaten path, fill them with semi-human characters and embrace the style they are working in wholeheartedly.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis has all the hallmarks of a Coen film. With one trump up its sleeve causing me to allow this film to grip me, shake me and leave me the same way it leaves its protagonist. With a wry smile and an empty heart. That trump is Llewyn Davis and his portayer, Oscar Isaac, who gives one of the best performances of that year.<br/><br/>With the characteristic, meticulous attention to detail the Coens immerse us in 60's New York and focus on the folk scene. It is an easy world to step into as it is presented to us with so much conviction and beauty. This is perhaps one of the Coens' best looking films, shot with a deep colour palette, emulating the coldness of the season and the predicament of their protagonist to perfection.<br/><br/>Story wise it is a pretty straightforward affair. We follow a struggling musician in his quest for finding a his purpose in life. Nothing groundbreaking there. But as so often is the case it is the storyteller that makes the story and the Coens are masters at doing just that. Davis is one of their best anti-heroes. He is distant, a freeloader, egotistic and a brilliant musician. He couch surfs his way through the city, bumming cigarettes whenever he gets the chance and always trying to peddle his music, trying to make a living from his passion. And no matter how hard he tries to be an asshole, I still felt myself rooting for him at every turn. It's the music. Whenever he picks up a guitar and starts singing one of his songs, you see him baring his soul. But the Coens are cruel masters. Every time he is allowed to speak through his music, he is more often than not yanked back to reality, taking us with him. I love that shared frustration between an audience and a character, it linked me to him, helped me appreciate his plight and in this particular case, his music even more.<br/><br/>This being a Coen film it is natural to start looking for a layer beyond the story. In this case it is hidden in plain sight. Llewyn is the cat. The cat is Ullyses. He is lost, adrift with many ports of call but none to call his home. I loved the nautical themes embedded in the story, his sailor father, his decision to actually disembark and drift even farther and some of the songs, they're all there, emphasizing that we are watching a man's journey, or at least an essential part of it.<br/><br/>Another thing that the Coens do brilliantly is structure their story like the Ouroboros. This is much like that snake eating its own tail, or tale if you will. The ending is the beginning is the ending. That gives that last wry smile Davis gives us, mumbling Au Revoir, all the more weight. He is stuck in his own cycle and unless he gives in to life's compromises he'll stay there forever, cold, lonely and adrift.<br/><br/>It's too soon to tell, but this could very well turn out to be my favorite film by the brothers. Time will tell, but for now I'll stick that unbelievable soundtrack on repeat and drift off."
"wgingery","9","0","0","12 September 2019"," An Odyssey for Today
","With its music and appealing stars, it's at once one the Coens' most accessible and most complex, layered films.<br/><br/>The plot is a kind of Odyssey - 'coming home' - about a couple of strays. The songs are more than mere decorations amidst the gauzy photography, they are windows into Llewyn's soul.<br/><br/>It's also one of the Coens' most personal works. If Llewyn is the cat, he is also a stand in for the Coens: art as self-expression v. art as a way to pay the bills; the fear of selling out v. the yearning to connect with people: . . . .in the end, too, it's an attempt to do with film what 'Young Bob' exemplifies in music: making something new and relevant out of classical materials.<br/><br/>Fwiw, the part where Llewyn's partner Mikey jumps off the George Washington Bridge probably echoes an incident in the news around the time of the film. A student at Columbia leaped to his death after being ridiculed on social media when he made sexual advances to and was brusquely rejected by his male roommate."

I went into this movie blind. I knew it had a good reputation, but other than that, I knew nothing about this. The opening song really drew me in, and set this up to be a really great movie. It didn't take long for me to recognize the trademark style of the Coen brothers, which made me like it even more.
I can't say enough good things about this movie. In fact, I can't really say any bad things. The entire story is entertaining and I thoroughly enjoyed every minute. The direction, the acting, the writing....everything is impeccable. I especially enjoyed the short cameos from John Goodman and F. Murray Abraham.<br/><br/>Despite everything great about this movie, what makes it brilliant in my book is the music. I'm like folk music as it is, and all the songs in Inside Llewyn Davis are great by any standard. I could easily listen to this album every day and still want more. As a side note, the ending nod to Bob Dylan offered quite the finish.<br/><br/>In short, main highlights are the acting (Isaac's talent continues to blow me away) and the music, along with a little bit of smart humor. This is highly recommended for people who love watching talent showcased on screen, because everyone involved is at their very best here."

","If it was never old and it was never new, then it's a folk song. Words spoken by Llewyn Davis in this film that could not apply to it more. This film is a folk song in its structure, tone, and scope; a song that makes us laugh, think, and at times break.<br/><br/>Writing/Direction: Ethan and Joel Coen are two of the modern masters of cinema with works that range from the Big Lebowski to No Country for Old Men. While those are certainly good, I am firm in my stance that none of them hold a candle to the intimate character study that is Inside Llewyn Davis. Their direction paints a portrait of intimacy while sticking to a dulled color palleate that fits perfectly. Their writing is fantastic. Fun fact: they actually do not plot out their movies, they just write without having much of an idea where the story is going. It is true creative writing that allows us to spend a week Inside Llewyn Davis.<br/><br/>Performances: While John Goodman is typically hilarious, Carey Mulligan is accurately and rightfully dramatic, and Justin Timberlake is pitch perfect, none of the supporting characters can compare to the finely tuned performance of Oscar Isaac, who gives what may be his best work yet. There were times I forgot I was watching Poe Dameron/Nathan from Ex Machina and only saw Llewyn Davis on the screen. He portrays a sarcastic, witty, somber Folk Singer with ease and his vocal parts are off the charts. Oscar Isaac is one of the truly underrated actors of the modern day.<br/><br/>The music is fantastic; a medley of folk songs combined with what would be considered modern back in the 60s (Please Mr. Kennedy).

","Dear Coen Brothers, <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis was for the most part an entertaining but ultimately depressing character study of an uncompromising and unlikable folk singer. The film is peppered with some great lines mouthed by remarkable bit players. Just like in other films of yours. You guys must hire the best casting directors on earth.<br/><br/>The film has some beautiful sets - like the bar where Llewyn sings, that toilet during the road trip which reminded me of the one in The Shining and the café. There is this cleanliness about the set pieces in your movies. Everything is squeaky clean and shiny. You guys really know how to quickly show a beautiful shot of a highway surrounded by nature and then cut back into the films action. I noticed this in Fargo as well.<br/><br/>One of the pop songs was very catchy. The rest of the songs sung by Issac were tuneless.<br/><br/>The performances were respectable all around. I'm not a big fan of Issac or Cary Mulligan. But they did decent jobs I guess. I might not watch it again, though. <br/><br/>Best Regards, Pimpin. <br/><br/>(7/10)"

","This is now the best movie made. The Coens have always come out with great movies but not in such a time of revelations. This is just before the Beatles came in and the the British invasion of music happened. I remember because a little while after in a new magazine called National Lampoon there was a take off on it called ""The Adventures of Zimmerman"" and Bob Dylan saves America from the British invasion of Stones and Kinks and other British rock and roll, in the form of a comic book. Dylan is heard right at the end of the movie when Llewyn Davis gets punched out. The movie is taken from the life of Dave Von Ronk,in the book ""The Mayor of MacDougal Street"". I read the book and he's not as hard edged as his depiction in the movie. I'm glad he he was friends with Dylan. The actual pop music at the time sucked then, just like it does today. But it was about to change. And so Dave Von Ronk got to experience the folk revival and be friends with one of the creative geniuses of that time. That's not too shabby. These are and have been scary times because of phony and obviously bad politicians. Maybe a real democrat will finally get in the White house and some great music will come back. But probably we'll just get fooled again."

","British SF drama ""Ex Machina"" led me here because of charismatic actor Oscar Isaac who was quite unforgettable, so I decided to check out what else he did. It turned out he was not a newcomer, but had already been awarded for his work in this movie directed by Cohen brothers. ""Inside Llewyn Davis""is re-creation of New York's Greewich Village music scene in early 1960s but not as seen trough just some any nostalgic, rose-tinted glasses - where others might have chosen to present it as a sunny beehive full of pot, enthusiasm and brotherhood, we see it here as a struggle between young musicians and industry that mercilessly exploits them. ""I don't see any money here"" says famous producer (F. Murray Abraham) after one heartbreaking audition and just like folk club's owner Max Casella, he doesn't care for music or the facts that musicians are obviously hungry and wet, money talks and folk music might just be the next trend. I happened to like the atmosphere shown here: cold, windy and rainy streets where the snow beats upon starving musicians, underground and coffee bars as the places to warm up, hunt for a friends with couch (or floor) to spend the night... it all feels very realistic and possible, very far removed from idealistic vision of love & peace, camaraderie and togetherness. This is a struggle and constant compromise between art and commercialism (see hilarious studio recording of novelty song that is obviously prostitution but brings some money in).<br/><br/>Main character is Oscar Isaac and he is brave enough to be unlikable. That he might be great talent is almost besides the point, he refuses to be nice to people, insults them and lash out of frustration when hosts expect him to sing after dinner. Time and time again we quietly root for him, though odds are really against him and at the very end, on the same night when he is supposed to finally get a break, we get a glimpse of another performer, a certain guy from Minnesota and this is when we understand Isaac might be just another hopeful who perhaps never made it. For every successful star, there were thousands who slipped in oblivion or simply gave up the fight with the windmills. The rest of the cast is mostly used as cameo roles (excellent John Goodman, unexpected Justin Timberlake and sweetly green Stark Sands) and there are lot of people who find inclusion of the cat as something symbolical, though I am a bit wary of searching for deep meanings since the movie is quite heavy already."

","Inside Llewyn Davis is a drama that is set in the 60s. It features Oscar Isaac in the leading role as a struggling folk singer. This movie by the Coen Brothers is markedly different from some of their previous ventures as it is much more serious with little humor. <br/><br/>Despite having a relatively short runtime of just over 100 minutes, the film manages to show the journey of a musician who has to face rejection most of the time, sleep on other people's couch, and in general find it hard to make ends meet. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac is brilliant in the role and he shows great emotion while playing the guitar. Carey Mulligan plays the friend of Llewyn Davis who is furious at him for getting her pregnant. She does a decent job in her small role.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers don't give us a typical Hollywood movie in which everything works out in the end. Instead, we get to see how the hopes and dreams of Llewyn Davis are crushed and he has no choice but to quit playing music. The film is anticlimactic but the journey is worth the watch."

","As a Coen Brothers fan, I've always felt that, at least for me, they are pretty much hit or miss. While I loved NCFOM, I hated The Big Lebowski and didn't get the hype surrounding Fargo. With Inside Llewyn Davis I think that they created one of their best crafted movies, one I would go so far as to call a subtle masterpiece. It's all there: the amazing acting by Oscar Isaac, who carries the movie with a complete understanding of his character, the cinematography, the soundtrack, the direction... In an age when movies tend to be more and more about action and fast paced dialog, a movie like this feels like a breath of fresh air. Its deliberate slow pace only adds to the incredible atmosphere of the world the Coens build around their protagonist, allowing us to feel his struggle and his loneliness. It's much more about what we feel than what we see. Kind of just like in life."

","​​​Inside Llewyn Dewis is not a quintessential Coen Brothers' movie. It ain't dark. It doesn't have cold humor. It won't stay with you all your life. But, it is still one hell of a movie. Technically, it is as good as any period musical drama character study can get. <br/><br/>It is a story of the journey of an artist and a celebration of a musical form, the folk music. It is about the heartbreaks and 'no breaks' that an artist can get if he is not ready to compromise his standing on the manner and style of creation and display of the art form which gives him maximum pleasure and satisfaction. Inside Llewyn Davis literally takes us inside the heart of a true artist, how fragile it is and how that fragility, those sentiments translate into his works, in this case, his voice and his music. <br/><br/>It is a lovely movie and thank god there was Oscar Isaac, a Julliard graduate singer actor because it is hard to imagine anyone else doing justice to the role. Carey Mulligan in her short part in the movie, once again reminds you of how she made you fall in love with her in her previous movies. <br/><br/>​Anyone who has ever felt the need to create art and has felt a special connection between his feelings and the desired output, you are in for an amazing ride."

","As an active member of the poetry, folk music and performing arts community in Melbourne, which is burgeoning just as the Village Scene was at the time of the movie and which is one of the most active arts communities in the world, I was interested to see this movie. A sort of low-key folk 'This Is Spinal Tap', like that movie it is accurate enough to make you wince.<br/><br/>I'm new to the Coen Brothers but I've watched about half of their films. Their main strengths are in the creation of lead characters who are memorable and complex, the excellent cinematography- always including wonderful and significant shots - and the well-visualised environments. Their movies, when based on their own texts, can be a bit simplistic, or as one reviewer here said, linear. That is, they have depth but can in some ways lack complexity. Their versions of life are still to some extent a Hollywood imagination or perspective, grounded in an imagining of reality rather than in the experience of it. Also it is only really the central character that is thoroughly depicted, though the other characters always have life. When they are using an external text, as in 'No Country For Old Men', they are capable of making movies that provoke thought and questions that can be considered for many years. The supporting characters in that movie have strong existences and realism. The Coens would be better off in many cases using texts written by actual members of the worlds they depict.<br/><br/>The criticisms from veterans of that scene who say the movie does not truly represent the vibrancy of it are not justified. This movie is not attempting to be 'Nashville'. It visually demonstrates the internal world of the lead character.<br/><br/>In some ways this movie is a homage to struggling performers and as such, should be seen by anyone who is a part of a similar scene. The first two thirds of this film contain consistent comedy which is low-key but hilarious in a quiet way. After that it may turn too dark for some viewers. A good movie and one that I will revisit, but not a great one."

He impregnates a woman who is married to a rival in his music industry and wants an abortion, his old girlfriend who aborted their child left him, he has poor family relationships, and especially has career struggles. Joel and Ethan Cohen did an interesting film that centers around a failure in a time of success where many music stars such as Bob Dylan. What's interesting is that the plot can relate to anyone having career struggles in our time.

","Review: I quite enjoyed this witty movie about a folk singer who just can't get a break, even though he's extremely talented. The storyline was put together well by the Coen Brothers and Oscar Isaac plays the lead extremely well. There are some amusing scenes that made me laugh, like the scene in the studio with Timberlake, but it does seem to go a bit downhill when he goes on the road. There is a taste of Were Out Thou, with the old American music, and I enjoyed the scenes with the cat that has many lives, but it's not a classic Coen Brothers movie like The Big Lebowski or Fargo. Watchable!<br/><br/>Round-Up: Oscar Isaac seems to be taken quite seriously in Hollywood at the moment and I'm sure that he will get an extra boost after starring in the near Star Wars. With films like Robin Hood, Drive and the Bourne Legacy in his portfolio, he has definitely made some great choices in his career and he also a great voice to add to your skills. All of the other actors like, Justin Timberlake, John Goodman & Carey Mulligan, only play small roles in the movie but they put in good performances. Oscar Issac is in every single take of the film which doesn't get tedious or boring because of the mixture of wit and seriousness which works very well. For such a small project, it deserved to make a profit because of the way that the Coen Brothers write there movies so well. <br/><br/>Budget: $11million Worldwide Gross: $33million<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to people who are into there musical, down and out, type of movies about an artist trying to make it in the music world. 6/10"

","The Coen Brother's certainly know how to make depressing oddly entertaining and continuing on in the vain of Barton Fink, A Serious Man and arguably other of their films, Inside Llewyn Davis is a seriously morbid film that finds much humour in its protagonists failings but due to the limited nature of its story it is not hard to see why (despite many bemoaning the fact) come the Oscar nomination process Davis was virtually shut out completely even though many hailed it one of the years best.<br/><br/>Our depressed figure here is Llewyn Davis, a folk singer so morbid and bereft of lightness that hanging with him for these 100 minutes can at times be as hard as the winter streets of New York. Llewyn is rightfully miffed at his current life situation as his musical partner has recently committed suicide, his new solo record is earning him nothing, he doesn't have a place to stay and his friends women Jean (played by Mrs. Marcus Mumford herself Carey Mulligan) is pregnant with a child that is possibly his. Many of these situations that Llewyn finds himself in are typical Coen Brother scenarios and Isaac is a fine leading man in what could well be a career defining performance for him but it doesn't make Llewyn any more tolerable as a person and character. With such an overly morbid tone that film is made around its fantastic music and top notch production design.<br/><br/>With dynamo musical producer T Bone Burnett at the helm of music duties and with help from Mumford and Sons frontman Marcus Mumford the music in Davis is such a blast that it elevates the film from what could of been a permanent state of neuroses. Setting up the tale of Lllewyn around the folk scene of the 60′s was a masterstroke move by the Brothers and is fantastically captured by cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel in what was a rightfully Oscar nominated aspect of the movie. You can feel every breathe of cold winters air, every smell of a cafés cigrettes and every strum of a well played guitar. The film excludes atmosphere and would easily rank as one of the Coen's most well filmed movies which is a grand feat indeed in a catalogue of beautiful movies.<br/><br/>With a great soundtrack, a well performed and casted group of actors and with a great visual eye Davis is a quality made film that is also a tale which could of done with a little more narrative scope. The journey Lllewyn and subsequently we take in the end is nothing more than slight and The Coen's with all their other fine elements would of been wise to enhance the story that little bit more. Always watchable, often enjoyable yet not always lovable, Inside Llewyn Davis ranks as another fine Coen Brother movie but perhaps one of their less meatier jaunts.<br/><br/>3 and a half couches out of 5 <br/><br/>For more movie reviews and opinions check out - <br/><br/>www.jordanandeddie.wordpress.com"

The up-and-coming Oscar Isaac performs several songs, leading me at the time to think he was an actual folk singer the Coens had convinced to act, and supporting stars Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake both raise their own voices, proving surprisingly talented at it.<br/><br/>T Bone Burnett must be given a large part of the credit for the music. He chose and assembled the songs at the behest of the Coen Brothers, having previously performed a similar task on The Ladykillers, and on O Brother Where Art Thou's wonderful Mississippi blues soundtrack.<br/><br/>The film has a different look to any other Coen Brothers film, due to a change in cinematographer: their regular collaborator Roger Deakins was replaced by Bruno Delbonnel, who has a handful of Oscar nominations under his belt, although it pales in comparison to Deakins' eleven!<br/><br/>Once you get past the visual style though (which is actually quite beautiful once you get used to it) and Llewyn's surliness, the Coen's trademark wry, surreal sense of humour is much in evidence. ILD comes from the more sober line of Coen Brothers films than their zany comedies, but there are still plenty of laughs, in my opinion.<br/><br/>And then, although he takes a long time to turn up, frequent Coens alumnus John Goodman's reassuring presence in a quintessentially Coen Brothers role could almost have been directly transplanted from any of the other films in their shared career.<br/><br/>It's not for everyone, but as a die-hard Coens fan, I was not disappointed... and I will probably be buying the soundtrack before too long.<br/><br/>For my full review, see my independent film blog on Blogspot, Cinema Inferno: http://cinemainferno-blog.blogspot.co.uk"

You won't want to watch this one as much as you might ""O Brother Where Art Thou?,"" ""True Grit,"" ""Fargo,"" ""No Country for Old Men,"" and ""The Big Lebowski."" Basically, this simple tale concerns a down-on-his-luck folk singer,(Oscar Isaac) who suffers from a case of perennial bad luck. He is broke for most of the time and lives off the generosity of others. His musical efforts haven't paid off and eventually he decides that strumming a guitar in a dark, smoky bar may not be his ultimate calling. At one point, he contemplates going back into the merchant marine but one of his friends has trashed his license. The action unfolds during a week of trials and tribulations for the vocalist. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't a fun film and the songs are not memorable at all. You won't feel better after you watch this polished effort. Nothing really changes in Llewyn's life. He has to arrange an abortion for one of his illicit lovers and in the process discovers that one of his former lovers didn't have an abortion but moved away to Akron and kept the child. Later, he learns that the man who owns the bar where he plays gigs has had sex with the lady for whom he is arranging an abortion. The most interesting thing about this soap opera of sorts is the yellow cat that escapes from a New York City apartment where he is sleeping on the couch. He searches for the elusive feline, finds it, gives it back to its owners only to learn that the city is not the same cat. When the film ends, the call—named Ulysses—has returned. At one point, during a highway trip through the great Northeast, Llewyn hits a cat but he doesn't find it. Llewyn isn't a role model. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't the kind of movie that will make you feel good unless you are a serious fan of indie-type, niche movies with minor characters that lack charisma. Everything that Llewyn tries to do fails, but he sticks with the guitar. As the movie is ending, while he is leaving one Greenwich Village nightspot, he spots another singer who resembles Bob Dylan singing, and the implication is his life may take an upswing because Dylan will make folk singers more prominent. John Goodman, Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, and Garrett Hedlund have supporting roles that don't amount to much in this character study epic."

","The Coen Brothers' 'Inside Llewyn Davis' follows struggling musician Llewyn Davis, a one-hit wonder that 'faded into oblivion' after the suicide of his singing partner. He's been performing at gigs, as second fiddle , if he's lucky enough but Davis is about to reach that point of realization that his dreams will only be a dream and the lack of stability in his life (no home, no job, no real friends and not even a proper family) will only push him further into darkness.<br/><br/>The film falls on the lines of 'A Single Man'. Here the viewer is accompanied by some fine music and some suitably awful songs. Moreover, the director duo also create a gloomy but equally intriguing atmosphere set in 1961. It's also darkly comic. All the other people Llewyn meets throughout the film are losers too. The only difference is that Llewyn has pretty much lost everything except his love for music while the others lead a relatively more secure life that is equally, if not more, empty. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac finally gets a role that allows him to showcase his abilities as an actor. He is well supported by John Goodman and Cary Mulligan. The only bad performance comes from Justin Timberlake. He is awful but thankfully he's only there for a limited time. <br/><br/>Whimsical and atmospheric, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' works as both a character study and mood piece.

","Llewyn Davis is such a realistic character. He experiences loss, pain, anger. He's a great guy, He's a bad guy. He is a real human being. Oscar Isaac's performance combined with some of the best writing from the Coen brothers yet gives us an accurate portrayal of a musician trying to catch a break in the 60s folk scene.<br/><br/>The film looks beautiful. bright whites and dark browns, blues and blacks give the film its overtly sad, depressing tone. The supporting cast all bounce of Isaac well, being the ones to encourage and discourage him from his hopes and dreams. There's also a cat, a guardian angel if you will, looking over Davis wherever he may roam. Davis tries to abandon him, he returns, its a nice little metaphor for Davis's never giving up and continuing to try and make a career out of his passion.<br/><br/>The songs perfectly capture the time period and just like the rest of the film, they have a down in dumps feel to them. Justin Timberlake starts in the film for what is basically a cameo, primarily singing 'Please, Mr Kennedy' which is a really catchy song and ironically becomes a hit after Davis writes it of and dismisses all royalties on the song - just an example of how much bad luck Davis has throughout the film.<br/><br/>One problem I have is that because Davis is such a real character, he can get mean and its because of that its hard to sympathize with him at times and maybe the Coen brothers don't want us to, but I feel that a man who has this dream and goes to great lengths to achieve it deserves our support when he does and sympathy when he doesn't.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Llewyn Davis isn't the best film the Coen brothers have made. Fargo, The Big Lebowski, O Brother Where Art Thou and No Country For Old Men are all films that I consider better but this film has a realistic tone that the others don't, a main character with more emotional depth than any Iv seen on screen and for that, This film succeeds."

","I will start by saying that if I wasn't a musician my self, as well as a folk music fan, i am not sure whether I would have rated this movie as highly as I did. If you are someone trying to play music for a living then this film will definitely appeal to you. Appreciating the magnificent musicianship (Oscar Isaac could sell an album of songs like this) really improves the movie. For a casual movie watcher the absence of closure may discourage you from liking the film, as well as the complete lack of exposition throughout. The best way to enjoy the film would be to step back and try to watch it just as the description says ""a week in the life of a young singer"". <br/><br/>As I've said, any budding musician will easily identify with Llewyn. So these are the people I'd recommend to go and see the film, they will love it. Others, maybe not. But nonetheless it is a terrific film that is not the norm, something The Coen Brothers are specialists at."

","The title may be a red herring conjuring up images of Charlie Kaufman's ""Eternal sunshine of the spotless mind"". Nothing of the sort, ILD (sounds like a drug, I know) is simplicity personified. The suggestive title is merely the title of an album, a pathetically unsuccessful album unfortunately, recorded by the titular folk musician. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a fictional character, albeit somewhat modelled after Dave Van Ronk, a pre-Dylan era Greenish Village regular. That Davis might have turned out to be a Dylan is faintly hinted but never suggested, as we become witness to his mundane life during a week, at the end of which it remains exactly as mundane. Maybe even the word ""life"" is a glorification, and one other word suggested in the dialogue fits better: ""existence"". Davis, despite his obvious talents, is in a sad state of not even possessing a coat that can keep him warm during the Manhattan winter, and drifts from couch to couch where he sleeps, at the homes of friends and sometimes even fellow musicians he has just met. The wonder-worker directors, however, have no problems making the audience root for this not-quite-appealing figure. Iassc's simple honesty in interpreting the character deserves equal credit.<br/><br/>One very important aspect of this movie, as can be readily surmised, is the singing. Isaac is nowhere near to matching the status of, say, Joaquin Phoenix who played Johnny Cash. He played Joseph in The Nativity Story (2006) but from my recollection, it could have been anybody. But musically he comes with Juilliard School credentials while his guitar virtuosity, beautiful tenor voice and soulful lyric delivery speak for themselves. While there are many singing roles, the star power comes with two in particular. Justin Timberlake has been a celebrated singer long before he truly launched his acting career playing the flamboyant Sean Parker in ""Social network"" (2011). If you have seen Carey Mulligan in ""Shame"" (2011) you know how well she can sing. The two play a singing couple who shelter Davis from time to time (the relationship is actually a little more complicated but there is no need to dwell on it). The two of them in the movie perform in Peter-Paul-Mary style (Davis is not the third making up the trio) ""500 Miles"" in which Mulligan harmonizes so beautifully.<br/><br/>While ILD is among the Coen Brothers' films about the most low-key and unassuming, their wit and humor populate the dialogue throughout. There is also a one-hundred-per-cent-Coen sequence, in the form of a highway movie when Davis travels in car-pool with two weird characters from New York to Chicago. One of them is played by John Goodman. I needn't say more.<br/><br/>Watching ILD will leave you in a strange mood that is a mixture of pleasure, melancholy, sadness, resignation, disillusion as well as hope. Above all, there is the sheer joy of sublime folk music. This movie won the Cannes Grand Prize of the Jury for good reasons."

","Inside LLewyn Davis is an excellent movie about a folk singer trying to be succeed in his business.Llewyn(Oscar Isaac) does not work, he thinks that he is an undercover talent, so he doesn't work.He lives a sad life, because he just lost his partner,Mike, so he is trying to recover his friend's death. In this ""Odyssey"" Llewyn is always with a cat(almost of the time.For me the cat represents Mike,his lost partner, you can see that in some scenes, like almost at the end, when the cat as the beginning of the movie tries to get out of the house, with LLewyn , but LLewyn wont let him,after that Llewyn goes to a café , and he plays a song, an old song that he used to play when he had Mike.The cats name is Ullysses, and like in Homero's Odyssey, Ullysses travels and at the end he returns home, That happens in Inside Llewyn Davis, LLewyn travels and the end of the film is similar to the beginning, this Odyssey happened to Llewyn forgets his partner's death and to keep playing wonderful music.At the end, LLewyn says goodbye, and at the same time Bob Dylan is playing at the bar that he used to play, that means that Llewyn was not hard-worker and very arrogant.Bob Dylan started from the bottom, and there you can see the difference from Bob Dylan's career and LLewyn's career.The acting is brilliant, so the directing and the music. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of my favorite movies of the year, and i think it should have been nominated for best picture and best direction, at least. My congratulations to Ethan Cohen and Joel Cohen. 8.3/10"

","Llewelyn Davis is a compelling character around the time of the folk revolution in New York. He was very talented but also a bit of an abrasive character. He is a conflicted character and so he isn't able to reach his potential as a performer. He is patronizing, elitist, and arrogant which rubs many people the wrong way - most notably when he attends a dinner party and hilariously insults the overly earnest music one of the hosts is performing. However, he's a musician, he is very talented and so bookers must contend with him. This makes him a very compelling character because he acts in ways that are counterproductive to his career or his personal life. <br/><br/>The scene in Greenwich Village is recreated with great detail, sometimes hilariously - most notably when a Peter, Paul, and Mary like group is kitted out in some truly horrible sweaters. The costuming and staging adds a great deal in creating the mood of the movie.<br/><br/>The most notable part of the movie, however, is the character of Llewelyn Davis, as created by the Coens and realized by Oscar Isaac. He is a charmer with the ladies but much too honest and can't hold his tongue. He has a lot of opinions, most of which antagonize and set people off. While this internal conflict holds back his music career, it makes for great complexity which is the heart of an incredible movie. <br/><br/>There is some great work by Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman but Oscar Isaac is really fantastic. The creation of the script and the deepening of our understanding about the start of the ""folkie"" scene and how things are much more complicated than we're often led to believe, make this a great movie."

","Just like ""the pursuit of happiness"", everyone loves the story of the guy who's super talented, but just way down on he's luck.

I've just cared for this character the last couple of hours! i want to know what happens to him? urgh! this is the third movie I've watched this year with this kind of pretentious, chichi, ""this movie is a work of art and the people will have to decide for themselves what happens in the end""'ish bull. You can be the best storyteller of a director, but sometimes we just need that basic ""hero defeats evil"" stuff. Now that i have calmed down, i would like to say Oscar Isaac is pure gold in this!

","What I loved about this movie is how timeless all the songs felt. It looked like the songs were mostly live takes and a bit of research backs that up. Most of the songs also belonged to one person ( Dave van Ronk) which also added to the authenticity of the story. <br/><br/>The most interesting part of the movie was the way in which the songs were presented as natural conversations of performances in context of a week in the life of the lead character.<br/><br/>In future this movie will be remembered for the songs and that is fitting. When they were being performed time seemed to stand still. Even the song he performed for the Chicago club guy ( a bad choice of song - I think) was going somewhere.<br/><br/>The other striking thing about the movie is the weird feeling of being out of sync with everything around it. Llewyn as the lead character see the future as flying cars and that contrasts greatly with his friends, his sister and other acquaintances. <br/><br/>They mostly see him as an entertaining dinner guest ( the Goresteins) or a loser who has slept on their couches too many times. <br/><br/>The real world flickers around him a few times and the possibility that he should go to Akron is raised. When he visits his father who has advanced dementia there is almost no recognition. But then Llewyn plays a favourite song of his Dad's.<br/><br/>Just for a tiny moment we see something in his Dad's eyes and then it goes. The possibility of another life outside of a musical spiral on the breadline does seem to occur to Llewyn and he steps in that direction but never quite gets there."
"MorgothsReach","7","0","0","30 March 2014"," The Coens return to form with tale of struggling musician in tribute to 60s New York folk scene
","The Coens have always defied easy categorisation. From slacker, The Dude, in their unorthodox film noir homage, The Big Lebowski to Marge Gunderson, the pregnant small town policewoman in Fargo, their protagonists aren't normally shaped in the archetypal hero mould. The same is true of Inside Llewyn Davis, the chronicle of a few days in the life of the eponymous struggling folk singer (Oscar Isaac). Although Lleywn's life is perhaps more straightforward than the aforementioned characters who find themselves embroiled in kidnapping and murder plots, he nevertheless shares the predicament of being out of his depth in extraordinary surroundings. Indeed, his situation could be said to reflect that of Larry Gopnik in 2009's A Serious Man who struggles to adapt to dramatic changes in his everyday life. <br/><br/>On this occasion we find ourselves in the rising folk scene of 60s Greenwich Village, New York. Lleywn Davis is giving a heartfelt, soulful performance at the Gaslight Café in front of a small intimate crowd who reward him with warm if not necessarily rapturous applause. Five minutes later he has been assaulted in the alleyway outside the café by a complete stranger posing as a friend. It's the type of irreverent scene reminiscent of many of the Coens' characters and indicative of the type of life our titular hero leads. Moving from place to place, harbouring the much sought after dream that his published record will be a success, his existence is a nomadic one. To think that this is an idealised, over sentimental portrait would be a mistake though. From shamelessly taking advantage of the slightest acquaintance to secure a bed for the night, deprecating other aspiring folk artists like himself and sleeping with one of his best friends' (Justin Timberlake) girlfriend (Carey Mulligan) Llewyn is far from likable. We root for him nonetheless though as his relentless pursuit of his dream takes him from the dingy studio apartments and record studios of New York to the freezing colds of Chicago and the promise of a nightclub gig...all without a winter coat. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is not one of the Coens' best (though thankfully better than True Grit) but it remains a solid portrayal of the almost men that history tends to forget as well as a poignant tribute to the folk scene. With unedited, full length songs and numerous shots of languidly smoking audience members settled behind rickety tables and coffee cups, we are immersed in immaculate period detail from beginning to end. Oscar Isaac is powerfully understated as Llewyn, abrasive and facetious but also sad and frustrated at his continuing failures. In one particularly moving scene he almost breaks down when the mother of his dead partner – who committed suicide – begins singing her son's lyrics while Llewyn is performing. Out of a supporting cast that includes John Goodman as a cantankerous travelling buddy and Justin Timberlake as a fellow Greenwich musician, Carey Mulligan stands out as fiery and unrecognisable Jean who shares some of the best exchanges with Llewyn. This is Llewyn's film however and like the other characters her sporadic and fleeting appearances emphasise his grounding in no particular place. Uncompromising in their portrayal of the talented individual who just doesn't have enough for true success Inside Llewyn Davis marks a return to form for the Coens. In a slightly gratuitous, full-on scene a figure looking and sounding remarkably like Dylan (whose first gig was at the Gaslight) is beginning a performance just as Davis exits the venue. It is a scene which defines both the film and the era as this celebration of the almost man comes to an end but not before we get a brief glimpse, like Llewyn Davis, of a period in music to come that he will not be a part of.<br/><br/>sites.google.com/site/drunkprojectionist/"
"Buddy-51","6","0","0","30 March 2014"," The Coens in a minor key
","Llewyn Davis is, what one of the characters in the movie calls, a ""loser."" That is, a struggling folk musician in 1961 Greenwich Village who's so bad off he doesn't even have a place to call his own. Instead, he's been reduced to sleeping on friends' couches for as long as they're willing to put up with him. Then it's on to someone else's place (he seems to have a rotation system set up amongst a group of regulars). Llewyn has also recently become a solo act following the suicide of his partner, and no one seems much interested in hiring Llewyn to play on his own. To further complicate matters, it seems Llewyn might just have impregnated his best friend's wife during a recent one-night stand, a woman, by the way, who really can't stand a thing about Llewyn, least of all the prospect of being a mother to his child.<br/><br/>In comparison to the flamboyance of some of their more recent works such as ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Burn After Reading,"" ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" finds Joel and Ethan Coen at their most subdued, spare and inward-looking. More somber mood-piece than narrative-driven drama, this is what we get when the boys decide to compose in a minor key. As such, the movie may try the patience of some in the audience and appear too slight to others, especially with its lack of a clear-cut resolution come fadeout time. The movie becomes especially stripped-down when Llewyn heads off on his own to Chicago in search of a gig, sharing a ride with an enigmatic and eccentric musician/heroin addict played by who else but John Goodman (this IS a Coen brothers movie after all).<br/><br/>Llewyn finds his identity and purpose in music and in the counterculture persona he displays to the world. The only trouble is that, while he feels superior to all the unenlightened ""squares"" whom he sees as having sold out to the Man and to crash commercialism, he's still dependent on those people to lend him a helping hand. After all, what's the point of being your own man when you have to keep throwing yourself on the mercy of others just to find a warm place to bed down for the night? Llewyn's troubles seem to be the result of a combination of factors: a lack of ambition, grief over his partner's death, and his decision to hide behind nonconformity as a justification for never growing up and never accepting the responsibilities that come with being a man. It could also be that he's just a bit of a jerk by nature.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac gives an effectively understated performance as the title character, and the rest of the cast (including Carey Mulligan, F. Murray Abraham, and Justin Timberlake) is fine as well. Bruno Delbonnel's cinematography is starkly beautiful, especially in those scenes set against the bleak landscape of a wintry Midwest.<br/><br/>""Inside Llewyn Davis"" isn't quite the engaging survey of the music scene or of Bohemian life in that specific place and time that the critics have claimed it is (the soundtrack is not really all that impressive), and it is no crowd-pleaser by any stretch of the imagination, but if you lower your expectations a mite, you may just get find yourself getting into its subdued portrayal of a social misfit."

","And here comes another Coen Bros film. Another film with some very memorable characters led by the somewhat newcomer Oscar Isaac. He is basically the only lead in the movie, everyone else is a glorified cameo. Besides perhaps Carey Mulligan, who is great as the ticked off ex-girlfriend type. The whole movie comes off as a depressing journey for a man who cant find himself. The deeper meaning is he cant move on from his best friend and music partner committing suicide.<br/><br/>Praise- The look of the film is great, so much that it was nominated for an academy award for cinematography. Even without much of a climax, the Coen Brothers work their magic and do a great job directing. They always find a way to make their characters memorable. Even in the Big Lebowski (which I think is a highly overrated film) I remember some of the lines of the infamous 'The Dude'. I really liked that they threw the cat into the mix as the heart and soul of the movie. It truly symbolizes his music partner and that he finally realizes how to let him go and move on. Man does Davis struggle through most of this movie though. It really seems like nobody cares for this guy and the only people that actually allow him to stay more than one night are the Gorfein's. Perhaps they are the parents of his former partner?<br/><br/>Complaints- I don't have many problems with the movie, as the writing is pretty much flawless as is every other Coen Bros movie. I would say for me, the movie didn't pull me in emotionally as much as I wanted it to. I had heard it has as much heartbreak as Pursuit of Happiness. It just didn't thrill me as much with the emotion.<br/><br/>As a whole its a great small film that has some great deeper meanings of loss and getting over something that haunts you and eventually makes you hit rock bottom.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","As I went ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" (please please please, don't take that the wrong way) I discovered I was watching a mediocre film that was a bit overrated by the film critic industry. But Inside Joel ""Meeza"" Mesa there is a disturbed pun cerebral cortex that causes Mr. Mesa to actually think he is part of the film critic industry; so there you have it. Anyways, this Coen Brothers feature stars Oscar Isaac as Lllewyn Davis; a struggling 60's folk singer who leaches of acquaintances, strangers, and other musicians for places to stay as he tries to make a folking name for himself in the music industry. Llewyn is not a nice guy; he is bitter, abrasive, and narcissistic; but boy does he love pussy. Get your mind out of the gutter, cause the pussy I am referring to is a cat of a couple friend of Llewyn who accidentally gets stuck with him, and he does go beyond the call of duty to safeguard the cat. Joel & Ethan Coen are filmmaking legends, so it's hard to nitpick them; not good to nitpick a Joel anyways. But I don't think their direction and scribe of the picture captivated me, but at the same time it was not a folking bore either. Many say that Oscar Isaac got snubbed of an Oscar nom for his starring role here. I do agree that Isaac was phenomenal, but with such a heavy competitive field in the Best Actor race this last season, I think Oscar was properly snubbed; but Oscar's Oscar time will come, try saying that six times in a row at a fast pace. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake give fair performances as the folk duo singing couple Jane and Jim, or is it Jim and Jane. Llewyn impregnates Jane by folking around too much with her; I guess he was having too much fun with ""Dick and Jane"". ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was not the movie I thought it would be, but as an outsider looking inside to the film critic industry, I still suggest you take a look for yourself.

"tomgillespie2002","9","0","0","28 March 2014"," The Coen's at their most melancholic
","Looking like a Bob Dylan record cover come to life, Inside Llewyn Davis, the Coen brothers' first film since 2010's True Grit, takes place on the wintry streets of 1961 Greenwich Village in New York. We follow it's lead character, Llewyn (Oscar Isaac), a talented but struggling folk singer crashing from couch to couch, trying desperately and comically to hold his life together and come through what was one of the most exciting times for folk singers - this was the year Bob Dylan broke out of the scene. The film, like Llewyn, wanders sporadically, seemingly without direction, but this is the Coen's finest work in years.<br/><br/>The Coen's have always been cruel - be it shooting Brad Pitt's lovable idiot in the face in Burn After Reading (2008) or needlessly killing Donnie in The Big Lebowski (1998) - and here they revel in beating down its protagonist. But they have a lot of sympathy for him also - when he's beaten up in the alleyway by a shadowy stranger, we know he deserves it, but feel sorry all the same. And it's the same attitude they have with the subject matter. Although they often poke fun at the free-spirited melancholia of it all, they have a lot of love for the music. Long-time collaborator T-Bone Burnett provides the tunes, and it's a great soundtrack. Most impressively, the cast perform live on set, and Oscar Isaac manages to belt out a beautiful opener in Dave van Ronk's Hang Me, Oh Hang Me (the film is loosely based on van Ronk's memoirs).<br/><br/>It's often difficult to work out what kind of film it is. It shifts between being a drama about an artist struggling to make an impact, a sombre look at what life was like as a folk musician in the early 60's, a Kafkaesque comedy with a tragic anti-hero at its heart, and a dark, somewhat mystical odyssey. Like the Coens' earlier film, A Serious Man (2009), it keeps the audience at arms length. But as brilliant as that film was, Inside Llewyn Davis is a more mature take, creating an altogether warmer film, offering throwaway, laugh-out-loud moments such as Llewyn's recording with fellow artists Jim (Justin Timberlake), a marketable, likable sort of guy, and Al Cody (Adam Driver), whose performance during Please, Mr Kennedy steals the entire damn film.<br/><br/>As the film progresses, and Llewyn finds out Jim's girlfriend and performing partner Jean (Carey Mulligan) is pregnant, possibly with his child, and after he embarks on a doomed road trip with heroin-addled jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) and chain-smoking Beat poet Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund), it becomes clear what the film is really about. The final scene will leave some people scratching their heads, but I believe it signifies the point in all our lives when we look at our own existence and contemplate the meaning of it, often coming to no conclusion. This is beautiful, thoughtful, sometimes uncomfortable film- making, with the Coen's at their most melancholic.<br/><br/>www.the-wrath-of-blog.blogspot.com"
"GTeixeira","8","0","0","19 March 2014"," The Coen brothers' best film in over a decade
","The Coen brothers are really a cinema apart. They have their unique style, blending multiple genres in a way that feels natural, with an interesting cinematography that makes them easy to differentiate, (usually) great and original music and often witty dialogue/characters. Yet, I often find them polarizing: while I've loved some of their films ('Miller's Crossing', 'Barton Fink', 'The Big Lebowski'), I often found some difficult to like others.<br/><br/>Not since 'O Brother, Where Art Thou?', over a decade ago, have I liked a Coen-directed film (except for 'True Grit', though that one doesn't feel like a Coen movie at all). In fact, I could consider 'The Ladykillers' and 'A Serious Man' among the biggest disappointments in the decade (among the worst too, at least among 'big, important' productions). <br/><br/>Surprisingly, it was 'Inside Llewyn Davis' that peaked my interest again. This simplistic, almost pointless slice-of-life yarn about a fictional 60's washed-up folk singer doesn't look like much, but just like 'Fargo' in the 90's it is deceptively captivating. It is heavily a drama, yet with a somber humor and wit, where the characters aren't forced but actually realistic and the reason you keep watching on. Oscar Isaac is also part of the reason, being able to naturally convey a Coen character's wittiness; he is kind of a downer, yet sympathetic, and Isaac even manages to sing well.<br/><br/>We have some good casting in here too (which became less common within the Coen's films as time passed; they've never casted as well as they did on 'Barton Fink' or 'Miller's Crossing'). John Goodman is really good on his small part, as is F. Murray Abraham in a cameo-like role and Max Casella as the bar owner. Carey Mulligan was quite cute, and her interaction with Isaac's was very fun to watch; moreover, she has a very good voice and is nice to hear sing.<br/><br/>Adam Driver was a surprise with his deep voice, but again had little screen time. Justin Timberlake seems to be becoming quite popular lately; he sings well enough, true, but he isn't a good actor at all and makes his character look like too much of a wuss. Even if they insisted on casting a singer for the role, they could have chosen better.<br/><br/>The songs are all original, collaboration between the Coens, their musical supervisor and sometimes Timberlake. Maybe because I like folk music, or because Isaac is a surprisingly good singer, but I loved them; coincidentally, Timberlake's 'Please Mr. Kennedy' was the only song that I didn't like at all, though he kinda repents in his other song with Mulligan.<br/><br/>Overall, a simplistic to the point of pointlessness, but nonetheless engrossing and likable picture. Oscar Isaac is the highlight here, as are the excellent cinematography and the songs. Also worth noticing is that, as often, the Coen brothers leave a lot of references to Homer's 'Odyssey'; pay attention to the cat if you wish to get it."

The journey of its protagonist, Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Issac, isn't eventful or celebrated. His journey consists grief, pain & struggle. But, what compliments him in his journey, is his own music. <br/><br/>The Screenplay Written by the Coen's themselves, is undeniably engaging. Their Direction, on the other-hand, is perfect. They deliver a story of a troubled musician most effectively. Cinematography is outstanding. Editing is crisp. A Special Mention for the wonderful music. <br/><br/>Performance-Wise: Oscar Issac is brilliant as Llewyn Davis. He enacts the struggling musician effortlessly. Carey Mulligan is, as always, first-rate. John Goodman is delightfully despicable in his part, while F. Murray Abraham shows up in a powerful cameo. Justin Timberlake suits the part & adds great depth to the songs. <br/><br/>On the whole, 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a very well-made film, that excels in every aspect. Two Thumbs Up!"
"CMTiago","8","0","0","11 February 2014"," What to do when all meaning is gone
","Inside Llewyn Davis is a rich work of art, be that in cinema or in music. The title character is a man filled with remorse and emptiness, who after the suicide of his partner drifts around looking to basically survive and live off the music he makes. All throughout the movie he will interact with people he knows and even travel to Chicago. This story invites you into the life of someone who seems to be going through life without any sense of purpose. He assumes music as his way of being, folk music to be exact, and all he does ends up being connected with the songs he does and also his presence in the whole business. Personally I rooted for this folk singer despite his flaws and wrong decisions that after all just makes him more human.<br/><br/>I am usually not a fan of the Coens and their feature films. The only other movie I can say I've loved from them is No Country For Old Men, and that one was from a different perspective. I'll admit that I haven't seen Fargo. but still they fail to capture my fullest attention. Given its musical nature, Inside Llewyn Davis nails the mark on the songwriting and composing point. The commitment the filmmakers had on perfecting every single detail is something I very much appreciate. The performances are quite good and Oscar Isaac handles the responsibility of leading the movie quite splendidly. With some eerily beautiful cinematography and a inquisitive script, Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those rare movies that leave you asking questions but on a positive note. Definitely a must-see<br/><br/>Rating 8/10"

","'INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS': Four and a Half Stars (Out of Five)<br/><br/>The Coen brothers' newest film is yet another of 2013's biggest Oscar contenders, as well as one of the best reviewed movies (of last year) and the Coens' careers! It's about a broke folk singer trying to make a living, by following his dreams, in New York City's Greenwich Village (during a week in 1961). It stars Oscar Isaac as the title character and co-stars Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake, Adam Driver, Garrett Hedlund, F. Murray Abraham and John Goodman (who appears in almost every Coen brothers' movie). I found the film to be interesting and entertaining enough (despite an overly depressing nature and lack of story) but most of all I loved the movie's music.<br/><br/>The film takes place during one week in New York City's Greenwich Village, during February of 1961. There's no plot at all but it does have a decent amount of interesting character development. The movie tells the story of Llewyn Davis (Isaac), a struggling musician and ex-merchant marine. He was a part of a mildly popular folk singing duo but his partner committed suicide. He's now trying to make it on his own but his solo album 'Inside Llewyn Davis' isn't selling. He's broke but makes a little bit of money playing clubs while sleeping on friends' couches and waiting for his manager to get his record distributed. He also has to deal with a bitter ex-lover (Mulligan), who thinks she's pregnant with his baby, and take care of a friend's cat (he locked out of it's apartment by accident).<br/><br/>The movie is funny in places (in the Coens' usual style) but mostly it's a pretty serious character driven drama about the struggles of a gifted small-time musician. In that way it reminded me a lot of the 2009 film 'CRAZY HEART'. T-Bone Burnett did a lot of the music for that movie as he does this one (and a couple of other Coen brothers' films as well; 'O BROTHER, WHERE ART THOU?' and 'THE LADYKILLERS'). The songs in this film were mostly recorded live and played in their entirety. I think they're absolutely beautiful and make up one of the year's best soundtracks (without a doubt). Because of the music I give the movie an especially high rating but the dark negative subject matter and lack of plot certainly don't make the film one of the funnest movies of the year (or the Coens' careers). It does seem very true to life though.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VljRGPnGo0s"

","As I have managed to see all movies directed by Joel and/or Ethan Coen (many of them even multiple times), it is natural that Inside Llewyn Davis was on my list as well. I like the Coens' approach, choice of character actors, and that all characters are ""odd"" in different ways. The same applies to the movie in question, where the viewers are invited into the New York folk music scene in the 1960ies; thus, there are many songs fully performed on different occasions (probably annoying for them disliking Bob Dylan, The Byrds and like), but they are masterfully carried out and fully fit into the general context, at times, there are funny scenes during or after them. The mood of the movie is rather gloomy, stressed by the gray weather, and the protagonist's condition/situation and lifestyle enables to logically introduce the bunch of colorful characters and witty lines - with Roland Turner (splendidly performed by John Goodman) as the most ""Coen-specific"" one.<br/><br/>As for the cast, as typical to the Coens, there are both known and less known persons involved. Goodman is a kind of Coens' trademark already, Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake have suitable roles as well, Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis was not so vivid to me - perhaps due the fact I cannot remember him from other movies. But still, the chemistry is there, and the development/fate of characters remains unclear, unsettled - so pleasantly characteristic to the Coen brothers as well.<br/><br/>All in all, another nice contact with the Coens, although not at the level of e.g. Fargo or No Country for Old Men."

","Aw, but what about the cat? Wow, whoever the animal handler was for this film, they really did some great work but, who exactly played 'Ulysses' then? The Coen's appear to have another hit on their hands by looking at the other side of success. Here we have a conceited amateur performer who is trudging around trying to make a living when half of his act has died. He's in mourning and doesn't know it and sings mournful songs with little subject appeal. He's not someone you'd want to have anything to do with yet he can find a whistleable and memorable tune from some hidden depths. Cinematography is spot on, dialogue is spot on, casting is spot on, sounds are spot on. What more can you say!"

","For me the best part of Inside Llewyn Davis came right at the end when he gets the crap knocked out of him. Because this is the story, as good as its told, of a self centered A....hole. I mean you sit through nearly two hours of 60s memories in the company of one of the most unlikeable characters to grace the screen in a long time.<br/><br/>I know he's an eccentric artist and Oscar Issac does a great job...especially his wonderful singing bits...but in the end he's the same loser as he was when the film began.<br/><br/>As for the film,the only real negative aspect is its length because his life being so one dimensional as a parasite, the story could have been told in half the time.

","In a year of out-sized entertainments, ILD was an anomaly - minimal special effects, much silence - music used within the story, rather than an emotion-yanking soundtrack. Beautiful performances, down to the smallest role - the two couples who were guests at the professors apartment - amazing. Minimal pyrotechnics beyond one abortive beating. <br/><br/>But for me - difficult to enter. I remember that scene well, went to college in NYC in the 60's, and the film was immersed in aura I remember - not with nostalgia or sentimentality, but accurately. Kids without money scrambling to make some sort of music career, old Village characters and Times Square types holding out. A cold winter, no money, road trips, overdoses - the beginning of Vietnam, but all Llewyn can focus on is keeping himself warm & fed. The outside world is like the weather - chill, oppressive, dangerous.<br/><br/>I did not understand the timeline of the ending, but that didn't really bother me; probably wasn't meant to be understood. I'm glad I saw it, but I would recommend it cautiously - not an easy ride. Stark Sands singing ""Last Thing on my Mind"" broke my heart."

","The Coen brothers previous musically themed effort, O brother, Where Art Thou, proved that the boys have a knack for finding good music. Llewyn Davis is a struggling folk singer in New York in 1961. Oscar Isaac is a revelation in the title role. He has a great voice and hits just the right tone as a somber, starving and wandering artist. Carey Mulligan is a girlfriend and fellow singer, who, besides being an excellent actress, is also a talented singer. The entire cast is good, and the Coen's script has the expected sardonic humor we have come to expect. I am taking away a point for an extended scene with John Goodman which is funny for a few minutes, but drags on and is out of place in this film. The music is beautiful and makes this a movie worth watching."

","I was looking forward to Inside Llewyn Davis, but I can't really call myself a Coen Brothers fan having only seen a handful of their movies. After watching the trailers I was greatly intrigued by the visual style and story, and Inside Llewyn Davis not only gave me that but much more as well.<br/><br/>The movie is incredibly well written. I never know what would happen next and found myself incredibly invested in the characters. The movie is very gripping, which is a great feat considering we are just watching a week of a man's life and struggles. There is some amazing symbolism and hidden meanings, some of which I'm sure I will keep thinking about for days after watching.<br/><br/>The acting is phenomenal as well. Oscar Isaac is excellent in the title role, he carries the whole movie and does a brilliant job of doing so. There are a lot of supporting cast members as well, including Carey Mulligan and John Goodman who are both great. Justin Timberlake is in this movie as well, and he actually plays a different type of role to the usual college computer nerd he normally plays.<br/><br/>Of all the Coen brothers movies I've seen, Inside Llewyn Davis is by far the best directed. The cinematography is incredible and just as I was hoping for, has a very unique and beautiful visual style. Although the film is set in the sixties, it has a timeless feel to it so that it could fit into any decade. The pacing is impeccable, when the movie was over I was surprised at how quickly it seemed it had gone, I don't want it to end. I'm not normally a huge fan of the type of music that this movie showcases, however I thought that the soundtrack was excellent. Inside Llewyn Davis is a movie that I certainly plan on watching time and time again, and I strongly recommend that you watch it too."
"Likes_Ninjas90","10","3","8","5 January 2014"," Stands as some of their very best work
","Joel and Ethan Coens' brilliant new film Inside Llewyn Davis is inspired by Brooklyn folksinger Dave Van Rork's memoir The Mayor of MacDougal Street and stands as some of their very best work. Though the film is not autobiographical, it is also about a New York folksinger named Llewyn Davis, played with hilarity and sizeable heart by Oscar Isaac, who in 1961 is struggling as a solo artist. The film follows him for one week, watching as he stresses his independence and professionalism but still opts to sleep on other people's couches. While he's also miserable after a tragedy involving his former singing partner, he persists with trying to sell his own solo music instead of entering a folk group. <br/><br/>This is a fascinating cultural period and approached with great authenticity. Folk music in America was considered in the 1950s to be politically left leaning and because of this it was forced underground into clubs and cafes during the McCarthy Red Scare days. Between the end of the 1950s and early 60s, folk music was revived by less politically active and more commercial groups like The Kingston Trio, who dominated the music scene prior to the British Invasion that would introduce pop and rock music to the world. <br/><br/>Another interesting layer to this material is its reflection of the Coens' defiance of the Hollywood studio system, the commercialisation, and their persistence for uniqueness. The Coens were born in the 1950s in Minnesota with Jewish heritage. Both have university degree, which includes Ethan's background in philosophy. They now live in New York and each of their films continues to satirise the different facets of American culture, including Hollywood itself. Many of their projects are genre films, which means they use a set of existing film tropes and then subvert these conventions in funny and sometimes bizarre ways. At a time when Hollywood films are generally lazy and complacent, their resistance to ever make the same film twice, shifting effortlessly between crime, comedy and drama, and sometimes mixing all three, is invaluable. The public's interest in their idiosyncrasies is reflected in the Coens' glowing box office results. They are proof that filmmakers can retain their own unique auteurist imprint while still remaining commercially viable - perhaps a similar desire to the title character of this very film. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis excels in being unique because the excellent, original screenplay by the brothers deliberately sidesteps conventional narrative beats at crucial turns. One of the main plot lines is that Llewyn is looking after a friend's cat. Its name is Ulysses, which is our first clue that the film is distinctly Joycean in its narrative structure. Llewyn's odyssey isn't to make him a more likable or less stubborn person but to introduce him to a series of characters who he fears that he will have to depend on. In its drifting trajectory, the film is foremost of a crisis of personal grief and a resistance to personal and cultural connections. This very resistance is tested by Llewyn's low economic status and his poor relationship choices. Staying on the floor of a friend's house, he learns that Jan (an unusually fierce, angry Carey Mulligan), the girl he has been sleeping with, is pregnant and it's possibly his child. She's married to Jim (Justin Timberlake) and they sing together. Potential moments of success for Llewyn, including a long road trip into Chicago, where he meets a drug addicted jazz singer (played by John Goodman), cleverly subvert our expectations and deepen the sense of isolation. Many of these vignettes meet justifiable dead-ends and free themselves from easy sentimental resolutions because the central character refuses to embrace change and continues to resist cultural, artistic and emotional conformity.<br/><br/>The Coens' technical work, from their entire production team, is on the whole faultless. The 60s of New York is recreated with such stunning attention to detail that it could be a photo representation of the time period. As this is the early part of the decade, traces of the 1950s and its reserved mood are still visible, long before the flamboyance of the new era emerged. The blistering winter storms are frightfully atmospheric and the entire colour scheme is washed out with a grey desaturated lens. This is true to the thematic core of the film of a man's detachment from other people and the changing time period he won't embrace. The way that the static camera cuts from long shots of narrow corridors and winding roads to tight close-up shots of faces is also reflective of Llewyn's stubborn narrow-mindedness and unchanging ways. In the outstanding opening scene, the camera focuses tightly on a single microphone to show his singularity, while other characters seem to disappear into the deep and smoky shadows of the audience. The costumes, including Llewyn's drab, thin attire, unsuitable for winter weather, is contrasted with people who have adopted more formalised suits, are also true to his cultural resistance. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac gives his best performance so far, with a role that requires a comedic touch and moments of subtle internal pain. His glum, hangdog face is a perfect fit for the quiet, often hysterical deadpan comedy that the Coens have mastered. Yet there are also times when his grief is quietly visible, as he tries desperately to contain his emotions from surfacing. Isaac performed his own live singing, working under the film's music producer T. Bone Burnett, and as expected the music is often stirring. Even in the smallest roles, the cast from Justin Timberlake, Carey Mulligan to Adam Driver, are memorable additions. The only fault with the film is that on my initial viewing the ending didn't quite sit as comfortably as the rest of the film with its deliberately circular structure. Is it literal or metaphorical or both? What would a Coen brothers' film be though without a bizarre finish? It's who they are."

","The Greenwich Village folk scene of the early 60's drew me as a concept like iron to a magnet.

Enter Llewllyn, quite the most unpleasant scrounger, ne-er do well and general sociopath who you could ever hope to avoid. Its true he does receive a beating by way of his behaviour toward another performer but I wound up wondering why the hopeless numb-skull was not permanently black and blue.

It really has a sixties feel in it, it slightly reminded me of The Graduate, which is probably my all time favorite movie, and I couldn't help but feel that there is a lot of good elements that are missing here like humour and a pace. I've seen other Coen brothers' movies, I am aware that they tend to do downward spirals but this is kind of a waste. I think the reason why most of their other films worked for me was that, at any point, I felt sympathy for the protagonists. It is kind of essencial for the process and it really doesn't happens here. There are no good things happening to Llewyn and at some point you just realize he really is kind of an a** and deserves it. No identification at all. It has some great cinematography, the movie just looks beautiful, great filming and great acting, but it's not engaging and it's also very slow.

"filmfanperspective","10","2","5","5 May 2015"," Flawless film that shows everyone how great Oscar Isaac is (*****)
","If you haven't seen a Coen Brothers movie at this point, shame on you. While not all of their films are equally entertaining, they are all perfectly unique, yet the same. If that doesn't make sense, consider it for another moment. From ""Barton Fink"" and ""The Big Lebowski"" to ""Fargo"" and ""No Country For Old Men"", as one fellow amateur critic put it, you can always tell when you're watching a Coen Brothers movie, despite how different they may play. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is in the same vein, yet still manages to stand alone as a unique tale of a man who's either a self-absorbed jerk or a supremely unlucky soul. The film makes no judgments of its' own, and through its' quirks and memorable dialogue, it stands as a supremely enjoyable, if not melancholy masterpiece.<br/><br/>Llewyn Davis (Isaac) has an abundance of talent, evident from the opening scene as he performs a soulful folk scene. Unfortunately, he carries an abundance of arrogant negativity with him as well. After the opening number, bar owner Pappi Corsicato (Max Casella- Doogie Howser's old buddy if you can recognize him) tells Llewyn that a friend wants to speak to him outside. This is no friend- the gruff man is angry about criticism Llewyn threw his wife's way at an earlier time, and proceeds to beat Llewyn senseless. It's a great tone-setter for the film, as we can sense Llewyn's greatness with music and his propensity for poor social behavior in the same sequence.<br/><br/>That knack for paining others doesn't stop there. Upon waking the following day, Llewyn manages to lock himself out of a friend's apartment after mistakenly letting out the house tabby cat. Then he calls upon folk-singing 'friends' in Jean (Mulligan) and Jim (Timberlake) to stash the cat while he takes care of business. The problem? Jean is none too happy with Llewyn for reasons I won't reveal, and then he lets the cat escape out of their window. The same day, he upsets his sister after a brief visit. See a pattern yet?<br/><br/>Llewyn just can't get out of anyone's way, including himself. He's without a partner (who appears to have killed himself without reason), without a permanent home, without a competent career plan or agent, and without a confidant. He has plenty of 'acquaintances', whom he calls upon to provide him with a couch to sleep on, but even they have become disillusioned with him. There are those that will see this film and feel sorry for Llewyn, and others who will feel he deserves what he gets. It's hard to argue with either point of view, but here's an alternate thought- he seems to meet everyone on their worst day. Could it be that Llewyn is just trapped in a vicious circle of self-doubt and bad timing, made worse by how callous he's forced to become with everyone's negativity towards him? I got the impression that the character means well, in all honesty- he's just locked into a good run of bad luck.<br/><br/>I'll try to illustrate my theory by describing a series of scenes in the latter half of the film. Llewyn has decided to make his own luck by hitching a ride to Chicago, whereupon he'll meet Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), producer extraordinaire, who will realize his talent and make him a star. His companions for the trip are Roland Turner (Goodman) and Johnny Five (Hedlund), two more eccentric people Llewyn tangles with, and another cat. Llewyn ends up having to take the last leg of the trip on his own, even leaving the cat behind (it's just another being he'll let down, right?). Upon arrival in Chicago, it's clear that despite the conditions he's in, Llewyn is optimistic; he may not trust himself, but he trusts his talent. He meets Grossman, plays for him- and Bud isn't interested. It's not that Llewyn isn't talented, which is clear, but as the man says, it won't sell. I believe the film shows its' soul in this scene. Llewyn croons with a purpose here, his entire career and life leading up to that moment, but that moment has already passed him by. It's heartbreaking to watch, as Llewyn finally get his opportunity but cannot seize it. I loved how the camera slowly zoomed in on him while he played. It was as if we could, for that moment, dare I say, see 'inside Llewyn Davis'.<br/><br/>Very few filmmakers are able to squeeze so much out of what might seem so simple, but the Coens are the masters. This is a flawless film for what it is- a multi-layered character study. On the surface, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" may seem like a basic, quirky story about a few days in the life of a jerk. Digging deeper brings forth a different result- a portrayal of a man who's been calloused by bad luck and what's projected on to him by others. The cycle of unfortunate luck and choices for Llewyn just goes on and on, encapsulated by the final scene of the film. It's a fitting ending for one of the best films of 2013, and we're left to wonder if Llewyn will ever catch a break."
"Red-125","6","2","5","20 March 2014"," Not what folk music was about
","Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) was written and directed by Ethan Coen and Joel Coen.<br/><br/>The film is about a struggling folk musician who can't support himself by singing. We're to assume that he's right at the brink of the folk revival of the 60's, and he's poised to become a star. All he has to do is earn enough money to survive until Bob Dylan and Joan Baez come along to make folk music profitable.<br/><br/>The story doesn't work for me. In the first place, Llewyn (Oscar Isaac) isn't all that talented. (We heard folk music in Ann Arbor, NYC, and Newport in the 1960's, and Llewyn would have been considered OK, but nothing special). <br/><br/>He doesn't appear to have any feel for the music in the sense of where it originated, who may have sung it before, and what historical significance it might have. <br/><br/>He makes fun of an older folk singer, who may be meant to represent someone like Jean Ritchie from Kentucky. Urban folk musicians respected people who learned folk music through the oral tradition. They didn't make fun of them. (Anyway, as a performing artist, Llewyn should have realized how vicious it is to heckle an onstage performer.) <br/><br/>Folk music in the 1960's was always allied with labor struggles, civil rights, and other progressive causes, but Llewyn appears apolitical. <br/><br/>In the movie posters, he's shown carrying a cat. That makes us think that he may not have a place to sleep, but he's not going to abandon his cat. Actually, it's not his cat, and he does abandon it eventually.<br/><br/>Finally, his behavior towards his sister is rotten, he betrays his best friend by having an affair with his friend's partner, and he's cruel to an older couple who try to help him.<br/><br/>Even though the Coen brothers are talented directors, I don't see why people would enjoy a film about a low-talent, unlikeable loser. If you still want to see it, it will work well on DVD.<br/><br/>P.S. This movie includes a road trip from NYC to Chicago. Note to Coen brothers: In 1961 the route between those two cities was not uncharted frontier territory. There were highways and expressways and people used them."
"johnnymurphy15","9","2","5","10 February 2014"," A more stripped down Coen Brothers which slowly grows on you.
","Quirky, original soundtracks and struggling, under achieving characters seem to be somewhat of a forte with the Coen brothers. Here they have succeeded in melding these aspects together again like they did in films like 'A Serious Man', but with more effective results. The opening performance by Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis playing 'Hang Me Oh Hang Me' really sets the tone for the film and the brilliant performance. Here is a man who seems to understand and relate to a song that is essentially about suffering and melancholia. The performance is very honest and he seems to be a man of integrity. As the film goes on, we get to observe Llewyn's behaviour and how he relates to people. We also get some references to his past which I think is critical to attempt why he is the way he is.<br/><br/>We see Llewyn Davis crashing on any available couch his friends have to offer with his guitar in tow. He seems most of the time to be ungrateful to the people around him who try to help and he has gotten his friends wife Jean (Carey Mulligan) pregnant. The scenes between them often end up with Jean berating and insulting Llewyn and frequently calling him either an a**hole or a loser. It is safe to assume that his dire situation is of his own choosing as he does refuse help from his friend. He tells his agent he does not have a winter coat. When offered a coat he rudely declines. In a key scene, he is asked by his friend to perform a song during a social gathering. When the friend starts to harmonise with Llewyn, he gets angry and insults her. This opens a window to his tragic past when he had a collaborator who committed suicide. This, and probably many other things have probably shaped the way he is in this film. He seems cynical because he sees the world as a place were it is difficult to make great art and to do something more than just 'exist' in the conventional sense. He is very stubborn about his music, as to him, it is an honest picture of himself. A vicious circle is formed, as without these experiences or world views, his music would not be as honest and true.<br/><br/>The cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is excellent and integral to the story. The whole film is set in winter, were the hues are mainly cold and drab, you almost feel cold yourself watching it. You see the life get sucked out of Llewyn as he walks the streets, making a concerted effort to get his music out there, leading to a scene where he tells Jean he is tired. It is very subtle, but still left me with the feeling that he doesn't mean just physically, but emotionally as well. The cinematography really brings out the cold world he is in, and to me, how he sees the world. The film does hint at the fact the world he has found himself in is a world he has chosen for himself. He seems very beaten up by life and deep down has low self esteem that maybe he thinks this is all he deserves. Has he fallen victim to a law of attraction which reflects his negative world view or does he just have awful luck? He seems to not have much luck with his music, even though he clearly has talent. He is always in the wrong place at the wrong time and is told that there is no money in his music.<br/><br/>Llewyn Davis is most of the time an unlikeable character, but yet there is a lot of depth to him which made me want to understand him. I felt his character was rightly portrayed empathetically as I did feel sorry for him sometimes. I felt there was some caring attributes in his personality which is where the cat comes in. I feel the cat represents his possibility of success, his drive to succeed and good opportunities which he is presented with. Sometimes he is presented with these opportunities, but he turns them down. One scene which symbolises this is when he drives past a sign which points to a town were his past girlfriend and his child live, but chooses to drive on in treacherous, snowy conditions. We see the headlights illuminating only just in front of his car symbolising his life choices leading him to nowhere and at the same time, choosing a more treacherous, difficult path. I must admit, I did not wholly understand what the cat(s) symbolised or the conclusion of the film. There was definitely a dawning of a new era of folk music when we see snippet Bob Dylan's performance in the Gaslight near the end. This needs to be contrasted with the performance Llewyn witnesses and subsequently spoils with a barrage of drunken insults, a performance which is comparatively more conservative and old fashioned, something Llewyn wants to move away from. I have had the desire of wanting to watch it again to get a clearer picture of it, and to watch the musical performances again, which are all sublime, save for 'Please Mr Kennedy' which is hilarious. The ending also has a refreshing honesty about it. From what you may tell with my review, it may sound like a bleak film, but the signature Coen brothers humour is still present throughout. I think they are masters of mixing humour and sadness in a film.<br/><br/>People have had reservations about this film because of the lack of character arc, but I feel this is one of the best films in years by the Coens. It has a lot of character depth, some profound themes put forward more honestly and some great music. It is a love letter to the folk scene as well as an insightful and complex character study.<br/><br/>Check out my blog - www.projectionistreview.wordpress.com"

","Sadly lacking in buzz this movie. Might it be possible that Greenwich Village in 1961 was an exciting place to be? No sense of that here. Instead a series of cliché characters; light and misplaced spoofing of ""folk"" types - oh what a laugh! with their arran jumpers singing their ""dated"" shanties - This is film-making by numbers and less than I would expect of the Coen Brothers. We've got that cigarette trick. It's 1961 - everybody smokes. Look at them in the Gaslight Cafe. They are all smoking. How quaint! - and heavy-handed. Redeeming features - Sylvia Gauder. Carey Mulligan is good too. Effective plot loop. A mild sense of thwarted artistic endeavour. In general though it's too knowing and measured.<br/><br/>Final positive - good to have the introduction to the music of Mr Van Ronk. His rendering of House of the Rising Sun sublime - on Spotify (from Washington Square)."

","I have been shamelessly recommending their films to everyone I have met for the past half a decade, most of them gave them a watch and hated their films, now I have learned a lesson and try not to recommend their films to anyone. It's surely not everyone's cup of tea. I have been earnestly waiting for Inside Llewyn Davis from ever since I first saw its trailer about a year back. At first instance I shrieked at the idea of Coen brothers making a musical. Dark comedy and musicals does not really go together, does it?. They surely must have compensated on either the musical part or their staple dark comedy. After watching the film (twice) I am bemused at how they have proved me completely wrong. They made a film which is so very much a Coen brother film, and yet an absolutely brilliant musical. The dark comedy, although not that dark at times manages to get better on the 2nd watch and is fascinating. The film is about a folk musician called Llewyn Davis. It is set in the 1960s,an era which gave birth to one of the best country/folk musicians of all time, and ILD is surely a homage to that fact. Llewyn Davis is no rock star , neither is he astutely talented, rather he can be called an underdog, sleeping on couches ,kicked around by people and record companies. His music partner has recently committed suicide and he is failing to come to terms to a solo career. The film chronicles a week in his life. Llewyn Davis is played to perfection by Oscar Issac. The film has a fantastic ensemble cast which gives it the quirky feel it has got. Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman are the most notable of the small but interesting characters in the film. The music from T Bone Burnett transcends all realms and takes you back to the 1960s. As it is the case of many of their films, ILD also has no background music ,the only sources of music are from live performances from various characters in the film. They are mixed in so seamlessly that you don't even notice the background music missing. Cinematography is very well done here.Strangely enough Roger Deakins did not shoot this , hope their long collaboration with the Coens does not come to an end. Bruno Delbonnel shot this and the soft touch he has lend to the film added to the fact that this is in it's basic essence a musical. Deakins may have done a better job but Delbonnel did not disappoint, in fact at parts it was brilliant ILD is funny and depressing at the same time, a combination which can be devastating in the hands of people not belonging to the class of The Coens.You leave feeling amused and sad at the same time.As Peter Bradshaw from The Guardian rightly said the Coens have hit this one out of the park."

","For every Bob Dylan out there, there are hundreds, probably thousands, of musicians who don't make it. Many of them are even very talented, but they're lacking whatever it is they need to break out and become a star.<br/><br/>Meet Llewyn Davis, one of the thousands. Navigating the Greenwich Village folk scene of the 1960s, Davis is a good singer of good songs, but he's stuck on an endless treadmill of existence of his own making. We don't feel sorry for him, because he's a jerk. But we, or at least I, feel compassion for him, because every time he opens his mouth to sing, he expresses the vulnerability and warm humanity that he's not able to express in any other way.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have created a vibrant, unsettling, marvelous movie with ""Inside Llewyn Davis,"" a dark night of the soul journey led by the actor Oscar Isaac, who plays the title character flawlessly. In this overcrowded movie awards season, it's criminal that this film got lost in the shuffle and that virtually no one seems to think it's worthy of serious awards attention. But then again, when I see the films that do win awards, it makes me think that maybe ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is in better company with things as they are.<br/><br/>Grade: A+"
"Bravesfan17","8","2","5","10 January 2014"," Coen Brothers Continue Their Excellence with Oscar Isaac Anchoring
","It goes without saying that Joel Coen and Ethan Coen, a.k.a. The Coen Brothers, are among the top working filmmakers today. They keep showing us repeatedly why they are among the best and proved it again with their latest flick, Inside Llewyn Davis.<br/><br/>The title character, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a folk singer who is not living an ideal life. Llewyn gets himself gigs every once in a while, he lives in New York City, but his records are not selling, his former singing partner has killed himself, and he is crashing on the couches of his friends since he does not have a home. With all of the troubles Llewyn has going on in his life, he cannot catch a break. His friend Jim (Justin Timberlake) cannot give him money without his wife Jean (Carey Mulligan) finding out. Jean is also pregnant and thinks that the child is Llewyn's. She wants an abortion and for Llewyn to pay for it. Inside Llewyn Davis focuses on one week of the title character's life as he does whatever he can to change his life.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are still among the true auteurs out there and still have been doing what they've been doing for 30 years and produce excellent results. Inside Llewyn Davis shows us the Coens have a keen interest in showing us a character who is a loser and make us be interested in this character. As writers, the Coens have crafted a unique story in 1960's New York with quirky characters.<br/><br/>At the front and center of the film is Oscar Isaac as Llewyn Davis. Isaac is very interesting here in becoming this guy who is having no success as a folk singer. Isaac's strong points in his performance are in making us feel sympathy for a guy who is a loser that can't catch a break. Isaac proves that he can make a great leading man.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast do their contributions nicely. Carey Mulligan is the best of the supporting cast as Jean, Jim's wife and a woman who thinks Llewyn is a scumbag but cares for him too. Justin Timberlake is good here as a Jim, a fellow folk singer who brings on Llewyn for a song he wrote. Garrett Hedlund and John Goodman are also fun in their roles as fellow musicians who are travelling to Chicago and let Llewyn ride with them. F. Murray Abraham even has a nice cameo as the owner of a Chicago venue who gives Llewyn an audition.<br/><br/>The technical aspects of this film are well done, like all Coen Brother films. Oscar winner T-Bone Burnett is the music producer and does a nice job with having the music all fit the film. There is beautiful cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel. Frequent Coen collaborator Jess Gonchor does a nice job with the production design and making the sets feel authentic to the time period. Also involved is another frequent Coen collaborator is costume designer Mary Zophres who does not disappoint here. The other major highlight is ""Please Mr. Kennedy"", a song in the film that Llewyn contributes to recording."
"copyright908","8","2","5","10 January 2014"," Absurdity, the spice of life
","The Everly Brothers, The Andrews Sisters, The Carter Family, even Karen and Richard Carpenter; there has always been something special about family harmonies, something that separates them from all the rest no matter how good. <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers, in their filmmaking harmonies, have clearly separated themselves from all the rest. With now a body of work spanning almost 30 years, they rival the accomplishments of any filmmakers anytime, anywhere, and in the vague and general category of Americana, I don't think they can be touched.<br/><br/>"" Inside Llewyn Davis"" is yet another foray into a character's existential journey into a Coen Brother's absurdist reality. Unlike most other Coen Brothers heroes which have a plan they attempt to execute and are resisted by absurd external forces, Llewyn Davis's biggest problem is himself. <br/><br/>A talented singer/musician Davis tries to make his mark in the pre-Dylan Greenwich Village folk scene of the early 1960s. But he can't get out of his own way. He alienates his family and friends; he misses opportunities; and makes careless decisions that will haunt him in the future. He commits to no one and no thing. In fact he's a bit of an A..hole. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac has the difficult task of creating enough empathy for this extremely flawed character so that the audience will follow his journey through the length of the movie. With a certain quiet intensity, he pulls it off. <br/><br/>Isaac fashions the character who is not so much following his own star, but is doing the best he knows how with the talents given to him. In the process of day to day life, Llewyn makes rash and expedient decisions that are largely determined by exigent circumstances that require that decision right now, and invariably those decisions are not so much wrong, but more they just don't work out. <br/><br/>Opportunities are often best seen in hindsight. <br/><br/>The Coen Brothers always create great supporting roles and this is no exception. Justin Timberlake plays Jim Berky a friend and fellow musician of Llewyn who does his best to help Llewyn out. I continue to be amazed at Timberlake's range as an actor.<br/><br/>If you remember his cynical hustler in ""Social Media"", here he plays the exact polar opposite as a naïve stereotypical 60's pre Kennedy Assassination idealist who is absolutely certain that everything is going to turn out alright. <br/><br/>Carrie Mulligan plays Jean Berky (Jim's wife) who has had an adulterous relationship with Llewyn. Mulligan gives a one note performance, always angry and berating Llewyn at every opportunity. It becomes a bit tiresome after a while, especially considering that she takes none of the responsibility for her own condition, but it seems to be what the script calls for so it's hard to blame Mulligan. <br/><br/>John Goodman has his customary role in a Coen Brothers movie, here he plays a bombastic (what else could Goodman play?) passenger in Llewyns car pool to Chicago. I have no idea as to the purpose of this character and its relationship to the rest of the movie, but it's Goodman so it's entertaining to watch. <br/><br/>Just as an aside, I often don't get what's going on in a Coen Brothers movie. To this day I don't really get ""No Country for Old Men"", but I liked it. <br/><br/>F. Murry Abraham has one scene, and he dominates it. A great screen presence, I wish I could see more of him. <br/><br/>And I would be remiss if I did not give the brothers credit for managing a great performance out a big orange tabby cat named Ulysses. It is Ulysses who probably elicits the biggest laugh of the movie. <br/><br/>Coen Brothers fan that I am, this effort is a little too ambiguous for me. I like my characters to have a little direction, whereas the point of this movie seems to be the lack of direction. The brothers admit that there is no real plot to this movie,it is a character study, and the character is not all that appealing.<br/><br/>It's the story of a screw up, but a not degenerate screw up, but a sort of ""everyman"" screw up. Our egos would have to be pretty high and mighty if we were to think that given the circumstances Llewyn found himself in that we might not make the same choices. It is this distinctly Coen Brothers touch that kept me interested in the movie.<br/><br/>Still, in the end Llewyn is a character who one could say gets exactly what he deserves. That he is reaping that which he has sown. <br/><br/>Of course you could say the same thing about ""Citizen Kane"". So there's that."
"Dr_Coulardeau","8","2","5","7 December 2013"," The French love being caressed clockwise
","Inspired from Dave Van Ronk, and his memoirs of course, that folk singer who was born in 1936 and died in 2002. He worked as a guitarist with many other folk singers but also had his own career. And we can trust the Coen brothers to make it an attractive nostalgic bleak story in which they settle some accounts though this part is becoming some kind of an inside joke.<br/><br/>An inside joke of course the union exploitation of workers on the seafront of New York, but that sounds passé and looks obsolete. Union control and tyranny has been a constant motto in the USA and many films have shown it, over and over again, but it became trendy at least thirty years ago to show over and over again too how some have said, ""Enough is enough"" and have pushed back that tyranny and brought unions back to what they are supposed to do: to protects workers and not to defend the privileges of those who are unionized, and buying a union card is nothing but one form of corruption in western countries, unionized if not syndicated corruption.<br/><br/>In the same way accounts are settled concerning producers in the music field, be they label managers, artistic agents or club and bar owners of any kind you can imagine. The art world is a hard world, easy shift of words but true enough and if you want to succeed, talent is not enough, desire and will power are not enough, good music and good lyrics are not enough. You need something else, something more: persistence, stubbornness, one-pointed-ness, serenity and serendipity, and even so you will need a lot of flexibility and resilience. And as the Van Ronk sung in one song of his ""Cocaine is for horses, not for men!"" but flexibility is for men and horses are anything but flexible. If you have the power of a horse, change professions and forget about the stage.<br/><br/>The film gives such a bleak description of that profession, how these artists are exploited by everyone and how they are reduced to go begging for the help and charity of friends and acquaintances. That's pathetic. Because we are living in another world, and those 1960s are so far away, so uninteresting today, so Martian in spirit and Lunar in mind, outlandish, out-spacey, like a black hole in our recent history, when everything was nothing but permanently apocalyptic. <br/><br/>The Coen brothers are just clean and polite about it and avoid everyday problems like clogged bathrooms and stuffed toilets, but they cannot avoid the friendly couple with the wife building the career of the couple on her flexible sexuality, and the husband building the same career of the same couple on his just equally flexible sexuality with producers who prefer boys. Bleak I am telling you. And the wife will have some of the friends of the couple pay for the abortions by making them believe they are the fathers with some silly aggressive joke on having to wear double condoms next time. <br/><br/>No surprise that the French public loves the films and that Amazon.fr has the French dubbed DVD already for pre-order on their site whereas the English version ,is not available on other Amazon sites. The Coen Brothers are becoming the doppelgangers of Woody Allen in all possible ways. The French public is not very big but it is faithful and gullible. That's the type of film that will enchant them with some pleasure because it is bleak without being dirty, anti-American without being jingoistic, anti-capitalist without being communistic. In other words it will satisfy their desire to attack this modern world and at the same time it will target and hit off the point, which means it will let them go on enjoying their decadent blind self-satisfaction. The brothers even play the ""pulp fiction"" trick of starting the film with the last scene or finally developing to the end the first scene only at the very last moment of the film.<br/><br/>Dr Jacques COULARDEAU"
"diana_phillips","8","4","14","29 October 2013"," Typical Coen brothers movie
","I always love the quirkiness of a Coen brothers script, and this film definitely hits that mark. The lead actor, Oscar Isaac, is terrific. It's rare that you find an actor who is also a good musician. What I found very unauthentic was the language. I was in my early twenties in the early 60's, and I don't remember people cursing that much. Unless musicians and New Yorkers were that much different, people just didn't talk like that. I don't know why writers always feel they have to be so over the top with the language. Sometimes it's just too much and becomes offensive. A good story otherwise. I loved the production design and T. Bone Burnett's soundtrack."

","It is hard to believe the same guys who made ""No Country for Old Men"" and ""Fargo,"" and several other of the greatest things to touch celluloid could be responsible for this. They should be at the height of their abilities, not misfiring so badly.<br/><br/>This is a movie about a jerk, and not in the Steve Martin sense. Davis isn't an anti-hero who does things you secretly wish you could do or has some justification that allows you to understand--if not sympathize--with his behavior. He does not remind you of your quirky friend or relative that is hard to take sometimes but has qualities that make his company tolerable. No, Davis is someone you want to see beat down in the hardest possible way. When you learn early in the film that Davis's partner offed himself, I started to think: I don't blame him. I would too if I had to spend time with this guy. Then I remembered I had paid for the privilege of doing so. At least I enjoyed my popcorn.<br/><br/>Movies where there is no compelling plot are called ""character studies."" This isn't even that. It is like ""Men Behaving Badly,"" that goes on too long. Davis's performances and music are not even the best in the film, so you can't call him brilliant but flawed. Just moderately talented but unlikable.<br/><br/>90% of the screenplay consists of the words f**k, s**t, and a**h*l*. I'm not a prude about foul language, but its just lazy writing if this is the meat of your dialog rather than the spice.<br/><br/>What makes it worse is that the early 60's folk scene is such an interesting time with incredible characters and stories. Why didn't they make a film about Mulligan's character? That might have been worth watching."

"disinterested_spectator","4","2","6","26 April 2017"," Pretentious Frills
","The Coen brothers have made a movie about a self-important, obnoxious bum who sponges off people because he believes he was meant for better things than holding down a job. But such a movie, without any frills, would immediately be dismissed as irritating and boring. And so it needs some frills.<br/><br/>First, they decided to make this bum a folk singer. They had previously made the movie ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" (2000), which succeeded with people that liked the music, although it failed miserably with anyone that did not. So maybe they figured this movie would appeal to people that like folk music. And even if the folk music in the movie is pretty bad, at least as far as the music performed by the title character is concerned, we know we are supposed to overlook the fact that he is a self-important, obnoxious bum because he is an artist, and that means we are supposed to care.<br/><br/>Frill number two is a cat. Having a cat continually appear and then disappear gives the movie a motif, making it appear that there is some deeper, hidden meaning to it all. There isn't, but something has to get this movie on its legs. The cat eventually turns out to have the name Ulysses. Gosh, you mean the return of the cat is like the return of Ulysses? Well, telling a dumb story with parallels to ""The Odyssey"" worked for James Joyce, so maybe the Coen brothers figured it would work for them too. And it recalls the main character in the movie ""O Brother Where Art Thou?"" So make that two dumb movies by the Coen brothers that are supposed to be spiced up somehow by alluding Homer's epic, with the second one also alluding to the first.<br/><br/>Finally, there is a time loop. Sort of. Except that in the second iteration of the time loop, the cat does not get away. Now, there are some pretty good time loop movies. ""Dead of Night"" (1945) was the first movie I know of to try this, and it worked fairly well. And, of course, the greatest such movie is ""Groundhog Day"" (1993). But does a time loop belong in a movie about a folk singer? I mean, some genres don't really mix well. It's like a movie that starts out as a murder mystery, and halfway through, while we are trying to figure out who done it, Godzilla comes to town. However, the Coen brothers were desperate for another frill to keep this movie from seeming to be what it really is, and so a time loop is what we get."
"b_fett66","1","2","6","29 March 2015"," Avoid if unless you are a huge folk music fan
","I found this movie tedious in the extreme with no story, characters who had little appeal and repetitive music. Unless you happen to love this kind of music you won't be entertained in the least and will regret the time you invested. I'm avoiding the Cohen's movies from now on. The pace of the story was slow to say the least. Most of it consists mainly of lead trying to find somewhere to sleep for the night, driving around and singing or listened to others sing folk songs. These songs mostly sound the same and are depressing. The highlight of the whole thing is a chase for a missing ginger Tom. I really can't think where on earth the positive reviews come from. Maybe it is best viewed after taking drugs?"
"ZedMovie","10","2","6","1 January 2014"," The time is right, but the personality is all wrong! **** Spoiler Alerts****
","First off, if you are looking for a better movie examining the life of a struggling artist, watch Al Pacino's ""Chinese Coffee"". To me that is more palpable than this movie, dialog wise puts this film to complete shame, acting wise, this movie is not even in the same league, even though I have to say it was well acted, but Chinese Coffee lacks the cinematic factor which gains so much more points these days and this movie has all the colors and camera work to substitute for that. Google the AL Pacino's Chinese Coffee movie and watch a youtube scene and judge for yourself. This movie is more poetic though, which leads to the viewer thinking in a different way when walking away from the movie. Don't get me wrong, I love the Coen brothers and find them a staple of movie making of our time with almost no one to match them in ticket price worth. Though disappointed with No Country for old men, which to me missed much of the major points in the book (There was a reason the book was called No Country for old Men and proves that most of the Oscar voters are not exactly concerned with the book's meaning if they even read it) and the most important scenes with Moss talking to the girl on the drive were completely missing! I can't help but love most of their work. They always leave you fascinated with the abstract of what we call normality and pull you into the scene in a very comfortable way regardless of the situation. <br/><br/>However, the reviews on IMDb show that most people had their own interpretation of the movie and the characters which is usually a good sign that the movie makers did their job right. Being an outsider to folk music, I have personally delved further into looking at the artists portrayed and finding jewels like Tom Paxton.<br/><br/>It's tough to think about this movie without being at odds about how I feel about it. I felt as though we didn't delve enough into the protagonist. He seems frozen by resentment and anger but short of knowing that he had a partner that committed suicide we don't know too much about how he was before as a person and an artist. We know he wasn't much of a success as a duet and learn that he doesn't want to get into a group again either. The root of anger wasn't just the lack of success, but there is a deeper cut here. One of the clues to me was when he gets upset at playing his music at a dinner table for guests and screams out that this is what he does for work although a couple times later he plays for others in a non-working environment (which confuses me more). Maybe, he is not enjoying it anymore in his own personal life and it's become a job. He seems like a purist and judges others who have goals that possibly lead to a suburban life instead of the art itself but maybe that is just envy. In another scene, he has his sister dispose remnants of his childhood without a second thought. The reason given is professional and lacks any personal explanation, letting me to believe he had an unhappy childhood or maybe his past is not important. I don't believe anyone easily disposes such personal items. I can step back and look at his character simply as an unsuccessful angry artist, but I think I wouldn't be doing it justice. There is more going on here, even if much of it lies in anger and resentment. <br/><br/>He seems to live in the moment and for most part the moments seem miserable to him. In an interview, the Coen brothers suggested that we all know someone like that who screws up his relationships with harsh unnecessary words. This is true, but he is also fed up with fake social behaviors. In a scene when he turns down a kindness of his agent giving him a jacket, he responds with unkind words, saying something about the gesture being fake, and he ends up being right. Charming, he is not but you can't disagree with his reactions all the time, especially when he gets fed up in the car with John Goodman's wisdom. The problem is that he has no balance and being desperate, unloved and struggling just to find a roof over your head does that to most of us. Accepting that your best is not good enough is a tough pill to swallow and if you have ever taken a risk to bypass the 9 to 5 soul killer and failed at it, you might relate to him more. I personally don't think he even knows he is a mean person, he catches himself being wrong but as a general view of himself, to me he appears clueless, much like the rest of us until someone points it out. The other artists around him seem much more relaxed and seem to be producing great works too but they seem more forgiving of themselves. None of them seem to be struggling with survival as much as him, but they are not that far off either. I think the saddest part of the story and maybe part of the message of this movie is that you can't let your failures dictate who you are. As short as life is, it's long enough to adjust and you need to find that strength after you have given yourself time and permission to recover. All and all, it was worth seeing it to me and I look forward to their next movie. <br/><br/>Please ignore the star rating, I personally think its more related on how you felt about life on that day or maybe what you consumed before the movie! Its an excellent film overall, so it only deserves one rating."

The Coen Brothers' ode to the early '60s folkie scene in NYC focuses on misanthropic singer Davis (Isaac in a fine turn) whose knack for pissing off those he encounters runs neck-and-neck with his musical talents while keeping stardom (and any kind of hope for relationships) at arm's length. Great production design by Jess Gonchor and Bruno Delbonnel's bruised cinematography perfectly capture the essence of Greenwich Village in its hey-day."

","The title character is a struggling folk singer in New York's Greenwich Village in the early 1960s. His many troubles lead him to bum favours off many people. ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is directed by the Coen brothers.<br/><br/>This film has a handicap like other recent films such as ""The Wolf of Wall Street"" and ""Blue Jasmine"" - the main character is very unlikeable. The other films have various strengths to overcome and rise above this handicap but this is not the case with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"".<br/><br/>Though Oscar Isaac does well in the main role, his character is hard to take for various reasons. Despite his desperate situation, he lives in the delusion that he is superior to those who don't share his bohemian lifestyle aspirations. He also shows little or no gratitude to those who do great favours for him.<br/><br/>As his journey includes negative karma hitting home (in typical Coen schadenfreude fashion) with only a few moments of humour and warmth, this makes for difficult viewing. He's not all bad. Some scenes do show signs of a deeper humanness but they are too few. The other characters don't fare much better. The only characters that might generate empathy are cats.<br/><br/>With little humour or charm to lighten the ride, thankfully the music is the most uplifting part of this film. Isaac is a superb singer and he performs great songs beautifully as do the film's other musicians. The film could also be given credit for using cinematography and other aspects to recreate an era long gone.<br/><br/>There are living folk singers who remember the time and place depicted in this film.

","The main character is a passable folk singer who is grieving the suicide of his former partner, as he tries to find success in the early 60s folk scene of Greenwich Village.
He has alienated almost everyone he knows. As the week of his life unfolds, a series of mishaps involving two cats and two awful traveling buddies just adds to the misery.
Even his few crumbs of good luck are tainted with guilt and more misfortune.
What's the point of this movie? A great cast with great performances, wasted on a drudge of a story that wallows in sadness. Was the early 60s folkscene really so grim?"

","Not suited for the popcorn loving masses. Stay away, this is not your cup of tea! Having said that I can now praise this wonderful Coen Brothers gem for all those who are curious about these genius movie twins. Any one who knows the Coen Brothers wont be reading these reviews, they will be watching their magnificent work. However for all those who dont yet know who the Coen Brothers are, this review might be very helpful with my one and only advice: go watch it.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers do it their way. Instead of making a movie about the glorified period in Greenwich Village that put Bob Dylan in the spotlights, they made a movie of the bland period BEFORE that truly gifted singer songwriter saw the light. Who would dare do that, other than the Coen Brothers? Who would dare make a movie about a singer songwriter that has no talent?<br/><br/>Every Coen Brothers movie is full of losers: people who just fail at everything they aim for. This story aint no different. It's about Oscar Isaac trying to make it in the music business of the early sixties. And he fails miserably. But the meticulous portrait of his failing is done so splendidly, that it is a great joy to watch this man fall from grace.<br/><br/>""A fantastic true life"" drama was the quote from a disney poster that was featured in this movie. And true to life this story is. Bleak, grey and going nowhere. Nothing happens. A man loses a cat. A man finds a cat. A man goes to Chicago and returns from Chicago. He goes with nothing and he returns with nothing. Well, he has gained something: the wisdom and insight that his music carreer and his life are going nowhere. All this bland, depressing waste of effort is photographed, edited, scored and acted in such a brilliant way that I honestly dare say, that this movie gets better every time I watch it. No longer the story is relevant, but the depressing mood, that smothers every scene. And that mood is one of quiet despair and loneliness. No director can portray loss and despair with such grace as the Coen Brothers have done with ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Magnificent!"

","Garrett Hedlund<br/><br/>Yes, I'd have to say that watching this film was worth seeing Garrett Hedlund. I have liked his voice since hearing him sing in the film 'Country Strong.' Other than that, this was a dreary, sad, grim depiction of NYC life - and fairly accurate if you do have to be in that city when the sun is not shining and you don't happen to live in one of the fancier boxes they call apartments or even houses. <br/><br/>The main character is unlikeable - so unlikeable that I did not want to learn the pronunciation of his name. I did not care. Lucky for the audience, the scriptwriters stress the pronunciation of his name half-way through the movie so that you have to remember it. Is it important to like the main character? No. But it helps to have some shred or spark of charm to catch your attention. <br/><br/>I'm a bit familiar with folk music and live coffee-house folk music. I'm more than a bit familiar with the Hootenanny generation (that was my generation). I even have a relative who sings in coffee houses and writes songs. It is that dreary, yes - scrambling to play for a pittance. Only the very devoted and dedicated stay with it hoping to someday have a life that allows them to pay rent money from this kind of work. <br/><br/>Having Bob Dylan sing in the coffee house at the end was the perfect wrap-up to this film for me. His voice is very cat like, twangy, even yowl-y as a cat might yowl. He is a song writer but a crappy singer. Still, a very successful one.<br/><br/>Which should inspire all Llewyn-type characters: if Dylan can sing and twang his vocal chords as well as guitar chords with fabulous success, so can you!"

","I was very disappointed in this movie and I really wanted to like it as I am a fan of the Coen Brother's work. The character arc never occurred and I patiently waited for it to happen, but alas, nothing. There was no real character development and the film didn't go anywhere. Davis was in the same sad, loser position at the end as in the beginning. The usual cast of offbeat characters were here with John Goodman once again in a role that lets him bring out his weird side. Oscar Issac did a fine job and can sing but the music was not too my taste. Carey Mulligan got to play an angry women and pretty well stayed that way throughout the film. I don't see a great deal of growth in what the Coen's are doing now from their start and like the older stuff better as if was more offbeat and unusual. This was just boring.

"ElMaruecan82","9","1","2","23 September 2016"," Behind the moody enigma, a simple but beautiful statement: ""just respect the music""...
","In ""O' Brother, Where Are Thou"", one of the best parts of a rather inconsequential comedy, was the catchy and somewhat penetrating singing of ""A Man of Constant Sorrow"", a little musical hit that played as significant a part to the plot that the role bluegrass music really played to appease people's anguishes during the Great Depression. In a way, folk songs were both the artistic outcomes and the fitting cure of these times of melancholia. And maybe this is why the Coen brothers decided to pay a second tribute to folk music, through their moody character study of fictional folk singer, Llewyn Davis, played by Oscar Isaac, a real revelation to me.<br/><br/>Study is an overstatement though as you don't learn much about folk music from ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" except maybe the most essential thing, which is that music is something to respect, no matter where it comes from, and whom it addresses, music is a language that belongs to someone, borrows from a few ones and is shared with everyone. It's not just about the journey about Llewyn Davis consisting of many attempts to rise as a star and immediate falls, it's the journey of music within his experience. And adversity is the stuff music drains its creativity from, human suffering, folk songs are about everyday struggles, the haunting ""Auld Hand Triangle"" is a ballad about prison and hell, even the upbeat ""Please, Mr. Kennedy"" is about someone who doesn't go to space.<br/><br/>""Who wrote this?"" disdainfully asks Davis, and Justin Timberlake's answer is priceless ""I did"" no big deal but he says it with such confidence that you better believe he takes pride in it, and why shouldn't he? In a later scene, Davis is asked to perform a song in front of friendly guests and for some reason, he's reluctant, refusing to be treated like a trained poodle, this is his way of living, and can't just sing like that. This attitude is rather contradictory with the way he criticized people with careerist moves, and his evocation of myths when it comes to the building of a star's image. In a way, Davis needlessly mystifies his Art when talked about career and when he's given professional advice, he brandishes the Artist card. Is he deliberately dishonest or innately erroneous?<br/><br/>Character studies are never as interesting as when they deal with people full of contradictions, and Davis strikes like someone who's never really come to term with his personal issues, he holds his Art into high regard, but he refuses to make any concessions that could allow him to reach his goal. There's one thing though, he loves his music and he's never as convincing and mesmerizing as when he takes the guitar and sings, the rest of the time, he's hesitant, clumsy and pathetic, letting his impregnated girlfriend (Carey Mulligan) treat like him dirt without a reaction. Davis hasn't found his language to reach people, it might be music, but the film takes place in the musical sequence that came before Bob Dylan, so we know Davis won't be the 'chosen one'.<br/><br/>Now, are we supposed to feel sorry for him? Maybe. Maybe not. I did recognize a pattern though: everyone who didn't show respect to someone's music got somewhat punished at the end. It starts with Roland Turner, a teasing instrumentalist played by John Goodman. When Davis, tells him he's a folk singer, the answer is ""I thought you were a musician"". Later, the pompous prick is found lying on the toilet floor, victim of an epileptic stroke. At the end, Davis is also put in the same place, hit by someone who seems to have a problem with him. The ending scene is the opening, but it's only at the end that we realize the reason of the aggression, like the punch-line of a song, and in a way, Davis had it coming for having disrespected music.<br/><br/>""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is perhaps the most enigmatic Coen brothers' film since ""Barton Fink"" and there are many similarities between Fink and Davis. These are two men who believe they are in touch with life, through their status as artists and common men, but they're not. Fink is so obsessed to be called a common man that he turns it into a concept that is totally unlike the world, and alienates himself physically (small hotel room) and morally (existential block). At the end, he really doesn't know where he stands for. And Davis is so wrapped up in his artistic ego that he's incapable to male concessions. And he's lost. But he'd rather give up than destroying his life, indeed, , there comes a point when self-esteem and passion interfere.<br/><br/>The merit of ""Inside Lwellyn Davis"" is not to deal with this enigmatic character by writing a complex plot full of symbolism. This is a straightforward, rather neutral story, set in New York City of the 60's before what would be considered the greatest musical sequence of rock' n' roll 1963-1973. Even the cinematography is pastel, and gray as to illustrate this neutral period before the rebellious explosion, or the gray area where we can't really label Davis. In a way, he embraced the incertitude and transitional aspect of his time, being both a protagonist and a victim, loving so much his music he failed to respect the others.<br/><br/>The film doesn't strike as a Coen masterpiece but there's something truthful and sincere about it. That they managed to hire actors who were also talented show that the Coen brothers really wanted to make the music believable and were lucky enough to find that special something and I bet they would have abandoned the project if a talent like Oscar Isaac didn't pop up. And indeed, there's not one single music scene that feels acted or artificial, I guess that's also out of respect to music."

","For those of you who are considering seeing this movie, a few thoughts:<br/><br/>From my point of view, the user-reviewers who didn't like it missed out on the subtleties and complexities of character and tone. A movie's not obliged to follow the same form as most, or tell a story we've heard before. <br/><br/>There's odd, dry humor that percolates through it, as you might expect from the Coen brothers, but this is their more serious side. <br/><br/>Unlike many of their other movies, this has a more sincere warmth to go with the darkness, the oddness, and the intelligence.<br/><br/>It's a rich, sad, dark winter's tale. It's the kind of stiff drink of storytelling that would not be out of place in the Bible or Gilgamesh or other classic literature. It's about a man stuck in a time and place and manner of being, as he hits up against the limits of what is possible for him, and often is his own worst enemy. <br/><br/>See this when you are in the mood for more nutritious entertainment, and feel free to give yourself just enough distance from the main character that you can have a good look at what makes him human. <br/><br/>The music is great, and it's all live performances."

","Inside Llewyn Davis is a depressing comedy, a glimpse into a struggling folk singer's life during one week in the 1960's.<br/><br/>The first half of the movie is slow as Llewyn ping pongs around the Village and New York, causing disruption everywhere he goes. Oscar Isaac unflinchingly plays the dislikeable title character; a sincere to a fault, because it impedes upon his ability to be successful, freeloading folk singer newly solo due to the suicide of his duo partner Mike. Frustrated, dejected and broke, he leaves on a road trip to Chicago and the story's components converge to a chaotic culmination one expects from an Ethan and Joel Coen film.<br/><br/>Teeming with talent and thoroughly Coen, the movie is full of quirky characters of a beatnik persuasion. Unfortunately, with the rare exception, most portrayals are forgettable – Carey Mulligan, John Goodman, and Garret Hedlund included. Justin Timberlake is ultimately the least successful of the bunch and his casting is a misstep. His acting is an out of place self-aware parody of a folk singer from the 1960′s. With the exception of Oscar Isaac, Adam Driver, whom most know as the love interest of Lena Dunham's character in Girls, is hilariously sincere and scene stealing in the minor role of Al Cody.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis contains all the successful ingredients typical of a Coen Brothers motion picture but is lacking the charm that typically enamors viewers. It is artificially bleak, reliant upon post-production, and fundamentally contrived.<br/><br/>Our website contains more movie and film reviews."

The only thing which kept me captivated was the way the film was shot and the fact that the Coen brothers usually deliver.<br/><br/>The film left me not wanting to view anything with Oscar Isaac in again due to his lifeless approach to acting and 100 minutes in I was still waiting for the film to start never mind finish.

"cleary-joshua","9","1","2","12 July 2014"," This is a continuation of the dark sense of humour that the Coen Brothers have thrived on...
","I have to confess that I don't know as much of the work of the Coen Brothers as I'd like to. I've seen ""No Country for Old Men"", ""True Grit"" and ""O Brother, Where Are Thou"", all of which I adored, and ""The Ladykillers"", which really isn't as bad as people said it was. Their dark sense of humour and ability to capture beautiful scenes is what sets them apart from the crowd as directors. Naturally, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is no different, with brilliant black comedy and memorable cinematography, except this time, just like ""O Brother"", we have the pleasure of music as well.<br/><br/>The title character, played by Oscar Isaac, is a folk singer living in Greenwich Village in 1961, around the same time as Bob Dylan. Nothing goes right in his life, with his singing partner's recent suicide and his failing solo album both adding to his depression. He is homeless as well, but despite so many bad things he doesn't give up, and constantly continues to try and make it. This is not always helped by the people around him, including his friend Jean (Carey Mulligan) who tells him that she's pregnant and it might be his, and the always odious Roland Turner (John Goodman). The Coens write their characters extremely well, and they all have believable relationships with each other. They can give us a first impression with so few words too, which makes the characters even stronger. Their writing is as strong as always, with their eye for dark comedy coming through constantly. There are so many devastating scenes which you can't help but laugh at, or throw away lines that make you chuckle despite their grave nature. Goodman's line, ""George Washington Bridge? You throw yourself off the Brooklyn Bridge, traditionally. George Washington Bridge? Who does that?"" is mere genius.<br/><br/>Three things, apart from the plot, make this film such a joy to watch. Firstly, the acting is brilliant. Isaac's performance is bold and intimate, making us long for him to succeed so much. Among the supporting characters, Goodman, Mulligan, surprisingly Justin Timberlake and F. Murray Abraham all leave their mark with brilliant, funny or devastating scenes. And the cat that Llewyn is charged with looking after for so long is also great. The cinematography is great too, with the film being shot with a bleak, saturated lens. It feels dark and appropriate for the setting, but doesn't become too noticeable so as to be annoying. And finally the music is brilliant. All of the songs are memorable and well sung, with ""The Death of Queen Jane"" being my particular favourite, mainly because Isaac sings it so well. They don't feel pointless in the film, but there are times where you can just sit back and enjoy them.<br/><br/>""Inside Llewyn Davis"" won't please everyone, because there are people who simply just don't 'get' the Coen Brothers' sense of humour. But for those that do, it's incredibly rewarding, and undoubtedly one of their best works yet. It was utterly robbed of a Best Picture nomination in February, and I cannot understand for the life of me why."

He has done stuff before that is good (like in the latest Bourne movie, the first without Matt Damon that is), but this is his star vehicle.<br/><br/>And you can tell he put a lot into the movie and he makes it work. He sings himself and he can apparently sing. But he doesn't treat the character like a saint or someone without flaws. There is a lot wrong with him, but you have to embrace that.

","My Inside Llewyn Davis review Telling the down spiraling story of a struggling folk performer, Inside Llewyn Davis manages to charm it's audience and give them something to meditate in the following days.<br/><br/>The one that makes the movie work in every way and is the essential part of the movie is the one and only Oscar Isaac. After this film I decided I absolutely respect this man. Not only for his amazing performance as an actor, as he perfectly plays the conflicted and subtly funny character the bros wrote for him, but as a folk performer who hits every emotional note as he sings. Another thing is that the songs where filmed live by the Coen Brothers and that peaks the challenge for Oscar Isaac just to the point to be amazed.<br/><br/>While the other actors are bypassing side-characters (except for Carrey Mulligan who is more present than the others) all of them manage to play their roles pretty awesomely and feel like Joel and Ethan Coen picked them very specifically for the characters they wrote, as every one of them understands how they must play their figure so that the subtle comedy can work. This film showed us the ability that the Coen Bros possess to write original characters.<br/><br/>The dialog was fun to watch as you always expected a dose of crude humor to suddenly pop up. And that's another aspect that was handled pretty good. The humor in the movie is very subtle, natural but never over used, and it comes mainly from the dialog and the performances who hit every humorous note needed.<br/><br/>Scene selection is something that the Coen Bros excel at, and now that folk song selection is their thing too. These songs fit the mood of the movie perfectly which is bleak but at the same time sympathetic. And plus the beautiful photography this is a well done package.<br/><br/>Being said, this movie isn't a cheerful one. Llewyn takes quite a life beating in many scenes and it may be a little melancholic for some viewers.But it knows it's themes and works with them in such a way that you won't get this film out of your head in a few nights.<br/><br/>I just said that because this movie is deeper than just simply Llewyn's journey this movie has metaphors and symbolism in it that won't be easy to find but movie lovers will love to dig through the internet for answers. And that will be a gripe for some too. Many will feel confused because they just wanted to watch a fun movie or just sit back, relax and look at some meaningless crap (I sometimes like doing that too).<br/><br/>So in the end, great movie, amazing music, great acting, an awesome pretext for making your brain hurt by analyzing it but clearly not aimed at the general audience. I am giving this movie a 9/10. Check my other reviews at http://thechannelofawesome.blogspot.mx/"
"StevePulaski","10","1","2","30 April 2014"," Plunges you into its character's world and bathes you with his emotions
","While watching Joel and Ethan Coen's Inside Llewyn Davis, a film that undoubtedly details a fierce bout of depression its titular character is battling, I became deeply upset and sorrowful, to the point of simply not saying much while viewing it, lumbering through the remainder of my night, and finally, going to bed with a lump in my throat. I awake this morning to write the film's review in a more refreshed but still fragile state-of-mind.<br/><br/>This is one of the strongest impacts a film has had on me in quite sometime. On this basis alone, the film deserves a glowing review, but thankfully, the film is stuffed with greatness that appears to be bursting from the seams, so that part isn't tricky. What's tricky is to convince you, the reader who perhaps hasn't seen Inside Llewyn Davis, why it's so great and why it's the next film you need to see. My only condition before continuing is you promise not to ignore this recommendation because the film is ""depressing"" or ""sad."" Set in New York City's Greenwich Village in 1961, the film follows a week in the life of Llewyn Davis (Oscar Issac), a depressed and struggling folk singer, who has just lost his singing partner Mike Timlin after he throws himself off the George Washington Bridge. Llewyn is now stuck in a funk, forced to continue his singing career by himself, which we can see isn't going so well. Llewyn's performances in folk lounges and in impromptu meeting sessions is great, but one can tell he stood behind his partner Mike when performing. Llewyn clearly needs someone to help him sound more polished, but because he's forced to be on his own, this makes getting gigs and being accepted into the folk world that much more difficult.<br/><br/>Llewyn is as wayward as one can be, currently not living anywhere, and frequently staying in the apartment of his closest acquaintances Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan). Jim finds Llewyn to be a good guy to work with, while Jean loathes him; she tells him to his face that he is ""King Midas's idiot brother,"" for everything he touches turns to s***. Jean also reveals to Llewyn that she is pregnant, and fearing that there is a chance that Llewyn could be the father, decides to abort the child to do away with it entirely. Everywhere Llewyn goes, he finds little to no acceptance; even a mildly optimistic drive to Chicago with two other musicians results in Jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) browbeating him the whole way. His only companion is his neighbor's (metaphorical) cat, whom Llewyn guards with his life and lugs around with him wherever he goes, despite frequently losing it.<br/><br/>Watching Llewyn be verbally assaulted, mistreated, and unappreciated, you just want to shed tears, which is what I did within minutes of the film. During the first few minutes, we hear the beautifully-sung tune ""Fare Thee Well,"" which Llewyn sung with Mike, while watching a clearly broken Llewyn riding the subway with the cat he so lovingly protects from danger. Yet, despite a scene like this, one questions how much we can sympathize with Llewyn. While he is clearly facing a deep, professionally and emotionally affecting depression, we see him neglect important things, like the feelings of his acquaintances, personal responsibilities, his constant refusal to compromise, and so forth. Some viewers may find Llewyn difficult to sympathize with; once you realize that many of his actions are likely attributable to his severe bout of depression is when the character becomes easy to have sympathy for.<br/><br/>Llewyn wouldn't be the character he is without the help of Oscar Isaac, an incredible new find of an actor who you will hear more and more about in the next few years - mark my words. Isaac nails the beautiful nuances and facial expressions that indicate something is right with our protagonist. He handles the outbursts, the heartbreak, the smug wit, and the complications of Llewyn with biting realism and understated craft, never becoming too over-the-top nor too subtle and inhuman. Other talents that encompass the picture are Mulligan, Timberlake, and Goodman, all of which bringing their own character to the table in an effective manner.<br/><br/>Then there's the incredible music and cinematography that just loan themselves to the material at hand. The music, first and foremost, is riveting, built from the ground up on some of the catchiest and most memorable folk ballads you've heard in years. From the exceptional ""Fare Thee Well,"" to the goofy and infectious ""Please Mr. Kennedy,"" the smooth and soothing ""Five Hundred Miles,"" and the somber performances of ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" by Llewyn, which bookends the film, everything about the picture's soundtrack is moving and effective. Then there's the beautifully bleak visuals, thanks to renowned cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who effectively personifies depression through the film's excessive black and gray visuals. If you call the film's palette of colors ""ugly,"" you're only reemphasizing the feelings of the protagonist of the film.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis plunges you into its lead character's world utilizing what could be classifiable as mumblecore filmmaking techniques, giving you many different emotions to feel and many different instances that you can either quietly laugh at or simply sulk at. Watching this film, as stated, was an incredibly emotional experience for myself, not on a personal level but a human level. The Coen brothers have gone on to detail one of the best films about depression and loss that I have yet to see and, in addition, have made a film that speaks to the folk music world in a lyrics and themes far too many of them probably understand."

","The Coen brothers don't seem to feel bound by any particular genre, and that's a lovely thing for their viewers. With Inside Llewyn Davis, the writer/director duo delivers a gem of a movie about New York's 1960s folk music scene. Told in a pseudo-documentary style, the flick follows fictional Dylan-era singer Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) as he spends a week bopping from couch to floor to car, from New York to Chicago and back again, pursuing a career in music even as he becomes less enchanted with his calling—or at least with the lifestyle it entails.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is told so skillfully and with such authority that you imagine Llewyn really was part of Bob Dylan's scene. The film is grounded by a fabulous performance from Isaac, who nails the singing and guitar playing along with the acting. It also features an excellent soundtrack, produced by industry mogul T Bone Burnett.<br/><br/>As you would expect from looking in on a week in the life of a talented, vagabond musician, the film unveils a fascinating smattering of characters, human and otherwise, who cross Llewyn's path. The supporting cast includes John Goodman, a scene-stealer as bluesman Roland Turner, and Isaac's Drive costar Carey Mulligan as songstress Jean, showing off the vocal chops she debuted in Shame.<br/><br/>Overall, Inside Llewyn Davis is an emotional arrangement rich with mood and atmosphere; watching it often feels more like dropping in at a club than taking in a movie. There isn't always a clear direction, but each performance leaves you with the impulse to clap. And it's all wrapped up in an interesting finale that perfectly ties the film to time and place.<br/><br/>This is a great picture. I'll be surprised if it doesn't wind up with more than a few nods, come Oscar season."

Set in the Village in 1961, just before the big commercial folk boom took off, ""Llewyn"" is a dry, sardonic tale that asks the musical trivia question ""The first time that Dylan played the Gaslight, who was the guy that went on right before him?"" Oscar Isaac doesn't have the pipes of a great trad singer like Van Ronk or Ewan MacColl, but he does pretty well by the songs, and he gives a great performance as an actor. Llewyn loves the music, doesn't want to go back to just ""existing"" (specifically, signing on as a merchant seaman, like his father), but he's too hard-edged and uncompromising to do more than just scrape by. After he blows an audition by singing a dismal Child ballad (why not ""Cocaine Blue""? D'oh!), the clubowner offers him a spot in a new commercial folk trio if he shaves his beard and just keeps the goatee (that's Peter, Paul and Mary for you younger folks), but Llewyn just shakes his head.<br/><br/>The story's played pretty straight; Coen brothers weirdness mostly occurs on a roadtrip to Chicago in the company of a junkie jazzman (that's the John Goodman part), a mumbling Beat poet and a big orange cat. Survivors of that era may hear echoes not only of Van Ronk but Tom Paxton, Ramblin' Jack Elliott, Jean Ritchie (the gentle ballad singer that Llewyn heckles), plus an a capella version of the Clancy Brothers; a few red-diaper babies may even get the throwaway joke about the Schachtmanites. I must admit I was dubious at first, about both ""Llewyn"" and Llewyn (he's not a very relatable character, as they say), but being a confirmed Coen bros. fan, I watched the disk again and was totally won over."
"peppecannone","4","1","2","28 February 2014"," Stuck in the middle of nowhere
","Well this is my first review, and the reason I'm writing it is I'm really disappointed with this movie.<br/><br/>I've seen all Coen's bros works and I can tell you this is the worst, by far. It's not just that folk music's not everybody's cup of tea, is just that apart from the mellifluous folk songs (which I admit I hate) there is nothing. The main character is nor good or bad: things just happen to him, the most going the wrong way, but no tragedies either. And you can just have a laugh or two, but the movie is not going deeper than that.<br/><br/>Many say this movie is close to ""A serious man"", but while there we assisted to the personal crisis of a man's beliefs and values, here the main character is going nowhere, is stuck in the middle of nowhere: you leave him exactly the way you found him and knowing little more about him and about what he really feels. In facts, he shows no values or believes at all, good or evil ones. I'd say more: while you can easily watch and enjoy ""A serious man"" without knowing anything about Jewish culture and traditions, it's really hard to enjoy ""Inside Llewin Davis"" without liking folk or indie rock music. Because this movie is definitely a musical one, seen that there are more tunes here that in ""The sound of music"".<br/><br/>So being this not one of Coen's ""serious"" movies, of course not one of Coen's ""funny"" movies, the plot being not the reason to watch it and being the photography the only enjoyable thing, I should say this is one to avoid, suitable just for Coen maniacs and indie rock freaks."

","This film tells the story of a young struggling folk singer, and his eventful week in New York.<br/><br/>""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is the title of the album by the title Character, Llewyn Davis. It is not creating ripples across the nation in the 1960's USA, and he struggles to make ends meet. He crashes in various friends' places, a few days at a time. His encounters with these friends are eventful, but they do not seem to get anywhere. I thought Llweyn Davis was right back where he started after almost two hours, and the big circle he travelled was not even entertaining.<br/><br/>In a plot driven film like this, it is crucial to grab the viewers' attention - but there was little to grab mine in ""Inside Llewyn Davis"". Fortunately, the songs were very good, and they did the songs justice by playing them in their entirety."
"cultfilmfan","10","1","2","14 February 2014"," Inside Llewyn Davis
","Leave it to the Coen brothers to give us one of the most original and unique films of last year. They have been doing this most of their career from Blood Simple, up to and including, Inside Llewyn Davis, with very few missteps along the way. This is a later film I saw of 2013, but as of now I would have to say that it is my personal favourite film of last year. Why? Well, I will do my best to explain that in the following few sentences. First off, I like the character Llewyn Davis a lot. That isn't to say that he was a great, or inspirational character, or anything like that. In fact the character himself is a pompous and full of himself person with not that much going for him and his over indulgence and pride and arrogance are the downfall of him. He is not all that likable a character, but that is what I liked so much about him. He is our antihero for this film and his personality and the many assorted predicaments that he gets himself into, during the course of this film are so intriguing and fascinating that this is one film that grabbed me from it's opening shot to it's closing one. I laughed with and at Llewyn, sometimes felt a little pity for him, but mostly just really enjoyed watching him as he tries to make a name for himself in the music industry and sort out the various annoying problems that go on in his life, some of which, as I mentioned, he causes himself because of his attitude and his big mouth. Fans of other Coen brothers films know that they like their music and really good cinematography and this film is not failing in that regard either. A lot of the film's original folk music (actually performed by actor, Oscar Isaac, and cast) is very good and really suits the setting of the early 1960's Greenwich Village folk scene. I still can't quite contemplate how ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" did not end up getting a Best Original Song nomination at the Academy Awards. The cinematography (which it is nominated for) is superb. The film takes place during a long and dreary winter and the cinematography gives the film a bleak, cold and very depressing look which really enhances the mood and tone that the film is going for. It was achieved successfully. The acting was also fantastic from Oscar Isaac, playing Llewyn Davis, to the various supporting characters that he meets during his travels as well. As, I mentioned earlier, Isaac performed the songs written for him and he gets so into character playing this unlikable and self indulgent character, but also lets us laugh and occasionally have pity for him as well. It is a brilliant performance that should have been nominated a lot more than it has been. All the supporting characters and actors are great as well and the thing about these supporting characters is that each and every one of them is just as interesting as it's main character, so watching them is an absolute joy as well. The Coens always do their own screenplays and they have a certain style that has become familiar to fans of their work and this film brilliantly shows their madness and creativity. The character development runs deep and the film is so entertaining and often gives us a lot to laugh at as well. It is also fantastically different and offbeat and really unlike any other recent film in memory, which I give them a lot of credit for. They know how to set certain scenes, build up characters and surprise and shock us out of nowhere with things we just did not see coming. The film is about music and the folk scene of the early 1960's, so fans of music, or people who lived through that time should easily enjoy and find a lot to identify with in this film. For someone like myself and many others who were not around at that time, there is still so much to love here and the story is one that can appeal to any and every generation of film fans who appreciate unique and great works of art which we have on display here. This film is a great work of art from the talent and skills behind and in front of the camera. This is a film that entertained and grabbed me from when it started to when it ended and made me laugh and just made me appreciate the brilliance that is the Coen brothers for another great film in their already impressive lineup. Inside Llewyn Davis, is my favourite film from 2013 so far and if you are in the mood for something different, original and artsy, then it may be one of your faves too."
"Seraphion","6","1","2","8 February 2014"," A funny movie but...
","Inside Llewyn Davis So it's basically musical where we see Llewyn Davis, a washed=up folk- singer, struggles to get back to his game in the music industry. The movie starts with Llewyn having an almost literally f^cked up life, and continues on with his struggles over his solo act record, his relationships with others, and a cat.<br/><br/>The flow is just freaking hilarious. From a live lounge or café thingy gig to a playback accompanying a day's activities to a trio part with Justin Timberlake to.. ""Shaaoot!"" LOL ROTFL.<br/><br/>Normall I don't really dig into folk music, I find the music quite boring makes me sleepy. But the music in this movie is just good. It's relaxing and I seem to be able to endure the whole length of them.<br/><br/>It's the first I see Justin Timberlake sing something just off his habit like folk-music. Great harmonization on the trio part.<br/><br/>John Goodman's part is also hilarious, just won't shut up that old man Turner LOL. The only silence with the old man is only when he's sleeping with his mouth yawning like the gates of hell itself LOL.<br/><br/>And one other funny part is when Llewyn found out about the cat's name ""That's his name?"" LOL<br/><br/>Eveb though it makes the movie looks darker than real world, and though it contains some laughs, the film coloration is great, it adds up to the soothing effect from the music.<br/><br/>One bad thing of this movie is that it doesn't really teach you about anything, in fact it doesn't really give any ending. I feel that the movie is just meant to be a plain form of an entertainment, without any intention for any moral message whatsoever.<br/><br/>I give it a score of 6 out of 10. Though all in all I wouldn't recommend you to go and see on a theater. It'll be a waste of money."
"l_rawjalaurence","9","1","2","7 February 2014"," Vivid Recreation of a Moment in American Popular Culture
","Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS dramatizes the life of the eponymous hero (Oscar Isaac), who tries to carve out a career as a solo folk singer after his partner commits suicide. The film vividly recreates the atmosphere of the Gaslight Cafe, a real-life venue that opened in 1958 and closed in 1971, where acts such as Bob Dylan, Bill Cosby, and Luke Faust performed. The Café attracted high- profile patrons: Jimi Hendrix was known to visit one night. Llewyn is never going to be that popular; but we have to admire his spirit as he tries his best, despite numerous obstacles placed in his way. The 1961 setting is significant: the Coen Brothers' film recreates a significant moment in American popular culture when people broke free of their conservative shackles and began to express themselves in much more basic terms. Politics became a legitimate subject for popular music, rather than the anodyne lyrics characteristic of many chart-topping hits of the late Fifties. Llewyn tries his best to emphasize the significance of his songs, but no one appears to listen to him. The film suggests that the music business was a cut-throat world, in which talent went unrecognized and agents only promoted the tried and tested, rather than the experimental. This is brought out in a significant exchange where Llewyn travels to Chicago, only to be rebuffed by the seedy-looking Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham). The film is full of significant moments and quirky casting: I particularly admired the casting of Justin Timberlake as Jim, another would-be folk musician who tries to change his name to guarantee success, but ends up on the musical scrapheap, just like Llewyn. Deliberately shot in low-key color, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS befits repeated viewings, in order to make sense of its multi- leveled structure. Potentially a contemporary classic."
"cosmo_tiger","6","1","2","3 February 2014"," The acting is very good and the movie is OK but if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it.
","""If it was never new and it never was old its a folk song."" Llewyn Davis (Isaac) is a folk singer living in New York in the early 60's. He is trying everything he can to make it big while struggling to find his way. He couch hops from house to house and picks up gigs when and where he can. When the woman who's place he is staying with tells him he has to move out it begins a long week for Llewyn that changes everything about him. At the risk of offending people I am not a huge Coen Brothers fan. I have liked most of their movies but my problem with them is that some are very slow moving and are really made for a specific audience. The music in this one is good but not as good as in O Brother Where Art Thou. The acting is very good and the movie is OK but again if you aren't a Coen Brothers fan you may not totally get into it. This is a movie where not much happens you just follow one guy around for a week. Overall, Coen Brothers fans will like this. If you aren't a fan you may struggle to get through it. I give this a B-."
"bbewnylorac","7","1","2","31 January 2014"," Interesting film
","This wasn't a great film, but interesting enough. It's quite refreshing to focus on someone who doesn't triumph against the odds, someone who continually fails both as a person and in his career. In the end Llewyn doesn't come out of it looking wonderful; in fact the film gradually displays all his faults. And he doesn't appear to have many good points. He 'takes' a lot from others and doesn't give much in return. It's a light comedy in which we follow one week in his bumbling journey through life. The New York and Chicago weather is terrible, as if mirroring his bleak existence. I personally didn't love the folk music portrayed here. It seemed a bit bland to me, but it did seem to reflect the sort of songs that were never going to reach the heights of, say, Dylan's, but obviously attracted a solid local audience in their day. On the surface, the film says that maybe if Llewyn was a stronger character, went out and sought work and took notice of good advice and didn't miss so many opportunities, he could have made some kind of living and rent his own place. But was it just that he had bad luck? A bad agent? Friends and family that weren't supportive and encouraging? How much is a man's life his own effort, and how much is luck, seems to be a theme of the film."
"dobner","6","1","2","29 January 2014"," Honest
","I really wanted to see this movie, because I just crave this cultural period of American history. I did not know what to expect, and was wise in retrospect. Visually, I think the production design of this movie was excellent. Creating the backdrop...the cars, the bus station, city streets, cafe's, Fred Harvey Oasis was beautiful. The cinematography also captured the angst and purity of this particular folk figure. The acting was striking...I did not even recognize Justin Timberlake until I was reminded in the credits.<br/><br/>However, although I appreciated the interior desolation of Llewyn Davis, there were just long stretches of nothing happening that might be better delivered in a novel than on screen. Also, I think the script could have benefited from a some topography."
"kitchent","5","1","2","26 January 2014"," What was the point again?
","While not the most overrated film of the year (that belongs to Her), Inside Llewyn Davis tells a story that doesn't seem worth telling. The film follows Llewyn Davis through a week in his life in the NYC folk scene of the early 1960's. <br/><br/>The film looks amazing. The recreation of the time period is incredible, the camera work extraordinary, and the direction is splendid. If there was just a story here somewhere we would all be happy. There are interesting scenes, and a laugh or two inside this bleak environment, but mostly we watch Llewyn go through his miserable paces. He crashes with whatever friend he hasn't ticked off lately. He loses one cat, then kills another. He finds out that he has a child, but finds no strength to actually go find it. He takes a meaningless trip to Chicago with an out of place John Goodman. Nothing happens so he comes back to NYC. And the film ends up exactly where it started - LITERALLY - by showing us the first scene of the film again. <br/><br/>Sorry, but not my cup of tea."
"griffolyon12","8","1","2","21 January 2014"," Not the Coens' Finest, But Still Worth Your Time
","The new Coen Brothers film, Inside Llewyn Davis, is very much a Coen Brothers film in its dark sense of humor, with its pessimistic story of failure, yet it kind of feels like a been there done that exercise.<br/><br/>The film follows the titular Llewyn Davis, a struggling folk singer in Greenwich Village in the 1960s. Llewyn is the kind of complete and total mess that the Coens seem to be drawn to. Llewyn is not the nicest guy on Earth, he bums off friends, sleeping on couches with nowhere to call home, and yet we still like him. Why? Perhaps it's because the Coen Brothers know what they're doing when they write characters like this. If anyone knows how to make a tragic, seemingly unlikable character likable, it's the Coen Brothers through their witty dialogue. Of course, while this is an enjoyable film in the Coen-style, it fails to really differentiate itself from many other films in their filmography.<br/><br/>Here's the thing, Inside Llewyn Davis features superb performances from the actors, in particular Oscar Isaac as Llewyn, and the songs produced by T Bone Burnett are all sensational, but aside from those elements, it feels like we're watching A Serious Man or Barton Fink all over again. Perhaps if you've never seen any other Coen Brothers films, Inside Llewyn Davis might feel a little more fresh, however don't go thinking that I disliked this film, I just think it pales in comparison to their previous works as writers and directors for a few key reasons. The film drags a little bit in the middle portions, especially when Llewyn is on a strange road trip with John Goodman, and the ending was a tad confusing, drawing into question what the Coens were really trying to say with this whole story. For these reasons, Inside Llewyn Davis just failed to live up to the heights of what the Coen Brothers have previously achieved.<br/><br/>I give Inside Llewyn Davis an 8 out of 10!"

","After seeing this film with a pal of mine , both of whom have a deep love and working knowledge of the NYC Village scene ( I was actually born there ...Dad had a Jazz Coffee shop on St.Marks place in 1960 ) we left the theater feeling kind of dis-appointed with the experience and feeling like the Coen brothers were showing more disdain than respect for the folk scene. I liked the attention to details and the mood the cinematographer evoked , the music was lovely , all lot of the performances were great...it seems to have all the right ingredients but something's missing...One of my pet peeves were the Cat , or cats, .They seemed to have no real meaning to the story telling.Also, the constant refrain of "" everyone wants to f**k Jean"" , amusing maybe the first time , really got old quick . I might have a slightly romanticized take on the early Folk scene so it's hard to reconcile this darker version."

","Winner of the Grand Prix at the 2013 Cannes Film Festival, Inside Llewyn Davis finds the Coen brothers in sublime form & puts on screen an aimless journey of a messed up individual navigating through the New York's folk music scene of the early 1960s. The film covers just one week in the life of Llewyn Davis where we see him trying to deal with the increasing pile of obstacles he faces on a daily basis, most of which are of his own making. In short, Inside Llewyn Davis is simply an observation of a reckless individual who refuses to get his life together.<br/><br/>In spite of having no definite plot, the Coen brothers somehow manage to make the film work through their remarkable use of dry humour & unconventional narration. The film makes great use of Coens' trademarks, the production design is impressive, cinematography is this film's most striking aspect, editing could've trimmed away some more scenes & the soundtrack introduces some wonderful folk additions performed by the cast themselves.<br/><br/>As for the performances, Oscar Isaac delivers a breakthrough performance as Llewyn Davis & it's his brilliant performance only which makes it possible for us to sympathize with the quite unlikable character he plays in this film. Other supporting performances are also good but present in short doses featuring Carey Mulligan as Jean, Justin Timberlake as Jim, John Goodman as Roland Turner; a jazz musician & Garrett Hedlund as Johnny Five. Also making a prominent mark is an orange tabby cat which is a symbolic character in the film.<br/><br/>If you're into folk music, then you might find something to like about this film. If you're a fan of the Coen brothers, then you will find something to like about this film. On an overall scale, Inside Llewyn Davis is a tragically funny cinema that explores the bleak disappointments that so many people around the world face at some point of their careers and tries to expose a deeply unsettling truth; It's that even the most talented individuals don't always end up being the successful ones. Multiple viewings advised.<br/><br/>Full review at: cinemaclown.wordpress.com"

","The Coens have a lot of gems in their filmography, and honestly I haven't gone through much of it, but the few I have are wonderful. Before this I always claimed A Serious Man as their best, but now I'm eager to call Llewyn Davis their masterpiece. This is soulful, heart-wrenching, powerful filmmaking. My favorite film of 2013 was Before Midnight, for months, but now I think a new king has emerged as the finest of 2013. This is an amazing film, intimate as can be, and not surprised mainstream and general audiences are ""bored"" by it. Oscar Isaac is a revelation, such sadness and longing in his eyes, and he's shown extreme talent here. This is highly recommended."
"caseymoviemania","9","1","2","15 January 2014"," Well-acted, if flawed melancholy drama with a unique touch of Coen brothers' dark sense of humour.
","After scoring their biggest hit to date with their first Western genre, TRUE GRIT (2010 -- a critically-acclaimed movie which I personally thought was overrated), the Coen brothers goes low-key with INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS.<br/><br/>WHAT IS IT ALL ABOUT?<br/><br/>Set in the winter season of 1961, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS revolves around Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a talented folk singer who suffers a rough week following Timlin's unexpected suicide, his music partner at which they sing together as a folk group duo called Timlin & Davis. As Llewyn tries to embark into a solo career, his journey proves to be an unpleasant experience. With no money for a place of his own, he forced to crash with various friends from time to time. He even had a hard time trying to get paying gigs, while his girlfriend Jean (Carey Mulligan) thinks he's a total loser.<br/><br/>THE GOOD STUFF<br/><br/>From the sublime opening scene that begins with Llewyn singing ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" at the Gaslight bar, the Coen brothers successfully captured the melancholic atmosphere of the 1960s folk music scene surrounding New York's Greenwich Village. With the help of lush cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel and the distinctive period look by production designer Jess Gonchor, the movie certainly have the lived-in quality that transports you into the particular era. Even though INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a depressing movie, the Coen brothers manage to strike a fine balance between their downbeat tone and dark-comedy element without going overboard one after another.<br/><br/>Apart from the Coen brothers' beautifully restrained direction, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is also a musical triumph for its folk music. This is largely thanks to the talented T-Bone Burnett himself, at which the songs are performed live by the actors themselves. From the above-mentioned ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"" to ""Five Hundred Miles"" and a particular uplifting tune of ""Please Mr. Kennedy"", all the songs are simply top notch.<br/><br/>As for the actors, Oscar Isaac scores a breakthrough performance as the soulful Llewyn Davis. He's particularly terrific the way he expresses the lyric when he sings a folk song while strumming his guitar with full of emotion. Equally great is the highly-talented Carey Mulligan, who is memorable as the estranged and foulmouthed Jean. The rest of the supporting actors, even the small roles from Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Garrett Hedlund to F. Murray Abraham, have their fair share of acting highlights.<br/><br/>MOST MEMORABLE MOMENT(S)<br/><br/>Three folk songs -- ""Hang Me, Oh Hang Me"", ""Five Hundred Miles"" and ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" -- are particular highlights that stuck in my head. The blackly comic but symbolic scene involving the orange cat is another must-see sequence.<br/><br/>THE BAD STUFF<br/><br/>The debatable finale somewhat left me cold, and yet unsatisfied the way Coen brothers chooses to end the fate of Llewyn's career journey.<br/><br/>FINAL WORDS<br/><br/>Minor flaw aside, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS remains one of Coen brothers' best movies ever made in their illustrious career.<br/><br/>http://www.caseymoviemania.blogspot.com"

","If I go now to the basement and look real hard, I can probably find the vinyl from that era: Dylan, Ochs, Van Ronk, Peter Paul and Mary. This film certainly has some personal nostalgia wrapped around it, even though the Coens were probably in grade school when this music was produced. Inside Llewyn Davis is a touching portrait of a musician down on his luck, a recurring Coen brothers theme. Llewyn (Oscar Issac) is a true talent, but a handful of unfortunate incidents have left him hamstrung emotionally, artistically and financially with just about everyone in his personal and professional world fed up with him.<br/><br/>The music is beautiful, the acting excellent, the script tight and disciplined, but the movie just doesn't go anywhere. Unlike most other reviewers, I find Llewyn a warm and sympathetic character, even though most of the characters he interfaces with show anger, contempt, and hostility toward him, he perseveres. Unlike the harsh critique of Albert Grosman (F.Murray Abraham) his music is evocative and strong. The creative marketplace is both ruthless and fickle. The brilliant and talented are often looked over for the shallow and facile. Llewyn is often reminded of this at key points in the film, but can do little to remedy it.<br/><br/>This is a movie about failing. It is depressing and unfortunately very real. Llewyn Davis should be judged not for his character flaws, but the caprice of the creative world he has chosen to live in."

","OK, I fell sleep before the opening number (a slow folk song) had finished. But I jolted fully awake when this terrific rendition of ""500 Miles"" was being sung. I realized that I was watching a special film, and now I'm sorry I missed the first 15 minutes and Isaac's initial performance.<br/><br/>Oscar Isaac is really terrific in this film. They found an actor who is an excellent folk singer. It's not just that he sings the songs himself, great songs, but it's also his portrayal of the character. I found him and his character engaging. Sure, bad things happen to Llewyn and the people around him, and he alienates people wherever he goes because he's an as$hole at times. But still I was really on his side despite all this. I wanted him to succeed, for others to see what I saw in him, to see how talented he is.<br/><br/>This movie reminded me strongly of how much I used to enjoy folk music when I was younger.<br/><br/>The rest of the movie was also interesting, everything from its portrayal of American life in the early 1960s to the parade of strange but believable characters that cross Llewyn's path, and especially their dialogue. This intelligent movie has a few profound things to say about ""making it"" and fate. It's a good movie for those who believe deep down that life is not fair.<br/><br/>There were a number of amazing scenes in the movie, eg the Kennedy song, the injured cat, the Grossman audition, and so on. I suppose this is attributable to incredibly good writing. I've enjoyed all of the Coen brothers' movies, and this is no exception. I need to research why I enjoy their films so much. Very American, but not Hollywood movies.<br/><br/>I think the movie is worth about 8.5 and possibly higher, but I'm rounding it down for now because I was uncomfortable with the sudden ending, and I can't say that this movie actually moved me. For me, this movie tickled my intellect more than my heart. I want to see it twice (even though I seldom do that), and perhaps I'll raise the score then."

Goodness gracious me, though, their past couple of films have been awfully down on how we interact with the universe!<br/><br/>Oscar Issac gives a tremendous performance at the core of the movie, with deeply emotional folk music performances. The rest of the ensemble is solid, but i think pretty much all the other performers really classify as supporting characters, as they all take turns fading in and out of the story. Oscar is the films rock, it's heart and it's soul. He's the one who we go on this incredible journey with, and he is up to the task.<br/><br/>Deeply ruminating film that is more then worth a look.

","I was very excited to have the opportunity to screen this film before release. I have been a strong fan of the Coen Brothers body of work since Raising Arizona was released in 1987. This film was a gritty, realistic view of an egocentric artist who was hell bent on success through self destructive actions that were about to shatter his musical dream and force him onto a different career path. As in many young men whose ego writes checks that are too large to be cashed, Llewyn Davis created his own self destruction. The film lacks the charm or brilliant cartoon quality of Oh, Brother, Where Art Thou? or Fargo. It is an expertly made film that realistically depicts a gritty musical scene in a time just before immense change. The portrayal of a young Bob Dylan like performer foretold starkly the impeding changes. I give it an 8"

","I saw a preview of Inside Llewyn Davis last night. The press got the best seats reserved and members of the local folk station, which is playing several cuts from the soundtrack, got the rest. It was a logical move to fill the seats with people who should like the movie and fans of folk from the 60s through today should like the movie. The many songs are nearly all full length and performed by proper musicians (and Justin Timberlake.) Oscar Isaac is actually an actor now, but began as a musician and plays a struggling musician in 1961 New York City. I can't say if he's a good actor or well cast, but he is a great performer. Despite my dig at Timberlake, mostly due to his perfectly appropriate branding, he performed well also. His fans are unlikely to enjoy his performance, he plays folk songs in the style of Peter, Paul and Mary. That's not the only surreal aspect to the movie since it is fully Joel and Ethan Coen. This one is very dark, far more like No Country for Old Men than O Brother Where Art Thou despite the music, and funny if you like their humor (I do.) The Coen-style conversation is covered by Carey Mulligan and John Goodman with many other characters providing one-liners and other humorous moments, proper actors all. Music fans and Coen fans will all enjoy parts of the film, and soundtrack fans and Coen fans will love the final result. Hope it comes to a theater near you."

It has also a few horrific scenes, again typical and the soundtrack is used to perfection to wake one up, if you were ever going to sleep!! <br/><br/>Cat lovers will love it and will be sad and happy. <br/><br/>So, what's the decision. Good Coens, good story well told, good characterisations, wonderful ambiance of NY in the 60s. <br/><br/>However, I'm of the generation when the 60s was the 60s for me, out of school in the late years, into Beatles and Stones - living in Ireland, when the folk scene let us escape from the stifling 'traditional Irish music' scene. The Clancy's were the start on mass media, but there were hundreds of lesser mortals who were better. <br/><br/>I ask, what are the Coens saying? Are they (just) reliving their youth, or part of it? Are they indulging their film interests, making a musical? Are they just ""doing it"" ? Either way a very entertaining 2 hours, not Oscar stuff in my opinion, and anyway 2014 will be Hanks..... gung ho stuff. <br/><br/>I give it seven/ten, because it is them and it relives part of my life, good enough reasons."

","So I think this movie is saying that terrible people can be capable of beautiful art. It spends its time following around a folk singer bumming through Manhattan. He gets his friend's girlfriend pregnant, he sleeps at other peoples' apartments, he treats people poorly, and then he gets on stage and sings nicely. That's it. When the movie ended, I decided I hadn't really cared about anything I'd watched, and I wasn't especially taken by its message, either. Are the filmmakers trying to excuse themselves for something they've done by making a movie about the redeeming qualities of art? It's kind of like what Woody Allen seemed to be saying with Deconstructing Harry. But the bottom line was that there weren't any very entertaining moments."

","Other reviewers have suggested that people don't like this film because there's not enough action and pointed out that it's not an action movie. If I wanted to watch an action movie, I wouldn't pick one about a singer-songwriter wandering about 1960s New York. One guy does his girlfriend a disservice by implying she's simply too low-brow to appreciate it, that it doesn't have enough action for her. It's not that she only likes action movies, it's that she doesn't like bad movies. People have written that it's darkly comedic. It isn't. There's nothing funny about this movie. The protagonist, admittedly he's not supposed to be likable, is aimless in a charmless way and really rude to his two benefactors, simply for the chance to flex his artistic temperament. As usual, the Coens have stuck in John Goodman as a completely over the top caricature. They like to stretch credulity. He must surely tire of these roles (like in Death Sentence) but it's all money in the bank I guess. Carey Mulligan does her usual hard-to-like girlfriend act. Justin Timberlake is worth watching as a wholesome folk singer and Garrett Hedlund is wasted as the enigmatic Johnny Five.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers still think swearing is hilarious when it hasn't been funny since the beginning of Four Weddings and a Funeral. And Hugh Grant was charming.<br/><br/>The cat is by far the best thing in it and doesn't even get credited in the cast. Sensibly, he spends all his time trying to disassociate himself from this ideas vacuum of a movie and disappear from the frame. The cat should get an award, the rest was awful."

","This film made me feel the physical cold; the snow, wind, rain along with the gray skies. The atmosphere magnified the way of the world. It reminds me that we are all on a journey through life. Better choices may glean us better rewards and less suffering, but in the end we all die some how and some place.<br/><br/>Llewyn's music was good as far as ability and performance but I tend to agree with the character played by F. Murray Abraham. He said he did not see a lot of money being generated from it. Although music with a lugubrious nature has done so, part of the problem was Llewyn's look. The hippie movement had not yet arrived in 1961. A clean cut look was still needed to succeed. Think of real life folk acts like; Peter, Paul and Mary, The Smothers Brothers or The Kingston Trio, any male singers with a neatly trimmed goatee, even a young Bob Dylan.<br/><br/>The other message in this film was lack of responsibility. Llewyn was more compassionate towards the cat than his two known lady friends. It seemed to be that having an abortion was a standard solution to a heat of the moment careless pregnancy. But it does take two to tango.<br/><br/>The movie went full circle from nowhere to nowhere. The Coen's did a good job of showing the struggle to become famous and the hardships it can cause for oneself and others directly and indirectly involved. At least he was not a heroin user (yet). Hopefully, Llewyn decides to go electric in 1963 at Newport. Rated 7.3/10, slightly better than some 7.0 films."

","There is something very lonely about the life of a musician. He seems cursed, to wander here and there, never quite obtaining what he wants and finding nothing but hardship along the way. Such is the case with Llewyn Davis. He is a rag-tag songwriter who sets out to make it in the world with little to no help from anyone, especially those closest to him.<br/><br/>What I appreciated most here was the cinematography, which is very ""closed in"" and cozy. It overshadows most everything else. The acting is sufficient to carry the story, which isn't terribly original, but the film holds together and ends up entertaining you.<br/><br/>There is definitely a Bob Dylan cutout the C Bros are trying to make with Llewyn, though they make him a little more sad and lonely, with his friends and lovers treading all over him. There is also a troublesome cat that adds to his woes.<br/><br/>The end result of the film is sad and kind of unresolved, though maybe the life of a wandering minstrel is such. I'd recommend the film. There is good music and visuals and the C Bros always seem to know how to spin a good yarn, even when sad things are happening."

","This is one of my favorite films I've ever seen. I can't explain why I love it so much. I seen it a couple of days ago for the first time and I've already seen it twice.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers seemed to be so careful with the film, with every part having the right feel and mood that they wanted to portray. The story, plot and characters blend together to create a simple story with an intricate plot, playing out over a week.<br/><br/>Like every Coen brothers movie, it was shot beautifully and it was shot thoughtfully. The two also payed a lot of attention to the story, creating characters that we seem to know well after their first few scenes. They even created a good and interesting character who speaks almost no lines and only has about 10 minutes of screen time.<br/><br/>The movie seems to have three acts that blend characters and plot together brilliantly creating an ongoing feel to the movie. Whatever they did created a film that feels close and intimate as well as creating a long and interesting plot with a simple and small story. The movie never loses it's local feel while it expands it's horizons creating a whole world for the audience to enjoy.<br/><br/>This years Coen brothers movie Hail!Caesar lacks this feeling. It became messy and the main story got lost somewhere in between the side stories. That movie should have felt big as well as being intimate and interesting. Where that movie failed this movie strove. With Inside Llewyn Davis, I felt like I was a journey, the movie felt long and I was sad when it was over. With Hail!Caesar the movie felt like it had ended before I knew what had happened or who any of the characters were.<br/><br/>One thing that stood out in this movie was the comedy. For some reason the two brother's sense of humor mixed so well with the feel of this movie. Watching Llewyn as he argues and annoys people around him while dropping very funny lines throughout. Sometimes you just laugh at the situations he puts himself in. All of it though led to some funny moments.<br/><br/>Overall, it is a 'little' movie that felt expansive, intimate and interesting that coincides beautifully with the characters and the music."

","With Christmas coming up,I started looking for a Bob Dylan related item to pick up as a gift for a family friend. Struggling to find something a bit obscure,I suddenly remembered hearing about an unreleased version of the Dylan song Farewell being included on the soundtrack to a title from auteur film makers the Coen brothers.Being enchanted by the soundtrack,I decided that it was the perfect time to pick up the DVD,and finally meet Llewyn Davis.<br/><br/>The plot-<br/><br/>New York 1961:<br/><br/>After the suicide of his singing partner Mike Timlin,Folk singer/songwriter Llewyn Davis has been struggling to gain a foothold in the business. Bringing his first solo album out,Davis begins to lose all his hopes as his album fails to sell.Keeping an eye on every cent he has,Davis sleeps on the couches of friends and former lovers.<br/><br/>Leaving a friends flat behind,Davis is left having to carry their cat around,when it escapes just before he locks himself out. Dragging the cat and his guitar around the music scene,Davis meets former lover Jean,who asks Davis if he can cover the cost of her having an abortion,due to Jean believing that Davis is the guy who impregnated her. As he goes to pay the doctor for the abortion,Davis begins to seriously think about leaving the Folk music scene behind altogether.<br/><br/>View on the film:<br/><br/>Before I get to the film,I have to mention the extraordinary soundtrack from T Bone Burnett,with prime cut Folk tracks from Dylan and Dave Van Rock being joined by elegantly performed new songs performed by the cast,which fit perfectly within the era of the film.<br/><br/>Sitting in the corner of every run down café and coffee shop,co- writers/co-directors Ethan and Joel Coen & cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel soak the movie in a rich, atmospheric darkness,which creates the striking impression of faded photos being bought to life.Not keeping the title solely confined to the clubs,the Coen's compose Davis fading music dream with a rustic chill,which subtlety goes against the family warmth that Davis and the other musicians present in their songs.<br/><br/>For the screenplay,the Coen's take an excellent Folk song structure,by connecting Davis moments of doubt/loss of direction with deliciously dry,witty detours. Taking inspiration from real life people in the music scene,the Coen's pave Davis path with delightfully off-beat characters who go from a tight-fisted manager to an ex who never forgets.Pressing down on Davis dreams,the Coen's send their singer off on wonderful misadventures,which goes from Davis having to deal with a musician who dies from a heroin overdose,to a cat ""changing sex"" without him noticing.<br/><br/>Delicately performing each of the songs,the eye-catching Carey Mulligan gives an excellent performance as Jean,who Mulligan stops from appearing brittle by giving Jean a perfect ""light touch"" in seeing Davis hit a dead end.Being stuck with only a cat for company,Oscar Isaac gives a fantastic performance as Llewyn Davis.Perfectly hitting every dead pan one-liner,Isaac crosses the comedic verses with a rough round the edges folksy charm,as the crowds in the coffee bars and cafes prepare to uncover the inside of Llewyn Davis."

","I went into this movie unsure of what I'd think, considering I don't typically listen to folk music and considering the mixed reviews it received. I'm happy to say that it was absolutely amazing. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis doesn't have a particularly deep plot. It's about a folk singer trying to become famous. It's a pretty average music movie plot, which isn't a bad thing, especially in this case. The plot is very well carried out and realistic nonetheless. The choices Llewyn Davis makes feel more human than other movies I've seen, despite how hard they were to watch at times. <br/><br/>The characters are the driving force of this movie. Llewyn Davis is very well developed, and his character feels real and full of depth. Not everything that he says or references from his life will have major significance in his life later on, which really adds to it. The other characters are all amazing too, although I wish we could have spent more time with some of them. But just like real life, people come and go. There's not a lot we can do about that. <br/><br/>The music aspect of the movie was, although the overall plot, not as big as I thought it would be. Llewyn plays and watches other performances occasionally, but he doesn't do either very often. It's part of his character, but I kind of liked how there wasn't an excessive amount of music, despite the fact that I loved every song sung in the movie. <br/><br/>Overall Inside Llewyn Davis is amazing. With a well-done plot, fantastic characters, and great music, it's well worth anyone's time. If you didn't like it, then I really can't see why, but that's just your opinion. If you haven't seen it, then go do it. I highly recommend this movie to anyone, whether you like music or not."

","Inside Llewyn Davis was for a fact, the most boring and uninteresting movie I have ever watched. The movie starts off with a bit of a hook, showing us the sad existence of a starving, couch surfing artist. But after the first 15 minutes it became incredibly difficult to set my smart-phone down. Nothing.... let me repeat, nothing of interest happens from here on out. <br/><br/>As time progresses, the movie grids to a halt. We start watching the grass grow as Llewyn comes to terms with the futility of his music career. There is even his lucky break, which he misses out on, foreshadowed as plain as day with no expert writing or development.<br/><br/>An orange cat's cameo tries to spice up the movie a few times throughout the movie (The three times I laughed in this movie had to do with the cat). And when Llewyn makes an attempt to head back to his normal career, he makes fun of his sick father and belittles his sister in front of his nephew. Oh yeah and through this cinematic lobotomy, Llewyn expresses what hes afraid of becoming if he leaves his glamorous life, to a real world career.<br/><br/>The rave reviews and the fact that this movie is receiving much acclaim has shown me how much politics are within the realm of Hollywood and its critics. This is the biggest disaster of my life, watching the Coen's epic of what the pain of trying to be something great in this world can really feel like. These are the kind of movies that make me want to put a gun to my head. (Not for real, but man this movie sucked) <br/><br/>The pathetic melancholy and sad, over played events of a dull life have been emphasized in this boring tale of how dreary life can look. So if that is your cup of tea, and you need to elevate yourself by finding grace in the viewing of others misery, please, watch this movie. After all, I have just had all worth while stories and epics I have viewed as of late, be shredded to pieces by this atrocity that some call a movie.<br/><br/>On the bright side I must admit the acting was A+ and the cinematography was very impressive. Every shot to me seemed to be cared for meticulously. It really did set the tone for the innate sadness and drudgery that lied ahead of every frame. But sadly, the screen play, the story, and the ending were just very badly designed and more plain than a box of macaroni and cheese.<br/><br/>For the meantime, I will eat an entire box of table salt in hopes I can re-stimulate the destroyed interest of my mind, body, and soul that have been removed from me in the operation of Inside Llewyn Davis."
"BrentAMG","10","1","3","23 January 2014"," Coen Brothers Will Be Remembered for Long Time.
","The Coen Brothers are stalwarts of the film industry. Since their first movie, Blood Simple., was released in 1984, the directing duo has rarely settled for anything but greatness. Most recently, the Coens wrote and directed Inside Llewyn Davis – a film about a week in the life of a struggling singer trying to create a name for himself in the Greenwich Village folk scene of 1961. Like many Coen collaborations, the film left some people nonplussed. Where was the resolution? It is a factor that some viewers – unenlightened ones, if I pretentiously do say so myself – find infuriating. Many of these films have similar threads running through them. Often, the familial filmmakers make noirs, a genre essentially extinct, save for mediocre attempts to revive it such as The Good German. The likes of Double Indemnity do not exist – at a high level, at least – in the modern era, except when the Coens decide it's time. Their works are paradoxical. At times, the gist will be clear: there is a God, or some higher being doling out justice. However, just as the viewer deems this to be true, Joel and Ethan throw some amalgam of existentialism and doubt into the mix. Wait, this isn't what I thought it was going to be, is it? This leaves the viewer to decipher what the meaning really is, if there is one. Another one of their trademarks is to include things that add absolutely nothing to the crux of the film. Don't read into the films too much, ya hear? <br/><br/>In Inside Llewyn Davis, the Coens reverted to what made O Brother such a success. Music and movies are the core of popular culture. In 2011, the two industries accounted for $17.5 billion. As a result, many musicals/ movies with music-themes do extremely well. Most recently, one should recall Disney's Frozen. However, there are those films that wade underneath the mainstream. Llewyn Davis is one of those films.<br/><br/>While Llewyn Davis was never as hyped as The Wolf of Wall Street or American Hustle, I believed it would garner some acclaim. I mean, it's the Coen brothers. Celebrated directors in their own right. True enough, many top critics have given the film solid marks. However, hoi polloi has not embraced the movie as warmly. Additionally, and unsurprisingly, the Academy failed to recognize the greatness of this folk tale about a folk singer.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis was nominated for two Oscars. Best Cinematography (Roger Deakins) and Best Sound Mixing. Exhilarating, right!? I take back the sarcasm for Deakins' sake. The man is responsible for some of the most beautiful displays of cinema in the past twenty years. The Shawshank Redemption, Fargo, No Country for Old Men, and Skyfall are a few examples. He's also worked on every Coen brothers' film since Barton Fink (1991). But, Sound Mixing? C'mon! Oscar Isaac deserved a nod for his soulful, back-breaking performance, Justin Timberlake and other writers for this little number, and the Coens proved their Oscar- worthy directing in the very first scene. The film opens with Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) on a stage. Not a large one. Maybe, maybe 75 people watch and listen as Llewyn plucks his guitar and intones the lyrics ""Hang me, oh hang me. I'll be dead and gone. Wouldn't mind the hangin' but the layin' in the grave's so long, poor boy."" The entranced crowd slowly taps their feet, ashing their cigarettes on down beats, taking for granted the talent a paper plane's flight away. Davis continues his incantation while the mastery of the Coens ensues — I wouldn't be surprised if the seven other people in the theater thought we were watching the performance live. Seamlessly, the Coens transition from perspective to perspective, placing the viewer at the heart of the performance. A waitress walks by, blocks the camera as she passes, and moviegoers shift their heads to the left – as if it would actually change their view. First impressions may not be everything, but they count for a lot. The first scene left me enchanted.<br/><br/>The film would have failed without a talented actor at the helm. Ethan and Joel made no mistake in picking Oscar Isaac. He was able to embody the tortured artist, desperately wanting to be successful in playing his music while shooting himself in the foot the whole way. The film focuses on one tumultuous week in Llewyn's life. He lives in the moment, couch-to-couch, playing his guitar where he can. He has a couple friends, though he's not a great friend. He's prone to drink, lose his temper, and knock-up girls. His life is that of a rolling stone.<br/><br/>The Coen brothers have done much to advance the scope of cinema. Inside Llewyn Davis is no different. While it is under-appreciated now, I believe the picture will stand the test of time. Go see it. Thanks, Joel and Ethan."

","I guess everyone expects a masterpiece from Coen brothers. In most cases it is true. This one, however, is not one of such. Story (story?) is pretty weak and I guess only an orange cat stands out. The main character does not. Now, to be honest, cinematography and cast performances are extraordinary. Coen brothers know how to make a movie, even if it is back-grounded with such a shallow story (story?). To me this movie has neither a beginning nor an end. It is just an excerpt from a life of a musician (and an orange cat). Long line of brief conversations and wandering around. Depressing at its best moments. Probably this would mean something to an American who was struggling to find his/her place on the stage in the depicted period, but to majority of the audience it's simply boring. Slow paced cat movie with some singing and guitar playing. Well made, though. Someone may even call it ""artistic"". But that's it. Nothing to write home about."
"jcbutthead86","10","1","3","7 February 2014"," An Excellent,Unforgettable And Funny Comedy-Drama From The Coen Brothers
","Inside Llewyn Davis is an excellent,unforgettable and funny Comedy-Drama that combines wonderful direction,a great cast,a fantastic script and a terrific soundtrack and with all of those element Inside Llewyn Davis is not only a great film but also The Coen Brothers at their best.<br/><br/>Set in the New York section of Greenwich Village in 1961,Inside Llewyn Davis tells the story of Llewyn Davis(Oscar Isaac),a Folk singer who is trying be a successful music artist while dealing with his own personal life taking him on an interesting journey of discovery about himself.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is another amazing film from one of my favorite directors master filmmakers Joel and Ethan Coen AKA The Coen Brothers. The Coens have been on a roll delivering great film after great film the first film being their excellent Oscar winning Masterpiece No Country For Old Men(2007),their wonderful and very underrated Black Comedies Burn After Reading(2008)and A Serious Man(2009),the terrific Western remake True Grit(2010)and now Inside Llewyn Davis,an outstanding Comedy-Drama that is funny,intimate and The Coen Brothers delivering another incredible film to their body of work. Right from the beginning Inside Llewyn Davis is a sensational film that gives us a brilliant and at times quirky character study set in and around the Folk music scene in Greenwich Village New York with a movie that is simple but is still very engrossing and unforgettable because when you watch the film you are on the journey along with the main character. The Comedy and Humor in Inside Llewyn Davis is funny and weird and done in the style that is very much like the Coen Brothers using the characters and interactions with each to drive the Humor which is subtle and interesting. Although the movie is funny the Comedy has much more in common with A Serious Man then say Raising Arizona and The Big Lebowski. Another thing that I love about The Coen Brothers films and this movie as well is the amazing photography and attention to detail. The photography by Bruno Delbonnel is beautiful and visually stunning making the cold snow and winter look very bleak and isolating and at times surreal with harsh lighting that is dark and light. Also,The Coen Brothers' attention to detail and production design by Jess Goncher give the film a realistic look and truly takes you back to the year of 1961 whether it's in a bar,on the road or in a music studio you will feel like you are in the Folk music scene of 1961. The music scenes in ILD are exceptional and gives the film not only a great energy and tone but an accurate depiction of what the Folk music scene was like in the early 1960s and the performances by the actors feel true(it helps that actor Oscar Issac is a guitar player and singer in real life). You can now add Llewyn Davis to the gallery of great and memorable characters from The Coen Brothers films because like most of the other Coen Brothers characters Lleywn is a character looking to find himself in his surroundings and trying to figure out where to go whether it's dealing with trying to be a successful Folk musician or his personal life that at times can be funny and dramatic. And while Llewyn isn't always the most likable character has a depth that makes us relate to him because we are along with Llewyn on the journey he goes on. Llewyn Davis is a great Coen Brothers character that anchors the film and is a character you will never forget. The screenplay by The Coens is wonderful and memorable filled with great dialog mixing Comedy and Drama the only way The Coens can do. The ending of Inside Llewyn Davis is truly amazing because it makes ask questions about what happened throughout the film while leaving you with laughs,wonder and mystery. A terrific ending.<br/><br/>The cast is great. Oscar Isaac is excellent and memorable as Llewyn Davis,with Isaac bringing emotion and depth to the role. Carey Mulligan is terrific as Jean,Llewyn's ex-girlfriend. Justim Timberlake does a fine job in his small role as Jim,Jean's boyfriend. Coen Brothers regular John Goodman is wonderful as Roland Turner,a Jazz Musician. Garrett Hedlund is great as Johnny Five,a beat poet. F. Murray Abraham is great as Bud Grossman,a guy in the music business. Ethan Phillips(Mitch Gorfein),Robin Bartlett(Lillian Gorfein),Stark Sands(Troy Nelson),Adam Driver(Al Cody)and Max Casella(Pappi)give good performances as well.<br/><br/>The direction by Joel and Ethan Coen is amazing and stylish,with The Coen Brothers always moving the camera and bringing a beautiful visual style to the film. Wonderful direction by The Coens.<br/><br/>The soundtrack in Inside Llewyn Davis is fantastic with mostly Folk songs by Oscar Isaac and more. An outstanding soundtrack.<br/><br/>In final word,if you love The Coen Brothers or Folk Music,I highly suggest you see Inside Llewyn Davis,an excellent,unforgettable and funny Comedy-Drama that is The Coen Brothers at their best. Highly Recommended. 10/10."
"shawneofthedead","8","1","3","16 January 2014"," Never has an elegy been so full of life, incident and gentle, comic tragedy.
","In a movie industry that encourages simplicity and accessibility, the Coen brothers and their almost uniformly excellent, resolutely quirky films have always set themselves apart. Where most other directors and writers would celebrate the triumph of the human spirit, Joel and Ethan Coen craft movies that practically take delight in the futility of human endeavour. Life and its attendant twists and turns, their oddly-named characters discover, just happen to you, however you might try to dictate your own terms. Even their fizziest of comedies have a darker soul buried beneath the laughs.<br/><br/>In much the same vein, Inside Llewyn Davis defies easy categorisation. It's ostensibly about the titular Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a struggling folk singer who couch-surfs across New York to avoid sleeping on the streets. For the week in his life that the camera stays with him, Llewyn is hunting for the cat that slipped out of his grasp when he was staying with the wealthy, Jewish Gorfeins (Ethan Phillips and Robin Bartlett). Along the way, he tries to ply his trade, hunting down a job opportunity in Chicago that might free him from his stints at the tiny, smoky Gaslight Café tucked inside New York's bustling Greenwich Village.<br/><br/>Tucked away within the meandering narrative, however, is a soulful meditation on the fickle nature of fate, fame and fortune. Frequently, movies and well-meaning mentors tell us that we are the architects of our own success: if we want something badly enough, if we're talented and work hard, the universe will provide us with a happy ending.<br/><br/>The tragic folk ballad that is Llewyn Davis, the hapless anti-hero of his own life story, tells us something quite different. Here is someone enormously gifted - this would be a different film entirely if Llewyn only thought he was a good singer - who has never managed to grab onto the spotlight when it flickers over him. He shares it, briefly, with singers who will go on to do far greater things than him. (Watch out for the iconic tousled mane and harmonica of the man who will soon change the face of folk - and popular - music forever.) Money, fame and joy seem to elude Llewyn at every turn, despite (and sometimes due to) his best efforts to get by.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis also works as both road trip and character study. As we travel with Llewyn from Manhattan's classy Upper West Side to the narrow, boxed-in apartment of his best friend Jim (Justin Timberlake), we get a peek into Llewyn's tenuous relationships, even the best of which are wrung dry of favours and predicated on lies. In an almost callous way, he fights with Jean (Carey Mulligan), Jim's girlfriend, over an indiscretion, and in the next breath, lunges desperately after a cat that bears a passing resemblance to the one he lost.<br/><br/>Llewyn's determination to do whatever it takes to get noticed - to get a job - also underscores the surreal road trip he endures to Chicago. This is perhaps the most characteristically Coenesque stretch of the entire film, the black humour played with a twist of sarcasm and irony as Llewyn is trapped in the car with his fellow passengers. He must suffer the derision of pushy jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman) and the casual disinterest of beat poet Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund), until circumstances - odd as they inevitably are in a Coen film - separate them all again.<br/><br/>The performances in the film are, in a word, sublime. A struggling actor for many years, Isaac must have seen the parallels between Llewyn's story and his own. This is his moment in the limelight, however, and he knows it. Isaac plays the highs and lows of the Coen brothers' melancholic script with marvellous self-assurance, and is hauntingly note-perfect in the songs and stories he spins for unappreciative audience members. Mulligan, Timberlake and Goodman all deliver memorable supporting turns, the first two even contributing a beautifully-harmonised rendition of Five Hundred Miles (with Stark Sands) to the soundtrack.<br/><br/>Anyone looking for the same oddball dynamics and sensibilities that the Coen brothers have honed to a fine precision in films like Fargo and No Country For Old Men should take heed: Inside Llewyn Davis is made of gentler, subtler stuff. It's a snow-washed blend of amusing drama and bitter comedy, played at half the tempo of the Coens' more frenetic output. As such, it might appear languid, and even a bit lifeless on a first viewing. But it's that rare kind of film which lodges itself firmly in the heart - or perhaps the soul - as it makes the most melancholic, magical music for a man who's slipped between the cracks."
"vibha101","7","1","3","13 January 2014"," Inside Llewyn Davis embodies immense soul and spirit
","I wasn't sure what to expect prior to watching Inside Llewyn Davis, but I was definitely impressed afterwards. Inside Llewyn Davis is one of those films with many grey areas and a lot of depth and sincerity to it. Llewyn Davis's character was extremely soulful and through his music he constantly conveyed a variety of different emotions ranging from sorrow, hope, defeat and compassion. One thing I found very striking in this film was its cyclical nature. The movie began and ended with extremely similar scenes with very minute differences in each. This shows us the difficulties that he had to face over and over as a struggling musician during the 1960s. This cinematic element reminded me of the film ""Before the Rain"" that began and ended the same way, where the characters were unable to escape their circumstances. Similarly, Llewyn Davis cannot escape the harshness of the current world he lives in where it is extremely difficult for a struggling musician to survive. It leaves you with a sense of ambiguity but also shows more about the character of Llewyn Davis and how true he is to his music. Unlike other characters in his film, he does not succumb to music or ways that are not a representative of his soul and who he is. Llewyn Davis expresses various emotions through his music regarding some of his life events such as his partners suicide and the birth of a child he had no idea about. This is what makes his character and his music heart wrenching and soulful. I think this film is more about Llewyn Davis rather than his life events. Overall my expectations for this film had been surpassed and I am extremely glad I went to watch it. It was thoughtful, filled with emotion and beautifully executed."

","I imagine the inspiration for Inside Llewyn Davis hit the Coens one night when they were letting folk music saturate their souls. Inside Llewyn Lewis is like a folk song acted out on screen. It may sound like a journey that isn't worth venturing on, but Joel and Ethan Coen have a nack for telling simplistic stories in an artful way. Though this film does not conquer relatively recent masterpieces such as No Country for Old Men or A Serious Man, Inside Llewyn Lewis is another bulletproof tale for the Coen brothers to add to their protracted resumes.<br/><br/>The title holds no hidden meaning, the audience shown the story from within Llewyn's perception. We are immersed in an unimaginative world through blue-tinted cinematography that highlights the faces of the characters as ghost pale. Incredibly beautiful and unique photography that feeds an underwater feel to the viewer, adding to the isolation and lack of direction Llewyn feels. Adding to that, Oscar Isaac portrays Llewyn, a performance that feels extremely personal to its audience. The frequent, tranquil folk songs create the rhythm of the picture, soothing the audience for approval, which it earns. The screenplay is an odyssey of searching for life direction, a story that would be truly gloomy if it were not for the Coens everlasting Fargo-esque, awkward humor. The comedy is sinfully funny and fits in between moments of drama. The Coens' screenplay explores the lead character's dark period wisely without abandoning their audience, only aided by the adept directing. <br/><br/>Carey Mulligan, who's performance shattered the screens with a strengthen arm in 2009's An Education, shows worse sides of her acting abilities as time moves her on. Here, she receives scenes of anger to bring to life, a task that obviously was asking too much of the actress by the Coen brothers. Mulligan actually detracts from the film. One knows it isn't a good sign when Justin Timberlake upstages an Academy Award nominee...with less screen time than her. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is an easier sell to audiences than most of the Coens work, but illusion of the ending may send audiences scattering. The approach is performed well by the Coens and could actually be seen as quite smart, but it's a move that could confuse audiences not anticipating a bit of trickery. I have thought on the ending since seeing it, there are different interpretations audiences can embrace, I do not know which I side with at the moment.<br/><br/>The film follows emphasizes a cat as symbolism for the lead character, they build a strong comparison case. I think the Coens have proved to deserve a reserved spot on every critic's year-end top 10 list with their multiple films having a consistent quality. It seems the directing duo can do no wrong. They have expressed their range now, yet with all their films they retain an auteur trademark of an ""earthy"" atmosphere. A reliable film for those who appreciate the craft being held to high expectations.<br/><br/>Grade: A<br/><br/>Rating: 8.0"

","The ""1-4-0″: @InsideLlewyn is a heartbreak of a film that will perforate your emotional husk, courtesy of Latino actor Oscar Isaac and the Coen Brothers.<br/><br/>The Gist: New York folk singer can't get a break as we see his life go from one debacle to another.<br/><br/>The Highlights: The cinematography, the brilliant representation of failure and defeat, the fantastic aggrieved performance from Oscar Isaac. I'm not a fan of depressing movies and this is one of them, but there's enough caustic humor here that manages to deflect some of the hard negative energy of the character and the film. The more in pain Isaac's character is in, the more the audience laughs, a classic Coen Brothers mark. Deep inside the DNA of the film, the core is about the everyday struggle to succeed and the resentment that comes along when one doesn't. One can become bitter, sensitive at constructive criticism, blind to others feelings and reticent and taciturn – all this has been captured magnificently by the Coen Bros. and Oscar Isaac in Inside Llewyn Davis. <br/><br/>The Lowlights: Folk music and the ending. Folk music isn't my cup of tea, but I was able to get passed that and listen to the lyrics of the broken Llewyn to understand how much of what he sang pushed the story forward. There was this one very catchy, droll, upbeat pop song though, ""Please Mr. Kennedy"" that has become embedded in my head, you should listen to it. Regarding the ending, and yes, there's a bit of a spoiler coming up, the denouement is a repeat of the opening scene. Actually, it is an extended version. It came out of nowhere and it infuriated me because of the randomness of it and because there was no explanation for it. According to Isaac, there's a musical metaphor to the repeated scene: ""I think it's like a folk song in particular, because generally in folk songs, it goes first verse, chorus, second verse, chorus, third verse, chorus and then back to the first verse again at the end. And there's a deeper meaning when you come back to that first verse.""<br/><br/>Pay or Nay?: If you're an indie moviegoer who searches for artistic films with a deeper human connection, than pay for it. If you're an average moviegoer who usually likes blockbuster films and commercial fare, then you'll hate it for its pace and its inherent unappealing characteristics. I personally enjoyed it because this film strips the celebrity gloss from musicians, you know, the struggling part that they never want to talk about?

","Writer/director/brother duo Joel and Ethan Coen have always been really hit and miss for me (I loved ""No Country for Old Men"" and hated ""The Ladykillers"", ""Raising Arizona"" and truly believe ""The Big Lebowski"" is one of the most overrated films of all time) but ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", with all of its dry and metaphysical humor, is a homerun.<br/><br/>Nearly void of plot, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is sort of a ""day (more like a week) in the life of"" story of a relatively homeless folk singer named Llewyn (Oscar Isaac). We follow him as he loses the neighbor's cat (which becomes a living, breathing motif throughout) asks for money, deals with the fact that he may have gotten a woman who hates him (played by Carey Mulligan) pregnant, does session work, rides around in a car with two characters (John Goodman and Garrett Hedlund) whom resemble Pozzo and Lucky from ""Waiting For Godot"", and toys with quitting the folk scene for a regular 9 to 5. Now clearly, while this doesn't sound like much in the way of entertainment, that Coen magic somehow makes this little movie one of the best of the year.<br/><br/>Finally, Oscar Isaac will get the recognition that he deserves! Yes, as you would probably imagine, the music in this film is great (the soundtrack is worth buying) thoroughly capturing the folk scene in Greenwich Village in 1961. But it is the performances from Isaac, which demands an Oscar nomination and Mulligan, who spends the entire supporting role with a consistent sour puss expression on her face only rivaled by Cate Blanchett's Jasmine, and the intelligent, true-to-life, self deprecating sense of humor which stems from the Coen's immensely clever and incredibly deep conversationally driven script, which deals with issues of relationships, questioning when is it OK to give up on ones dream and a smattering of enlightened ramblings from simple looking characters, as only the Coen's can depict.<br/><br/>Final Thought: At the end of the day, it's hard to pin down a clear cut reason as to why I thought ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" was so brilliant or why it resonated so much with me. So, I'm going to stop trying."

","Having reached the end of your rope, at least there's not enough left for a noose This could be the theme of the Coen Brother's latest, INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS, about an unlucky early-1960's folk singer whose career isn't exactly panning out.<br/><br/>The film begins with Llewyn waking up at someone else's pad. As he exits the apartment, the owner's orange tabby escapes and the day goes progressively downhill Like a grungy coin rolled down the street, a hapless, bearded Davis visits the places and people making up (and shaking up) his dreary life: From the local tavern where he performs to a very special girl he accidentally knocked up, we exist through the eyes of a title character who isn't particularly nice...<br/><br/>In that, the Coens have created a new sort of unapologetic, selfish anti-hero. Thus the best moments involve Davis's smug reactions to the world around him, surpassing the pivotal road trip with a motor-mouthed John Goodman, providing more of a break than a purpose.<br/><br/>Throughout this punctuating turmoil, set mostly in the cold New York/Greenwich Village wintertime, the one thing Llewyn can do is sing Having lost his duo partner, he's an un-discoverable solo act although his music, sung beautifully by Oscar Issac himself, is heartfelt and world-weary, especially compared to an intentionally campy tune that will stick in your head longer than the good stuff.<br/><br/>Perhaps this is intentional. If INSIDE has one purpose it's to show a character with genuine talent, much too personal and private for the mainstream – an isolated curse befitting both the man and his music."
"graupepillard","8","1","4","31 December 2013"," Leaving the theater silent with a touch of melancholy.
","I was on my way home on an icy day in NYC, after going to art galleries in Chelsea, and decided to pop into a theater and see Joel and Ethan Coen's INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS. The wintery weather befitted the mood of this slow, strange, original movie which left me with a lingering unexplainable feeling of pensive melancholy. I exited the cinema confused and stunned thinking of beginnings, endings, and repeated beginnings, a cycle which spins round and round – "" the times they are a-changin."" Afterwards, I took the bus home to my Greenwich Village apartment - deep in thought - the very locale where in 1961 an aspiring folk-singer named Llewyn Davis attempted to maintain his creative integrity in the face of commercial and personal ambush, often self-inflicted; youth is the period for reckless and self-righteous inquiry as well as outbursts of peevish anger and defiance.<br/><br/>INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a road trip with an expressive dark-eyed, bearded Oscar Issac playing the lead character – a young man stumbling along the path he has chosen for himself; a young man determinedly serious about being a folk singer who wants to be taken seriously; a young man who is careless and yet caring, a young man who is finding out about himself and his effect on others with haunting revelations from his past and present shaping future actions. Llewyn's songs sung in a mellow, resonant voice (arranged by executive music producer T-Bone Burnett} are an audible measure of the depth of the complexity ""inside"" Llewyn Davis - more so than any of the dialogue he laconically utters.<br/><br/>Communication with family and friends are almost farcical if they were not so ruefully inadequate. The Coen brothers skirt the line of caricature and burlesque when depicting these incidents, lightening the acutely dispiriting ambiance. There are many weirdly compelling bit parts by actors that contribute to the surrealistic mood of the film. One example being John Goodman who is grotesquely sinister, playing a fellow traveler in the claustrophobic atmosphere of an automobile, spraying a frenzy of wildly bizarre dialogue during those staccato moments when he is not ""nodding off"" from whatever actions he is performing every time he staggers off to the bathroom.<br/><br/>INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS flows at a pace all its own. A cat by the name of Ulysses flits in and out of various scenes, referencing Homer's epic poem The Odyssey, alluding to the ""trials"" that our hero must go through to return a changed man to himself. This is also a movie about being an artist, hanging on to one's own vision in the face of the marketable embrace of mediocrity. The sadness I felt when INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS ended was the bitter shroud of familiarity."
"axel-koch","8","1","4","30 December 2013"," Despite being close to the age of 50, the Coen brothers still underwent a very welcome process of maturing with Inside Llewyn Davis
","Llewyn Davis, a loose take on the folk singer Dave Van Volk, will, in hindsight, not be remembered as one of the Coen brothers' most interesting characters and neither will the movie, in which he is the eponymous protagonist. However, Inside Llewyn Davis is still another great picture by the inseparable duo that can deservedly look forward to a couple of Oscar nominations in January.<br/><br/>Whether it's the trademark cynical writing, the excellent acting throughout the cast, the bleak yet beautiful cinematography (even though it's not Coen regular Roger Deakins this time around, but Amélie's Bruno Delbonnel), or the perfectly done editing (reaching its pinnacle in a sort of match-cut between a man and a cat walking) – this semi-musical is done flawlessly and should be a feast for connoisseurs of quality movies. Yet I can't exclude the fact that the 105 minutes feels like a lot more than that and that the full-length folk performances popping up every now and then only increase this. That's not an all-too-strong counterargument though, as the sheer fact that Ethan and Joel Coen succeeded in making a so heavily down-to-earth and unspectacular story into a movie that I will definitely watch some time again is enough for praise. The protagonist, as it turns out, is probably the most relatable character in the year of 2013 and seeing him perpetually fail in his attempts at becoming able to really live from his hobby gets all the more harrowing to watch through that. <br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is the perfect dramedy and additionally a lovely experience for fellow cat-lovers, as the tubby with the aptonym Ulysses gets more screen time to be cute than all the supporting actors. That again shows that it's all about Llewyn and his never-ending cycle of failing, which makes the movie, despite being a step back in humour and inventiveness, a Coen number one: in the category of those of their works one can easily spend an hour thinking about."
"howard.schumann","9","1","4","29 December 2013"," Llewyn is a real human being
","Folk music has been around ever since there have been folks, but the folk revival of the 1960s was due in large part to the increased topicality of the songs and their relevance to the changing times. Though singers such as Joan Baez and Ian & Sylvia among others continued to sing traditional ballads, singer/songwriters like Bob Dylan, Tom Paxton, and Phil Ochs brought new life to the folk scene with their songs of sharp social and political comment. Little of the new vibe, however, creeps into the Coen Brothers Inside Llewyn Davis, the story of sad-eyed troubadour, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), a talented folk singer who remains stuck, singing in conventional mode while singers of perhaps lesser talent move forward.<br/><br/>Set in Greenwich Village in 1961, the film is loosely based on the memoir of Dave von Ronk, a successful sixties singer/songwriter and left-wing political activist who was known for his personal generosity and loyalty, qualities that are not reflected in the film's main protagonist. The dour Davis is understandably downcast after the devastating suicide of his friend and member of his folk group Timlin and Davis and the strain and weariness shows clearly on his face. He releases a solo album but it does not bring success and a scene in the office of his agent (Jerry Grayson) tells us all we need to know about his financial and emotional state. Without any stability in his life, he is forced to rely on friends and whatever family he has to put him up for a few days at a time.<br/><br/>His frustration is such, however, that he alienates those who try to help him including his sister Joy (Jeanine Serralles) whom he puts down for her conventional lifestyle. He is also at odds with his friend Jim (Justin Timberlake), and his wife Jean (Carey Mulligan) who thinks she is pregnant with his child and wants him to pay for an abortion. Her foul-mouthed disdain (uncharacteristic of women in the sixties, by the way) for Llewyn is both a sad and a comic high point of the film. Davis also stays with Columbia professor, Mitch Gorfein (Ethan Phillips), and his wife Lillian (Robin Bartlett), parents of his deceased partner.<br/><br/>A sequence in which the Gorfein's cat escapes from the apartment during his stay prompts a chaotic chase scene with the elusive animal and results in the singer having to carry the cat around with him for most of the film, a symbol of whatever you want to make of it. A trip to Chicago to visit record producer and owner of Chicago's Gate of Horn club, Albert Grossman (F. Murray Abraham) introduces us to a few more colorful characters such as Roland Turner (John Goodman), a heroin-addicted jazz musician with severe disabilities and a sharp tongue (who Davis cruelly leaves alone in an abandoned car on the highway), and the chain-smoking taciturn actor Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund).<br/><br/>The scene depicting Davis' solo audition with Grossman is mesmerizing in its stillness and sense of anticipation. Here Davis performs the English ballad The Death of Queen Jane while Grossman sits next to him, his gaze focused intently on the singer. Though the song is beautifully rendered, it seems inappropriate to what Llewyn is trying to accomplish, prompting Grossman to say, ""I don't see a lot of money here."" The music in the film, however, arranged by T-Bone Burnett, is its centerpiece and is deeply moving, especially songs such as Hang Me, Hang Me, The Last Thing on My Mind, beautifully sung by Stark Sands as Troy Nelson, a young Army officer, Bob Dylan's Farewell, 500 Miles, Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song), and the Ewan MacColl song The Shoals of Herring, sung by Davis to his sick father.<br/><br/>Even though the Coen Brothers' message - that it's difficult for any new artist of average talent to be successful in a highly competitive arena, especially when their actions are toxic and self defeating, is not a startling piece of information, Llewyn is a real human being who has so much soul that, while we may not like him, he strikes a responsive chord in anyone who has ever been on the outside looking in. Basically, what is inside Llewyn Davis is what is inside all of us, the longing to be accepted, to connect with and contribute to others, a longing that, though it is often misdirected and filled with pain, is universal and allows the film to transcend the singer's limited perspective. While Davis insists that singing is just something he does, we get the sense that, underneath his ""poor me"" act, he clearly knows that his singing indeed is ""a joyous expression of the soul,"" and is now ready to tap into it."

Inside Llewyn Davis insinuates a maddeningly frustrating folk performance existence on the title character. Like the drive up California's grapevine, it is nearly impossible to tell, while amidst the journey, that you are ascending a story arch.

It certainly shows a lovely recreation of a period long gone, and it has a cool soundtrack, but we wonder if by the end of the movie, we really got what just happened. There is some type of odyssey, with enough references by a very talented pair of writers/directors giving us another artsy exploration of a flawed person's life.<br/><br/>In here things just happen, and we're part of an audience who could be driving by a car wreck or a beautiful building, so we respond accordingly. The story's protagonist is certainly having a really difficult time that he seems to bring upon himself. His opinionated and arrogant persona certainly helps him derail whatever opportunity he might have to improve things. It certainly doesn't help that his fate appears to be written. Life appears just to be one messy circle.<br/><br/>There's one big question here: Who is that ""gentleman in the hat""? Why is he so aggressive? Is he Llewyn's conscience? Just a figment of the extraordinary imagination the Coens are able to conjure? He is there at a critical moment, and we wonder if we just sat through 90 minutes to understand there is no hope here.<br/><br/>Our ""hero"" jumps from sofa to sofa seeking help and shelter. He appears to take this for granted and rarely appears grateful. He visits people whom he appears to have wronged and shows little remorse. Even at times when he's given a way out of his mess, he finds a way to ruin the opportunity. We don't get much of a background, but we truly know his black cloud has been around for a while.<br/><br/>The film is hypnotic, as we follow him around time, interacting with people who in one way or another try to tell him that his dream might not happen exactly the way he wants it. There's a mention of his ex-partner, and we wonder what drove Mike to his ultimate fate. A few people manage to remind him what will his ""hubris"" lead him to. Goodman's physically compromised character is a hoot. He tells us so much with his body language, and his santeria speech is a winner. Then we see the authorities at work, the power of bureaucracy and the simplicity of a poisonous remark. I want to thank the Coens for allowing F. Murray Abraham to use his facial expression and a very minimalistic dialogue to deliver one very effective strike.<br/><br/>As I mentioned before, there is much to admire here, but it's not as good or entertaining as ""Oh Brother Where are Thou?"" or even the mysterious ""The Man Who Wasn't There"". Here we are again, seduced by the critical mermaids, and are we being misled like the people who accompanied the mythical Odysseus? Is this tale another illusion or the victim of an illusion created by others?"
"alanhull1","8","1","4","23 December 2013"," Inside Llewyn Davis, A Film About Artistic Integrity
","Inside Llewyn Davis, the latest Coen Brothers film, is a melancholy, yet touching, ambling tribute to folk music and artistic integrity. The music is prominently and beautifully featured, fitting in thematically and seamlessly integrated into the action. <br/><br/>I thought the first half was great, with Llewyn's struggles, both professionally and personally, really pulling me in emotionally. He grinds away, doing small gigs, while refusing to sell out, believing in himself and his art. Even though most of his problems are his own doing, it's hard not to have a soft spot for the starving artist. <br/><br/>I did feel it was a bit rudderless in the middle, particularly during the unsuccessful trip to Chicago (though an interesting, brief intersection with the jazz and beatnik crowd perhaps?). The ending brings it home strong. The framing mechanism of the final performance carries much greater meaning when it all comes full circle, because we've seen him live through all the sadness he sings about. There's also a subtle, cruel joke tucked in (that I loved), when his final performance is followed by that of a famous folk musician, suggesting what we hope will be the improbable break-through moment, will not be."
"jkbonner1","8","1","4","22 December 2013"," Oh! What an unlucky man he was
","Llewyn Davis's (Oscar Isaac) life is scattered and fragmented into bits and pieces as he seeks to make it as a folk singer in Greenwich Village's 1961 music scene.<br/><br/>Many reviews of this movie comment that Llewyn is unsympathetic, rude, an asshole, out of touch, obnoxious, unrelatable to, etc. etc. Personally I think the Coen brothers set out to make a movie about a character struggling to make it in a profession that is incredibly difficult to ""make it in."" You need talent. Sure. But you also need luck. Or whatever you want to call it: fortuitous circumstances; a fairy angel over your shoulder; serendipitous connections; being in the right place at the right time.<br/><br/>Llewyn has talent. Yes. Luck? No. Things just don't pan out for him. Partly because of his personality. Partly because of circumstances. It doesn't help that he comes from a working class background. His father was a seaman. Llewyn put in a stint as a seaman. The $11,500 his family's house sold for is going to pay for his dad's upkeep at a nursing facility. Money's tight. He ends up, like many artists did, sleeping over on someone's couch or bumming money off someone. What I didn't see too much evidence of were booze and grass, which would have been floating around aplenty in early '60s Greenwich Village.<br/><br/>The music scene in 1961 was beginning to morph as the social climate changed. The year 1964 saw the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley. The Vietnam war was heating up. American values were changing at an ever increasing pace, especially among younger Americans. The Counterculture was beginning to emerge. Certain musicians were there at that moment and captured in haunting lyrics the seriousness of the changes taking place and rode the wave.<br/><br/>In the very last scenes Llewyn is tipped off by Jean (Carey Mulligan) that he has a chance to make it that night at The Gaslight in the Village where a NY Times critic is going to be in the audience. He strums on his guitar and sings a wonderful, evocative ""Hang me, oh hang me."" But the next musician to follow him is Bob Dylan. Dylan's unique style, raspy piercing unforgettable voice, and musical poetry hit the scene. And Dylan rode the wave. And Dylan went through his own set of hardships on the rocky road to success. One man doesn't make it. One man does. That's how life works. No one said it was fair.<br/><br/>This movie doesn't have the whacky offbeat craziness and absurdity of some Coen movies like Fargo and The Big Lebowski, which is okay by me. Possibly the most engrossing character in the movie is the crippled irascible but eloquent jazz musician, Roland Turner (John Goodman), who occupies the backseat of a car heading for Chicago that Llewyn has hitchhiked himself into. He continually pokes Llewyn with one of his canes to make his point (he carries two to walk with because of his disability). Turner is a certifiable Coen-type character and Goodman renders him impeccably.<br/><br/>The acting is well done. The story is circular. Where Llewyn's life is at the movie's beginning is where it is at the end. Nowhere. A talented musician who couldn't smash through the barrier. One other point. The movie captures to a tee both the atmosphere and the brutal winter weather of NYC and Chicago in the early '60s. Winter in both cities makes Llewyn's lot in life even more a hardship. Still most definitely worth a watch.<br/><br/>8/10"

I guess that's a credit to the acting and the filmmakers. This isn't one of my favorite films by the Coen brothers, but it's definitely not the worst one."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","9","1","5","14 January 2014"," Even though more subdued and artistic, 'Llewyn Davis' is another great Coen film
","Nothing the Coen Brothers ever do is really a change of pace, but ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is about as close to one as you're likely to get from the filmmaking duo that has rolled out nothing but critically acclaimed hits since 2008 Best Picture winner ""No Country for Old Men."" Even with a three-year break between directorial projects for the first time in almost 20 years, they strike again with ""Llewyn Davis,"" perhaps their most understated and emotional effort to date.<br/><br/>""Davis"" is a melancholy story that finds occasional moments of classic Coen Brothers humor (that killer combination of wit, frankness, exaggeration and irony) and stirs the soul with an influx of folk music. Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) is a couch-surfing folk singer of unquestionable talent struggling to make money in New York's Greenwich Village in the winter of 1961. Plagued by a number of mistakes in his work and personal life and followed by the shadow of his stint as one half of a folk duo, Llewyn impatiently pursues his big break despite the lousy circumstances.<br/><br/>Isaac get his much-deserved big break as Davis, a role that could really only be played by someone yet to become a full-fledge movie star. In fact, the Coen Brothers veer away from casting their usual suspects entirely (except for John Goodman in a small role), which gives ""Davis"" both a different feel for the Coens in general and helps to get across the sense of anonymity in the folk scene. Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake play supporting roles as Jean and Jim, some lovable local favorites performing in the scene, but they're a small part of the film overall.<br/><br/>This is Llewyn's story entirely, a disheartening portrayal of the American dream, and without an ounce of sugarcoating. Plus, Llewyn is far from the brave and naive optimist who's hopelessly in love with his craft. He sees it very much as his passion, but it is his career, his work – a means to a paycheck. He's not the smartest or the most likable character, so it's actually the scenes in which he performs so beautifully that will move the audience to root for his success. We can observe his talent, but objectively, we can also see the very qualities in his personality and even his music that account for his struggle.<br/><br/>Although ""Davis"" has a number of striking scenes, some of which are difficult to watch, there's not much shock factor in this particular Coen Brothers film. The plot is non-traditional in the sense that there's no main conflict with scenes that move toward a resolution, rather everything that happens is meant to give us a window into the unforgiving nature of the life Llewyn has chosen for himself. His desperation road trip to Chicago to try and land a gig for a man with a prominent club sums a lot of this up. He bums a ride with Goodman's character Roland Turner, a jazz musician who tests Llewyn's wits to no end, and his ""chauffeur,"" Johnny Five, (Garrett Hedlund), a poet of few verbal words. The trip takes a strange turn with less than desirable results.<br/><br/>In most Coen films, each character or event, no matter how small, has something to say to the greater overall theme and ideas of the film. ""Davis"" is no exception, though it does so in much more subtle ways. One of the more prominent metaphors involves an orange cat that falls into Llewyn's care. Although the symbolism is obvious, the meaning remains open to interpretation in a way the Coens do so well.<br/><br/>Music is of course integral to this film in a way it has not been for the Coens since ""O' Brother, Where Art Thou?"" Music immediately sets the tone in addition to creating a nostalgic, poignant feeling throughout the film. The script explores the many uses of folk music as well. There are soul-bearing, intimate ballads like those sung by Llewyn to the political hijacking of folk music such as the scene in which Llewyn and Jim record ""Please, Mr. Kennedy,"" to the way folk music has evolved from songs from the ""old country."" ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is a film that all artists will appreciate, and quite possibly anyone who has dedicated themselves to something only to end up disappointed time and time again. The Coens approach this subject with brute honesty but also a certain poetic sensitivity. Especially when held up to their many irreverent comedies, ""Llewyn Davis"" will long be used as evidence supporting the Coens' knack for artistic, nuanced filmmaking.<br/><br/>~Steven C Thanks for reading!

","Wow. Honestly, I'm still touched by this pure work of cinema. It's quite a pessimistic and depressing- albeit very honest- depiction of the lives led by the people who aspire to be something greater than an average employee for a corporation. In this case, we have an impeccably talented folk musician named Llewyn Davis (played by Oscar Isaac) who's not exactly in the best of circumstances, considering his impoverished state and exhausted soul. Folk music has never been an overly popular genre, and his struggles prove the unfairness within dreamers' lives. Right from the get-go, we understand that Davis has been doing this for a while now. Unfortunately, he's not making a living off of participating in that which he absolutely loves and is spending every night at another friend's or relative's residence. His willingness to endure the hardships that plague his unlucky life (rather than fall back on something that's more financially sound) is undoubtedly appreciable. <br/><br/>The sad truth certainly should touch anyone who's looking to involve themselves in the entertainment industry, specifically, for quality (as can be seen here) is oftentimes disregarded as the majority of the public are drawn to simpler and more crowd-pleasing material. For instance, as I observed my surroundings in the theater room, I realized that not many people sat in the audience. That right there, folks, is the sad reality of the entertainment business, proving the lack of recognition of sheer quality in general as we're frequently distracted by the more extravagant productions that lead you from one intense situation to another. As I was originally stating, the pop and hip-hop music reign supreme while the intelligence found in tamer and more lyrics-based tunes is inequitably overshadowed. And rather than eventually permeate this clever picture with heartwarming events and Hollywood-izing the ending, the Coen Brothers remain ruthless in their brutally honest and genuine portrayal of a struggling individual who I largely sympathized with. <br/><br/>Davis's road ahead and behind is wretched, and you're forced to see him run into an adverse incident after another as if someone completely cursed him once in some unimaginable way. His behavior initially might bother some viewers, but as you witness the cruel and unforgiving individuals around him and the harsh environment- I, at least, definitely understood his persistently hostile attitude and mindset. He's not the ""asskisser"" who finds success in the industry by forming connections here and there and sleeping around elsewhere; he limply carries along with his integrity and dignity in tact. The filmmakers wisely never compromise in order to implement some superficial element to his character so as to present a more likable side. <br/><br/>Anyways, being that this is primarily a character-driven narrative, Oscar Isaac's performance is surely crucial to how the final product turns out. Fortunately, he's unquestionably phenomenal- I've got to love and appreciate the subtle performances as opposed to the showy and ""Oscar-baity"" paths that lots of actors seem to take in these kinds of films. No, Isaac is so capable in his role that you can't help but admire this miserable character as he proceeds along on his inauspicious journey. I found everything from his low-key mannerisms to the overall hesitant and reserved personality (especially when in the company of loud-mouthed or more enthusiastic people) incredible and utterly convincing. <br/><br/>Of course, I have to vastly rave about the film's amazingly beautiful and unique cinematography. To me, it seemed pastel-like, for lack of a better term, in a sense and borrowed a grayish, or predominately colorless, visual style. Throughout its duration, we're introduced to particularly darkened rooms, pervaded by rising smoke and an attentive crowd in a respectfully silent atmosphere- occasionally, we sight the light illuminating one side of the room while the other side remains desolate and gloomy. In essence, the Coen Brothers always know how to showcase the most stunning of camera-work, and speaking of traditional Coen Bros. strengths, the writing also keeps us highly invested throughout the numerous enthralling encounters and dispiriting conversations Davis runs into on his mentally gruesome adventure. <br/><br/>All in all, Inside Llewyn Davis is, without a doubt, one of my favorite films of 2013 (it expanded nationwide in early 2014, which is why I'm writing the review this late). Notice how I haven't even covered any weaknesses of the film. Guess why? Because there are none, and usually, Hollywood pictures disappoint me with their endings in that unnaturally happy or unnecessary fashion. Like I said, this film, however, refrains from sacrificing its artistic integrity as the melancholy tone never subsides. If you love the art of cinema and treasure the passionate filmmakers that still allow for clever projects like this to be made, go see Inside Llewyn Davis!"
"Horst_In_Translation","10","1","5","5 January 2014"," All the right notes
","After Joel and Ethan Coen had a very prolific three years between 2008 and 2010 (""Burn After Reading"", ""A Serious Man"" and ""True Grit""), ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is their only film since 2011. That, however, is not a problem at all as I'd love to wait three years for a film like this one. There's some films I like from the two and some I don't like, for example I wasn't too impressed by ""The Big Lebowski"", but I quite love ""No Country for Old Men"", and I haven't seen many of their earlier works, but I can safely say that, so far, ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is my favorite film they made and as well my new favorite film of 2013 with Isaac probably being my second or third favorite male performance next to Didi Hallervorden and Geoffrey Rush. Wonderful to see the Coens peak for me at this point and I am hoping for at least 20 more years of quality moviemaking from the brothers. I'm definitely curious about their next projects.<br/><br/>Back to the movie: I'm not shy of saying I found it a modern masterpiece, especially for the music genre and it wouldn't be difficult at all to write an own paragraph about the majority of scenes from this film and the genius behind it in terms of the characters, their actions and words. For lead actor Oscar Isaac, this movie should be a deal-breaker in landing crucial parts in films for many years to come. Of course, he owes so much here not only to his talent, but also to his writer-director duo. The Coens are the absolute masters right now in character creation (and casting the perfect people for those characters): the secretary in Mel's office, the elevator guy, the owner of the music bar or Troy Nelson of course, a character that pretty much defines the see-no-evil, likable (and highly talented) dimwit for years to come. Stark Sands may have been the perfect casting for him as well. John Goodman you just have to experience yourself how he starts rambling about his alleged voodoo background all of a sudden or about Brooklyn Bridge or about all the other wisdom or what he assumes wisdom. His character's expressions are pretty much the perfect example of the Coen's gift in writing dialogs.<br/><br/>Besides that, cat lovers will probably also enjoy this one as we see three ginger cats in what could almost be considered portrayals thanks to the way their actions were written and the first cat related scene at the Gorfein's may very well be the funniest of the entire film. Back to the human characters and to Llewyn: I also quite liked the one scene with his agent and the coat early on in the film. It perfectly summarizes him as a character. Llewyn Davis is not a hero. He's incredibly flawed, occasionally downright unlikeable, but still you feel for him in most situations. A true anti-hero. Another highlight is the music, right away from the first second with Isaac singing the first song of the film already. This gets us in the perfect mood for everything that is about to come music-wise and story-wise. Well done to all the singers and writers in this film. ""Please Mr Kennedy"" is the definition of groovy. ""Five Hundred Miles"" and ""Last Thing on my Mind"" will touch you and we also hear a moving Bob Dylan number in the background as we continue witnessing Llewyn's path. Maybe taking into account the renditions of all the songs and scenes in which they were played, my choice for favorite song would be ""The Death of Queen Jane"" played by Davis' character to F. Murray Abraham's character in a final attempt to save his singing career. Breathtaking effort.<br/><br/>This is an outstanding film and you should all go experience it yourself. Cannes got it right. Even if the film is set over 50 years before today, it has all the issues which are more than common today and probably always will be: economic struggles, pregnancies, abortions, fatherhood, career, sick family members and most of all taking the right paths. One could probably make a convincing argument on this movie being a great metaphor on homelessness. And yet, the film makes you smile all the way from start to finish thanks to the clever approach of situation comedy. I thought there was only one downright sad scene, namely the final car trip scene with the guy sleeping in the backseat and Llewyn driving and taking or not taking the crossroads to a different (better?) life with classical music playing strongly. Also the final line of F. Murray Abraham's character about reuniting had me choked up a bit. How effective can one line be?<br/><br/>A nice way to end my review is comparing the first to the final scene and the change of perspective we reached thanks to everything happening in-between. At first, we see a pretty talented musician being beaten by a stranger whose outfit looked a bit like organized crime. When we see the same scene near the end again, we see it from a totally different perspective and that Davis certainly had it coming and we could even understand the other man's approach. Of course, we also shouldn't forget that Davis' motivation that resulted in him being beaten up happened really more as an act in the heat of the moment as he just found out that he was probably simply targeted by Jean for being the weakest link. And that comes only right after he and Jean had a moment of true harmony for the very first time in the film. And also she allows him to sleep at her place a couple nights during cold winter, which is an act of mercy despite her permanent feistiness towards Llewyn. It's not a story of good or bad characters. They all have too many different shades and this is what makes this film a perfect 10/10."
"Jampa71","7","1","5","25 December 2013"," many layers that some may miss
","An interesting film but yes, kind of depressing. I found myself wanting more twists and/or an ending that reconciled at least some of the main character's journey. After reflection, it seems to me that Mr. Davis was caught in the Santeria spell perhaps. After bitching about folk music, a famous 60's folk hero showed him the way and he completely missed it, showing that maybe if he listened more instead of speaking...except that time was not necessarily linear...so many layers it is definitely very Coen brothers. I was disappointed at first but now see the complexity of the human condition they were trying to get across. Music is as complex as the human condition. What truly lasts are the songs that touch us deeply in our soul ...not just the flavor of the month. yet ....a catchy tune can last forever...so complicated."

","The thing I liked best about Inside Llewyn Davis is that unlike most movies today, it doesn't put long expositive speeches in the mouths of its characters to explain exactly what's happened in the past, what's happening now, and what's going to happen in the next scene. We get inside Llewyn simply by watching him make his way in the world.<br/><br/>Many reviewers have remarked that Llewyn is his own worst enemy, or that he's an unpleasant character, but if you watch the movie carefully, you'll get an idea of why he is that way, and perhaps even feel a bit of sympathy. The Coens don't come out and tell you about Llewyn's family background, instead showing brief vignettes that allow you to come to your own conclusions about the family dynamic. And if you pay careful attention to what happens before each of Llewyn's outbursts, you'll see that he lashes out because he is hurting. He's yearning for the music to be something that lifts him above the tawdriness and disappointments of everyday life, but trying to make a living at it keeps dragging him down in the mud.<br/><br/>In short,like all art, Inside Llewyn Davis requires you to put some effort into the collaboration, and to think about what you are seeing and what it means. If you are so used to a movie experience in which you are spoon-fed explanations, you may just let the pictures pass by and conclude that there isn't much there. But if you take the trouble to think about why, for example, Llewyn's last version of ""Fare Thee Well (Dink's Song)"" is so different that the preceding ones, you may start to get inside Llewyn Davis."

I remember one night, we just finished up and she had this knack for tying back her hair in bed to the point where it looked like she was giving herself a face-lift. She put on Snow Patrol and began bobbing her head like it was on a spring, slowly reminding me that we are all in a circuitous free fall around the drain's end... I said to her, ""this isn't music.""

","The film opens in the Gaslight Cafe in 1961 in New York City in the deep of winter. Llewyn Davis gives a beautiful performance, then goes out to meet somebody who wants to talk to him.

","Inside Llewyn Davis (2013) <br/><br/>**** (out of 4) <br/><br/>The Coen Brother's latest takes place in 1961 at Greenwich Village during the folk scene as struggling artist Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) tries to make decisions on his future. I'm not going to reveal too much about the plot but I must say this is quite the jewel and that I loved every single frame of the picture. When it comes to the Coen's films, I usually find them very good but never at a ""great"" level but this here is certainly an exception. Being someone familiar with the time and setting, I thought the directors did a remarkable job at really capturing the atmosphere and spirit of the era. The cinematography is without question some of the best that you're ever going to see and the entire look of the picture reminded me of ""The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan"" album cover. The soundtrack is also a terrific one with all of the numbers really jumping off the screen. Within seconds you're caught up in the lyrics and the music. The entire film takes place within a week, which is just perfect for the journey that Davis goes on as he tries to express himself through the various ups and downs of his life. I really thought the screenplay did a marvelous job at building up a complete and full leading character but it was also quite excellent when it comes to the supporting players and their impact on Davis. The performances are certainly a major plus with Isaac doing a marvelous job in the lead role. I really loved the way he brought this character to life and especially the various moods that he goes through. This includes some very dark moments in the film but also some pretty funny ones where his mouth gets him into trouble. The supporting players include very good turns from Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman is simply divine in his small role. The directors have obviously put a lot of love and affection into this project and it shines through during every single scene. This probably isn't going to be a film that appeals to the masses but those who appreciate cinema are bound to love it."

A film with a continuous solid story line, phenomenal comedic moments, and excellent dialogue to this film?
Anyone that loved this movie isn't any different than the Woody Allen lunatics that feel every movie he made was brilliant and if not, then misunderstood. Whatever Joel & Ethan we're going for with this film, it wasn't to entertain or stimulate the mind. It was for people who like folk music."

","From the opening moments of the film, Oscar Isaac's performance as Llewyn Davis had my heart aching in the sad beautiful way that only an old folk song can. The pain of a life full of work and hard scrabble effort welled up in my soul like the tears you shed for an old man who dies with an empty bank account and a well worn picture of his long gone sweetheart.<br/><br/>I won't talk too much about the plot of this movie because it is one of those meandering plots that really serves more to explore the character of Llweyn than to entertain or create a tight through line. The film is really more about understanding the soul of folk music and one of the people who makes it.<br/><br/>His frustrations and obstacles are the same as many musicians. He's nomadic, aching from a loss, flat broke most of the time, and seen, by many of the people around him, as a bottom feeder, living off of other people's kindness until he drives them crazy enough to force him to leave. He's a good performer but not a great one and a lot of the time his pain makes him a real jerk to those around him. He's a working artist.<br/><br/>Normally I wouldn't go into such a lengthy description of a character but so much of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is about understanding the place that music holds in Llewyn's life and how he sees the people around him in comparison. The world around him is cold full of people who seem to want to use him for their own purposes then blame him if he asks for anything in return. Even the people who seem to really like him can't help but ask him to basically play impromptu shows in their living room.<br/><br/>Yet his music speaks to them all. They may not know how to capitalize on it and he may not know how to turn his talent into cash but everyone seems to recognize that he has a gift.<br/><br/>Enough about the character (although his complexities could be the topic of several essays.) The rest of the film is a stunning piece of work. The cinematography is subtle at times but not afraid to do its own share of the speaking in the film, alternating between the cold distance of the city of New York and its inhabitants as well as the close hominess of small apartment living rooms with couches that double as beds yet symbolize his vagabond status.<br/><br/>The music is quite simply, some of the best I've ever heard in a film. The soul of the performances is brilliant but the Coens continue to show their deep understanding of relating themes through their films' music rather than just playing nice songs. While Llewyn's music is aching and drawn out like your first high school crush, the music of the other musician's whom he disdains are snappy, calculated, arranged and somewhat robot like. In fact many of the songs not played by him feature countdowns and numbers, making it feel computed by something other than emotion.<br/><br/>While this isn't the Coens' funniest film it certainly has its moments.Even while communicating serious ideas The Coen Bros. never forget that their audience is not a group of masochists who just want to punish themselves with sadness. Even some of the hardest moments of the film elicit guffaws, not because they are jokes, but because the turns are so unexpected, even as they are not usually great moments for Davis.<br/><br/>As in many of the Coens' films, one of the things I find myself loving is their connection to the every-man. When the go to make a movie about a folk singer they don't make it about a famous or successful one. The majority of people work their lives away with recognition only from their family and friends, and even that is sometimes absent.<br/><br/>Though they are famous, they don't seem to have let it remove them from telling of the woes and toil which befall most of the work-a-day folk who live in this world. Those people who may tell a story that makes their friends laugh but would never be a famous stand up comedian, the men and women who build other people homes too lavish to live in themselves, or perhaps the singer who could never sell out a theater but who picks away at a beat up six string and sings with a sadness that causes everyone in the bar to think of those they miss but still love."

","I watched this at home on DVD from my public library.<br/><br/>In general I am a fan of Coen Brothers movies, ""Fargo"" is a masterpiece, and I have varying degrees of admiration for the others. But they always deliver something interesting.<br/><br/>As the ""making of"" extra states they were very fortunate to find Oscar Isaac, someone who is an accomplished actor and who also can credibly play guitar and sing. He is Llewyn Davis and the movie's title comes from the name of his first solo record album called ""Inside Llewyn Davis."" But on a broader scope the whole movie is an examination of what in fact is inside Llewyn.<br/><br/>The movie actually begins and ends with a continuation of the same scene, Llewyn is asked to go outside into the alley after he performs, a ""friend"" wants to see him. It turns out to be an angry husband from out of town, his wife had been performing and Llewyn wasn't very nice.<br/><br/>In between the first snippet of that scene and the resolution of it we see about a week of Llewyn's life, trying to make it as a solo performer after his duet mate killed himself. Llewyn is good, very suitable as a 1960s folk singer, but he is not a very nice person and is basically homeless. There is also a cat, belonging to a neighbor, that becomes a running gag throughout.<br/><br/>It is well-made and interesting, and Isaac is great in the role, but I find that it has no real staying power in my thoughts the way the better Coen Brothers movies do."

"harryrgrove","9","0","2","21 October 2015"," A beautiful, charming, fairytale of New York
","The Coen brothers are maybe best known for their action thrillers, such as 'No Country For Old Men' and 'Fargo', or possibly their romping comedy 'The Big Lebowski'. In 'Inside Llewyn Davis', however, I saw something entirely different: a quieter, almost silent, tale of character - a sad and yet funny film about a week in the life of a young New York folk singer (excellently portrayed by Oscar Isaac).<br/><br/>The title ""Inside Llewyn Davis' is a curious one. It seems to promise an insight into the understanding of the principal character, and this is exactly what we get. In the opening scenes, I saw a charismatic and mysterious character, but as the plot rolls on, I began to learn more and more about this character, and also like this character more and more. This is the genius of the film: the protagonist is an excellent example of a character who is not lovable - in fact at times he seems detestable - but he gets such a bad hand that we as the audience are inclined to feel sympathetic. <br/><br/>Another aspect of the film that is completely nailed by the Coens is the tone. It seems like a dull take on a somewhat dull life at the beginning, but by the end of the first act of the film I began to realise what was not a dull mood but one brimming with character: sometimes the mood was soulful, sometime it was sad, and at others it was plain heartbreaking. This mood was helped along by a series of aspects and devices: first and foremost, I must talk about the cat. The use of the cat to describe the situation of the plot and to brilliantly convey humour may just be the loudest and brightest example of the genius of Joel and Ethan. <br/><br/>The cat isn't all that the writing of the film excels in. During the scenes of dialogue, I felt as though they were real, creeping upon me and connecting with me deeply. They were emotional, devastating and hilarious all at once. The script was helped, of course, by a truly magnificent performance from Oscar Isaac - frankly, it was a crime that he did not receive so much as a nod from the academy. I should add to this that boy, can he sing! All songs in this film were performed live, which I cannot acclaim enough and adds a whole new dimension to the screenplay.<br/><br/>The other major way that this film builds such brilliant tone is through the cinematography. I expected something good from Bruno Delbonnel, but what I got was sensational. Perfectly capturing every scene in every frame is a true challenge in film making, and Delbonnel has done it as well as anybody could have. Again, I must refer to the academy: I am so glad they nominated the cinematography, but I thought, although Birdman was the better film, that Delbonnel deserved the Oscar over Lubezki. <br/><br/>The main criticism that most of the audience are having from this film is ""What actually happened?"" which in some ways I can understand: the story literally finished in the same place it started. However, I believe that the people saying this have missed the point of the film completely. 'Inside Llewyn Davis' is a journey into, and with the character, of Davis, and therefore the audience should not require plot development or, at a stretch, much character development: I was compelled to watch and re-watch this film because of the technical aspects and characters of the move. A good plot does not a good film make.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is a quiet but masterful work from the Coen brothers, as they continue to hop to and in between many genres - in fact, in may just be one of their best. I would ultimately recommend the film to any fan of Joel and Ethan Coen, or any fan of film in general, with this triumph of script and character."
"bryank-04844","9","0","2","22 August 2015"," This is a great addition to the Coen Bros. library.
","The Coen Bros. have knocked it out of the park yet again with their latest film 'Inside Llewyn Davis'. Although, I don't think this will have the big box office draw that 'O Brother Where Art Thou?' or 'No Country For Old Men' had, but I expect people to be talking about this film for months to come and singing the impressive soundtrack, which was produced by T Bone Burnett. In the scale of things, this is a very small film set in the New York folk music scene in the early 60s. In true Coen Bros. fashion, the mood is darkly funny, and follows a man, who tries to find himself later in life through his music. I can't recommend this film enough.<br/><br/>We first meet Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac) inside a seedy bar/cafe, where the spotlight shines on him and his lonely guitar as he sings a song about being put to death, then as he exits the bar after his set, a mysterious old man whose face we cannot see beats Llewyn severely for reasons unknown. Llewyn is a struggling musician, who has the potential to be the next Bob Dylan, but lacks manners and vision as he drifts from couch to couch of his friends if he needs to sleep, while also treating these ""friends"" in not such a swell manner.<br/><br/>We don't really know why Llewyn acts the way he does, but it seems to stem from his music partner's early death that is still clearly effecting him. The Coen's have crafted a perfectly flawed character that is a true test of the human spirit that we see this man get rejected, beat up, and abused - most likely because he deserved it, but how we still want to follow him into the darkness and back, time and time again.<br/><br/>While staying at Jean and Jim's (Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake) place, Llewyn is hit with some rough news by Jean, and is forced to fix it with cash he doesn't have and perform music on stage with her and record a new commercial album with Jim and his friend Al Cody (Adam Driver), who is donning the cowboy look in New York. The recording session is very comical.<br/><br/>But then the Coen's flip the film upside down into some form of a bizarre episode of 'The Twilight Zone' with Llewyn going on a roadtrip to a gig with an old entertainer played by Coen favorite John Goodman, who has a personal driver who doesn't say one word, and where Goodman himself constantly berates Llewyn. It's a bumpy road ahead for Llewyn and perhaps on this road, we get a glimpse of the true man Llewyn really is, which makes the title seem perfect.<br/><br/>The film is beautifully shot of course as we capture the essence of big city life in New York, but specifically in the seedy underbelly of the folk music scene. It's not a typically bright movie, but neither is the film itself. Isaac does an amazing job as Llewyn as we see him struggle with his own mind and body through this two hours of time. And the soundtrack is killer and have been listening to it since the film came out. This is a great addition to the Coen Bros. library."

","Inside Llewyn Davis has become one of my favorite Coen Brother's movies.<br/><br/>The story was very simple, which I felt was needed for this story, too much complicated things would have made it confusing. Some side stories ended abruptly, which I didn't like, but small enough to look over.<br/><br/>The acting was good, Oscar Isaac was the stand out performance while the others were OK. There were some scenes where it was hard to understand Oscar Isaac or the other characters though.<br/><br/>The camera work was great. There were so many nice shots that they captured my eyes immediately. I don't believe there was one scene that didn't look good in this movie. There was some noir feel to some scenes while others felt light hearted and bright.<br/><br/>Inside Llewyn Davis is a very heart felt and personal movie. Personally, I don't see it reaching to the mainstream audience, but I do see it being a cult film that will be remembered for a long time. People may think this movie looks stupid, but when watching it you can see the effort and love that had been put into this movie. Inside Llewyn Davis is a great movie, I loved it."

","Llewyn Davis, (Oscar Issac) a struggling folk singer, travels from New York to Chicago in the 1960's to try to establish a solo singing career, amid many obstacles.<br/><br/>This is a very complex movie. It is a funny movie, at first I thought it was a straight out comedy, but then it tackles serious issues, love, but not in the way a typical movie deals with it, loss in a more traditional sense and even symbolism. I was actually ruminating on the symbolism of a cat. This movie handles comedy and drama so adeptly, that it feels like real life. Life is sometimes funny, sometimes tragic and this movie echoes both extremes really well. The scenes are punctuated by hauntingly beautiful music, that adds to the overall mood of the film. The ending is appropriate to the overall film, and that's all that needs to be said. I did not go into detail on the plot, because any details would ruin your enjoyment of the film.<br/><br/>The acting is superb. The cast is led by Oscar Isaac, who plays the darkly comic, sometimes morose Llewyn Davis with an innate sense of self. He knows this character inside and out. Carey Mulligan is also outstanding as the vituperative, venomous Jean, although her American accent slips every once in a while. Mulligan also has a great singing voice, as does Isaac. Justin Timberlake has a terrific singing voice, but he's still a wooden actor, and yet he gets these plum roles, inexplicable.<br/><br/>The Coen Brothers are especially visual in this film, underscoring the claustrophobic feeling of living in New York City, filming down stairways, and between narrow hallways. The pacing is perfect, and the music is interspersed beautifully within the film. The brothers get beautiful, heart wrenching performances from a largely unknown cast. It reminded me somewhat of another Coen brothers film, O Brother Where Art Thou, with its comedic touches and music, but Inside LLewyn Davis is a much darker film.<br/><br/>This is a must-see.<br/><br/>For more reviews to sing about, visit my blog, reviewswithatude.wordpress.com"
"happy_hangman","6","0","1","15 March 2015"," Not Quite A Classic
","The posters for 'Inside Llewyn Davis's hype it as Classic Cohen Brothers, and it is most certainly that...sort of.<br/><br/>Replete with an oddball, outsider protagonist, a host of endearingly iconoclastic supporting characters, great use of landscape and occasionally blisteringly hot one-liners. A period piece, set amid the early '60s folk circuit, it riffs on Ulysses (sometimes a little heavy-handedly) anduma certain Bill Murray film (though to name it would if not actually spoil a surprise, make you arch a quizzical eyebrow a little less archly). Oscar Isaac in the central role of an aspiring folklore is by far the Cohen's least sympathetic leading character in quite some time, and it is greatly to his credit that despite this disadvantage he's almost endearing in his single minded capacity to learn nothing from his mistakes. The music is always entertaining (superb soundtracks being yet another perennial quality of Joel and Ethan's flicks. John Goodman, F. Murray Abraham, Justin Timberlake (again demonstrating his skills as an excellent character actor) and the lovely Carey Mulligan (brunette, here, and thus making me even happier than usual) are all as good as you would expect in file-sharing this Homer homage."
"PacificHeights","Null","0","2","15 March 2015"," Brilliant
","The Coen Brothers have created another brilliant film, shot in black and white, with Inside Llewyn Davis. They take us into Llewyn's life for one week, a very long, gut-wrenching week of agony as this young man tries to deal with life the best way he knows how.<br/><br/>Llewyn's best friend and his music partner, Mike, dies suddenly and unexpectedly. Llewyn doesn't know how to deal with the pain and the emptiness of his loss. So he doesn't. He bottles up his grief and continues his search for musical recognition in 1961 Greenwich Village. Davis depends on the kindness of others during his financial and emotional low period. He gets devastating news that his friend's wife, Jean, is pregnant. She demands that he pay for the abortion. The amount was a hundred dollars, but it may as well have been a million because Llewyn is flat broke. He complies with her demand and cuts a novelty record. It was a humiliating experience and one that will be in his music history for the rest of his life, but he did what he considered to be the right thing by getting the money for Jean.<br/><br/>Set backs continue to pile up on Llewyn Davis as he continues his quest for folk singing recognition. He learns many hard lessons about false promises, advancements made by others based on sexual attraction and not talent, consequences of a few words spoken in anger, and many others. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac gives a first-rate performance as Llewyn. Carey Mulligan delivers a good performance as well. The cinematography captures the time and place of the action perfectly. With many excellent films to their credit, The Coen brothers have a beautiful film in Llewyn Davis."

"yulia-pomarina","8","0","2","7 January 2015"," Merciless Truth
","This is a story about an average individual. Llewyn is a musician. He is talented, but not too much. He is upset with his companion's (co-singer's) death and absolutely crushed. During the film's time he makes all mistakes a person in such a condition is able to do. So we can see, he is rather far from - not even ""ideal"" - he is far from even what can be so called ""a good fellow"". Every chance he could get spectator's sympathy, he loses it (he passes by a curve leading to a city where his child might live whom he never has seen before, he leaves a homeless cat on a road, he insults an amateur- singer who shares the same stage with him and his friends, and so on, and so on, and so on). We see a person full of good intentions but he is very weak and broken to be able to follow them. It is a film about a loser. Llewyn is not like Shakespearean heroes with their deep heroic passions and misfortunes, no, he is just very light, very common, very shallow, and he splashes not in an ocean, he splashes in a bog, and the bog absorbs him. This is a movie about when something wrong can happen it happens. What I dislike in this picture - there is not happy-end at all. Even not a hope. I would prefer protagonist to be reborn after his wrongs, stay and think, organize himself, opened a new truth in his life. But no. He just continues his decline within the movie.<br/><br/>And I felt a vexation about all this situation. I believe that it is what the movie is about mostly. The moral is: When you are in bad condition, you can not act right, all you do is wrong. You can not change anything until turning you into a good condition. So when you are in depression do not try do something until you stop it. Honestly it looks like an educational movie how to discover that your friend is in depression and why it is bad. It is very bad indeed. The worst is that it is a movie about everyone who was at least once in a bad mood and bit his friends', wife's or child's head off. So the film is mercilessly true. Masterpiece but too hard to watch again.<br/><br/>Concerning the acting, directing and music - the movie is perfect. Especially music. It is as good as country music can be, slightly sad and wise, and perfectly performed. So when I am in a mood to mourn over our world (when the world seems unfairly wrong) and nothing can relieve my mind I listen to the 'Inside Llewyn Devis' soundtrack."

","Ethan Coen and Joel Coen has to be two masterclass director's and writers in movie media, and I said that back in my older reviews of these two.<br/><br/>The story to Inside Llewyn Davis is about a trip through New York's folk music scene in the 1960s as a singer-songwriter does his best to make it through these times.<br/><br/>Every time the Coen brothers release a new movie I always expect something great from them as they other films never let me down and always top my exception. With Inside Llewyn Davis it's a road trip film with little comedy this and there, and once again the Coen brothers showed off how talent they truly are, because this movie is freaking fantastic.<br/><br/>I have to be honest here but I didn't know who Oscar Isaac was before watching this movie. I couple of times I heard someone brought up his name but that's it really, didn't know who he was so when I watched this movie my first thought when I saw his acting and singing was ""I want to see him in more films"", because this guy is just brilliant and I'm a bit disappointing of myself for not seeing his other films in the past. His character can come off a bit of a douche at times but he played the role so well and breath so much life into it that I actually liked him, all because of Oscar Isaac.<br/><br/>The directing and the writing by the Coen brothers and do I need say more, I'm running out of things to say about this two masters of filmmakers. The movie is was written really well and once again I'm can't find anything else to say of what I ready said before in my other past reviews. The songs in this movie are probably some of the best music I've heard in a while and it was really catcher as well.<br/><br/>I love the way this film looks, you know that bright, clean looking and gorgeous to look at cinematography that stands out. The cinematography in this movie is just utterly spectacular. every shot looks like it took forever to get the perfect shot and a lot of hard work went into this to get, but the people who did the cinematography in this movie pulled it off perfectly and no wonder they got a Oscar nomination for it.<br/><br/>My only small little nick pick with the film is the John Goodman character (Roland Turner) Now don't get me wrong I like John Goodman has a actor and as a person , but I didn't feel like he fitted in the film, that might just be me but his character just kind of show up and then goes and never brought up again. <br/><br/>Overall Inside Llewyn Davis is a fanatic drama peace with a lot of amazing things to experience in this film."

","It's about the journey, not the destination. Hard to explain why this movie works, other than that. It appears to be a rambling, pointless film. However, the rambling, almost-cyclical, quite depressing in a way, story has many charms. <br/><br/>It is the story of an almost-famous everyman, his trials and tribulations, the almost irrecoverable rut he is in. Fill those adventures with the Coen brothers usual mixture of quirky characters, humour, symbolism, red herrings and character depth, and you have a very engaging story.<br/><br/>Great performance by Oscar Isaac in the lead role. Good supporting cast too. Probably the most surprising performance is by Justin Timberlake. Yes, we already knew he could act, but here he is hardly recognisable as an early-60s folk singer. Solid performance.<br/><br/>On the subject of musicians, the music is one of the highlights of the movie. Some great tracks, some written just for the movie. Helps if you like early-Bob Dylan/Steeleye Span/Fairport Convention- style folk (and I do), but it is very well done.<br/><br/>Subtler than your average Coen brothers movie, but well worth the watch."

","I've been a longtime admirer of the Coen Brothers, and they have made some of my favorite films. Still, most of them have been accessible in some way. This one was quite a hard nut to crack. INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS is a loose story about a down-on-his-luck singer named Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac). To name a few problems, his former musical partner committed suicide, one of his sexual flings is pregnant and it may or may not be his, and he was recently let go from his record company. In other words, life is hard for him. To make matters worse, he isn't too sympathetic of a character either. His go-it-alone nature and tendency to speak his mind get him into hot water with a whole host of people he meets over the course of the film. And yet he keeps on going, devoted to pursuing his chosen profession. That was my way in, and what eventually helped me get into the movie. Despite what life threw at him, he never gave up. Not only that, but there were some truly soul-stirring songs peppered throughout which helped to lighten the mood, even if they did describe things like saying farewell and being hanged. I also enjoyed the color palette and general visual aesthetic of the film. It was almost like chiaroscuro with muted blues, grays and browns. Also, like most Coen Brothers films, this was a comedy, although there was more of a greater tragic/melancholy tone this time around. The closest comparison I can make is with their previous effort A SERIOUS MAN, which dealt with similar themes of a man against the world and falling victim to circumstance. However, LLEWYN DAVIS is played straighter and has a more uplifting resolution, if one can call it that. Overall, though my patience was tested at times, it was rewarded somewhat in the end. As far as technical filmmaking quality and the performers/performances involved, this some of the Coens' best work, even if it was a little dense for me at first. This probably isn't the best film for Coen Brothers initiates, but for seasoned viewers I feel like this could hold something special. In fact, I'll probably get more out of a second or third watch myself. Recommended, with some reservations."

","From directors the Coen brothers, Ethan and Joel (Raising Arizona, Fargo, No Country for Old Men, True Grit), I would have assumed this film was a mild sleeper hit, but it certainly got more promotion towards awards season, and rightly so. Basically, set in 1961, in Greenwich Village, New York City, folk singer Llewyn Davis (Golden Globe nominated Oscar Isaac) is struggling with his career, following the suicide of his musical partner Mike Timlin, and his recent solo album Inside Llewyn Davis is not selling; and with no money he is sleeping on the couches of friends and acquaintances. Following a night in the apartment of older friends the Gorfeins, their cat escapes, he is forced to take it with him, until he can return the cat he takes it to the apartment of Jim (Justin Timberlake) and Jean (Carey Mulligan) Berkey, Jean is pregnant and fears Llewyn is the father, so she wants him to pay for an abortion. The next morning the cat escapes again, Llewyn records a novelty song with Jim and Al Cody (What If's Adam Driver), as part of the ""John Glenn Singers"", he agrees to payment of $200 with no royalties, needing money immediately, Llewyn sets up Jean's appointment at the gynaecologist's office, he discovers from the doctor that a previous girlfriend, without telling him, decided to a child he paid to be aborted, and then she moved to Akron. He spots what he thinks is the Gorfeins' cat while eating with Jean, he returns it that evening and is invited to dinner, after he reluctantly sings a song he had recorded with Mike, ""Fare Thee Well"", Lillian Gorfein (Robin Bartlett) starts singing in harmony which frustrates him and makes her leave the table crying, it turns out also the cat he brought is not theirs, he takes the cat he found with him and leaves. Llewyn hitches a ride with two musicians, laconic beat poet Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund) and odious jazz musician Roland Turner (John Goodman), who are heading for Chicago, on their drive Roland collapses from a heroin overdose at a roadside restaurant, and Johnny is arrested after resisting to move on stopping on a highway, with no car keys Llewyn leaves the car, unconscious Roland and the cat behind. He reaches Chicago and auditions for producer Bud Grossman (F. Murray Abraham), following his singer Grossman tells him that he is not suited to be a solo singer, he would consider incorporating him into a trio that he is forming, Llewyn rejects this offer and hitches a ride back to New York, driving on the way he hits what he thinks was the same cat he found. Back in the city Llewyn plans to rejoin the merchant marine union, he first visits his unwell father, however his sister threw out his seaman's license which he needs to ship out, he apologises to Jean for everything, and she tells him he has got a gig in the Gaslight that she set up, it is there that Pappi Corsicato (Max Casella) claims he had sex with Jean, and in a moment of frustration he heckles a woman performing on stage. Going to the Gorfeins' apartment Llewyn is welcomed graciously, he is surprised to see that their actual cat Ulysses has returned home, Llewyn performs at the Gaslight, he is applauded, Pappi teases about the heckling he did the previous night and tells him someone wants to see him outside, in the alley Llewyn is beaten for a suited man in the shadows, for heckling his wife, the last moment is him looking up as the man drives away in a taxi. Also starring Alex Karpovsky as Marty Green and Ethan Phillips as Mitch Gorfein. Isaac as the title character is fantastic both as a sympathetic character and with his soulful voice, co-stars Mulligan, Timberlake and Goodman are great with their time on screen as well, it feels low-key throughout and runs a nice steady pace, it makes you laugh with deadpan humour and feel sad at the right moments, and the original songs are brilliant, this is a most watchable comedy drama. It was nominated the Oscars for Best Cinematography and Best Sound Mixing, it was nominated the BAFTAs for Best Original Screenplay for Joel and Ethan Coen, Best Cinematography and Best Sound, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture - Comedy or Musical and Best Original Song for ""Please Mr. Kennedy"".

And like Jake Barnes, from the Hemingway novel, Llewyn has a piece of himself missing--his former singing partner, Mike. Llewyn loses himself in this lost part of himself, and thus falls into the wind's swirling, circular course. But his obstinacy and pretension keep Llewyn from escaping, and so, as the movie's beginning and ending scenes suggest, Llewyn is stuck in a rut from which he'll never escape until he can learn to compromise. <br/><br/>And since I've already compared the film to one literary work, I suppose it wouldn't hurt to bring in a few others. Llewyn's cyclical life evokes Sisyphus, although if Albert Camus imagined Sisyphus happy, the Cohen brothers imagined him broken, weary from pushing his meaningless rock day after day. <br/><br/>And then, of course, there was the cat, that elusive creature that kept slipping through Llewyn's fingers, much like his dream of being a renowned musician. I can't help but think of T. S. Eliot's ""Prufrock"" here, with the ""yellow smoke that rubs its muzzle on the window-panes."" <br/><br/>But anyways, I thought the film was excellent. The writing was superb, the direction was great, and Oscar Isaac really shined, even if only as a diamond in the rough. (And mad props to Adam Driver for being one heck of a scene-stealer.)"

","When I first saw the trailer to this, I didn't really have any urge to rush out and see it. It just didn't seem like a movie I would enjoy. But over time I kind of gained an interest in checking it out, and I'm glad I finally did. It's different for sure, but interesting, and there's a lot there.<br/><br/>The whole movie is extremely aimless and roams around, just like the main character it follows. Llewyn Davis kind of roams around himself, sleeping on couches and just taking it a day at a time. He doesn't exactly have a specific goal in this film, lie most films would. It also doesn't really wrap the whole thing up at the end. But it's not exactly about that. It's about the journey he goes on and what he learns. I thought the whole cat situation he gets involved in was interesting, and there's a lot to look into regarding that (""Llewyn is the cat""). There's also a weird connection between the first few minutes of the film and the last few minutes, where it almost feels like some kind of time loop. I think due to the nature of some of the discussions in the film about Llewyn just not trying to change and letting things happen to him again and again, I think the loop worked. It may confuse some, but I think it is really neat. I'm sure on a second viewing I would pick up on more.<br/><br/>The performances were great. Oscar Isaac is really captivating as Llewyn. I found myself interested in whatever he was doing, not matter how simple, and that's extremely important in a film like this where the plot is so aimless. There are also performances by Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and even Adam Driver that are great (also that other guy from Girls appears which is kind of funny). I also really enjoyed the music. While it's not the kind of music I would listen to normally, it's really well done and great to listen to.<br/><br/>Overall I think this is a unique film that's worth a watch. It does a lot of subtle and interesting things that keep you interested throughout, and it's a movie that would benefit from a second watch."
"forlornnesssickness","9","0","2","14 June 2014"," Inside Llewyn Davis : Play it again, Llewyn
","It is winter in 1961, and every day is struggle for a young unknown folk singer Llewyn Davis(Oscar Isaac). He did make one album with his partner, but his album did not give him a breakthrough he had yearned for, and now he is performing alone because his partner, who never appears in the movie except in the photo on the album jacket, recently committed suicide for some reason.<br/><br/>He has no home, so he usually bounces around the homes of his friends or acquaintances. In the next morning after his latest performance at the Gaslight Cafe in Greenwich Village, we see him waking up at the nice, comfortable apartment belonging to a generous college professor he is acquainted with. There is no one in the apartment, and he is supposed to leave the place gently after having a breakfast and leaving a note expressing his small gratitude to the professor, but he finds himself stuck with the professor's pet cat. The door is already locked when he sees that the cat has gone after him, and, to make the matters worse, there is no one to keep the cat for a while in the apartment building.<br/><br/>While being its reluctant temporary keeper, he searches for another place to stay for tonight. He luckily gets it within a short time, but he is not welcomed much. His fellow folk singer Jim(Justin Timberlake) and another temporary guest Troy Nelson(Stark Sands), who is also building his own singing career while serving in US Army, do not mind about Llewyn and the cat staying with them, but Jim's partner/wife Jean(Carey Mulligan) is hostile to Llewyn for a very good reason; she is pregnant, and it may be Llewyn's child. Whatever happened between her and Llewyn in the past, their private conversation scene is bitter enough for us to see that Llewyn was not a good man to her, and Mulligan delivers her character's barbed lines with pungent precision: ""Everything you touch turns to sh*t, you're like King Midas's idiot brother.""<br/><br/>He tries to get the money for her abortion, and he also tries to get any good chance for his career, but the coincidences in his life seem to align mostly against himself. Besides losing the cat(and that is not the first time, by the way), he keeps finding himself against the wall, and he gets frustrated by that. His old, ineffectual agent is not very helpful, and his disastrous trip to Chicago does not change anything even though he did present his talent to a prominent Chicago music producer(played by F. Murray Abraham) in the end, and now he comes to wonder seriously about whether he should give up his singer career or not.<br/><br/>In their many comedy films, the directors/writers the Coen brothers frequently had a devious fun with throwing twists and turns at their unlucky heroes struggling within messy situations, but they sometimes showed care to their characters even when drawing sharp laughs from their plights, and the results were some of their best works including ""Fargo""(1996) and ""A Serious Man""(2009). In case of ""Inside Llewyn Davis"", they subtly balance their story between drama and comedy, and the humorous moments in the movie are mostly kept at low-key level. For example, when Llewyn visits his aging dad at a nursing home, we naturally come to expect something to come out when he plays a song for his father, but this scene feels so quiet and serious that it may take some time for you to realize its punch line at the end of the scene.<br/><br/>The screenplay, which is as intelligent and precise as we can expect from the Coen brothers, provides a fair share of offbeat moments which work well with the melancholic background in the film. One of the best moments comes from a part involved with Llewyn's trip to Chicago, and John Goodman, who plays a boisterous guy who happens to travel along with Llewyn and a beatnik poet played by Garrett Hedlund, steals the show with his character's obnoxious rudeness.<br/><br/>The music is a crucial part in the story, and the songs produced by T- Bone Burnett, who previously collaborated with the Coen Brothers in their another music movie ""O Brother, Where Art Thou?""(2000), are well- chosen for giving the feel of the era before Bob Dylan became popular. The lead actor Oscar Isaac, who unfortunately did not get Oscar- nominated for his dedicated performance, and his co-actors including Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake sing the songs for themselves in the movie, and they are good enough to make an enjoyable soundtrack to listen(""Please Mr. Kennedy"", an amusing novelty song performed by Issac, Timberlake, and Adam Driver, is the most fun of all). The period setting in the movie is impeccable, and the cinematographer Bruno Delbonnel, who deserves a recent Oscar nomination for his work here in this film, did a impressive job of creating the smoky mood of light and shadow for the performance scenes at the Gaslight Cafe, and the gray, unsaturated tone of his cinematography effectively accentuates the desolation and desperation inside the story."

","I have always appreciated the Cohen brothers even if I have not always enjoyed their films, I've often found them hard to sit through with the exception of 'The Big Lebowski' and 'No Country For Old Men'. When I first heard about Inside Llewyn Davis I was interested because I am a fan of the folk scene amongst other elements of the film as such as the time period and setting. <br/><br/>I sat in the cinema upon the films release with optimism but I was cautiously optimistic as I thought I would react to it in the same way I react to most of the Cohen brothers' films, masterfully created but hard to watch.<br/><br/>So what did I think of Inside Llewyn Davis? I loved it. Not only Is it my favourite film of 2013, but it is also now one of my all time favourite films. I saw it the day it came out, now, months later, I still cannot stop thinking about it. I've had the blu ray imported from the US because I can't wait for the May release here in the UK. <br/><br/>My favourite elements of the film are; the soundtrack, put together masterfully by producer 'T Bone', The acting, brilliantly carried by Oscar Isaac in one of his biggest roles yet with amazing supporting parts from Carey Mulligan, Justin Timberlake and John Goodman, the story, which I felt was beautifully simple whilst managing to be deeply harsh and real as it follows a week in the life of a failing folk musician in the 60s and finally the cinematography. The Cohen brothers had to use a cinematographer this time around as their usual was otherwise occupied with the latest James Bond flick, this both shows and delivers as we are greeted with the cold, blue, vintage-like tones that add to the bleak tale.<br/><br/>I honestly can't find any major flaws with the film, some criticisms that accompany the film are that it's extremely bland and uneventful with an underwhelming ending that ultimately goes nowhere, but I would disagree because the uneventful story is also a connotation for Llewyn Davis' life that appears to be inspired by folk singer 'Dave Von Ronk', I can't exactly explain the significance of the ending without ruining it and I feel like spoiling it even for those who don't mind having it spoilt will then loose something from the film that they need to discover for themselves to appreciate it. All I can say is that it is harsh yet grounded and actually quite sad. The film has a fairly short run time but I feel like it was the perfect length otherwise the story could have become repetitive or tedious. I think Inside Llewyn Davis was expertly constructed and it is the definition of art. I can't wait to revisit the film. I think it is an important film that all film buffs should watch. I can understand why some people may not get on with the film because they may find it too melancholy and tedious, but I feel it's a classic."

","Historically I have enjoyed the Coen Brothers comedies and have been underwhelmed by their dramas. I didn't know which one this was before I watched it, but I'd say it's either a fitfully amusing drama or a dour, not especially funny comedy. Whichever it is, I found it watchable, but not really engrossing.<br/><br/>I didn't hate the character as my girlfriend did (she found him repellent in every way and hated the movie). Sure, Llewyn is aimless and drifting, uncharismatic, a bit of a user, and prone to violent outbursts, but as someone who used to play in folk clubs I had some sympathy for his frustration. And really, most of the characters in the movie aren't likable, so in the film's world he's not really that bad.<br/><br/>This is a musical, as the movie's songs are generally sung all the way through. It's mainly traditional songs sung pretty well, but there's not much excitement to it and the songs often feel long. I also feel that, in order to emphasize the end, they insist on only pretty, serious singing, although there were rawrer singers at that time like Pete Seeger and Rambling Jack Elliot. It felt like the movie wanted to make an untrue point for reasons of its own.<br/><br/>My girlfriend almost decided to give up on this one, stuck with it because John Goodman was interesting in a fairly small part, and then felt it was too late to stop. I never particularly felt like turning it off, but I was never especially engrossed in the story. I wouldn't recommend it."

Oscar Issac is fantastic as Davis, the presentation looks gorgeous, the story is interesting and emotional, the music is great and you get the trademark unique humor of the Bros. as well. The entire film is like a folk album come to life and decided to look like the album art and play out like one of their songs would stereotypically go and that was the magic of it for me.<br/><br/>Granted, I'm probably not going to watch this one as much as I watch ""Fargo"" or ""The Big Lebowski"" but I will come back to this one and re-watch it numerous times.

","Very interesting movie, a must see, another question is if it is good or not and if it makes any sense.Inside Lewyn Davis is another great movie about a singer. The actor Oscar Isaac got ignored during the Oscars, just like Phoenix in Walk The Line. Not even a nomination for best actor for Oscar Isaac. Ironically playing a very talented, but unappreciated underdog musician, the movie also takes an underdog position for awards so Isaac becomes an underdog actor starring in a movie about underdog musician. Isn't that funny. Among very poor performances and blunt script in this Coen Brothers movie(I don't know who they are) Isaac shows acting talent and more amazing singing. I don't know if it is the bad acting or the Coens wanted to portrait everyone else as insensitive and bring an atmosphere of alienation to the whole movie, well they sure succeeded. Even John Goodman is horrifying to me in this movie, playing a repulsive character with no presence. I suppose it is intended for everyone else to be a-holes to Lewyn, so we can better appreciate the sorrow and despair of the protagonist, however this might have gone out of the scope of people who award Oscars and don't watch that many movies. Lewyn Davis succeeds not to look like a loser in my eyes, but rather a fighter and a proud man who struggles with life the best he can. If Isaac had received even a nomination for Oscars it might have diminished the credibility of his character."

Because both the main characters from these two movies are more alike. Theirs professional struggle and also chronicles relationship problems.<br/><br/>This, Coen brothers latest created lots of noise before hitting the screen. Like everyone I too expected what they gonna give to us. I enjoyed it. The folk songs were so good and it was not nominated for Oscar because most of them were not original. According to the filmmakers, especially the music section was inspired by 70s, but not the lyrics.<br/><br/>Beautiful cinematography, very eye catching colour palette. It was on the short list for Oscar, but lost to the magnum Opus 'Gravity'. I was rooting for any of these two in this category for Academy awards.<br/><br/>I think Carey Mulligan is used to it with a character like this, an anti-good roles or an irritable one. In a recent 'The Great Gatsby' as well she was in such role. But I like her, she's the one of a beauty that Hollywood imported from Britain.<br/><br/>The only trouble the movie gave me was the tease in many parts. It teased me with its scenes when I expected something it went opposite direction made me look like a fool. Yeah, it was good thinking by the Coen brothers as the script writers, but I felt a little let down when they carried away throughout. In the end the buzz they created did not end in what everyone could expect. I don't know it is good or bad, but the movie will win our hearts. <br/><br/>Believe it is not your regular movie, but looks like one, that is the trick made by the legendary brothers.

","I haven't been that impressed by the director duo with their takes on crime, except No Country For Old Men; that was epic. But this time around they give out such an enterprising story, I sat there relating it to myself.<br/><br/>As the story moves forward, we are given a perspective through the protagonist. Oscar Isaac has marvelously played the character and it is only because of him that we both feel sad & funny about his plight and his toil and his homelessness. His actions are so true to the level it never goes haywire because reality shines everywhere in the script: from the cat called Ulysses to his ex-girlfriend to his famous father. All elements are so finely tuned, I am in love with this film so much.<br/><br/>Next is the music; I might cry if it doesn't win an Oscar for the sound mixing. Such wonderful folk songs... they are in my local play-list now. Beautiful lyrics, production by T-bone and Isaac himself with the diction. And the songs are played in full, which doubles the enhancement.<br/><br/>The plot is maneuvered nicely etching a powerful screenplay, keeping us away from boredom. And humor at the right time when it is least expected was another fantastic thing about it. Inside Llewyn Davis is told in less than 2 hours and it captures the whole terrible week of the singer in a fabulous fashion; it talks about people, relationships, road to fame and most importantly, struggle. It throws light into how passion can sometimes fail to earn us a bread. But, this has more to it. Go ahead!<br/><br/>BOTTOM LINE: Highly recommended! This is the right film to catch with your sweetheart on a cold winter night. The songs will get you. 8.5/10."

The Coen's have done music in films very well before, for example, O Brother Where Art Thou? The landscape is bleak in a cold New York winter. Llewyn travels with a jazz musician played brilliantly by John Goodman to audition for someone. The story is a kind of bleak about a folk singer that doesn't really make it.But the Coen's are masters at telling an interesting story that gets to you.

","It's a very slow movie, and slowness reflects the lethargy of an anti-hero, the folk singer Llewyn Davis who wanders along the roads of a music-living Greenwich Village, where it is difficult to come out, although you are a talented artist and are in love with what you sing. Davis is very vulnerable, probably beyond hope in this sort of Odyssey, his voyage is a no home-direction voyage, with no Penelope waiting for his return, but if his sluggish attitude may annoy, it also inspires human compassion, in this case for a man who probably believes in art, but understands that art is not enough, and cannot cope with this matter of fact. The real tragedy lies in the incapability to connect to others, and first to himself, he is both self-centred and stuck on a motionless existence of his own making, you get angry with him and would like to slap him, but in the end, you cannot hate him.<br/><br/>Isaac plays a difficult role with the due intensity and the right sensitivity, mainly when inspiring contrasting feelings, mainly that feeling of wanting to give up which makes him a universal character. The rest of the cast, although playing minor roles, help design the mood of a charming and yet contradictory musical era. And the ginger cat Ulysses (a significant name, indeed) is awesome and the scenes with Davis wandering in the Greenwich village with him in his hands and his guitar in tow are the ones I liked most."

","There are two versions of Coen brothers (I'm not including the evil, shadowy version that inflicted The Ladykillers on us). Inside Llewyn Davis is not from the Coens of The Big Lebowski or Oh Brother, Where Art Thou? This is from the gloomy, shuffling, subtle Coens of The Man Who Wasn't There.<br/><br/>Know this from the outset: this isn't for flighty fans who want to sing along, laugh out loud and enjoy the romp. This is a slow, inward-looking film that gently delights and brings smiles that occasionally bubble into light chuckles. I loved it.<br/><br/>Taking a week out of the life of a young, troubled and struggling folk singer from Greewhich Village, Llewyn Davis (Oscar Isaac), Inside Llewyn Davis follows him as he trudges from sofa to sofa in a New York winter as bitter as himself, searching for validation and a breakthrough, incapable of seeing that the greatest obstacle in the way of success is himself.<br/><br/>Of the regular Coen company only John Goodman is present, as irascible jazz musician Roland Turner, filling the back seat and armed with a cane, but as we have come to expect from Joel & Ethan's work, the screen is littered with memorable characters that aren't so much carved as cut from the script with pinking shears, jagged edges catching on those around them.<br/><br/>Always beautifully written, their characters are brought to life by an invariably eclectic bunch, from New York outsiders to Hollywood stars. Lead from the front by Oscar Isaac, sprinkled through this 104 minute joy are the likes of Justin Timberlake, F. Murray Abraham and Carey Mulligan, as the fantastically dour, dowdy and razor-tongued Jean. When she sneers at Llewin, ""Everything you touch turns to s***, you're like King Midas' idiot brother"" we laugh and shrivel simultaneously. Hers is a wonderfully nuanced performance of a character that is sharp of tongue and blunt in attitude. With evenings spent in her company, is it any wonder that Llewin's self-esteem packed up and went south long ago?<br/><br/>Isaac, in a rare but welcome lead role, marries the social ineptitude of Llewyn with the natural talent and bloody-mindedness that attracts friends and supporters before pummeling their emotions. We cringe, not from Issac's performance, but from each verbal bludgeoning Llewyn dishes out in his tiny life cycle. It is like watching a blinkered hamster lumbering around a barbed wire wheel when there is a vast stretch of calm and freedom a couple of steps to the left.<br/><br/>Shot with muted hues that peak at 'dim' and trough at 'dull', Inside Llewyn Davis is a delightful comedy of folk music and cats with undertones of Greek mythology that takes its time, wanders at its own pace and stings with killer dialogue that the Coens have mastered.<br/><br/>Where else would you hear a character screech ""Where's his scrotum?""<br/><br/>For more reviews from The Squiss, subscribe to my blog and like the Facebook page."

With Inside Llewyn Davis they have added another significant film to their repertoire. This is the story of a week in the life of one Llewyn Davis, a folk singer without a clear plan of where he is going. Once part of a duo, he is trying to make it in Greenwich village after the suicide of his singing partner. Seemingly without friends, he moves from apartment to apartment and sofa to sofa as he gradually antagonises all those prepared to take him in. In true Coen Brothers style, this is a gritty dark view of someone in a situation he seems unable or even unwilling to pull himself out of. A lot is said without uttering any words and I found myself alternating between feeling sorry for the guy and wanting to shake him hard and tell him to pull his socks up.

","My partner and I, on leaving the cinema, were thinking the same thing: There are few certainties in life but you can guarantee that a Coen brothers film is not going to be a bad one. Inside Llewyn Davis is a good film. Its not the greatest Coen brothers film and might not even make the top 5 but its still a good film. The cinematography is great, the casting is great, the atmosphere is great, the usual touches of dark humor are there, the music is great. Most of the elements that make the Coen brothers the outstanding film makers of the last 25 years are there. In my opinion the only thing that is in any way weak is the plot. It just doesn't really engage you in the same way that Fargo or No country for old men does. Its a story about a talented musician who doesn't have what it takes to make money doing what he does. The film can be interpreted in many ways but for me the key point was when he was being watched by a theater manager who clearly loved what he was doing but had to tell him that he couldn't see money. Artists have to try and most don't succeed and along that journey they have to suffer poverty and the disappointment of nearest and dearest. Its nigh on impossible to hold down a job and make it as an artist. Its a big gamble and for me the film is about someone who is losing the gamble."

","At first, I strongly identified with Llewyn Davis' struggles — I think you'd be hard pressed to find a musician who doesn't — but by the film's end, I realize not only how many of those struggles are self-inflicted, I feel as if Llewyn is going to cycle through them many more times before things pick up or bottom out. Musically, Llewyn comes across as scrappy and soulful. He's just the person I'd want singing those sad, world-weary folk songs, at least compared to the cleaner- cut performers he meets throughout the film. And yet, that soul seems to come from tragedies (the suicide of his one-time musical partner) and anxieties (the relationships with family and former lovers) he's too stubborn or poor of spirit to work through properly. He keeps floating by thanks to some enablers. Couches are continually offered for him to sleep on, even after Llewyn insults their owners. A club owner still books him as a performer, even after he is forcibly removed from the club for heckling other performers. It's hard realizing you're in a vicious cycle while you're still inside of it, trying to keep your head above water. It's even harder when connecting with people is as difficult as it is for Llewyn. I feel like the Coen brothers understand that, take it seriously, and yet, from that, created something that made me laugh and engrossed me. Highly recommended."

He's stuck in a dead-end situation: trying to make a living as a folk singer in the over-crowded Greenwich Village scene of 1961. He has some serious talent, but he also fails to connect with his audience on a personal level, a sentiment pointed out to him throughout the movie. He is surrounded by others who seem to be much better human beings and perfectly capable performers, but Llewyn consistently dismisses them all as beneath him. Until he needs to crash on their respective couches. <br/><br/>You see, Llewyn is basically homeless. And penniless. There are no royalties coming in from his last record, recorded as part of a folk duo. His partner committed suicide, and now Llewyn is stuck pushing a solo record to no avail. He has recently had sex with best friend Jim's (Justin Timberlake) girlfriend Jean (an equally unpleasant Carey Mulligan), and the baby she carries may or may not belong to Llewyn. They casually trade insults at each other while nonchalantly discussing the abortion they both decide she must undergo.<br/><br/>Once Llewyn runs out of open couches, he hits the road to Chicago, where he hopes to land a gig at a prominent club. He is joined by arrogant and condescending jazz man Roland Turner (John Goodman) and his quiet drifter of a valet, Johnny Five (Garrett Hedlund). This sequence is where Inside Llewyn Davis, which starts strong against all odds, slows to a grinding and infuriating stand-still. The 20-25 minutes depicted of the mostly-silent car ride to Chicago serves little purpose for the overall story. Neither Turner nor Johnny Five matter in the long run, and they certainly don't teach us any more about our main character than we already know.<br/><br/>Yet, we continue on with Llewyn. He is consistently kicked around by life, and he consistently kicks around everyone who tries to help him out. He rejects an offer to join a trio, presumably because he is either too hurt by his partner's suicide or simply too headstrong to share the spotlight, or both. He cares more about finding a runaway cat that he inadvertently let slip out than he does consoling the woman who may be bearing his child. And that pretty much sums up Inside Llewyn Davis. There is no arc to the story; indeed, the Coen brothers choose to tell a circular narrative, where one of the final scenes chronologically is presented at the front of the picture. By the time we come full circle, it is hard to care too much for Llewyn's fate.<br/><br/>Yet even here, the brothers Coen refuse to conform to such silly things as closure or resolution. If you've seen the final minutes of their Oscar-winner No Country for Old Men you'll have a feel for the type of ending they employ here. Like No Country, the Coens try to make Llewyn's week-long odyssey an existential search of some sort. Unlike No Country, there are no characters that anchor us in anything real or emotional. Inside Llewyn Davis is as cold and distant as the wintry drive from New York to Chicago, and ultimately one of the biggest letdowns of the awards season."

","Viewers of INSIDE LLEWYN DAVIS may well come out of the theater asking themselves, ""What's your story, Llewyn?"" WHO was the Mystery Man administering your beat-down in a Greenwich Village alley at this tale's opening and closing, and WHY are you so hell-bent on self destruction? Wikipedia says ""What's the frequency, Kenneth?"" is New York City slang for ""a confused and clueless person,"" like the character Llewyn Davis. It originally referred to a mugging in which CBS newsman Dan Rather was clobbered by a thug on Park Avenue Oct. 4, 1986. Rather reported the unknown assailant queried him, ""Kenneth, what is the frequency?"" This was such a bizarrely crazy crime yarn that any solid American would have kept the story to themselves, rather than snitching to the police. Since Rather's mugger was proved to be convicted murderer William Tager in 1997, it's no surprise that Tager's words had to be polished somewhat into ""What's the Frequency, Kenneth?"" when the rock band R.E.M. immortalized Rather's funk in their 1994 song of that name. Joel and Ethan Coen have released a number of classic films, such as BLOOD SIMPLE, but they usually have some sort of a story. Folks songs, no matter how quaint, are not enough to tie together a collection of mostly unlikeable characters without providing a central story to give direction or provide a ""plot."" So, like the tawny cat(s) of this flick, I ask, ""What's the frequency, Joel and Ethan?"""

","""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is the kind of movie that is scarcely produced anymore. It's a rare film which resonates with the reality of everyday struggle to ""make it"" in life, minus the typical heroism. It avoids ""Hollywoodization"" of its characters and plots, which may explain the Oscar snub, and the storytelling is great (try to relate the beginning, the middle and the end of the film).<br/><br/>Llweyn Davis is a folk singer/musician who struggle to meet ends. His solo album isn't selling and he has to 'couch surfing' at people's houses. Although his life is reproved by others, he refused to settle for ""merely existing"". He goes to great lengths to pursue his passion but finds the dream increasingly further away. He is stuck in a circle. <br/><br/>Oscar Isaac superbly embodies his character, and the soundtrack is amazing. One more thing I find interesting is that the characters (and the conversations they had) represent the society in many aspects. Overall, if you are the kind that appreciate a good movie that is not just packed with blockbuster action, this one is a treat."
"matthewssilverhammer","10","0","1","20 January 2014"," Isaac is phenomenal as the titular character trying to find a balance between art, business, life and relationship in this instant Coen classic.
","The Coens are arguably the greatest American filmmakers going today, and ""Inside Llewyn Davis"" is no exception to this theory. However, we can't judge ILD like their other films, or like many other films period. Instead, it begs to be critiqued like a great folk song: simple yet elegant, layered and lyrical, stark yet brightly colorful, familiar yet utterly new, funny but ultimately somber. This is musical cinema at its most pure, placing us firmly within the main characters shoes, forcing us to ask, ""Who are these people on stages that we idolize?"" ILD follows folk-singer Llewyn as he struggles to find a balance between life, relationship, business, and art. But unlike many struggling artist films, we aren't made to simply feel the plight of this guy's fight for notoriety and mourn his ambiguity. Instead Llewyn, phenomenally played by Isaacs, is an extremely abrasive albeit immensely talented character. His life is an endless cycle of minor highs and crushing lows. So despite the many colorful and self-centered characters we meet, played by a whose-who of ""Hey! It's that guy!""'s, Llewyn has only himself to blame. The original soundtrack, written by T-Bone Burnett and performed by the actors, is the best I have heard since ""Once"". They have nailed what it feels like to be a musician. The songs alone are enough of a reason to recommend, if it weren't also for the hilarious script, strong performances and stronger themes. ILD will stay stuck in your head like a catchy, beautiful song long after you leave the theater."

Not necessarily a bad thing, but I'd like to have known what transpired before Llewyn goes 'Au revoir' - know what I'm saying?<br/><br/>The movie itself is narrated like a saga (the name of the cat holds a clue to one of the Coen bros' references), and has the Coen bros. style all over, albeit subtle. Carey Mulligan is fanta-fabulous in 3 of her scenes, and Oscar Isaac IS Llewyn. He croons with the best of them, and acts his socks off, and being snubbed at the awards must have been immensely painful.

","2013 Movie Review - Inside Llewyn Davis #moviereviews #movies2013 #oscars2014 #coenbrothers New Coen brothers' film is about a poor Folk musician in New city in 60's. Right out of the bat, I find this a drama and comedy film (aka dramedy), so if the sense of humor of Coen brothers don't appeal to you, then this isn't enjoyable for you – this was unexpected to me to be that funny. I'm personally not a fan of Folk music but the songs are well composed and matched to the tone of the film – I didn't mind any of them, not that I would listen to them again, but I certainly wouldn't mind them if I was watching the movie again. The performances are great and likable here: Oscar Isaac, plays this leading role perfectly, an unlucky, poor, stubborn, and even rude and cocky character; Carey Mulligan is just one of my favorite actresses, and I enjoyed her performance here as well; Justin Timberlake, John Goodman, Adam Driver, and Garrett Hedllund are other familiar faces who play small roles and again, they do a solid job, maybe even underused, but my favorite performance goes to the Cat – I liked that damn cat so much, I couldn't lay off my eyes from it. This bring me to the next point, the cinematography of this film is amazing, especially working with the cat, it must have been difficult but they manage to grab some amazing and gratifying images.<br/><br/>In conclusion, even though for me the movie got dragging at some points due to the amount of the folk songs, but somehow I was invested in the main character and his struggles and also the humor in the tone, so I don't know if this is a movie for everyone, especially that there's not really a clear ending, it's an open interpretation, which Coen brothers often do for their films. Anyway, I give it 8/10."

","I will never understand the Academy Awards. Even if I live to be 100 years old and study their choices every day I will never ever in my life understand the Oscars. I just don't get what their process is. Who are these people and how do they choose? I am pretty much convinced at this point that their number one interest as far as choosing nominees in the big categories (picture, director, actor, actress, writing) is that it should be a movie that grossed a lot of money since the Oscars really are about Hollywood advertising themselves to the masses. Great films get snubbed every year. Oscar turned in a great performance in this movie and it should easily have been nominated for writing, directing and or picture, but it was overlooked. This isn't the best film every but it's definitely better than some of the movies they did choose. The other problem is they give nods to people who they snubbed previously and realize they shouldn't have (i.e. Martin Scorcese for his movie Wolf, Leo Dicaprio for acting since he has never won, even though Wolf isn't nearly as good a movie as this). Oh well maybe next year!"
"laojim","Null","0","2","16 January 2014"," Creepy rip off of a fine musician.
","OK, this is, but is not, all about Dave VanRonk, an excellent and entirely distinctive musician. Of course it isn't about him at all it's a fiction, which was why Leewyn's album cover is a direct imitation of one of Dave VanRonk's album covers, except that Dave's, if memory serves, is green and black while Llewyn's is red, otherwise it's the same pose. I can only guess who some of the other characters are, or are not, except for the obvious Clancy Brothers imitation and a couple of others.<br/><br/>The problem is that the whole thing seems, in the first place, entirely pointless while, at the same time, in the second place, leaving you with an unpleasant feeling of going through a dead man's private property. Had there been any learning or changing of the characters in the course of the story, as my seventh grade teacher taught me there should be, all this raking through the late Mr. VanRonk's life (except of course we are told that it isn't really his life) might have made some sort of sense. As it is there is nothing to this story worth watching. Nobody wins and nobody is saved.<br/><br/>Go buy a Dave VanRonk album instead. I suggest for starters, Inside Dave VanRonk."

","Inside Llewyn Davis (English): This Classic film (in my opinion) which won the Grand Prix Award at the Cannes Film festival 2013 is indeed one of the best films coming from the Coen Brothers, based on the struggle of a young singer who overcomes obstacles and makes his way as a popular American Folk singer. The film is actually a pure art house outing where the music score by Todd Kasow and various is based on the music played within the film and is indeed great. Then the production designing by Jess Gonchor and team brings out the best of the '60's in the film, the cinematography by Bruno Delbonnel is worth cherishing as he paints every frame beautifully, then comes the great characters especially played by Oscar Issac who delivers excellence on screen, then Justin Timberlake, Carrey Mulligan, Ethan Phillips and others at their usual best. Overall, with an initial slow pace and then picking up the pace within its progress, the narration by the Coen Brothers makes you just lost in its musical fold, making it worth a watch for Cinema Lovers. My rating would be: 4.5/5.﻿"

","This is an amazing funny slice of life story of a struggling artist navigating the music scene of 1961 New York. <br/><br/>Llewelyn appears to have fallen into an existential funk following the suicide of his singing partner who jumped off the George Washington bridge. A new found pal points out who jumps off the George Washington bridge? Because of course if you want to commit suicide properly, you have to jump off the Brooklyn bridge! This dry humour was a real feature of this movie- it just fit with the quirky movement of the film. The priceless look of realization when Llewelyn gazes at a movie poster for the 1960s flick ""The incredible Journey"" (about a group of pets that journey across the Canadian Wilderness to go back home). Was funny on so many levels!<br/><br/>The movie unfolds like a folk music song, with Llewelyn's disappointments, search for some kind of meaning in life and a somewhat transient / bohemian existence couch surfing with a variety of people.<br/><br/>The subtle humour of the props of that 1960s era, the staple corduroy jacket, the smoky music agents office with the secretary pounding out on smith corona typewriters, the corn cob characters performing folksy music at the Gaslight bar provides the backdrop for this slice of New York 1960s Greenwich Village music scene. It's great when a young Bob Dylan gets on stage at the end of the movie!<br/><br/>The soundtrack of the movie is beautiful and unique and I can't get the ""Queen Jane"" song out of my head!

"jadepietro","10","0","3","11 January 2014"," A Song for the Asking
","This film is highly recommended.<br/><br/>Written, directed, and edited by the Brothers Coen, Inside Llewyn Davis is an oddball comedy about a self-centered but talented folk singer in the 1960's Greenwich Village. The film lingers over the absurdities of life as its abrasive and unlikable anti-hero tries to find any trace of success in the dark smoke-filled nightclubs that made the New York Village scene such a viable place back then. The film contains many quiet and poetic moments, filled with insightful observations about its characters and that more innocent era.<br/><br/>Rumor has it that an artist must suffer for his art. Inside Llewyn Davis embellishes that myth as we moviegoers spend one fateful week with this struggling songwriter and his chance encounters with various people in the music biz. It is Llewyn's winter of discontent. He's out of money and out of patience. Fame continues to elude him but not life's hardships. His musical partner has committed suicide. Llewyn's first solo album is doing poorly in sales and he just may have impregnated his best friend's wife. Llewyn would rather commit to a short song on center stage than care for anybody or anything. Dealing with life's harsh realities are too taxing, even as he is forced to become an unofficial guardian of sorts for a friend's cat, Ulysses. Soon both man and cat are off on their individual odyssey for the meaning of life, but only one will find it.<br/><br/>In their nuanced film, Joel and Ethan Coen have added another assortment of quirky characters to their on-going array of bizarre behavior, although this time the central character is more disagreeable than needed. Oscar Isaac plays Llewyn and he gives a solid performance, capturing the talent and the bad luck that befalls his character with a sneer and a sad bitter-more-than-sweet song for the asking. With a terrific film score assembled by T. Bone Burnett and showcasing many of the folk tunes from that era (500 Miles, Fare Thee Well, The Last Thing on My Mind), the film is high on atmosphere and strong on character development. Plot-wise, there's not much to tell, except that the film shows a series of missed opportunities and misadventures for Llewyn, most of which are lessons not learned. Inside Llewyn Davis is more character study and a nostalgic reminder of another time long gone than the traditional action-driven entertainment one would suspect from these filmmakers.<br/><br/>Contributing to the film's richness are fine supporting performances by Carey Mulligan and Justin Timberlake as Jean and Jim, a more popular husband and wife folk duo, Stark Sands as Troy, an up-and coming idealistic song-smith, and a drug-addled John Goodman as Roland Turner, a jazz musician. ￼ This is one of the year's best crafted film. The period details are brilliantly evoked by the moody photography of Bruno Delbonnel, the purposely dated costumes of Mary Zophres, and the essential spot-on production design by Jess Gonchor. There is an genuine authenticity to the film due to their stellar contributions which convincingly portray the American folk scene of 1961.<br/><br/>The title character of Inside Llewyn Davis is purposely remote and distant. It's hard getting inside this tortured soul, as he never connects with anyone. Joel and Ethan Coen have created a deeply captivating film that keeps the moviegoer on the outside looking in, observing the characters and appreciating their conversations. We become voyeurs lost in the milieu of the sixties folk scene, always questioning Llewyn's state of mind, well aware that the times are a- changin' around him. Inside Llewyn Davis is wonderful escapist fare and one of the best films of the year.

","I really enjoyed this film, it was carefully crafted into a precise and persistent story of a man who thought he was at rock bottom to only discover that it could only get worse. The writing of this film was probably the most impressive feats next to the acting by Oscar Isaac and the aesthetic created throughout the film. This film was also something that I have not seen in quite some time, in which the arc of the story was completely upside down. The rising action became the falling action, obstacles were distractions, and the climax was the low point for the character. It was fresh, new, and provoked thought. The one criticism I had was how the beginning and ending were portrayed. It was necessary to show the ending at the beginning, to give insight into Llewyn's character. Although the way it was shown made for a confusing and rushed ending which left the audience a few scenes back. This and a few scenes throughout could have been cut down a bit as the film began to feel dragged out. Overall, another fantastic film from the Coen Brothers."

","I would like to share an experience I had while watching this film. When Llewyn goes to Chicago to audition for Bud Grossman he sings a song I'd not heard before. In that stark setting, playing to just one person he breaks our hearts. And as the song was sung in our big theatre, time stood still. It is an experience I will cherish as a moment of brilliant cinema. I can always see the film and that scene again but it won't be like the first time on a cold winter night in a dark room full of silent strangers. I've been a fan since Blood Simple but have really enjoyed their masterpieces Fargo and Barton Fink. When you are in the room watching a Coen brother's film you are transported to an alternate reality. It is a place of mystery with a touch of foreboding deliciously written for just us the audience.
