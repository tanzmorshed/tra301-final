"Hey_Sweden","7","13","14","14 March 2018"," Obviously a very divisive film.
","Veteran filmmaker Sam Raimi made his much-ballyhooed return to the horror genre with this crazed picture, after years of working on mainstream titles such as ""A Simple Plan"", ""For Love of the Game"", and the first three ""Spider-Man"" feature films. Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, loan officer at a bank. She covets a possible promotion a little too much, and her boss (David Paymer) likes people who are able to make tough decisions. Therefore, she denies an extension to the loan to elderly Gypsy Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver). This, of course, is a fatal mistake. The old lady becomes livid and curses Christine. Now a demon dubbed the Lamia will be on its way to drag Christine to Hell in three days time. Christine, who suffers one garish episode after another, works every angle she can think of to avoid the inevitable.<br/><br/>Many reviews here at IMDb tend to go to one extreme or the other: people either love it or loathe it. There aren't that many middle-of-the-road assessments. That said, this viewer did have some genuine fun with this over the top story and film, although it's not without its flaws. Raimi goes for ""GOTCHA!"" jump scares a little too often, there's an onslaught of utterly cheesy digital effects, and there are moments that are much more laughable than shocking. It is commendable that Raimi and his cast & crew give the proceedings a lot of energy, and fans of the first two ""Evil Dead"" features may take *some* delight in the way that Raimi goes for the gross-out so often. He never seems to run out of things to stick in Lohmans' mouth. One unqualified highlight is the grandiose music score by Christopher Young, giving the whole thing an operatic feel.<br/><br/>All of this would be rather meaningless if the lead character weren't at least somewhat sympathetic, and Lohman makes Christine an appealing character. Justin Long is similarly engaging as her loving, faithful boyfriend, and the top supporting cast also showcases talents such as Raver (who's memorably creepy and disgusting), Dileep Rao (as a fortune teller), Adriana Barraza (as a medium who'd encountered the Lamia 40 years ago), the always solid Paymer, and Chelcie Ross as Longs' father. Raimis' actor brother Ted can be heard briefly as a doctor making a house call; Octavia Spencer has a small role as a bank employee.<br/><br/>This comes complete with a ""twist"" near the end that isn't too hard to predict.<br/><br/>Overall, decent entertainment. It may be silly at times, but at least it isn't boring.<br/><br/>Seven out of 10."
"kosmasp","9","84","119","28 June 2010"," Forget the rating
","And by rating I mean the ""PG-13"" one. Seems like you can get away with murder these days with a PG-13 rating ... Seriously though: While this was one detail that got discussed quite a bit, even before the movie came out, many ""fearing"" (no pun intended) that Raimi had lost his touch and had gone ""soft"" on them.<br/><br/>Fear no more (or actually do so, while watching the movie), because he hasn't. This movie is showcase of what Raimi is capable of. Sure you might not like the movie for various reasons, but Raimi does know how to build tension (and torture his protagonists apparently ... ask Bruce ""Ash"" Campbell and now the lovely A. Lohman) ... and serve as the good stuff. Disturbing images and a nice score, neatly edited and shot. One of the best Horror movies of 2009.<br/><br/>Sometimes it didn't get the recognition it deserved, sometimes it did (it just won another prize the other day). Of course there are flaws. Mr Jeepers Creepers (Justin Long) himself, reduced to a bystander for example. But in the end, it delivers fully on what it promises ..."
"krenwregget","8","58","84","4 September 2014"," Finally.....
","It took Sam Raimi to bring fun back to the horror genre, and I'm so glad he did. In a sea of 'torture porn' and 'found footage' garbage, this is a rare jewel that makes you realize what you've been missing as a horror fan.<br/><br/>If you're into Sam's other works, you will greatly enjoy this film as it hits all the right notes and contains many of his trademark moments and nods to his early films. It's light on the blood and guts compared to the Evil Dead trilogy, but I didn't miss it all that much because I was having too much fun with everything else.<br/><br/>If you don't get black comedy, perhaps this film will confuse or disappoint you or come off as 'cheesy', but this is classic Raimi style and I love it. It's good to see many practical effects back in action and his camera work is as great as ever.<br/><br/>I like horror films to be fun and this certainly fits the bill."
"indyj1","9","232","407","30 May 2009"," Intense and Funny - Classic Sam Raimi
","The early trailers for Drag Me to Hell dubbed it as (sic) ""the return to classic horror"", and for once at least, they are correct.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi manages to incorporate genuine thrills and terror using the old-fashioned format of surprise, misdirection and suggestion. As a frequent viewer of horror films, little surprises me, but in this film I was caught off-guard several times while watching it.<br/><br/>While the majority of the movie is kept on a serious and foreboding level, much like the original ""Evil Dead"", Raimi can't help but throw in elements of the absurd and slapstick during some of the more horrific scenes, thus reducing the tension and echoing the latter 2/3 of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy.<br/><br/>WHile I have nothing against the modern trend of horror movies to provide shocks merely in the form of how much blood and gore they spill, this flick was wonderfully refreshing. It's a must-see, not just for Raimi fans, but for anyone who loves a good scary story and a great movie in general."
"ajaj118","3","190","336","30 May 2009"," loud, predictable, not scary
","Seeing the trailer to this movie I expected to go in and have a few scenes that were ones that made you jump. But I also expected the movie to have something scary in it that made you think when you left the theater.<br/><br/>If you are looking for cheap thrills, LOUD music, and stuff jumping out at you constantly then this is your movie. I found this movie to be extremely predictable, especially the ending.<br/><br/>The séance scene was laughable. The guy hanging in the air ""dancing the jig"" was one of the dumbest I have seen in a LONG time. And the ""cartoonish"" talking goat was a joke. The SFX in this movie were worse than a Saturday night sci-fi channel B-movie. It was a serious WASTE of money. We had a free ticket, and I feel even that was wasted on this movie.<br/><br/>giving this movie a 3 out of 10 is even being generous."
"Stay_away_from_the_Metropol","9","294","532","29 May 2009"," A much needed revival for the horror genre.
","Drag Me To Hell is exactly what it should have been. It effortlessly takes a dump on 90% of the rest of the horror movies this decade has offered us. <br/><br/>In 2009, we are flooded with brainless remakes and Saw rip-offs, which was never a great series in the first place. Only Sam Raimi (the king of horror in my opinion) has the power to bring a completely original horror movie back to the big screen in this day and age and capitalize with it. <br/><br/>It was one of the most intense movie-going experiences I've had in some time and I see it as a wild ride that no one should miss out on. It is guaranteed that you will be either jumping or cringing in your seat half the time, unless you are one of those people lacking heavily in the department of sensitivity and/or general thought processing. <br/><br/>The movie is entertainment and horror fun in it's purest form. <br/><br/>A lot of people complain about CGI, and in a lot of cases I agree, but in Drag Me To Hell, they were never trying to hard with it - it was always in good fun and in a movie paced like this, with it's Sarcasti-Horror, it is certainly fitting.<br/><br/>It is, without question, a new horror classic - thanks to it's basic yet innovative plot, likable blondie, loads of bodily fluids, and an ending you will not forget. <br/><br/>Let's hope Hollywood takes some hints and allows studios to start making original horror movies again.<br/><br/>Thank you Sam Raimi. Loved it."
"thoward1223","1","320","581","31 May 2009"," Impossibly awful
","I just felt compelled to post this because somehow... and I can't even begin to understand how... people and even professional critics like this movie. I don't get it. I loved Evil Dead and I still don't get it, because this wasn't campy -- it was just bad. Seemed thrown together very quickly, with a few scenes stripped whole from Evil Dead 2 and some of the worst writing ever... It just didn't feel like camp. It felt like dreck. And the ending was telegraphed so early in the film that the last 30 minutes were almost physically painful to watch. And yet... the Washington Post said the ending was a shocker.<br/><br/>If this wasn't a Sam Raimi film, no one would even have suggested it was supposed to be funny. They would have just figured that it sucked. Maybe that's his joke on everyone, after all."
"hey_treacle","8","287","522","28 May 2009"," Sam Raimi has made his 'Jaws'.
","Drag me to Hell is, really, a throwback in so many ways to the fun of The Evil Dead 2. The camera angles, the excellent score - it all recalls how Raimi played with us in his earlier trilogy. What has changed however, is the sense of pace. We know its coming and Raimi employs all his skills to draw out the tension. The thrills are all there in place, I jumped like there was an electric buzzer under my seat. Perhaps a little too much CGI is indulged in but its easy to forgive in a film as wicked and blackly comic as this. I genuinely found the film disturbing for a 15 as well, again I think this is a mark of tension that Raimi creates with the score and camera work throughout the film. So incredibly refreshing to see a horror film with out the hallmarks of the recent saw franchise. Special mention for the ending, which has conviction and guts and was the proverbial cherry on top of the cake. throughly entertaining."
"Simon_Says_Movies","7","107","186","7 July 2009"," A liberation from the hell of mainstream horror
","After surrendering to the temptation that was Drag Me to Hell, I jokingly announced to a friend that it was 1/3 horror, 1/3 gross, 1/3 funny and 100% fun! Yet as wholly cheesy as that proclamation is, it is no less true. Ultimate B movie director Sami Rami's first horror film in years, having dedicated himself to the Spiderman franchise, succeeds in putting almost all recent horror films to shame. Drag Me to Hell proves that an R rating is not needed for shock scares, nor does a PG-13 rating mean that the film must feel stunted and incomplete, only that it takes a dedicated and competent director to pull all the elements together.<br/><br/>I recently called 2009 the-year-of-the-almost-good-horror-movie, with films like Friday the 13th, The Haunting in Connecticut, My Bloody Valentine, The Last House on the Left et al, simply not measuring up. While I am still hesitant to drop that moniker, the thrills Drag me to Hell brings to the horror genre certainly improves the spread. Aside from the tantalizing premise itself, Rami masterfully constructs atmosphere and amazes even further with a rousing and terrifying score and an absolutely chilling use of sound. Many tense sequences drift between an eerie quiet and a cacophony of anguish born from everyday objects and occurrences such as pots, the wind and garden gates and this is the very best part of the film, even if some other elements don't measure up as aptly.<br/><br/>As a alluded to, aside from Rami's fan base the real reason you would be drawn to this film is the premise; and hell dragging there is. The unsuspecting victim is a young loan officer named Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) who in order to secure a spot in the managers chair denies an elderly lady a third extension on her mortgage. But her timing could not be worse, as the gypsy mystic curses her to burn in hell for her shameful display. Christine now has only three days to rid herself of the terrible curse, garnering the aid of a psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) and her boyfriend (Justin Long) while trying to ward off the tormenting demon on her remaining days. Lohman is very good in this, creating a character of equal parts spunk and sweetness. Long seems tailor made for a Rami film, as his ability to drift between comedy and drama is a huge asset and is excellent as a result.<br/><br/>The only real determent I found in this film was the ending, which I will not spoil. It was actually a rather odd feeling that came over me when the credits rolled as usually a sub-par ending leaves me either infuriated or disgusted. Drag me to Hell's ending left me feeling mostly indifferent and numb to the events of the entire film by which it was preceded. Many will disagree with me and I am glad, as I thoroughly enjoyed the film and wish the ending had satisfied me accordingly. But the good certainly outweighs and bad and this schlocky gross and funny horror flick is very re-watchable, and above all unique. If Rami can still turn out quality B movie thrills after all these years, perhaps there is hope for liberation from the true hell; which is the Hollywood horror scene of today.<br/><br/>Read all my reviews at simonsaysmovies.blogspot.com"
"Sandcooler","8","28","43","27 November 2011"," Sinister as only Sam Raimi can be
","Personally I thought movies like the ""Spiderman""-trilogy, ""A Simple Plan"" and ""For Love Of The Game"" were excellent, but they all shared a common flaw: they made Sam Raimi look like a mentally balanced person. ""Drag Me To Hell"" on the other hand wants none of that, it caters to the ""Evil Dead""-crowd and does so very well. There isn't much of a story, but that's pretty much the point. Raimi has always stated he wants his horror flicks to be non-stop fun, and that's exactly what this is. It's a pretty stream of consciousness sort of thing, the feeble plot about Alison ""Big Fish"" Lohman getting cursed is just an excuse to come up with as much demented stuff as humanly possible. Put some maggots in a pie and then somehow make it bleed, why not huh? Anything goes here, that keeps things interesting throughout. You never know what's going to happen next, which is pretty damn scary. It's also a plus that eventually the movie works up to one of the the greatest climactic scenes I've ever seen in a horror movie, now that's what I call a finale. Overall this is a great movie that won't let anybody down."
"horsecoach4hire","1","164","300","2 June 2009"," This is no master piece. So bad....
","I'm still trying to find out why everyone thinks this film is wonderful.<br/><br/>First off, we have no storyline. We don't know if this film is funny or scary, the acting is at best 10th grade (and I'm a huge fan of Alison Lohman) I think everyone is forgetting about the fact that there needs to be a strong storyline (it doesn't have this. It has an idea, a concept, but never is fully developed, unless you think the old fashion, standard cop-outs work), good acting and most importantly, characters that you care about.<br/><br/>The characters make no sense. The girl can kill her cat, but not give away the object to foist this horrible thing onto? Where's the logic in this? If she is so focused on herself to kill her cat, when she's stating she's a humanitarian, then she should have no trouble passing along the button to some miserable slime. So, when did she develop morals? Secondly, plot??? Story?? Hello??? Evil Dead had a strong storyline. This does not. in fact, this movie seems to have had an idea, and was made off an idea, and did a typical, Hollywood cop-out ending instead of thinking of a valid way to make this film wrap up in an intelligent way.<br/><br/>Don't waste your money. Go see Knowing. At least the story in that film is strong, original and to me, unique."
"PoisonKeyblade","10","302","583","21 May 2009"," Sam Raimi's Return to ""True Horror"" is a Triumph
","From the intense opening scene to the stellar and shocking finale, Sam Raimi has officially returned to the horror genre with vigor and spark in the year's best horror film so far. Starring Alison Lohman in the leading role (Ellen Page was originally cast as the lead but dropped out of the project early in production), Drag Me to Hell feels like much more than your average, predictable horror popcorn flick. It's filled with plenty of twists and turns and, like any good ride, a satisfying conclusion. And the PG-13 rating? Forget about it! You hardly notice that little factor because of how immersed you become in the story. Also starring are Justin Long, David Paymer, and Lorna Raver.<br/><br/>Christine (Lohman), a loan officer at a bank with a lovely boyfriend (Long), is being considered for a promotion. Jumping at the opportunity, she comes across an old gypsy woman (Raver) who requests a third extension on her house. Her boss (Paymer) tells her it's a tough decision, and its her call, so she refuses the woman's payment. Absolutely infuriated, the woman stalks Christine after work and bestows her with a supernatural curse, one which she has only three days to overcome before the spirits drag her to hell.<br/><br/>Lucky enough to have won tickets to a pre-screening of the film, I had heard nothing but great things about it. I was hoping for the best, but I wasn't sure how the comedy and horror would mix together. Much to my surprise, the horror and comedy in Drag Me to Hell are that rare perfect mix of perfection that one craves in horror movies. If too funny, they can go overboard, but not this one. In fact, I don't think I've seen quite a proper mixture since Raimi's own Evil Dead II.<br/><br/>Perhaps the most shocking thing about the movie is how well it's made technically. It had all sorts of interesting shots and the real work of a master filmmaker. Having both written and directed the film, Sam Raimi more than proves his worth to the horror genre despite his long absence since Army of Darkness. In ways, this is also a sort of revival of what people with think of PG-13 horror movies. Drag Me to Hell is one of the most intense, scary horror films in quite some time, despite the PG-13 rating which many tag as already crap.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is full of its epic shocks, and the less you go in knowing about it the better. I could go on for hours about the movie and spoil everything there is to know, but that would truly ruin some of its appeal. Which is certainly not to say that it is lost after a first viewing, just that it's an experience unlike any other going into this movie watching virtually no clips and reading very little about it. It becomes a truly rewarding experience.<br/><br/>Mrs. Ganush is one truly phenomenal villain that provides plenty of scares. Lorna Raver infuses the role with an enthusiasm - an terror - that is rarely seen in big-screen baddies. She has more personality than The Ring's Samara for sure. Clay's character provides a much-needed balance between the goofy and the horrific, and helps make the film's heroine, Christine, all the more believable. It was an interesting twist to see Justin Long in a horror film, despite the nature of his role. I believed his performance and the sincerity of his character. Lohman had a lot resting on her shoulders with this movie, and she totally pulled it off with flying colors. Nobody plays the terrified, but headstrong and determined female lead better than Lohman, and she proves her worth over and over again in this movie. She totally has a career ahead of her.<br/><br/>Overall, Drag Me to Hell did more than just impress me nonstop. It was a masterpiece of a horror movie, with unrivaled intensity, scares, and one killer of an ending. More often now, horror directors/writers seem to have such a difficult time ending their movies properly. This one has an ending which snugly solidifies the movie as an early contender for best horror film of the year. Don't miss Drag Me to Hell... you will never look at handkerchiefs the same way!"
"weirdstrike","1","113","212","30 May 2009"," Predictable and Clichéd
","When I saw the preview for this movie, I thought it seemed interesting enough.<br/><br/>But no, the movie started for only 20 minutes and I figured out what was going to happen throughout the whole story. Guess what? I was right.<br/><br/>The movie is not scary, if that's what you were hoping for. It is only scary because the low then loud music they play every five minutes for supposed ""suspense"", will blast the living life out of your ears. The graphics are cartoonish, and it is more gore than actual fright. And that Mrs. Ganush lady sure liked sticking things in Christine's mouth, didn't she? And let's not forget the clichés. The skeptical boyfriend, the high-strung parents of the boyfriend, the being cursed by an old lady thing, the traitor co-worker, and the whole you think it's all okay but then the protagonist dies in the end unexpectedly, and when I mean unexpectedly, I mean you saw it coming if you have common sense. . Yes...she dies. DUH. The poster is actually a spoiler. That only happens in the end.<br/><br/>I watched this with my 11-year old sister and we both laughed hysterically at the ""horror"" scenes.<br/><br/>The end."

","A Lamia is a Greek fairy-tale demon who murders children and originally was the daughter of the gods Poseidon and Lybie. That has nothing to do with this story, I guess the writer thought it just sounded like a good name. Here it is a goat-head/cloven foot devil who drags peoples souls to hell on the curse of filthy, old gypsy women. What hog wash.<br/><br/>Horror tales confront the times in which they are written and even though the Rami brothers claim to have written this in their Evil Dead era, it's major themes are all from today's news...<br/><br/>Exposition Scene : Two California (illegal ?) Mexican immigrants bring their young son to a Medium named Shaun San Dena because he has stolen a necklace from a Gypsy woman, and although he tried to return it, the woman refused (More immigrants, but this time terrorists !). The Medium is unsuccessful in removing the curse and the poor child is Dragged to Hell.<br/><br/>Exposition Scene 2: Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) works at a bank and wants to be promoted to the assistant manager position, her boss Mr. Jacks (the underrated David Paymer) knows this and dangles this as a carrot before her face and lets her know that a new employee, Stu Rubin (the terrible actor Reggie Lee) is a real go-getter willing to put in the hours and make the ""hard"" decisions. The bank scenes don't work and they lack pace and get in the way of the story. The characters are one dimensional and Reggie Lee is just hard to watch as he tries to act.<br/><br/>We meet Christine's boy friend the Apple Computer guy (Justin Long-a truly listless actor) who is a psychology professor named Clay Dalton. This is a good idea, but nothing ever becomes of it in this mess of a movie. There is some antagonism from Dalton's mother and this is answered to later in the film, but is unnecessary to the plot, in fact they could have written out Clay's parents and moved the film along at a more even pace, instead it just drags...<br/><br/>The Set-Up: A Gypsy woman (saw this coming from a mile away) named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes in and has defaulted on her mortgage (another hot topic in the news); she asks for more time. Blah, blah, blah the manager says no and goats Christine to turn the woman down. The Gypsy woman has become more disgusting by the moment, taking her teeth out, yuk ! She begs Christine and is suddenly humiliated when Christine pulls away. Not an effective scene at all.<br/><br/>Mrs. Ganush somehow finds Christine's car and waits for her then acts like a terminator trying to hurt the young woman. I had to really bite my lip not to laugh at this scene, it is so contrived.<br/><br/>The Pay-out: There is none. There are some scenes that have promise like a séance with the former mentioned Shaun San Dena that has a moment or two of scares, but mostly this film is a real yawn fest. I can understand that the young reviewers on this page might like it, they are not as jaded as the more adult viewers. It's not scary, it's not even a great idea as Evil Dead was, it is however a waste of money.<br/><br/>I rate it so low because I expected much more from the Rami brothers. It is the Emperors New Cloth of the Summer Films. My advice, if you must see it, wait for the DVD and hope it has deleted scenes and comments..."
"ametaphysicalshark","Null","71","131","29 May 2009"," Deliciously pulpy return to horror for Raimi
","""Drag Me to Hell"" might be the victim of unfair expectations, or just plain incorrect assumptions. This might partially be down to the advertising campaign, which could lead audiences to believing this is purely serious horror, when in fact it is pulp silliness in the vein of the old EC comics, and fully aware of it. Sam Raimi, for whom the childhood experience of reading those pulp tales served as an inspiration for his now-legendary ""Evil Dead"" movies, and hence gave him his career, has made his most fun and entertaining film since ""Army of Darkness"", and probably his best since then as well (although I do need to see ""A Simple Plan"" again) in ""Drag Me to Hell"", which feels like it could be an adaptation of one of those horror tales.<br/><br/>Hopefully audiences will be expecting something along the lines of ""Evil Dead"" mixed with its sequels when they go in, or they could leave disappointed. Unless you're scared by old women and supernatural mumbo jumbo, unless you're a superstitious person, ""Drag Me to Hell"" probably won't be giving you any nightmares. Then again, I'm not scared by anything really. Still, one can't help but feel that this sort of thing (if done seriously) doesn't belong in today's age of rationality and would work only in the 50's, or maybe even then would be too late to really pack a punch.<br/><br/>That's why this is, like the ""Evil Dead"" movies, a cartoon. It is one cartoony horror set-piece after the other, more often than not with an overt comedic edge, and always, always with its tongue firmly in cheek. The characters are well-realized enough for the movie to be endurable, and well-played too (Justin Long is perfect for the role regardless of how limited his range is and I can't imagine anyone but Lohman playing this particular role), but Raimi doesn't really care about them. He cares more about piling on the pulp gross-outs, resorting here to all sorts of unsavory things (including embalming fluid gushing out of a corpse into Lohman's mouth, one of a multitude of things Raimi takes pleasure in introducing to that particular orifice of Lohman's body), but not much blood at all. It isn't needed either, the PG-13 rating may sound like a limitation but it's hard to imagine this movie with much more gore, although there are a few things that happen off-screen that I would have LOVED to see on-screen, but that might be because I'm a horribly sick person.<br/><br/>Utilizing an active, expressive camera akin to the sort of thing we saw in the ""Evil Dead"" movies, Raimi stages these ridiculous scenes with gusto and passion. This is not going to terrify many people, but it is absolutely terrific at being what it sets out to be- a live action EC comic. As long as you go in expecting that, you'll probably leave satisfied. I'd like to leave you with the wise words of AV Club critic Scott Tobias: ""He wants viewers to jump out of their chairs, to laugh and scream and cheer, and to nudge each other over the transcendent ridiculousness of what they're witnessing. This is junk film-making at its finest."""

","Firstly I HAVE to give this film a 1/10 to get the ratings down. I just got back from the cinema after watching this crap and I expected the IMDb rating to be 5 or lower. Imagine my surprise when it has 8/10!<br/><br/>This film is all too predictable. Think of Stephen King's Thinner meets The Haunting In Connecticut.<br/><br/>I walk into the cinema and there is NO ONE else there. The film starts with some Mexican boy being possessed and I thought the film was going to be one of those spoof horror-comedies when I saw over-the-top creepy shadow hands crawling over the ceiling. He gets dragged off to hell because he was cursed by a gypsy whose necklace he stole. Some Mexican woman looks on and promises to get revenge on the spirit that did it. When that scene finished we're taken to the life of Christine Brown, a loan officer for Wilshire Pacific Bank. She's after a promotion to position of Assistant Manager but so is her rival - the Asian Company Agent from Prison Break season 2.<br/><br/>She's day dreaming when some old gypsy woman starts asking her if the bank could give her more time on a mortgage repayment she missed. Christine, wanting to impress the boss, says no and so the gypsy then begs her, lunges at her and is then dragged out kicking and screaming. To be honest I thought that was simply horrible and I thought immediately that she deserved what happens but then we cut to a spooky underground car park (a setting used far too much for suspense and cheap scares) where the gypsy is waiting in Christine's car. Now here is the only time in the film where I WAS surprised. I thought the gypsy would curse her like in Thinner but instead starts attacking her with great strength and agility and it was quite funny to watch. One bit that was funny was when the gypsy's false teeth smash and she tries biting Christine with gums. Anyway, the whole fight seemed pointless as all she did was take a button from Christine's coat, curse it and give it back and THEN the predictability starts.<br/><br/>Christine and her boyfriend drive home where she starts getting creeped out with noises and seeing scary things with sharp teeth. Before she goes home she sees an Indian fortune teller who just happens to know EVERYTHING about the curse and was luckily just next to her boyfriend's parked car. He says she's cursed and makes no attempt to help her. After a half hour of miscellaneous scares and going to see the gypsy to retract the curse again just like in Thinner (I KNEW the old bag would be dead), she sees Indian man again. He says make a sacrifice so she kills her pet cat instead of finding a stray and I KNEW it wouldn't work. Meanwhile at work, she has a nose bleed so intense that she sprays blood everywhere and no one phones a doctor or anything. They just do nothing while she runs away. So back she goes to Indian man who says he knows this woman and you know what's coming: a standard Hollywood scary exorcism scene done by the Mexican woman from the first scene in the film (what a coincidence).<br/><br/>Here we're told that to remove the demon, Indian man, Christine, Mexican woman and another Mexican man have to hold hands, summon the demon and transfer it to a goat. Kill the goat and it's over. The goat starts to talk when it's possessed but of course the plan doesn't go ahead properly and the Mexican man gets bitten and is possessed. Mexican woman chants and the spirit is gone but Mexican woman dies for no reason. Indian man puts the cursed button in an envelope and says to give it to someone else and THEY will be dragged off to hell instead. She lies to her boyfriend saying it's all over and drops the envelope in the car and picks it up again. She ponders giving it to the Asian man from Prison Break but can't so back to Indian man again who says to give it to the gypsy's corpse. So over she goes to the cemetery, digs up the corpse and puts it in her mouth.<br/><br/>Next scene, she's all happy and I KNEW it wasn't a happy end. When she dropped the envelope in the car she mixed it with another envelope with a coin in it so she never got rid of it. She's dragged to hell while boyfriend watches and cries and it's over. Predictable standard horror.<br/><br/>If gypsies can curse people so easily, they should be ruling the world. Why didn't she use those powers to make payments or whatever? It makes no sense. Why this has such a high rating I don't know. It relies on shock scares too much with the plot being too ridiculous. The Indian man was ridiculous. Why didn't he just say give the button back to the gypsy or take her to the exorcist in the first place?"
"amarcordforever","9","193","390","14 May 2009"," Dragged to Hell: Another Experiment in Grueling Terror
","To properly (and fairly) access my experience with seeing ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi's (The Gift, Spider Man) much anticipated and blogged about new opus, we must first take a little trip back in time to the year 1995. As a kid, I had always been intrigued by the horror genre, most of which likely spawned from my parent's extreme hatred towards it. While they perused the Comedy and Drama sections of our old video store (then stocked to the brim with VHS tapes, I might add) I found myself sneaking off to the far left corner among the gory, trashy, at often times downright pornographic cover art that adorned the paper sleeves for films such as ""Invasion of the Blood Farmers"" and ""Deadtime Stories"". <br/><br/>Like a college freshman introduced to mass quantities of alcohol for the first time with no guidance in sight, I was on overload. What were they attempting to keep me from? If I slid this threw the door of my old Sony T-120, what exactly would I be getting myself into? One would like to think I found the answer that day instead of being forced to watch ""The Jerk"" for the ten thousandth time, but alas, my first experience with the ""terror"" genre began that same year, late at night, in the comforts of my own bed, with a remote control, a freshly fluffed pillow and the Sci-Fi Channel. <br/><br/>The words flashed onto the screen, ""The Evil Dead"" in blood red, bold faced lettering. As I watch the plot unfold I found myself paralyzed by the images I was seeing. Humans being possessed by demons, dismembered by their own friends, maniacally laughing in a distorted, demented all together frightening way and above all jumping out at me when I least expected it. I was changed. My outlook on movies changed. My fear of the dark was created and that was WITH commercial breaks. Of course, I have only one man to thank for getting me hooked on the ""Terror"" genre and that is Sam Raimi.<br/><br/>After almost twenty years (since ""Army of Darkness"" the final installment of the Evil Dead franchise) Mr. Raimi returns to his old stomping grounds with ""Drag Me to Hell"", the tale of Christine (Allison Lohman, Matchstick Men) a loan officer whom forces Mrs. Ganush, a sick, decrepit gypsy woman from her home by denying her an extension on an already delinquent bank loan. As fate would have it, after work in a desolate parking garage, Christine is attacked and the curse of the Lamia is placed onto her. In the days to follow she is brutally attacked by unseen entities, experiences visions of a deformed Mrs. Ganush and attempts to reverse the curse by contacting psychic mediums. Time is of the essence, but taking the curse off proves to be much more difficult than it was to put on as we witness Christine attempt to silence it before she is dragged to hell.<br/><br/>Earlier on, I referred to my obsession with the ""Terror"" genre. Terror differs from Horror in that its goal is to completely terrify the audience as opposed to simply scaring them. ""Drag Me to Hell"" falls into one such category. From start to finish, you make the first plunge down the drop of a 100 minute roller coaster and in the end feel as if you've been tossed around and abused by a master manipulator, Raimi. It is evident, through the use and placement of scares, gore, mixture of comedy and horror as well as pacing of the plot that Raimi didn't have to do much dusting off to get back in the game. He clearly knows that, in this genre, simplicity is often times the best course of action. The storyline and its unraveling is basic, often times boarding on naivety, but the absolute madness that ensues within its walls is comparable to a warm piece of chocolate cake. <br/><br/>Allison Lohman (who replaced Ellen Page in early stages of development) does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Page would have brought a bit more grittiness to the role, but that's beside the point. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part. Justin Long as Clay, Christines boyfriend, delivers as always and manages to keep it real in a role that could have very easily turned corny had it not been handled correctly. Supporting cast, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) and Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) the Medium are both convincing in their extremely demanding parts. <br/><br/>What's so special about ""Drag Me to Hell"" is that it knows its roots. It takes us back to the days when it was a true ""experience"" to see a horror/terror movie. When you went into a movie theater and the audience jumped, yelled at the screen and quivered in shock and disgust. At the conclusion it brought them to their feet with a standing ovation and all along with the mindset of, ""Okay, we're all in this together, let's make it out in one piece."" ""Drag Me to Hell"" is what a good experience at the movies is all about. There will be those who hate it, loath it even, but for the handful of us that were transformed into obsessed fans of this niche market by a master director, it will validate our love for the genre and will forever stand as a true testament of the best it has to offer. As for myself, for a short moment in time I was a thirteen again, curled up under my covers, frozen with fear, and loving every single minute of it."

If someone asked me what the worst movie I have ever seen I would without a doubt say Drag Me to Hell. <br/><br/>The gypsy lady was crazy and cursed a girl for not giving her a loan even though she had defaulted on 2 loans already. She went buck wild in the parking lot gnawing on the girls face and everything was just so absolutely ridiculous. The girl then found out she was cursed and had 3 days of torment before she was ""dragged to hell.

It's so bad if I hadn't been with someone else who wanted to watch it I would have walked out - something I haven't done for a while.<br/><br/>OK - the story has promise, but it's the endless use of the same tired old movie clichés and techniques to create any suspense. Yes, I'm talking underground car parks (do small bank branches have underground car parks? And even if it was a shopping mall, when she leaves work how come there are only half a dozen cars left in this place?). A big swollen lip one minute and then one minute later in the film (later that night in movie-time) she looks perfect and giving full on frenchies with her fella. And what the hell happened to the goat?<br/><br/>As for the twist...well you'll only miss the signposts to what's going to happen if you're completely dumb or asleep, which there is a reasonable chance of. <br/><br/>All in all, I wish I been dragged down to see Hannah Montana instead.

It was not scary even in the slightest. Comparing it to Evil Dead, IMO, is a complete disservice. Bruce Campbell was the perfect character for the off the wall humor, non-scary, horror style.<br/><br/>The difference is, this movie is trying to be scary. They are not purposely making a joke. They were trying to make this a serious, scary, well acted movie. It's not a satire, I see a lot of people posting in that thought.<br/><br/>A floating hanker-chef? Are you serious? And they do try to make even that scary, by it suddenly flying on the screen, and with a sudden tone in the music.<br/><br/>Story line was bad, Justin Long is the completely wrong actor for the role he was playing, every single thing that is trying to be scary just turns out so bad that it's funny.<br/><br/>I guess you could give it that, it's so terrible that it's funny.<br/><br/>The ending? OK...I'll bite. What did she shove down the old ladies throat? You could clearly see the envelope she was holding had a circular object in it (a button one assumes) but yet at the end, *SHOCK* she dies! The movie was more vile than anything else. Going for shock humor by having the old lady be ridiculously disgusting and spilling various liquids mouth to mouth to the young lady thru out the film.<br/><br/>Everyone in the movie theater panned it. The one I was in. That's why it grossed 7 mil on the opening...cause it stunk!"

I could not sleep for days and when I did, I slept with the door open with a clear path into my parents room if something out of the normal approached. Drag me to hell, drags us all back to the good old days of horror where true impactful scares are made yet the film takes you on a roller coaster ride where you just don't know where or when it will end. With a flawless story and well crafted, sound design was outstanding and therefore helped deliver the chills, this film will feel like going to a very expensive restaurant and eating meal where you feel so satisfied, you bask in the experience.

"rservello","10","119","244","13 May 2009"," Drag me to Hell Premiere
","Went to the world premiere of Drag me to Hell last night at the Chinese theater....and while I had seen quite a bit of the film with no sound I was still incredible surprised, and impressed! I have always been a big Sam Raimi fan....I watched Evil Dead 1&2 and Army of Darkness religiously in High School....so to be able to work on Raimi's return to horror was an honor and a pleasure. And this does not disappoint. It was exactly what I would have expected from a master of comedic horror that got to really cut his teeth on the mega budget Spiderman series. Extremely refined...but not a product. It doesn't feel like a typical Hollywood film....yet has the production values of one.<br/><br/>I was extremely excited when I got my invitation to attend the premiere and I was not at all disappointed. The final film is both one of the creepiest and scariest film I've seen in a while, and yet in perfect Raimi brothers style....very funny (even at times most other film makers wouldn't have been able to make it funny).<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil anything, but for those of you that saw the PG-13 rating and groaned let me say....don't let it deter you. As with other great Raimi films the scare is in what is NOT seen....which is what makes it so damn scary! I wish more horror filmmakers would finally realize that. There are some extremely tense moments brought on by nothing but great camera work and awesome sound design.<br/><br/>If you want a genuinely creepy movie....and a great laugh go check it out when it comes out. You will NOT be disappointed.<br/><br/>Oh, and none of my shots were cut!!! Woohoo!"
"Popcorndude13","2","59","116","30 May 2009"," Simply Horrible, almost unwatchable
","Going in to the movies to see this I really didn't know what to expect. I had seen MySpace ads around as well as a commercial I barely glimpsed at. Still like a typical horror movie I went in expecting greatness, despite being disappointed 9/10 times.<br/><br/>Now, prior to going in I was unaware the man who made this also did the Evil Dead series. In all fairness I loved those movies as a kid when my dad showed me them on VHS. They were scary and weird so it was still enjoyable despite the oddness.<br/><br/>Drag me to Hell on the other hand, well I seriously considered leaving the theater. If you want to simply jump throughout the movie you're in luck, it uses about 20 or so cliché suspense moments to get you scared. Now, I've watched plenty of horror movies in my day so disliking the movie had nothing to do with disliking ""gross"" things- but the amount of goo in this movie was just unnecessary and only there for the sake of being gross. While I now understand the comical-horror scenes in this movie (As I'm now aware of the creator) for newcomers to the maker, or just casual moviegoers in general it doesn't make sense to be in there. If we come for a scary movie we don't expect to see Looney-Tune situations. Laughter amidst a horror movie may be a nice break and all, but it just makes the movie look silly, low budget, badly written, and not serious considering the rest of the movies mood.<br/><br/>The acting for this was mixed, it was either over the top and unneeded or just awkward. Later we meet the Boyfriend's parents who are clearly wealthy. While they went for a ""smug rich people"" act it just seemed like acting of a cheap television show.<br/><br/>Personally I found the music and sounds to be terrible in this movie, I apologize if this is coming off as a rant but I'll explain. Drag me to Hell is LOUD, extremely so; in the suspense scenes people were covering their ears due to the loud pitch. Musically it was just inappropriate, during one particular horror scene they chose a Jazz-like bass rift. <br/><br/>CGI in the movie was decent, nothing award-winning but it worked despite certain scenes looking as if they were from the 1987 Evil Dead film. The style mirrored that of ""My Bloody Valentine"" where everything appeared ready for 3D (assuming you didn't see that in 3D)<br/><br/>On paper, the plot is good. Or at least it started good, though realistically its just your typical ""Somethings going to possess you and haunt you, we need to do an old ritual to end it"" film (See also: The Eye, The Unborn, Etc.)<br/><br/>To sum things up, I wasted my time and money by seeing this movie. While I would like to appreciate it as the ""Comeback of a great horror director"" I just refuse to call it anything more than a cult hit. Don't see this movie, its a jumbled mess of random acts thrown together to create suspense just for the sake of doing so."
"tyranid_slayer","9","77","157","30 May 2009"," Drag Me To Horror Movie Heaven!
","Hi! Years and years ago.....A guy called Sam Raimi made a couple of films called Evil Dead. Scary scary movies ahead of their time. But over time Sam moved away from the horror genre and directed films like Darkman and the Spider-Man trilogy. If he wasn't doing that he pasted his name on and produced really really bad horror movies like The Boogeyman. So imagine my surprise when i heard that he was actually directing a horror movie again! After seeing it last night here is my review. I do enjoy horror films......but i don't like them. That doesn't make sense but what i mean is i LOVE horror movies but all horror movies today are utter crap. The only scary movies made today are all Korean. Then America, with their complete lack of originality and money grabbing ways, make a remake with low standards. The last horror movie i went to see was The Unborn and that is THE WORST MOVIE i have seen in a long time and the worst horror movie as well. Drag Me To Hell is a breath of fresh air for the horror genre. In the films opening sequence the plot device is introduced in a chilling manner. It opens the film perfectly and the goosebumps go all the way through the opening credits. Christine has a fairly nice life until she denies an elderly woman an extension on her mortgage. Then the main part of the plot is opened in a sequence that is tongue in cheek funny and scary (classic raimi). From here on out it's scares piled upon scares. Sam Raimi doesn't follow the usual horror movie cliché of.........long......drawn-out......silences.....THEN LOUD NOISE TO MAKE YOU JUMP! He actually builds suspense with a neat little musical score. High pitched violins carry your nerves then throw them in the air! That's another thing. The film doesn't have a great focus on visual effects but the sound effects are fantastic. Tension building and atomospheric sounds and music are put to amazing use. The story is a good set up. It is an original film with an original story. It isn't plagerised or a cheap money making remake from Korea. Although the story is limited and the film run time is of average length. The film is classic Raimi and there are lots of references to other films by him. It's good to know that super massive Hollywood blockbusters haven't diluted his great direction and how he used to make films all those years ago. He keeps a good balance of humour and serious scenes by using humour when necessary and never ruining the atmosphere. Throw all this in with a disturbing shock ending you have the best horror film i've seen at the cinema in a long time! I'm sure you'll agree. Enjoy."
"hitchcockthelegend","7","17","29","18 September 2009"," Fun horror from Sam, but perspective is still needed.
","Waiting for another Sam Raimi horror film has been like hoping your numbers come up on the national lottery, long, arduous and ultimately unfruitful. So it be that when one finally comes around, there is a tendency to over praise, over hype, and even be blind to actually how worthy Drag Me To Hell is. Not only in the pantheon of the horror genre, but in the cannon of its supremely talented director.<br/><br/>So it comes to pass that myself, a Raimi fan for sure, decided to let the hoo-hah die down before venturing in to Hell with Alison Lohman and her devilish nemesis. I note now at the current time of writing that the film is rated just over 7.5/10, that's just about right where it deserves to be. It's not new or remotely ingenious, and for sure it's actually finding Raimi on auto-pilot for himself and his fans. But hey! It's still far better than the ream of remakes and blood for bloods sake cash cows that insult the genre faithful on a monthly basis.<br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell is a comedy horror, there's nothing really scary here, it's gross at times, almost disgustingly {delightfully} so, but Raimi is reliant on fun to go hand in hand with a creeper of a story instead of a conventional boo jump bonanza. And it works just fine. The story sees Alison Lohman's Christine Brown upset an old gypsy woman and gets a curse of demonic proportions laid onto her. This set up then lets Raimi pummel Lohman with a number of excellently scripted set pieces, whilst managing to keep a mystery element ticking throughout the story. Some problems do exist, tho, certainly enough to ensure this isn't the masterpiece the desperate for a Raimi horror hoards have labelled it.<br/><br/>Lohman does real well in relation to duality of character, but both she and her on screen beau, Justin Long, just look too young for the roles they are playing, and yes, it's pretty distracting and an itch you can't scratch. The CGI is also duff and affecting the story, particularly during what should have been a ripper of an ending. And crucially there is a familiarity about the whole thing, a feeling that Raimi and his brother Ivan have just made a collage of genre staples.<br/><br/>Still, Drag Me To Hell makes for a real entertaining night in by the fire. Enjoy a director making a film for himself as much as his fans, a sort of roots revisit if you like. But don't expect a genre defining, or genre boosting, picture, because you may be a tad disappointed with the return. 7/10"

","Sam Raimi hasn't made a bad movie yet, and while Drag Me To Hell has emerged as a case of you hate it or you love it (like Apocalypse Now, Forrest Gump, and Avatar). It turns out to be a fun ride.<br/><br/>Christine Brown is a loan officer in L.A. and is trying to get the position of assistant manager. She decides that in order to impress her boss, she has to be tougher. So when an old gypsy woman comes and asks her for a third extension on mortgage payment, Christine denies her that. Feeling shamed, the old woman puts a curse on Christine, and sends a demon after her. Her life is suddenly in ruins, but with the help of a fortune teller, and his Latin American friends, Christine attempts to rid herself of the demon, before it takes her down to hell. <br/><br/>the ending of the film is more than somewhat controversial, and in fact you could even spend the rest of the day going over it in your mind, trying to figure out what the Raimi bros were thinking. In fact considering what they choose, the entire story is kind of pointlessly staged, but at least it is fun. Raimi takes us on a crazy ride, we the viewers are treated to a handful of shocking and humorous moments, many of which directly resemble, the Evil Dead flicks. You can tell from this that after fifteen years, Raimi is still a master at horror. He has tackled every genre but it is clear now that he is most at home with this genre. I would not say it's lovable, but it doesn't disappoint either."
"jcdugger","1","39","79","10 June 2009"," The only thing shocking about this movie is IMDb's rating!...
","On the way to the theater, I tell my buddy ""This has an 8.0 on IMDb, it MUST be good!"" Ummm...No. I've seen better movies on a 3-D View-Master!<br/><br/>OK, so the movie begins with the main character, aptly played by the wet-dream-inducing Alison Lohman, getting a cursed placed on her by an old lady who's about to get evicted from her home unless the bank helps her out. Every cliché in the book is thrown at you to get you on the side of Alison, a bank employee who decided to help throw the old lady on the street for the benefit of the bank. (The film-makers resort in their attempt to show remorse towards Alison...to showing the old lady having terrible hygiene, her contempt towards Alison, disgusting habits, and emptying the bank candies into her purse). The old lady, by the way, apparently has ""powers"" the rest of us don't, like the ability to place a deadly curse on others, having super-human strength and tremendous dexterity while fighting, and having the knowledge that Alison could potentially have helped her personally (although she wasn't near the conversation Alison had with the bank manager).<br/><br/>The curse described by the old lady then begins happening to Alison. She goes to a palm-reader (a guy who has a knack for not mentioning extremely important things until it's nearly too late) and he tells her that she is cursed.<br/><br/>I cannot overstate the stupidity of this palm-reading character (played by Dileep Rao). If there ever was a ""Professor for the Occult"" at your local University, this character would be it! He informs Alison that she would be tormented by a demon for 3 days...then the demon would come for her and drag her to hell. Alison asks Dileep if there is anything that can be done. He says ""Well, you can attempt an animal sacrifice that might appease the demon"". (I thought the word ""might"" wasn't very reassuring for a person in the midst of a fight from hell!) Anyway, Alison doesn't pick up a stray cat or one destined for the back room of her local animal shelter...no, she uses her own precious kitty for the slaughter! After murdering her kitten, she thinks everything is now fine, as a day or so goes by without incident. As the 3-day-clock is ticking down, she gets terrorized by the demon again, goes back to Dileep and proceeds to verbally beat him like a rented mule. Dileep then (AND FINALLY I MIGHT ADD) says ""Well...I know this special lady who does exorcists and can drive the demon out...but it's costly, $10,000, and you need the money tonight."" ** Note, I yelled out in the theater: ""Could you mail that suggestion back to 2 days ago when I originally asked about what can be done?!"" -- the crowd began laughing hysterically! ** Anyway, her boyfriend (played by Justin Long's mangina) gets wind that she needs the 10K and gives it to Dileep on her behalf.<br/><br/>I'd like to quickly add this eye-rolling sequence. Alison decides to show up at the old lady daughter's creepy mansion of a house to ask for forgiveness and to tell the old hag that she would help her get the house back. The daughter answers the door and tells her to leave...then oddly lets her in after a rude verbal tongue-thrashing. Alison walks into the house...it's very quiet...she is led through some rooms, down some stairs...then asks ""Where is she?""...and her host says ""Right around the corner""....she turns the corner, and get this, A PARTY IS ENSUING! People drinking, eating, talking...a scene inconsistent with a house that looked as if it hadn't had a visitor in years...and with not many cars parked out in front as Alison walked up...and knowing you hadn't heard a sound the entire time Alison was walking through the house! The scene ends with you finding out that this is actually a gathering for the old lady's funeral. How do you find this out? Alison, not paying attention to where she's walking in an odd house full of strangers, trips over the old lady's casket, making her fall out of the casket and on top of Alison, where the old lady pukes embalming gel all over her face. Wow. You can't make this stuff up.<br/><br/>Back to story. Dileep then takes Alison to his psychic friends house. This lady was the most cliché of all the chock-full-of-cliché people in the movie. She was fully equipped with mood-rings, the ugliest new-age jewelry possible, candles galore and items from the occult (one item on her séance table, I noticed, was a dated and dusty jar that was completely empty...oohhhh, scary!). I won't spoil things here, other to say that the exorcism doesn't go well and there's a talking goat. (Yes). After things go badly, and Alison feels she is destined for Hell, Dileep offers up one more piece of advice that would have been best said 2 days ago. (This guy is the king of yesterday's news!) Dileep, amazingly enough, tells her that she can simply give the curse away as a gift...but the recipient would go through the same hell she is and would be dragged to hell themselves in 3 days! Much to my surprise...NOT!...She can't possibly think of ANYONE who she can gift this curse to! She sees an old creaky man...yes!...Oh, his wife shows up, nevermind. She calls her rival at work...she could kill 2 birds with 1 stone by gifting him the curse...Nah, he's too sad now, nevermind! So she decides to, again, get this, go to the graveyard and dig up the body of the old lady so she can shove the gift down her throat! Wow. I told my buddy ""She should give it to George W Bush!"" But, seriously, she couldn't have visited a prison and gave it to a rapist or murderer? That would have required logic I guess...something this movie lacks badly.<br/><br/>JD"
"Nick Zbu","2","36","73","30 May 2009"," Disappointing
","This has been regarded as Sam Raimi's triumphant return to horror, but the only thing that this movie has in spades is a high degree of ripping off Raimi's previous hits and using the sound system to create cheap scares. While the movie has a lot of Raimi's classic camera work and a few good performances (ignoring Justin Long, who seems grossly miscast), the movie itself seems like it should be more but isn't. Raimi can and should do better than this, and should focus his trademark dark humor on a project that has more to offer than a combination of 'Thinner' and a standard EC Comic tale.<br/><br/>All and all, I wanted to go in and be impressed. I came out partially deaf and wondering where Sam Raimi had gone wrong with the film. The conclusion I came to is that the script was just not up to snuff. The boasting of Raimi's name alongside of the film makes me wonder if the movie's uneven tone and execution was a cunning way to disguise a bad film.<br/><br/>A real shame. Hopefully next time he'll get it right. But right now, I just feel cheated out of a ticket and a lack of faith in a good director."

","The plot to this movie is almost not existent. A women denies a gypsy an extension on her loan, gypsy curses her, ""Lamia"" haunts main character in foreshadowing of taking her soul to hell, main character consorts with ""physics"", trouble with love interest, final confrontation, ending where you know main character is going to die (There is absolutely no twist, NO TWIST, you'd only be shocked if you were high). The only scares are built up by long pauses with cliché violin and followed by sudden flash of bad cgi. All of the cgi is ridiculous, you have no idea how bad cgi can be until you see one of the ""dragin to hell"" scenes or the (albeit funny) ""Lamia"" possessed goat. Speaking of which, i was under the impression that a lamia was a female snake-like creature and in this cause it is your typical run of the mill demon. A kitten also gets sacrificed, wtf?! The only redeeming qualities of this movie are the ridiculous gypsy woman, demon possessed goat (which was probably worth the admission price), and the comments of other movie goers. I would highly recommend avoiding this movie regardless of the past work of its makers"
"politehere","10","28","55","21 August 2011"," I Was Actually Dragged to Hell
","I saw this movie when it was first released, but after reading the poor reviews, I decided to write one of my own. Drag Me to Hell is not only the best horror movie but also one of the best and most enjoyable movies I've ever seen. This was a pleasant surprise to horror fans like me who are sick of excessive darkness and gore. Actually, I find most such movies to be disturbing rather than scary. What's so enjoyable about seeing someone's guts hang from their stomach? <br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell manages to scare you without using gore or dark scenes. It is the nice mixture of elements than makes it scary. The story line is smooth,there are no plot holes, the heroine is absolutely likable and innocent-looking, you are engaged with the movie and feel her torment, the background music is very creepy, there are plenty of sudden jumps and scares, there is very good use of common items and elements that makes them look terrifying, there are a few ironic moments in the film to give you a break, and the ending is totally unpredictable and leaves you in a state of shock, fear and despair. All in all, it was full of jumps and thrills throughout.<br/><br/>What more could I possibly expect from a horror movie? It was just perfect.<br/><br/>10/10"

","Now I don't want to seem inexperienced or ramble on about this movie or anything, but I found the movie absolutely mediocre and somewhat annoying to watch. It looks like a lot of money was pured into this mess to make it look like a very memorable horror film,but it is exactly the opposite. All the girl wanted to do was get a promotion for her job and the old woman just finds the need to completely screw her life up. Honestly I know its a movie, but would anyone really extend that woman's loan. She isn't a very reliable person to trust. Anyway, the movie has a very predictable plot with a couple of gag scenes such as, excess blood, vomit, and the constant appearance of this annoying old woman who seems to have some sort of an oral problem. If anything this is a definite date movie to bring your significant other too. Only because it does have a few good jump scenes, but nothing to write home about. The director of Evil Dead brings us a mediocre horror film that doesn't live up to his career. It is almost as comparibly horrible as Boogeyman, but it definitely is a waste of ten dollars and an Hour 1/2 of your life you will never get back. A very forgetfull film that does not deliver at all. 3/10 stars"
"kizzthesky","8","25","50","14 June 2009"," Dare I say it?
","I think I'll throw the cat amongst the pigeons by saying that I thought this movie was as good as, and possibly surpassed Evil Dead 2. <br/><br/>I was immediately taken by the classic - and somewhat clichéd - horror title sequences and music. The films pacing was excellent and well acted. The gorgeous Alison Lohman does an excellent job as lead role, and although her character is not as hilarious as Bruce Campbell's Ash, her charisma shines through. <br/><br/>Raimi isn't re-inventing the proverbial horror wheel, in many ways Drag me to hell is a homage to earlier horror films and their style. What sets it apart is that it takes tried and tested horror conventions and simply does them better than we are used to seeing. The formulaic drawn-out-periods-of-quiet-followed-by-a-loud-shocking-noise is used more than once and to great effect, without feeling too cheesy. There are also sequences when Raimi really amps up the creep factor i.e Christine alone in the underground car park.<br/><br/>Having said this, the film also has a comic touch and tongue in cheek manner. Raimi understands that its futile to try and sustain complete terror throughout a feature length film (alien is perhaps the only film I've seen that manages to accomplish this)as the audience will eventually just switch off. He laces the film with humour and some of the most terrifying scenes become laugh out loud funny and vice versa.<br/><br/>Also I think after working on three block buster films Raimi relished the opportunity for stylisation. Although there are no 360 degree camera pans and less fast zooms than in the evil dead films Raimi does indulge in some camera acrobatics, and tongue in cheek shots. i.e where a fly lands on the camera lens and leaves a dirty smear. <br/><br/>I think most people would enjoy this film, its scary enough for the horror aficionados but has enough humour to appeal to a wide audience. I loved it. <br/><br/>Also, I don't want to give away any spoilers, but I can say I left the cinema with my jaw hanging open."

","This film is so good in many ways that it seems churlish to be critical but I feel I have to mention a slight problem I have. This is so fast and furious that there is little time for us to become involved with Alison Lohman's character. There is all the annoying stuff at the Bank but somehow this doesn't make us particularly sympathetic. Then all mayhem breaks loose and incredibly jumpy and violent it is but for me, when there comes a pause and I'm catching my own breath, I'm not thinking of how she might escape. So then all the seeming silly fortune telling and séance stuff have no resonance for me. Mind you even if you are a little on the outside, this will still make you jump and even turn aside at some of the fantastic and awful oral projectiles. Very gooey, violent and relentless with some nice touches and a considerable nod to the much earlier b/w classic, Night of the Demon. If you enjoy violent thrashing horror you will love this, I just think it could have been even better. I've just realised that there is no sex in this movie, which I guess is a bit unusual. Possibly in the absence of character involvement, interrupted sex scenes might have done the job, not very original, I guess. And although there are obvious influences from other films, there are enough most original bits and bobs to make this well worth seeing."

As when a button is removed during a scuffle , a curse is placed on her . It will result in her being taken to hell in a few days time and the things get worse . Now the girl must call upon his boyfriend named Clay Dalton (Justin Long) and a spiritual adviser (Rao) to help her persuade the gypsy to lift the curse.

The psychics attempt to rid her of the strange demon , a malevolent force she is up against , leading until an incredible ending .<br/><br/>This exciting picture is a terror story full of supernatural elements with eerie moments here and there and brief touches of black humor . The makeup and special effects vary , but for the most part, they are quite good , they are realized by Robert Kurtzman and Howard Berger . Colorful and adequate cinematography by Peter Deming who captures perfectly the peculiar scenarios . The film displays adequate musical score fitting to terror and suspense by Christopher Young , an expert composer of dark atmospheres . The motion picture is professionally directed by Sam Raimi ( Crimewave, Evil dead I and II ) who directed ¨Army of darkness¨ another horror film with humor and tongue-in-cheek . This one isn't his worst movie , but definitely not the best either . The result is better than previous Stephen King adaptation called ¨Thinner¨, that bears remarkable resemblance to ¨Drag me to the hell¨.

"sumana-m21","3","32","69","30 May 2009"," What has happened to the Horror genre?
","I didn't like the movie at all. Where was the horror? Simply having loud noises boom at your ear every once in a while shouldn't be the factor to make you jump. In fact you don't even need loud sound effects to creep you out. Once in a while it's okay, but not throughout the movie and for every scene. I just got bored of it. The movie was very dragging, sort of similar to it's name, I guess. And you could sorta guess how the ending would turn out to be, DUH! Horror + comedy + goo simply don't go well together. They should be kept apart in the scenes at least. It's only going to grose you out to the point where you will feel like throwing up if you're eating something. Save yourself the money and watch this sometime for free, like in a few years maybe. Oh and btw, your 13-14 yr olds might get scared with the sound effects being so harsh. So beware!"
"Smells_Like_Cheese","8","25","52","6 June 2009"," Sam is bringing scary back, those other directors don't know how to act, I think it's special what's... um, yeah, I suck at opening lines, sorry
","Hmm, it's interesting on some of the reviews I've been reading on IMDb with users saying how Sam Raimi has ""returned"", hmm, when did he leave? Well, I'm assuming because he hasn't really done a horror movie for a while, he got into those crazy and over the top Spider Man movies(I'm not dissing, loved Spider Man 1 and 2). So when I first saw the trailer for Drag Me To Hell, I can't tell you how excited I was to see the movie then came, sigh, the rating. PG-13 horror movies are normally pretty terrible, they don't have much suspense and are so tame that it couldn't scare the super intelligent 5 year old. But, somehow, Sam Raimi, our awesome director of such cult classics as The Evil Dead series and Darkman, has brought us the intense and sure to be a new cult classic ""Drag Me To Hell"".<br/><br/>We meet Christine Brown, a loan officer with a promising future. A position for assistant manager has opened up at the bank where Christine works, and both she and her rival co-worker, Stu, are up for the promotion. Christine's boss, Mr. Jacks, advises her that she needs to demonstrate that she can make tough decisions and hard calls when she needs to. That same day, Mrs. Ganush, an elderly Gypsy woman, asks for a third extension on her mortgage because she is struggling with her economic problems due to her sickness. Christine, after a private talk with Mr. Jacks, denies Mrs. Ganush the extension against her better judgment to prove herself to her boss. In desperation, Mrs. Ganush begs Christine, and kissing the hem of her skirt. As a crowd of customers and employees gathers, Christine panics and shoves the woman away, shaming her in public. That night, in a parking garage where Christine is walking to her car, she notices Mrs. Ganush's yellow vehicle parked across from hers. Christine enters her car and realizes that Mrs. Ganush is staring straight at her in the back seat. After a short struggle, Mrs. Ganush removes a button from Christine's jacket. Mrs. Ganush places a curse upon the owner of the button and says to Christine, ""Soon, it will be you who comes begging to me,"" before returning the button. Pretty much Christine enters the seventh circle of Hell at this point with this curse and tries to get rid of it through the help of her boyfriend, Clay and fortune tellers.<br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell was very cleverly made and even has a morbid sense of humor to it to give the audience a breather. That's why Sam is awesome, he knows what it's like to be the audience, with so many horror movies today that are just a huge loud noise to scare the audience and it's the cheapest horror trick now in my opinion, he adds a joke to it to let the audience go with the flow of the story. This film is gross, gory, funny, scary and just all together a great horror experience. I have to say that one of my most hated clichés in horror movies are the old people that are supposedly creepy, but aren't, Mrs. Ganush definitely made me not only cringe but made me make my boyfriend to promise to shoot me before I get old well, she was scary! Trust me, really scary; ah, just go see the movie, it's a good recommendation.<br/><br/>8/10"
"CammyT","1","25","53","31 May 2009"," ""I felt like I was literally Dragged to Hell""
","I am a sincere fan of the Evil Dead series and am not one to ""shame"" any movie because I feel that every film has something to give the audience or fellow film makers in some way. This film unfortunately was not one that I would compare to Sam Raimi's ""greats"". His previous movies that made it big with huge cult followings were made a certain way with a certain feel that were certainly fitting for that time in cinematic history. I feel that these types of films can not and should not be revisited.<br/><br/>With that said, ""Drag Me To Hell"" was not only predictable but it was also filled with too many clichés and an extremely predictable ending. If you didn't see that one coming you can't call yourself a film buff! The story itself was very unoriginal. SPOILER IN NEXT PARAGRAPH (Even though i'm sure you would have guessed it) The movie itself and the reviews promised me an original plot but I'm sure if your a horror fan you have seen the gypsy curse before in a movie known as ""Thinner""(a convincingly scary horror). Gypsy asks for help, gypsy doesn't get help, gypsy curses you, gypsy gives you the gift of death while you try to please gypsy by counter cursing. Its always the same after all, you can't stop impending doom, you can only try to act like you even care. The only believable emotion was the single tear shot by Justin Long at the very end of the film. That's pretty much the way I looked after seeing it too. Speaking of Justin Long, his office desk was filled with Mac paraphernalia. I understand he is the Mac guy that always undermines the P.C. guy, but please can we show him not by a fancy Mac for two seconds(P.s. Love the commercials!)! To end my little rant, I think the fact that I noticed more things in the background (like what the extras were doing and saying) shows you how uninteresting I found this movie. Next time I think a better protagonist with a little more expression might be better for a role like this. I think a better ""surprise"" ending for this movie would have been to bring ""Ash"" back through the fiery pits of the undead ;)!! I'm sorry if you don't like what I am saying, but it is MY opinion and if you believe me, I may have just saved you some money. If you think I am full of it go see the movie and make your own conclusions! Thank YOU for letting me waste your time with a little opinion!"
"zetes","6","35","78","31 May 2009"," Too predictable and far too loud
","A huge disappointment in my eyes, especially after the high praise it has received from critics. Sam Raimi attempts to return to his B movie roots. Like the Evil Dead movies, it's delightfully cheesy and relentless. Unfortunately, it's also very formulaic and, much of the time, downright obnoxious. This is one film I would almost implore people not to see in theaters. At least not ones that like to turn the volume up. This movie is LOUD. I saw Terminator Salvation at the same theater, and was not nearly as deafened as I was by Drag Me to Hell. The problem: horror stings on the soundtrack. CONSTANTLY. The formula of the film is this: quiet set-up followed by sharp screech and an even louder BOO! It's the same thing over and over. I was cowering, but only because I was afraid I might not be able to hear in the morning. The story isn't bad, but it's been done before. Alison Lohman (awful) plays a loan officer who gets cursed by a gypsy after she turns her down for a loan extension. A goat demon begins to attack Lohman and, well, the rest of its intentions are included in the title of the film. Though I generally didn't like it, it's far from a bad film. In fact, I think it might play better on television (it's definitely the kind of movie that I would have caught on late night TV as a kid and loved). The séance scene near the end of the film is mostly gold. The demon itself is scary as Hell, but Raimi's way of indicating it, with sharp screeches, is what ruined the movie for me."

I don't remember seeing Alison Lohman before or after this movie, but she is perfect in this role. Cute and unassuming but gets stronger as the movie goes on. She takes a lot of abuse, mostly gross stuff happening to her. One of my favourite horror movies of the last 10 years!"

","OK, so I love horror movies. Good ones, bad ones, all of them, but I have to say that this movie was completely and totally crap. If anything, the movie should have been marketed as a comedy, and it would have at least been half way decent. Any movie that has a talking demon goat, I don't care what anybody says, there is nothing scary about that. Plus, who has an anvil hanging from the ceiling in their garage that is conveniently there when the dead gypsy witch reappears? The basic plot line of the movie was good, and it had every potential to be a good movie, but it fell very short of the mark. The best actor in the whole movie was the dead gypsy woman, she at least showed passion of some kind, whether it was evil or not. Everybody else stared off into space with a blank look on their faces, occasionally whimpering they were scared. There were some visually pleasing moments of the movie that were slightly unnerving, but nothing that could have been classified as true horror. It only had a slight shock factor to it. I would only recommend seeing it to see some of the more amusing factors of the movie, but if you're looking for a good horror movie, stay away from this one, because it's frighteningly bad."
"Frankensam","5","28","62","18 June 2009"," The only strong emotion I got out of this film was utter embarrassment
","Most of the reviews I have seen for this so far have been very positive, and I enjoyed the Evil Dead films, so I was looking forward to this film as a step above most horror films that are released. However, as with other horror female leads (the American versions of The Ring and The Grudge more specifically) Alison Lohman played most of this film with a slightly vacant look of mild surprise on her face, barely interacting with the other transparent characters, the bitch mother-in-law, the smarmy but nice boyfriend. <br/><br/>The brunt of the scares seem to come from just how many disgusting things the clichéd gypsy woman can pour in to the lead's mouth from her own, and the usual flapping curtains and swarming insects. I do realise this film is meant to be somewhat tongue in cheek, but I cannot accept that making a mediocre film is OK as long as it's almost comical enough to be watchable."

But we all remember he got his start with the schlocky ""Evil Dead"" comedy/horror movies. ""Drag me to Hell"" is in that vein, but it doesn't work.<br/><br/>Oh, mind you, the production values are much better. Even the acting is a bit better. But are they as much fun? Not really.<br/><br/>First, we have him doing to Alison Lohman what he normally used to do to Bruce Campbell. Sorry, comic/horror violence is just not as funny when the victim is a woman. And certainly not when she meets a gruesome end at the film's conclusion. So this somewhat likable girl is put through a ringer for the whole movie with no real redemption, no prevailing over evil.<br/><br/>The supporting cast is totally unlikable, especially Justin Long as her castrati boyfriend. Some of the scenes were just there for comic effect. She just HAPPENED to have an anvil hanging from a rope that she could drop on the head of the Gypsy Zombie Apparition? Who's her interior decorator, Wile E. Coyote?"

","In ""Drag Me to Hell,"" Our Heroine Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) has it all: a good job, a great boyfriend - Clay (Justin Long), and a bright future ahead of her. But in three days, she's going to lose it all. Why, you ask? Is it because she got fired from her job as a loan officer? Did her boyfriend Clay cheat on her, because his rich parents think she's a poor little country girl and he's too good for her? Did things in her bright young life suddenly take such a big turn for the worst that there's no way back?<br/><br/>You might say so. (Sounds like some Lifetime drama, doesn't it?) Things have taken a sudden turn for the worst in Christine Brown's life, all right. In three days, she's going to Hell, that eternal place of damnation, fire, and brimstone that all those fancy, big-name religions keep talking about.<br/><br/>""That guy,"" ""Evil Dead trilogy"" director Sam Raimi, returns to his horror roots triumphant with ""Drag Me to Hell,"" which he has co-written with brother Ivan. Of course, he's come a long way since ""The Evil Dead"" (1982) and its sequels (1987's superior sequel ""Evil Dead II"" is my personal favorite of the three); he's spent the last half-decade adapting Marvel Comics' flagship character (and my personal favorite superhero) Spider-Man to the big screen - ""Spider-Man 2"" (2004) is my personal favorite superhero film of all time, and is also my #2 favorite film of all time. (Just for the record, though, ""The Evil Dead"" scared the living sh** out of me!!!)<br/><br/>If you know Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" movies like you know your own face, then ""Drag Me to Hell"" will be a never-ending delight. It contains much of Raimi's classic manic, frantic horror movie style: frantic pacing, frantic, shaky camera-work, outlandish sights & sounds, fountains and fountains of undead goop and bile, and outlandishly dark humor. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a brilliant hark back to simpler times for Raimi and company. (He's also put some of his horror trademarks to work - quite successfully, I might add - in the ""Spider-Man"" movies.)<br/><br/>Raimi also loves to torture his lead characters, many times in the most outlandishly (I'm sure using that word a lot here) over-the-top and comical ways imaginable. In the ""Evil Dead"" movies, it was Bruce Campbell as the horror genre's supreme demon-slayer, Ash; in the ""Spider-Man"" movies, it was Tobey Maguire as Peter Parker/Spider-Man. Here, it's Lohman's Christine Brown.<br/><br/>As a loan officer with a loving boyfriend and a promotion to assistant manager being dangled in front of her by her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) and the office kiss-a** - Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee) - also vying for the same position, Alison seems to be at a crossroads in her life. So when an old woman, dear old Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) appears at her desk pleading for an extension to try to pay off her mortgage, Christine suddenly gets a cold heart and denies her request.<br/><br/>That was not a good idea, because dear old Mrs. Ganush is also a Gypsy with an army of soul-stealing, soul-hungry demons at her disposal. So a Gypsy curse is placed on Christine so that in three days, after three days and nights of non-stop demonic torment, the Dark One will come to claim her soul and drag her to the demonic underworld for all eternity. Clay scoffs at the idea of demons in the real world, but psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) confirms that demonic forces are conspiring to take her soul after three ""hellish"" days.<br/><br/>""Drag Me to Hell"" is living, breathing proof that Raimi has not lost his touch to deliver spine-tingling chills and over-the-top dark humor. He gives us some pretty good scares in this one, constantly changing up the pace to keep us on the edge of our seats. When we think that the latest demonic attack has finally ceased, when everything has gotten quiet, he lets us have it again with another good fright. He even takes time out from the horror to remind us of some real-life horrors, which is our current mortgage crisis (could dear old Mrs. Ganush be our in-theater vocalizing of our pain and suffering in these hard economic times?).<br/><br/>Most of Christine's demonic attacks occur in both total darkness and broad daylight. Everyday items come to scare the living daylights out of us as well: cell phones, handkerchiefs, and a fly (yes, a fly!) provides us with one of the film's most unsettling frights. There's also lots of undead goop, spit, and bile that reminds us that ""PG-13"" ratings for horror films still mean something; watch out for that nose bleed!!! And late in the film, Raimi makes a deliberate, jump-for-joy reference to any of the numerous scenes of demonic possession from any of his ""Evil Dead"" movies. Lastly, true to Raimi's style as a director here, just when we think the frights are over and everyone is about to live happily ever after, he sucker-punches us in the gut with a rather bleak ending that truly proves he hasn't lost his touch in delivering the goods.<br/><br/>""Drag Me to Hell"" is the most fun I've had at the movies this year. Jacked-up ticket prices have caused me to miss out on a lot of good fun at the movies so far this year. But ""Drag Me to Hell"" is the first movie I've seen this year that I've really felt deserved my $8.25. Even though Halloween is not yet upon us, ""Drag Me to Hell"" has instantly become one of my most cherished horror flicks, from one of the genre's premiere talents - Sam Raimi, who has successfully returned to the genre that brought him to fame (or infamy).<br/><br/>He has truly scared the hell out of us this time, which few filmmakers in recent years have succeeded in doing.<br/><br/>10/10"

","There's nothing original about this movie. This exact story has been done many times now and ""Drag Me"" does nothing to expand upon it; it is purely derivative. Like virtually all PG-13 ""horror"" films, it also mistakes startling people with actually scaring them. The story elements that could be frightening are depicted with such tastelessness that they end up being cartoonish. The jump scenes this film depends on are all anticipated by as much as a full-minute of lead-up, at which point they are just self-indulgent and irritating. Truly the worst thing about this awful movie is the soundtrack. I can only imagine the conversation that lead to it, but it probably involved the creators admitting that the film was not frightening and in an attempt to compensate, they made every little thing as loud as possible to squeeze every last ounce out of each jump scene. This of course only makes the movie at times unbearable to sit though, and considering how trite the story is, I can safely say that it's not worth the headache. The only thing about this movie worth applauding is Justin Long's performance; he is very good and continues to show a lot of promise."

As a life-long horror fan, I would expect far more than this from a horror film. The ""scares"" used were the simple, cliché, and overused methods that should have been thrown out with yesterday's garbage. There is only so many times that you can try to ""shock"" a person before it completely loses its effect. Unfortunately, Drag Me to Hell used loud, banging noises and quick cuts ad infinitum through out the entire length of the movie, utilizing it as a crutch. Some will say it's a ""tongue-in-cheek"" affair, but it fails miserably at trying to be this as well. I really don't understand how gross-out scenes amount to ""humor"", as it lacks any thought or subtlety that good humor has. There were very few funny scenes in the movie, and the ones that were present were drawn out long past the punch-line. Some would call Raimi ""bold"" for not ending a scene where others would, I would say he lacks the ability to understand timing and how to effectively run a joke. He can run a joke, but unfortunately he runs it into the ground. Another problem I have with this movie is that Raimi treads old ground. The entire movie seemed like a call-out to the Evil Dead series. Some would say that's the point, I would say it's beating a dead horse. He lacks any kind of innovation with this movie, and one is left with a sense of ""been there, done that"". The entire movie seemed incredibly pointless considering that one could get the same basic movie, only far better, from watching Evil Dead. However, all of these could be forgiven. Unfortunately, Raimi makes the one major mistake that any movie should not make: Inconsistent pacing and tone. It seems as though that Raimi couldn't decide if he wanted this to be a ""serious"" movie, or a tongue-in-cheek slapstick movie. You truly can't mix the two, as it completely removes you from the tone of the movie when you switch from a ""serious"" horror movie to a ""funny"" horror movie, and then towards the end decide to be ""serious"". It removed me completely from the movie, and failed completely to draw me into the world. <br/><br/>Other problems are present to, from unlikeable characters, to idiotic plot holes, to terrible acting, to bad dialogue, and many, many more. Giving this movie a 2 is a favor on my part, as I honestly find very little that is likable about it."

","I just got back from viewing this movie at my local theater. I never like to walk out on a movie but this tempted me so many times. I stayed until the end just so I could have the right to blast it on this site. THIS WAS THE WORST MOVIE EVER MADE! It has horrible acting, horrible effects, a horrible plot, and was a horrible story. In the theater many people broke out in laughter, if they had marketed this movie as a comedy I may have enjoyed it more. It is reminiscent of a guitar player that thinks he is the king of the world but can't play a simple song without screwing up. Its painful to watch them show a movie that just constantly fails to produce any enjoyment or fright despite countless attempts to do so. Nothing in the story made sense and the ""scary"" parts may have scared a 5 year old in the eighties who had never seen a movie before in his life. Just think crappy computer graphics and a writer that must have been comatose while writing the movie. I cannot give specific examples of why this was so terrible with saying any spoilers and it would be hard to even think of this movie ever again, I'm posting this because I went to see it because it got positive reviews online and after hitting submit I hope never to think of this movie again. I caution whoever thinks he/she wants to see this movie to please avoid it at all costs, if you see it you will want to sue the director for the hour and a half of your life that you can not get back."

But I was left very disappointed.<br/><br/>After watching it, I could not get over the fact of how bad it was. Although I knew there was a comedy element to the film, I do not feel it was applied in the right way - to me, it was just very strange with some cheap, 1980s style horror movie effects.<br/><br/>I kept thinking throughout the film that it would get better, it had to, it couldn't get any worse! But it didn't, and I just did not get how this film received good feedback?!<br/><br/>There was one scene that made me laugh though, it featured a goat, but that too was quite strange but rather funny. So I would recommend, if your still determined to go and see it, skip the majority of the movie and just watch the goat towards the end."

","This movie needs a new category: Horror, Thriller, Comedy. There is so many over-the-top scenes in this I could not stop laughing. Early in the movie this vile, filthy, disgusting old beach from hell shows up at the bank for another extension on her defaulted loan. Was unable to count how many colors of slime were coming out of her mouth, nose and ears. On top of that, her fingernails looked like solid fungus matter! The young lady turns her down and the old hag curses her and I think even her glass eye became lit up. So, this old fossil from the lower rungs of hell hides in the girl's car and attacks her when she's going home. This fight scene alone won me over for the whole movie. Old hag is choking the girl from the back seat and the girl guns the car then hits another car and the momentum throws the old beach from the back seat into the front, hitting the dashboard and knocking her rotten slimy false teeth out. The girl jams a ruler into her throat and the bag chokes on it SO HARD it is ejected and goes clean through the driver side window! Are you shatting me? After the rotten bag from walmart hell dies, her ghost appears physically in the girl's shed and again is choking her and the girl cuts a rope holding an anvil up above about 12 feet. The anvil comes down and squashes the hag's head off and the eyeballs pop out hitting the girl in the face. What more could you ask for in horror comedy? Have only scratched the surface here. This is well produced and has many surprises. Very entertaining."
"psychotic_d","1","22","49","2 June 2009"," Dragged Me Through Hell
","Sam Raimi's earlier Evil Dead film(s) are known for being Comedic Horror (at it's best, in my opinion). His Spiderman films started off pretty good (although a little crazy on the CGI), but got boring. So with Drag Me To Hell, he's taking another shot at Horror. A shot that missed completely. <br/><br/>I don't know what his intentions were with this film entirely, but it seemed to me like it was trying to take itself seriously as a horror/thriller, but had quite a bit of comedic undertone that came off as a back-up plan in case it didn't end up as horrific as he had hoped. Maybe he didn't know what he wanted out of this film. Regardless, the confusion is clear.<br/><br/>The plot is there, but nothing you really need to think about. There are no real twists and turns, save for one that was totally predictable along with all the ""jumpy"" parts. The whole idea that this gypsy put a curse on this girl, as well as a young boy in the beginning is uninteresting as well. When an elderly gypsy woman puts a curse on someone, I'd be more interested in an in-depth tale of revenge rather than a stolen necklace and being denied another mortgage loan by a girl who's just doing her job.<br/><br/>And the handkerchief creature of doom? That screeches as she steps on it? You've got to be kidding me. If you're going to do that kind of stuff, you shouldn't take ANY of the movie seriously. That would make an entertaining Horror film! But reviews I've read go on about how ""horror has finally returned"" and even Sam Raimi talked about how working on Evil Dead was a nightmare as he was constantly covered in fake blood and puss. Then don't make horror movies, you big baby! That kind of stuff is the BEST part of working on a horror movie! Now look at you, hiding behind the computer relying on CGI to please the retard movie-goers of today.<br/><br/>I will also add that the actress did a horrible job. Although she would have done it perfectly, had the director gone gung-ho Comedic Horror like he should have. If you're going to say that it was totally not meant to be taken seriously, I repeat how many reviews I've read raving about how ""horror has returned"", and I would also like to point out how no one in the theatre was laughing appropriately, save for those who were laughing along with me at how bad it was. <br/><br/>I knew within the first 30 minutes that I hated this movie. I felt like I was being dragged through the scenes as the girl was being haunted for 3 days, knowing everything that was going to happen, and waiting impatiently for the unsatisfying events to occur.<br/><br/>Worst. Movie. Ever."
"davebest2001","5","20","44","3 June 2009"," A bit disappointed. Not the classic I was given to believe
","I just came out of the cinema after seeing ""Drag Me To Hell"". I feel a bit cheated. I was given to believe that this was a return to horror form for Raimi. Well I am afraid that my opinion of it is that it is by no means a classic. Unfortunately Mr Raimi has been watching too much Buffy and Charmed. When Raimi made the original ""Evil Dead"", there was no comedy in it. This all changed with ""Evil Dead 2"" and ""Army Of Darkness"". Although a lot of people liked the sequels, I thought that the comedy ruined them. With ""Drag Me To Hell"", Raimi has combined the comedy of the Evil Dead 2 and 3 with the glamorous teens of Buffy and Charmed. What you end up with is something that is not quite right for true horror aficionados. I'm sorry but Mr Raimi needs to get a lot nastier for me to consider him back to his best. Mrs Ganush the gypsy is scary to look at but her image is used far too much in the film. The film could have used more demons/monsters. Whilst this film will be a hit, I don't consider Raimi to have created his new horror masterpiece yet."

"dragons1211","10","12","24","27 May 2009"," A good film!
","I have just saw this film and i was pleasantly surprised. I usually don't get scared over films but this one made me jump a few times. You know that something jumpy is going to happen but you don't know when, you always have to be on your guard because throughout the film there is a lot of jumpy moments and sometimes they have relaxing moments which calms you down then something scary happens which scares you more then all the other times if that makes sense. It doesn't rely on blood and guts to deliver the scares The effects aren't the best but they do the job and the acting is good. When something happens to her or she knows something is going to happen she doesn't go screaming the place down. There are also funny moments. The director made it so you know you shouldn't laugh but you have to. Like when the anvil drops in the old ladies head and her eyeballs pop out that was funny and when she went around saying here ""kitty kitty"" knowing that she was going to kill her kitty. She dies in the end which was a bit predictable but if she never got dragged to hell she would of got hit by a train anyway. She is a character in which you feel for and want her to survive. If you are looking for a horror film that delivers a lot of scares without using blood and gore with humour then this is the film for you!"
"Red-Barracuda","8","14","29","2 June 2009"," Raimi goes back to basics
","Drag Me To Hell is a welcome return to the inventive horror movie for director Sam Raimi. Even though quite a bit of his trademark style can be seen in the Spider-Man franchise, those films are so big and effects-driven that his voice is diluted. The lower-budget Drag Me To Hell is a much more personal movie. And as such contains a lot more of the things that made Raimi the tour-de-force, quirky and energetic director of the Evil Dead series.<br/><br/>The story is basically about a bank worker who is cursed by an old gypsy woman for not extending her loan. Enter all manner of scary occult events.<br/><br/>The story-line is pretty forgettable but it serves as a good framework for Raimi to bombard us with inventive scare scenes. As is typical, he mixes the horror with knockabout humour, and proves once again that he is one of the very few directors who is adept at mixing comedy with genuine scares. It's not an easy thing to pull off. If the balance isn't just right the horror will be diluted or the comedy will be out-of-place. Raimi though is a master at this and time and again mixes these two contrasting film genres extremely well. Happily, when the film focuses on the horror, it really is scary; the scene in the underground car-park being a standout scene. Mrs Ganush makes for a terrifying villain and her attack on the heroine in the confines of her car is a pure horror moment. When Mrs Ganush's false teeth fall out and she resorts to sucking her victim's face, we are in pure Sam Raimi territory; simultaneously terrifying but laced with a demented humour. This really sums up the film in general.<br/><br/>Acting performances are all good and the script is solid. There were a couple of references to Raimi's past work on Evil Dead – the idea that the hero and heroine were planning to go on a break to a cabin in the woods and the recurring appearance of the battered Oldsmobile. Sam Raimi is clearly having fun on this movie – I'm not sure that the same thing could be said in the case of Spider-Man 3 – and when he's having fun, the audience is in for a good ride. This may not be Raimi's best film but it certainly is his most satisfying in a while."

","Woehaa, this was a flash back in time when I hired VHS tapes from the local video store with totally unknown, strange, low budget horror movies. Everything you could see in those movies comes back in this one ... the tilting filming at critical moments (yep also used in Evil Dead! The mother of all horror movies for me), the meat maggots, the whirling autumn leaves, the plopping eyes, puking a dead cat, the arm penetrating a mouth.... etc.<br/><br/>Some scenes are just slapstick material: the scene in the car where old Mrs. Ganush loses her false teeth and then lies drooling on the lower jaw of Christine ... magnificent. Death Mrs.Ganush tumbling out of her coffin in such a way that the putrid drool runs over Christine's her face and she starts gagging ... masterful. The fly that causes a terrible nosebleed ... irresistible.<br/><br/>Yes, I've seen it all before ... all the scary moments are used a zillion times before ... the ending was so predictable ... But nowadays a real horror/scary movie (small nuance) are sparse. It's always some found footage film and paranormal nonsense. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a fresh wind in horror-land and a guarantee for a raunchy evening of shuddering and chuckling.<br/><br/>I really had to laugh when Rham Jas proposes to make an animal sacrifice after which Christine starts protesting in a bewildered way, saying : ""I'm a vegetarian ...

","I must admit I was categorically disappointed in Raimi's efforts herein. I have seldom walked out of a movie, but we left this about 45 minutes into it because it never got GOOD. All the best parts were in the trailers, and the effects were laughable. You can see wires, ill-timed stunts, and have your gag reflex triggered for free, so there's no reason to pay good money to see this. Our theater offered us rain-checks, which we gratefully accepted.<br/><br/>I will say that the story is quite compelling, and if it is released on DVD in an extended R version I may give it another chance, because hopefully, they will clean up the final proof and make this something WORTH seeing. Honestly, though, I'm not sure that's even possible, as the acting was as bad as (if not worse than) the effects. I'm not sure an extended R version would actually save this.<br/><br/>All in all?

","Alright, I'm a horror fan. Not just a casual horror fan, but more of a horror fanatic. Not just your average fanatic, really a connoisseur of horror. I remember my first viewings of Evil Dead, Evil Dead 2 and Army of Darkness. That was nearly sixteen years ago for Army and even longer for the others. I was a fan, but in the genre of horror, I really didn't think those stood the test of time. Overrated films, but still light years away from that Hollywood crap and Hollywood remakes of classics and foreign masterpieces. Either way, I was both excited and apprehensive when it came to Drag Me To Hell. There are many things in horror that you learn to overlook; such as continuity and acting. Yes, both fall short in this film. The continuity is actually dreadful in some scenes, but in the big picture, those can be forgivable. Perhaps the biggest problem with this film is, dare I say it, the direction. The writing surely didn't help either. A few jumpy scares and a decent premise, but that's not enough to save this film. It's worth a viewing for a horror fan, but please don't praise it like the rest of these casuals and fools. This film is NOT a classic and is NOT a great horror film. Hell, it's not even really a good horror film. Raimi did not save the horror genre in Hollywood, it's far beyond saving.

She takes the woman's case to her boss but he leaves it up to her to decide what to do she decides to take the tough decision and refuses the old woman's request.

We have a fly continuing to buzz after she swallows it, a high pressure nose bleed and a possessed goat to give just three examples. Director Sam Raimi does a good job and I liked the fact that the majority of the effects appeared to be physical rather than CGI. Alison Lohman does a solid enough job in the lead role; making us believe that her character believes in the strange things that are happening to her. The only real weak point of the film is the ending; it is just a little too cliché.

","In one of the best horror films of the year so far, Sam Raimi makes a beast of a comeback in the genre.<br/><br/>The lack of constant darkness and gore is a welcome detour from the mainstream of horror films that literally plague the scene, year after year. The only negative thing one might say is that the cheap buildup of suspense right before a scare is predictable, but hey, you're watching a horror film.<br/><br/>The acting is solid, with characters the viewer can identify, and some very pleasant stereotype-breakers (a funny boss, an honest boyfriend..). The direction is excellent, and Raimi doesn't hold back in grossing us out before letting us take a breath with a sarcastic bit.<br/><br/>However, what really makes the film shine is its allegory to eating disorders. The vivid imagery and action make for an excellent delivery of an impressive commentary at a group of medical conditions that are turning increasingly common."

"bryanmolinelli","4","17","38","31 May 2009"," Drag Me to Hell - A Bit of a Drag
","After all the hype surrounding this film, I was expecting a good old-fashioned reel of celluloid madness in the '80s horror tradition, and instead I got a contemporary cop-out. I remember when I first saw Sam Raimi's Evil Dead flicks. The trilogy is an exercise in camp, which is acceptable on the grounds that none of those pictures were intended to truly be horror movies. Bruce Campbell's comical turn as Ash Williams,a hapless defender against satanic zombies that somehow infest a backwoods cabin, is entertaining and even inspiring (plenty of E.D. knock-offs ensued) but far from horrifying, and minimally suspenseful. Back then, the aim was to cheese, and to cheese with a marked lack of substance so self-indulgent that eventually, two decades later, cinephiles would come around to the simple genius of Raimi's grime & slime vision.<br/><br/>It was on the foundation of Raimi's subsequent directorial works, combined with the slew of positive reviews surrounding Drag Me to Hell, that I walked into this flick expecting real scares. After all, Raimi is capable of fine craftsmanship - A Simple Plan was probably the most underrated film of the '90s, just ahead of Renny Harlin's The Long Kiss Goodnight. But Drag Me to Hell pales in comparison to both those pictures. Somewhere along the way (I suspect while making Spiderman) someone convinced Raimi that CGI special effects were a suitable replacement for, well, actually filming something.<br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell suffers very early on from the sort of CGI baloney so commonly seen in PG-13 ""horror"" flicks these days. An opening scene where an unimportant character is quite literally dragged to hell losses all impact for one reason and one reason only: we're allowed to see it. This fatal error, based it seems on the cinematic canard that seeing is believing, carries itself through the entire film. Which is a shame, because this movie seemed to have potential for real, down-to-earth horror elements. Alison Lohman as the ordinary, petite blond Christine Brown turns down the disgusting Mrs. Ganush, played convincingly by Lorna Raver, and sends the hag away without a third extension on her mortgage payments. From there I hoped events would crescendo to real horror proportions. They didn't.<br/><br/>Instead Raimi somehow meshes visually unconvincing CGI with actual film footage (see the scene in the parking garage) and lets Mrs. Ganush reappear in those sporadic flashes we've all come to expect from movies that rely on the audience's jumpiness when there's a deficit of actual thrills. When all the ""gotcha"" moments pass, all that's left are a handful of painfully mediocre scenes between Lohman and her boyfriend Clay, played unimaginatively by Justin Long. Throw in an over-cooked seance, which is probably the only part of the movie that directly hearkens back to The Evil Dead - you'll see why - and all that's left is the promise of more poorly-conceived CGI effects, and Justin Long placating Lohman's redundantly terrified, two-dimensional character.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is rated PG-13, and although there are times when that rating is stamped on an R movie for marketing purposes, this isn't one of them. Consider the rating a warning. Raimi might have been better served to study another film from the '80s, one that eschews the usual demon formula for an eerie old woman. It's called The Woman in Black. It doesn't have a single frame of CGI. And frankly, it's 100 times scarier than Drag Me to Hell."

","This garbage is considered to be a masterpiece??? Why does this have 90 percent on rotten tomatoes. I don't understand the positive reviews and praise? This movie was terrible disgusting schlock. Also, a complete rip-off of Stephen King's Thinner which also a shitty movie. <br/><br/>This was supposed to be a horror comedy? First of all this movie is neither scary or funny. They might as well called this jump scare the movie. Take a drink every time there a loud jump scare scene. There's an unnecessary scene where the main character stabs and kills her cat. She got what she deserved when she was dragged to hell at the end. Good riddance!<br/><br/>The acting is horrible and dry. Alison Lohman is an awful actress. No wonder her acting career ended after she did this movie. Her line delivery is horrid. You never believe anything coming out of her mouth especially when she tries to act angry or swears. She sounds like she's reading off cue cards. She also lacks reaction to anything crazy going on around her. She pretty much ruined this movie for me with her bland emotionless performance. She had that same stupid blank worried face the entire movie. I just wanted to punch her in the face! I was rooting for the gypsy woman to kill her!<br/><br/>Justin Long and Alison Lohman have zero chemistry and make for boring leads. I felt like they were both miscast. Justin Long felt outta place in this movie. He looked like belonged on set of Two and a Half Men with Charlie Sheen and Jon Cryer. He pretty much phoned in his performance as he slept walked all his scenes. The gypsy came off more hilarious than scary. Every scene with her was a joke!<br/><br/>This movie is way over the top and just plain old disgusting. They're replacing suspense and horror with blood, guts, and potty humor. This movie basically Alison Lohman getting attack absurdly and nastily every 5 minutes. This movie is full of gross. Burping up a fly, dentures flying out of mouths, old lady sucking on people's chins, vomiting bugs and maggots in somebody's mouth, bloody nose squirting blood everywhere, shoving arms don people's throats, possessed talking goat spouting profanities, spooky flying handkerchief's. None of this is scary or funny. Just childish, cheesy and stupid.<br/><br/>If this wasn't made by Sam Raimi it would have gotten negative reviews and trashed by fans and critics. This movie sucked! Forgettable characters you don't care about, not scary, not funny, bad acting, dull plot, repetitive fake out scenes, gross out humor, lack of a musical score. It's is one of the most overrated horror films in the last couple of years. <br/><br/>Sorry fans, this crap has nothing the on Evil Dead films. Those films were classics. This garbage is forgotten tripe."

","Where do I begin, let's start with the cast: Justin Long, now I usually like him I though he was great in die hard but taking him seriously as a doctor in my opinion was a bad choice. Now he has some funny lines but him playing a doctor is like Al Pacino playing the terminator, it wouldn't work (though would be amusing).<br/><br/>OK now Alison Lohman is such a bad actress it hurts, it makes me feel sorry for her - really, why did you pick her for this movie? SPOILER HERE: Now, I genuinely thought this movie was a joke; I actually thought the people who put the great ""scary as hell"" type reviews on it were all in on a big joke because it was halariouse. It absolutely could pass as a comedy and I really am serious, think about it, the funny fights, 1980's graphics, the gunge coming out the womans mouth and halarous funeral scene, the cat that was clearly a teddy being tossed in a ditch, the rubbish acting - need I go any further?"
"eytand94","10","9","18","3 October 2009"," Getting Dragged To Hell Was Never This Much Fun!
","Known to many for making the block-buster ""Spiderman"" series, Sam Raimi began in his career in 1981 with a wonderful little gem called ""The Evil Dead."" The 1981 horror classic featured everything a good horror movie is supposed to be: scary, gory, at times weirdly funny, and entertaining. When I saw ""The Evil Dead,"" I wondered if Raimi would ever return to horror again. 2009's ""Drag Me To Hell"" is the answer that was given. Raimi has finally gotten a chance to leave the ""Spiderman"" franchise and actually do something that old fans would remember him by. There's only three words to describe ""Drag Me To Hell"" and those words are: A PERFECT MOVIE! <br/><br/>Alison Lohman stars as Christine Brown, a woman who is living a happy life with her boyfriend Clay, and she has a great job at the bank. But when an old gypsy woman, Sylvia Ganush, comes to Christine, begging for another extension on her mortgage payment, Christine is faced with a challenging decision. Will she impress her boss and win the assistant manager position or will she help Mrs. Ganush out and never be able to make tough decisions? Christine goes for the first choice. Bad mistake, because Mrs. Ganush puts a curse on Christine. It is the curse of the Lamia, a furious demon that tortures its victims for three days until it finally drags you to hell to burn for eternity. Can Christine be able to find a way to stop the curse before it's too late? <br/><br/>Despite its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a superior horror film with nonstop scares, gratuitous gross-out moments, a very dark sense of humor, and it's fun to watch. Raimi doesn't just put Christine through hell, but he does it with the audience too. I was jumping in my seat so many times, talking to the screen, and I actually felt my adrenaline pumping, stuff that hasn't happened to me in a long time in a horror movie. It makes you remember classic horror film rules: If a disgusting gypsy woman with bad dentures, a blind eye, leper fingernails and endless phlegm coming out of her mouth needs your help, you don't ignore her. You help that woman out!<br/><br/>There are plenty of slashers and haunted house movies, but there aren't so many people getting cursed. Raimi's horrific story is just a little bit formulaic, but he takes it and makes it his own. Gypsy curses have never been this violent or scary.<br/><br/>The cast obviously had a good time making the movie because their performances are awesome. I really enjoyed watching Alison Lohman play Christine. I haven't watched a lot of her movies, but this one shows that she's very underrated and deserves bigger roles. Great job, Lohman! Justin Long has starred in another very popular horror movie called ""Jeepers Creepers."" He is also very good here as Christine's boyfriend Clay, the dude who is always telling her that everything is okay and nothing is coming for her. Hah! Welcome back to horror, Mr. Long. David Paymer is very funny as Christine's boss. Dileep Rao makes a very good psychic as Rham Jas. And Lorna Raver shines as Ganush. Raimi has created the most disgusting gypsy ever.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi directs ""Drag Me To Hell"" with such energy and love for the genre. This is the guy who obviously always loved horror movies. He never holds back on scares and gross-outs. And the effects here are remarkable. Thank God Raimi has returned to horror.<br/><br/>Peter Travers has called ""Drag Me To Hell"" ""horror movie heaven,"" which it very well is. You'll completely forget that it's rated PG-13 and you'll have a fantastic time jumping in your seat, screaming, and laughing. ""Drag Me To Hell"" stands as one of 2009's best horror movies in line with ""My Bloody Valentine 3D,"" ""The Last House on the Left"" and ""Friday the 13th."" Now, let's see what ""Sorority Row"" and ""Jennifer's Body"" can do."
"cnj8283","1","9","18","21 June 2009"," drag me to hell...please
","Drag me to hell.....<br/><br/>YES PLEASE to put me out of my misery. The opening scene was OK this could be good like ""The GRUDGE"", boy was I wrong... The next awful scene was the fight between the main character and this old lady who looks like she had been living under a rock for a year looks like it could have come from ""Scary Movie"". HOW the hell anyone could rate this movie higher than one must have been completely stoned like the creators when they wrote it. Not to mention they must have something against the culture in this movie because it was not portrayed nicely. The plot was awful... lady gets heated because she doesn't get an extension on her loan. She waits for bank lady to leave and hides in the car waiting for her to get in.... ""Scary Movie"" like fight happens which ends in bank lady's button getting ripped off her coat and cursed and thrown back at her. some boring stuff happens. Bank lady tries to fight her curse by killing her kitten. Bank lady freaks out because curse is still following her. End of movie kind of romantic and then bank lady falls on to train tracks where she was pulled down into the depths off hell because she failed at getting rid of curse/ daemon.<br/><br/>Come on now give me a minute and I will think of something better that will at least make people not want to gouge their eyes out with their buttered popcorn. Poor old film makers are rolling in their graves and when the creators least expect they will be pulled to their death into the depths of hell.... Hey, that would make a good sequel. I would have rather stayed home and watched my roommate pick his nose for two hours than pay to see this movie. I want my money back. I have seen some bad movies but this one I think should rank one. I wonder what the creators had to do to convince the actors that this movie was worth adding to their resume."
"rooticon","1","9","18","20 June 2009"," Seriously, how did this movie make it to the theaters?
","How did this movie make it to the actual theaters? This movie should have definitely been put in a B-rated movie theater or no theater at all for that matter. This was the most retarded movie I have ever seen. The special effects were absolutely HORRIBLE which made it seem like a B-rated horror movie itself and the plot was on/off of an interest level. I laughed so hard watching this movie because of how stupid it was. Why did you people on here give this movie such great ratings and reviews? You all must be high on crack or something because this was so retarded that a 2-year old would of thought so. Especially at the end where the main character falls onto the train tracks below and her boyfriend is standing above her on the boarding platform and out of ALL THE THINGS YOU COULD POSSIBLY SAY, he screams, ""HEY! HEY YOU! YOU GET BACK HERE!"". I mean honestly, who says that to their girlfriend, fiancé, or future wife for that matter if they fell onto train tracks and a train is about to run them over at full speed? Seriously. That was the funniest part of this movie because it was so stupid. And the other part earlier on in the movie where the main character's boss gets blood all over his face, he makes the most retarded face and walks away ONLY saying ""DID I GET ANY IN MY MOUTH?!?!?"" I mean seriously, who says ""DID I GET ANY IN MY MOUTH?!?!?"" when someone shoots blood all over them. Wouldn't someone instead be like ""WHAT THE ****?!?!"" instead? That was also one of the stupidest parts of this movie. And the worst part is, I'll never get back the hour and a half in my life I spent watching this pile of crap you people call a ""great horror movie"". What a waste of $9.50. If you haven't yet seen this movie, then take my advice and don't. You'll be greatly disappointed for the amount of money you spent on a ticket, but you might have a good laugh while watching it if you do decide to go see it. I would just wait till this movie hits the $5 DVD bin at Wal-Mart and see it then."
"globalfreak-2","3","15","34","5 June 2009"," Why or why
","OK, so I wanted to give this film my wide-open mind, and in the end, it was terrible. Honestly, there was more laughter than ""OHHs"", and though Raimi is when known for such things, this movie is no where near the level of Evil Dead. It is rubbish - and Justin Long cannot act at all! The editing was poor and the plot laughable. Justin Long's character has literally no clue what is happening the whole movie - really? Also, the nonchalance by which the female star goes about her 'duties' is poorly executed. What is good in this film are the supporting cast members - that are better than the so-called 'stars'. Also, as my friend pointed out, there is much here about female vs. male, which isn't new for his films, but here lacks all subtlety."
"cinemaofdreams","3","15","34","3 June 2009"," Stupid as Hell
","Sam Raimi is a talented man but this outing was very disappointing. Mixing camp, ooze, and horror is a delicate balance which was nicely achieved with the Evil Dead series. Here, the characters are played too straight for camp which makes the ""scare tactic"" affects of the movie out of place since most of them do not deliver even a jolt. The evil characters don't seem to be enjoying themselves which may have lent some credibility to the film's campy aspirations. Otherwise, the scares needed to be better paced in order to lend some needed dread to the events. Also, there is a big difference between nauseating and terrifying. Sick effects are just that and here induce ennui after about the third time. The result being Argento meets Disney. About 15 minutes of the film gives a thrill, but it comes too late and is then dampened by a predictable ending. 3/10."
"Tabletop_Live","3","15","34","30 May 2009"," Wear Ear Plugs to this Movie
","Here's how to perfectly recreate Drag Me to Hell in your own home. You will need a drum set. Get a friend. Pick a quiet room and take turns sitting with your back to the drums. Have the other friend randomly smash the cymbals and drums every few minutes for an hour and a half. Startled much? Congratulations, you've just watched Drag me To Hell, or at least felt what it was like to sit through it.<br/><br/>For scares, that is quite literally all this movie has to offer. There is absolutely no subtlety to the horror. Instead of taking what could have been a movie with a rich lore and storyline, Sam Raimi chose to make Drag me To Hell into a ""jumpfest"" that relies on lots of overly loud music and sound effects. Sam, things that are loud are not scary - like jet engines - they are simply obnoxious. And for that matter, rusty gates that are creaking, and annoyed goats do not even have the capacity to be as loud as a jet engine. Did you know that, Sam? Apparently not.<br/><br/>Initially, the PG-13 rating was a red flag for me, but I thought, it's Sam Raimi doing another horror film. I should trust him. Perhaps it's more psychological than anything else. After all, it is about an evil spirit that terrorizes its victim for three days before it takes them to hell. What an opportunity for a smart horror film! Sadly, my trust was misplaced. This movie tries to get some of its scares from gore, but ultimately fails, because it's PG-13 Gore. It's pretty easy to watch and pick out the parts that should have been R, but were obviously toned down to keep a more summer friendly audience in the seats. Too bad, really. Most of the effects end up coming off as fake, and oddly enough, done with CG when they did not need to be. Like when Christine gets dead old lady gunk splattered on her face in the shed. How hard is it to just splatter someone in the face with what looks like dead old lady gunk? <br/><br/>Ultimately it all felt like a rehash of some old concepts from Sam's Bruce Campbell heyday(Christine wrestles with an evil handkerchief much like Ash wrestled with his evil hand). Unfortunately there is no Bruce Campbell to be found, and the handkerchief is done in CG(how hard is it to just hand someone a handkerchief and say, ""Wrestle!""). Like everything else in the movie, it just comes off as lame.<br/><br/>And in case you were wondering if the plot is a ripoff of Steven King's ""Thinner"" - yes. Yes it is."

Am I missing something here. A good movie with lots of suspense, sudden scares, and open endedness to the horrors that lurk within is called bad by everyone.

Ash(Bruce Campbell) made both these films come alive with an outstanding acting performance then another and so on! Quite frankly the lead female was as good as a TV presenter reading an autocue. Even the supporting cast didn't help move the film along with an appalling storyline. Badly written acted and filmed. Sam Raimi should be ashamed of himself for this rubbish! My advice to you is miss it.... go buy The Evil Dead, 2 and Army Of Darkness and enjoy what seams a forgotten art of film-making great costumes, design structure,acting, settings, scenes, monsters, character acting at its best! Bruce Campbell may well have delivered the cult hero Ash to generations and generations to come by setting the standard this film is sorely missing. Clean the toilet instead"

Waste of money, stay at home or watch something else. I wouldn't even rent this one. Will someone please destroy the negative so it can't be copied?

","He may have spent the best part of a decade making family-friendly super-hero blockbusters, but Sam Raimi clearly hasn't forgotten how to have fun whilst scaring an audience silly: Drag Me To Hell sees the director on top nerve-shredding form, his enthusiasm for the genre that first made his name seemingly stronger than ever, and his film-making skills honed to perfection.<br/><br/>Masterfully blending edge-of-your-seat tension with ghoulish comedy, Raimi's brilliantly inventive and witty script tells of Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), an ambitious bank employee who, against her better judgement, rejects an old woman's pleas for a loan extension and consequently becomes the victim of a nasty gypsy curse. With only three days before she is due to be dragged to hell by goat-headed demon Lamia, the terrified young woman desperately searches for a way to avoid her dreadful fate, enlisting the help of her sceptical but concerned boyfriend (Justin Long) and psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao).<br/><br/>Packed full of perfectly executed jump scares, disgusting gross-out visual gags (eyeball popping; mucous spewing; blood gushing; maggot vomiting: it's all there!), stunning camera-work, and effective CGI, and featuring a strong central performance from lovely leading lady Lohman, Drag Me To Hell is hugely entertaining from start to finish.<br/><br/>It goes to show that not all modern mainstream horror is bland, predictable, vacuous drivel—just most of it.<br/><br/>8.5 out of 10, rounded up to 9 for IMDb."

"TheFinalAlias","7","8","16","29 May 2009"," A fairly decent return to the genre, but don't believe the hype....
","While certainly making up for the horrible botch that was 'Spiderman 3', Sam Raimi's return to the genre really cannot compete with his earlier horror films; the 'Evil Dead' trilogy and arguably 'Darkman'. This is not however, for reasons you may think.<br/><br/>The most common complaint is that the film's PG-13 rating is what ruins it's impact, but this isn't necessarily true, as the rating's system seems to have treated Raimi fairly liberally in piling on the gore and guts. The flaws of the film simply come from shakiness on Raimi's part in returning to the genre which made him famous.<br/><br/>For one thing, the film relies too much on 'jump' sequences and 'buses' which kill suspense. Clearly, a film called 'Drag me to Hell' is not going to be a masterpiece of subtlety and what 'subtle horror' originator Val Lewton called 'The Power of Suggestion'(Sorry, 'Blair Witch' idiots, it was Lewton who beat your stupid movie to the punch by 5 decades by just suggesting the monster.), but it just makes the film weak when the big scares are finally packed on, and this is not because of ratings restraint; as the monsters and possession scenes are quite heavy-handed. It's just that they lose so much impact. To put it simply; the film just doesn't know when to stop when it should.<br/><br/>Speaking of Val Lewton, this film owes a considerable debt, plot-wise to a film made by his greatest pupil; Jacque Tourneur. The film in question is 'Night/Curse of the Demon'(1957), an adaption of an M.R. James story 'Casting the Runes'. This film even includes several homages to that film in a spectacular séance sequence, and even ends at a train station like the original. Anyone who has seen 'Curse' will find themselves all too familiar with the story, but, hey, it's better than a remake.<br/><br/>The film also succeeds at giving it's characters believable motivations and flaws that makes them seem genuine in spite of the occasionally weak dialog. Even the villain has believable motivations without becoming sympathetic. The film also looks great, eschewing the 'Se7en'-inspired look so overused in modern horror films. Raimi's trademark insane camera angles also create some memorable scenes, particularly when the heroine begins contemplating giving a cursed object to escape her curse by drumming her fingers in a manner similar to that of the Hag who cursed her; who is introduced drumming her fingers. As if she's becoming as bad as the hag was. Great symbolism. The acting is also good. Lead's Alison Lohman and Justin Long both have a befuddled look that makes it all the more believable. The Seer character's are also great.<br/><br/>The film also has a good amount of humor in it, if nothing on the scale of the 'Evil Dead' films, nothing laugh out loud funny, but wryly amusing in a gross-out sort-of-way. There's also a scene guaranteed to offend animal lovers everywhere. The final 'Confrontation' in a graveyard should delight every horror fan. And the ending, while predictable, is amazingly effective.<br/><br/>It may not be saying much, but this is easily one of the best horror films in a LOOOONG time. With Raimi back on track, the results for his future films(and for the genre) will certainly be worth seeing. Enjoy.~"

"unknown07","1","10","22","16 March 2010"," Drag this movie to the toilet and flush
","Is this the best story line Hollywood can come up with? A gypsy curse? Is that supposed to be original in some way? Why is it that gypsies always have the power to kill people and curse people to death but can't seem to pay their bills on time or go to the dentist? This movie made me realize that Sam Raimi is one of the worst directors of all time. He's made one half-decent movie, The Evil Dead. The other two in the Evil Dead series were totally stupid, with a couple of funny lines that caught on in the cult film world.<br/><br/>Evil Dead 3 was total garbage. People want to make the Evil Dead series more than what it is, which is just plain bad. Spiderman sucked as well.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to this piece of crap. So this gypsy lady with a very fake accent can't pay her bills, even though she has a clan of relatives who appear later on at her house having a party. Her false teeth fall out, but when she goes to put them back in, you can see the actress's REAL TEETH right before the cut. Then, after stealing a bowl of candy, she begs for a break on her loan even though she's already proved herself to be a deadbeat and an actress with a really terrible fake accent. So who's fault is that? The loan officer, of course. And she deserves to die for doing the right thing! And this is basically the outline for this horrible pathetic excuse for a horror movie.<br/><br/>Then, the Mexican lady wants a shot at the demon. She's been waiting to confront it for many many years. It's been her life long goal to confront the demon that is now after the loan officer. She will risk her life to get this demon, and wants to be paid 10,000 dollars to do it! What? If she wanted the demon so bad why not do it for free? <br/><br/>This sets up the totally stupid and done a thousand times holding hands around a table and then the floating dancing guy during comedic music (evil dead crap.) So that doesn't work and suddenly the Indian guy tells her to give the button to someone else. Why NOW? Why not when he first found out about the stupid button curse did he not reveal this tidbit of info and save a few lives in the process? And what happened during the nose bleed scene? When blood shoots 30 feet out someone's nose, coating the room and a few people in blood, do you call an ambulance or act like the person had a paper cut? Oh, let's not forget the constant shooting of various liquids into the loan officer's mouth. Constantly. THROUGHOUT THE WHOLE MOVIE! Plus the inserting of an arm and some eyeballs into her mouth as well. What kind of perverted weirdo directed this movie? <br/><br/>How does it end? Well, the loan officer, who is dating that ass-head 14 year old PROFESSOR who drives a PRIUS (the liberals got that right) gets dragged to hell after buying a new coat. Why did she need that coat so bad? I'm sick of thinking about this pile of crap. Do not watch."

","a laughable, predictable attempt at horror. we came across the movie with no knowledge of what it was about but the title gave us high expectations. to say we are disappointed is an understatement. the events were predictable and the horror was weak. there were too many cheap shock tactics trying to make the viewer jump. the story line was not a strong one to begin with. the actors were not up to the characters. the gore did not look remotely real considering technology available in this day and age. one member of our party took it upon themselves to hit the fast forward button on the remote many times to reduce the time we had to sit through the movie. we thought it was laughable and we seriously thought it was a parody. it would have been better served as a comedy/horror but it wasn't that funny either; but actually it could have been. <br/><br/>it was torture to watch this movie."

William Shatner shat on this very movie--and when Bill squats over something, you know it's sucking balls big time. In the name of civil disobedience, I'm sending this P.O.S. back to Netflix in two distinct pieces to hopefully give the next sucker who tries to rent this one a couple of extra days to actually read through the justifiably miserable reviews instead of just trusting the rating that is still about 6 stars too high. I wouldn't dishonor my toilet by flushing this monstrosity down it. I would much rather be violated in a federal prison by a gang of angry ex-truckstop queens than have to watch this again.

","Drag Me To Hell proves Sam Raimi needs to learn a few new gags as his horror formula has become all-too-predictable, ultimately falling flat on itself becoming a tired rehash of the director's former glories. Despite this failure, I'm sure we'll see a sequel that Raimi fans will lap up like hungry dogs thrown a few scraps of old meat.<br/><br/>Not that the film doesn't have a few cute moments but an older viewer will likely feel as if they've seen this all before. It's a real shame that Raimi chose to release this film as it tarnishes the golden works of days of yore. Younger fans would do better to spend the night downloading Raimi's earlier flicks for free on the internet."
"costamesahotguy","2","14","34","3 June 2009"," Trite, Dull, Predictable
","I'm astounded by the number of people proclaiming this film a masterpiece. It lacks suspense, engaging or fleshed out characters, pacing, or surprise. The entire film played out as expected by twenty minutes into it.<br/><br/>I began to be worried by the opening sequence. When literally anything can happen in a world created by a film, it's rarely very exciting or interesting when it does. It's much better to use a little more restraint so that when a large supernatural moment occurs, it really packs a punch. As it is, we're given everything here, including the kitchen sink, so the whole movie feels repetitive and uninspired. There seems to be no rules for all the things that occur--matter and objects acting on the film-maker's wishes, rather that acting in accordance with the world created by the story itself.<br/><br/>I guess I'm old school, but I find a film like ""Rosemary's Baby"" a million times more interesting than this juvenile drivel. Fantasy and dark fantasy are interesting genres, but they have to have emotional weight and multi-dimensional characters to make them worthwhile. As it is, this film is simply an exercise in style over substance designed to appeal to the junior set."
"barneybubbles89","3","14","34","1 June 2009"," What film has everyone been going to see? I don't get it?
","Seriously? I really don't see how any one could rate this film higher than a 3! <br/><br/>I was really looking forward to seeing this film, i didn't read the reviews, just the star ratings. On IMDb it was rated over 8, which i thought was pretty damn good for a horror movie. Then from the poster I seen Empire Magazine had given it four stars along with a bunch of other big reviewers! So i thought, this film must be good.<br/><br/>The day before i go to see it, a girl comes into work terrified, she almost crys as she tells me about it. So I'm now thinking, wow this film must be great. Im really looking forward to a good scare.<br/><br/>Basically get to the cinema. pay for my ticket, food etc. start to watch it. i jumped a few times at the start, even at the car fight scene, which BTW was like something out of Spiderman and didn't belong in a ""horror"" movie.<br/><br/>I quickly began to realise that this is not a ""horror"" movie, with all the comic violence, molesting corpses, cute kittens, etc. the only thing that seemed to tie it to the horror genre was the mono performance of the leading lady. Go to acting school there! Horror to me must be something completely different to what it is to everyone else? Halloween any one?<br/><br/>The real ""menacing"" parts i thought were nothing to do with visuals, but more of the sound and tension, like that time in her house! The less you see the more i think, and that is not the case in this film, with stupid effects, gags and acting.<br/><br/>So I'm guessing that this movie was rated soo high because it was made by the evil dead dudes? so it seems you can get away with making complete and utter rubbish, and have it praised, just because you made a few good films before! Im judging this film on not who made it, but what it was for me, and that was poop. There was nothing at all scary or creepy about this film, i slept fine after it, and i kindda zoned out of it as it was so not entertaining!<br/><br/>also what is scary about a talking goat? it was soo sad, it wasn't even funny!<br/><br/>the reason i gave it three stars was, 1. Justin long was like the only good actor in it, convincing at least. 2. it had a really cute kitten. 3.this star is for myself for dragging myself through hell and back, (basically wasting two hours of my life and wasting £10 for dung!)<br/><br/>avoid it!"

I can't tell you how disappointed I was, and you can be sure that I will never walk in to a movie again that has his name connected to it. There were a few moments at the beginning that inspired momentary dread, but by the middle of the movie, it was clear that those horror movie moments were simply much ado about nothing."
"choclovesallofyou","2","9","20","13 March 2010"," A perfect example of a sub-par script executed by exalted directors, a failure.
","To put it bluntly, this film's script is terrible. So terrible in fact, that I, someone who NEVER voices his opinion about anything on the internet, actually took the time to register on IMDb and voice my disappointment in this lacklustre film.<br/><br/>Since the inception of early horror films, there have always been excessively corny pieces of work. Bad horror films are as bountiful as snowflakes in the arctic circle, and much like snowflakes they are usually uniquely interesting in their own way. This film however was like a bad regurgitation of all the time-worn horror failures rolled up and packaged as a possible 'clut classic' via. the Raimi namesake.<br/><br/>What makes the three 'Evil Dead' films 'good', to spite the fact that they are unbelievably corny, is their witty scripts. Things like the humour and pushing the boundaries of the cliché horror films of the day are what makes them classics. This film however, has no interesting points to the script whatsoever, it is plain Jane, mass produced, Hollywood garbage.<br/><br/>The frights are all too predictable. You get the feeling that you've seen this film already a thousand times. The classic horror score warns you of the impending ghoul popping out of the dark, this time with absolutely terrible CG graphics. The most entertaining part of the film was when it reminded me of Evil Dead Two, with the marionette possessed with the puppet-like movement. I was half expecting it to scream 'DEAD BY DAWN, DEAD BY DAWNNN!', and if it had, the film would have got another star from this reviewer.<br/><br/>Acting in horror films is not supposed to be good, hell, its more entertaining sometimes if its absolutely horrible, but in this feature the unimaginative script will make you want to turn the film off. PG-13 horror films MUST rely on innovations in the genre to really 'scare' people (i.e Blair Witch Project, JU-ON). R rated films can use the innovative violence and gore to propel itself to cult classic status. This monstrosity unfortunately has neither.<br/><br/>Terrible flick, IMDb rating is skewed by Raimi brothers die-hard fans, don't believe the 'hype'. I am an Evil Dead junkie and this turd does not cut the mustard. Who writes this garbage and how much do they get paid? Something this unimaginative was probably written by some computer AI in a pentagon basement. It was crap wrapped in a 18karat gold foil, bottom line."
"ffattahi","2","9","20","19 January 2010"," Raimi uses his popularity to sell us this weak work.
","This was not, I repeat, NOT a great movie. Okay I'm exaggerating a little here. Shouldn't have used the word ""great."" Let me try again: This was not, I repeat, NOT a good movie. Ahhhh, that's better. I like Sam Raimi's work enough although I'm not a very big fan. I really think he enjoys a semi-cult-like popularity that leads some folks here to close their eyes on the many flaws and write positive reviews about this weak Raimi offering.<br/><br/>There are several very big problems here. The main one starts with the unconvincing performance of Alison Lohman playing the protagonist Christine Brown. I have not seen her in a lot of movies but if I have, her work must have been as forgettable as this one.<br/><br/>Miss Lohmann comes off as a B-actress with very little range here. In many scenes I could have sworn they had just called her to the set as soon as she was done memorizing her lines. Those lines came out of her mouth just like a junior-high student trying to pass an oral exam by only memorizing from the text book instead of actually learning the topic.<br/><br/>Miss Lohman should not take all the blame for this, though. Her character is so unbelievable that when she has her first sequence of violent spirit activity in her residence she merely shuts a door and goes back to her normal life. After the third or fourth such evil-spirit violence she calms down enough to go out with her boyfriend and talk about how nice a night it is! The writing is very weak and feels rushed. As if the script was written in one Saturday afternoon. The dialogs are so lame that I'm not sure if even Meryl Streep could have made lemonade out of it. Justin Long who does a good job in those MAC commercials looks like he is having a hard time keeping a straight face with this script.<br/><br/>To be fair the individual set pieces are somewhat effective and in a couple of occasions even somewhat scary. But this is far too rare here. The Cheapest way filmmakers try to scare you is with gore-galore. The second cheapest, in my opinion, is when you are give sudden loud ""scare"" scenes designed to make you jump from your seat. While Mr. Raimi keeps the gore to a reasonable level he profusely relies on sudden shock shots to scare you.<br/><br/>Ah yes, there's a third cheapest scare tactic and it's not so much a scare tactic as it is a make-you sick tactic. Bloody vomit is really passé but Mr. Raimi does not let that bother him. He also serves us saliva-soaked yellowed dentures, corpse vomit and a host of other yuks. That stuff worked for ""The Exorcist"" because it never felt like the director was feeding it to us just because he could. It does feel that way here.<br/><br/>And oh yes, what was up with the boyfriend's parents? Imagine caricatures of Greg's parents in ""Dharma & Greg!"" At least that show was a sitcom. Were these characters even necessary? If so, why not flesh them out better? The whole sequence with the parents felt like another cheap attempt to fill five or ten minutes of this flick. Too bad.<br/><br/>I gave this movie two out of ten on the IMDb feedback scale. The only thing that saved it from zero was the set pieces that managed to work. And that's not all of them, mind you."

","When I watch these things, I am particularly aware of what is considered scary: slimy, maggoty dead things, particularly if they are in your face; surprises from out of the blue; supernatural forces, always presumed to be evil....<br/><br/>But most of all we fear inevitability. It is the most cinematic of horror, because the filmmaker is in control of everything that happens next. We are completely at his mercy. There is — for those of us that are serious — no escape. All he has to do is add an on-screen setup that puts the fate in the story, and a desperate, failing attempt to escape. There can be no escape. <br/><br/>This is what film has over books. Books can explore the hidden, the thoughts, the unseen. But film can grind inevitably at a pace that cannot be altered.<br/><br/>There is nothing else remarkable here, save the excellent use of a specific effect that always gets me: the inkflow.<br/><br/>Yes, I know it is used all over, but we see it here in three different modes, enough to know that the director understood the effect.

Think about it: ""The Grudge"" and ""Quarantine"" are adaptations (and poor ones, I might say) of the Japanese ""Ju On"" series and the Spanish ""Rec"". So, what changed in this picture? It's easy: Sam Raimi! ""Drag Me to Hell"" is not a masterpiece, but it has all the right ingredients of a horror movie: a lot of suspense, dreadful creatures, spooky situations and the most important of all - PACE! You can't take the eyes off the screen, because you're eager to see what comes next, and next, and next... Ah! But Sam Raimi does it even better: he adds the salt and pepper of his horror movies - COMEDY! The dark and gore comedy, the trademark of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, that permits you to relax and laugh of some gruesome situations the characters face, just before you jump in chair with some more spooky stuff! ;) A wonderful surprise! This flick is a MUST SEE!"

She made the character so likable, so sweet and so funny. And Justin Long did good too playing her boyfriend. Lorna Raver did amazing. She did creep-ed me out in some scenes.<br/><br/>The film is amazingly entertaining and joyfully disgusting. The blood is little but there is a lot of goo and fluids. It has lots of jump scares with huge sounds and music. Speaking of the music it was just great and really kept you in the mood. The direction was also well done. It has Special Effects and old school crafts that reminded me of Tim Burton and Sam Raimi's older movie Evil Dead.

And I gave another chance. I continued watching as a horror comedy . Yes, this movie was not scary. It was far more funny than scary . . I have never laughed so hard at any horror movie in my life. Drag Me To Hell is the most sensible of the bunch. The film is centered around Christine Brown. The film is keenly self-aware. . It was a totally cheesy movie..It was watchable as a one-off, but I wouldn't watch it again.. The characters are flat and unrealistic . Most of the plot twists are familiar in concept to any fan of ghost movies. Some of the finer technical points clearly remain to be tweaked (sound, visual effects). it was such a big let down! . This movie was completely predictable, often resorting to extreme loud noise in a desperate bid to elicit some sort of scare from the audience that will instead leave you constantly adjusting your volume. And the ending is disgustingly predictable!!!!!"
"ludwigtr","2","8","18","15 January 2010"," Overrated movie that has some very serious issues
","First I simply must express my curiosity: why have so many people found this to be an entertaining, good movie? After all, there is nothing particularly original or special about Drag Me to Hell to begin with.<br/><br/>The movie plot itself is very unoriginal but it works: main character makes a B-A-D choice which causes the antagonist to suffer greatly. The main character is cursed by the antagonist and spends the rest of the movie unraveling what has happened, what the curse is and how to get rid of it. It is in fact very reminiscent of two other movies: Stephen King's THINNER and The Ring. Particularly the former because Drag Me to Hell also implements the idea that gypsies are in possession of dark, super-natural powers.<br/><br/>Well, I can live with then the mediocre special effects, the pitiful attempts of ""shocking"" us by rattling furniture and kitchen gear, the redundant characters, the overall poor acting, the stereotypical office-competition story, the lame one-liners, the grotesque witch who does equally grotesque things --- but I can't live with the malicious portrayal of an already shunned ethnic group.<br/><br/>Whereas THINNER at least serves us a slightly more complex story about moral dilemmas, and in which the cursed Billy Halleck hardly counts as a decent human being, the main character in Drag Me to Hell is a fairly ""white"" young woman whose poor self-esteem causes her to do ONE (questionably) bad choice. And for that she gets a curse thrown upon her by the nasty, disgusting, thieving gypsy witch. A curse way worse than anything thinning Billy Halleck ever had to deal with.<br/><br/>Naturally this is to be expected from gypsies in this movie. After all, those folks won't hesitate to curse a foolish little child thief, causing him to be tortured by demons for three days and then be dragged to hell - in front of his horrified parents. And since the gypsies can command demons from hell to seize the soul of whoever they please, it is easy to deduce what kind of people THEY are --- right?<br/><br/>Anyway, good job movie makers, for making such a poor piece of dung, using all clichés in the book and strengthening nasty prejudices against a big ethnic minority – all in one fell swoop.<br/><br/>Topnotch!"
"raikou74","2","8","18","2 January 2010"," In no way a good movie
","After seeing trailers for this movie you get nice and excited about such a good looking movie, the trailer however have lied. The effects in this movie were awful in some places, and decent in others. There's one scene where the protagonist gets some vomit-like blood-like substance spewed onto her, easily the worst effects since 200 that I've seen. Another scene in a cemetery had me thinking about the model cemetery in beetlejuice, (You know the one that was MEANT to look like cardboard?), except I don't think they meant it in this movie, I then was trying very hard not to swap movies over! Some people on here have been defending this movie's awfulness by saying 'They meant to make it bad! That's what the director does!'... Making bad movies, whether or not it's 'what he does' is not entertaining. The storyline to this movie had cliché's from all over the place. The storyline was predictable and not very compelling, at no point was I frightened, and the parts that I'm guessing were meant to be funny, just confused me as to why they would joke in that situation, B-grade acting also. 2/10 Not good"
"moviesleuth2","5","8","18","1 June 2009"," Shock...Another Shock...Another Shock...Another Shock...Get the picture?
","In the past, the concept of a PG-13 horror movie was laughable. Now, it's pretty much all we get. I went into ""Drag Me to Hell"" with trepidation because aside from the spooky ""The Ring,"" all horror movies with the PG-13 have been universally reviled as complete crap. Then again, this is from Sam Raimi, the creator of the cult classic ""Evil Dead"" trilogy, so it should reverse the trend, right? Not really.<br/><br/>Although I didn't actively hate it, I didn't like it either. Because the PG-13 rating eliminates most of the trademarks of the genre (extreme violence, sex, gore), the only thing Raimi can rely on is shocks and special effects. There is an overload of the former (even though they ""work"", and they get boring after a while, and the special effects are sub-par.<br/><br/>Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer at a bank. Because she wants a promotion, she decides not to give an old lady named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her mortgage, as this will save the company money. While being a jerk in this case would have had some benefits, it was probably unwise to do it to poor old Mrs. Ganush. Boy can she hold a grudge<br/><br/>The problem of this movie is that I just didn't care. The acting was okay (though Justin Long was really miscast). I was only interested (a word I use with caution) in the story because I wondered where the story was going. And the special effects looked cheap; with a big budget movie like this, I expected better.<br/><br/>About the concept of PG-13 horror movies...as I am not a fan of the genre, I can't really give my opinion. However, I can say that I am against neutering movies to fit the PG-13 rating. In this case, I probably wouldn't have been so annoyed if this wasn't the case with every movie. Based on the past and this movie, I'm guessing that a PG-13 horror movie probably has no real merit, only marketing capabilities. And, unfortunately, the latter is the only thing that matters."
"zophar666","1","11","27","1 June 2009"," Ridiculous, long, boring drivel! Worst movie I've viewed in years!
","Well, I'd first like to say that I've had an account on IMDb.com for many years and have voted on many titles, but never have I actually posted a review for a movie until now. But I felt the need to really get this off my chest.<br/><br/>""Drag me to hell"", pardon the pun, made me feel like I was IN hell for the 1 hour and 39 minutes in which I had to endure it. There were many times where I wanted to just walk out of the theater but did not, thinking that ""Sam Raimi has never made a bad movie, it will get better"". Well, it didn't. It just kept getting worse.<br/><br/>The musical score was uninspired and sounded like a knockoff of ""Exorcism of Emily Rose"", the ""special effects"" were ridiculous, the writing was shoddy and copied far better ""gypsy horror"" genre films, such as Steven King's excellent ""Thinner"", which I'd recommend you see if you want to get a good idea of a gypsy horror film done properly. The acting was unconvincing and it was sad to see someone from a great series as ""Sliders"" reduced to this crap. I shall not give away the ending but suffice it to say, it really puts the final nail on the coffin on what could have been a good movie. Instead, we are left with an at times boring, ridiculous, cheap ""scare"" bore-fest.<br/><br/>I don't understand what other people see in this movie, but Evil Dead this was not. Shame on you, Sam Raimi. Shame on you!"
"KerryRaport","2","21","60","29 May 2009"," You won't be scared, but at least you'll be deaf!
","Are you afraid of shadows and loud noises? Well, then this movie is for you! Every 5-7 minutes you can be sure that everything will slow down to a crawl, the music will fade out, and then SURPRISE...there is a 140db blast of sound and a close-up of a shadow or an old woman's face, or maybe a handkerchief. Terrifying! I hate to sit here and be completely negative, but I don't know what else to say. The dialogue is awful, the effects are terrible, the last 20 minutes are actually painful to watch because the ending is so obvious, and the movie seems to never be able to decide if it wants to be scary or funny. I love the Evil Dead movies, but this movie is actually embarrassing in comparison. I gave it 2 stars because the opening scene was pretty good, but it's all downhill after that."
"tshi19","10","5","10","27 June 2011"," Drag Me to Hell is a perfect example of why you should listen only to CRITICS
","Drag Me to Hell is a perfect example of why CRITICS know what the hell (pun intended) they're talking about, whereas moron movie-goers do NOT.<br/><br/>This is one of those rare instances where the critics are the ones who praise a film (I mean, holy crap ... this film has like a 96% approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes) while the general public completely pans it. <br/><br/>Guess what?<br/><br/>After seeing this film, I can definitely say without a shadow of a doubt that all of the critics are absolutely, 100% correct. This is easily one of the greatest horror-thrillers of all time, the scariest horror-thriller of all time, and by far the most well-directed horror-thriller of all time.<br/><br/>It's amazing how many people claimed that this film wasn't ""scary"" at all, when in fact they were probably wetting their damn pants every time something popped out out of nowhere after the misdirection/suspenseful build-up that happens throughout the entire movie. Cheap? Maybe. Does it work? Absolutely.<br/><br/>This film now ties with The Mist as being my two favorite horror-thrillers of all time. <br/><br/>A great example of why critics are the only ones who should be making any comments about anything. Critics and myself, one of the few people who aren't a bunch of stupid morons who wouldn't know ""good"" from ""bad"" if their damn soul depended on it (another intended pun). <br/><br/>Nearly ten major critics (from Entertainment Weekly to the Washington Post) gave this film a PERFECT score. Personally, I wouldn't give it higher than a 90/100 or a 9.0 out of 10 ... but it really sickens me to read what many of the movie-goers have said about this film. <br/><br/>All those comments have done is prove just how stupid most people really are.<br/><br/>It's interesting how a lot of people (and I don't just mean on here) claim that this film wasn't the least bit scary ... and then they turn right around and admit that there were plenty of ""jump scares"" (which I guess is the term people are using) throughout. Okay ... so if suspenseful music/tension and misdirection leading to an inevitable, shocking ""scare"" isn't what ""scary"" is, then I'd really like to know what IS.<br/><br/>Of all of the horror thrillers I've seen in the last decade or so (1408, The Mist, The Others, Skeleton Key, The Descent, The Ring, 28 Weeks Later, Hills Have Eyes, Texas Chainsaw Massacre, House of Wax, etc., (too many more to name ... those are just off the top of my head)), Drag Me to Hell is BY FAR the scariest. If this film doesn't qualify as being ""scary,"" then I really don't know what else in the entire damn world would qualify as such, because every single one of those other movies I just named (and pretty much every horror film ever, especially slasher-types) watch like the Care Bears movie compared to Drag Me to Hell.<br/><br/>Honestly, do people even THINK before they post reviews on sites like IMDb and Metacritic?<br/><br/>Yes, the movie IS full of cheap, ""misdirect and then jump out at you"" shock-scares ... that's what SCARY IS!<br/><br/>Of course, as with all horror thrillers (including survival horror video games such as Dead Space), how ""scary"" it happens to be really depends on how, where, and when you watch/play it. For instance, if you watched this film with other people around during the daytime ... or even in a movie theater surrounded by other people, then it probably wouldn't come off that scary at all. I, on the other hand, watched this film by myself, in a dark room, in the middle of the night (I purposely wanted this type of atmosphere). Big difference. I actually considered closing my eyes at one point, but then I realized that the scares would have been even worse, as the loud, out-of-nowhere SOUNDS in this film are half the scare. At least with my eyes open I could see the nasty, crusty, hag of an old woman pop out out of nowhere and be expecting the loud-ass shriek that accompanies it.<br/><br/>It's one thing to NOT like the film, but to actually say that this movie wasn't scary is just plain ridiculous and stems from pure bias and spite. Because I can think of no other horror thriller in the last decade or two that even compares in terms of sheer fright and tension. If Drag Me to Hell isn't scary, then nothing in the world of cinema is. I pretty much cringed for the entire 100 minutes.<br/><br/>And yeah, there are still people who classify this as part ""comedy,"" but until Sam Raimi himself openly says that (which he has NOT), I call bull. The fact of the matter is, a ""comedic"" horror film would be quite obvious in its tone and atmosphere. I've seen ""comedic"" horror films before, and this watches nothing like those. This was a film that took its plot very seriously,where exactly did it say ""spoof"" or ""parody"" to you? Drag Me to Hell was tense and unnerving the entire time. If you laughed during this, then that's something to get checked out. Because there was nothing even remotely funny about this movie. Disgusting, shocking, and terrifying? Yes.<br/><br/>Bottomline is, most horror thrillers slightly entertain but do not end up impressing me much. This one shocked me to the core."

","The movie is worth watching for the first half an hour. After that, comedy stick it's nose in.<br/><br/>Honestly, the first few scenes scared the hell out of me, mostly the scene where Mrs. Ganush threatens Christine in her workstation. After that, the napkin in the windshield scene also did an awesome job in my adrenaline flux. Last but not the least, the goat shadow scene. From there on, a supposed horror movie turned in one of the most disappointing movies ever. Why? Because the disgusting acting by Alison Lohman, the lack of horror notion and the way the occult and spiritism are characterized, got in the way. Not a movie i'll see again, that's for sure.<br/><br/>For the ones who are looking to waste one and a half hour, PLEASE do something else other than watching this movie. It doesn't worth your wasting time, believe me.<br/><br/>Anyways, i gave it a four only because the first few scenes."

And trust me, I was really bored.<br/><br/>I watched the unrated version on DVD and just... I wish I had never even looked at the cover of that movie. It was the worst thing I ever saw and I really did not need to see a woman kill her cat and then a man spit the cat's dead body out of his mouth or a dead woman's eyeballs fly from their sockets and into another girl's mouth. Just, no. It felt like they were just trying to make the movie as horribly disgusting as possible. I mean, I enjoy horror and I find movies like Saw fascinating, but this was just horrible. It was predictable, the characters were almost totally flat and you wouldn't care if the heroine was dragged to hell or any other place.<br/><br/>I wanted to puke while watching this movie several times. And that's a rare occurrence for me. So take this as a warning and don't watch this movie. EVER."

","I loved this movie. Sam Raimi has returned to deliver a real masterpiece of horror. Everything is incredible, specially the dark humor. It's one of my favorites movies, in fact: 2009 was a great horror/Thriller movie period. <br/><br/>It has the taste of the trilogy (Evil Dead), and I would easily watch it several times. The characters are nice, the plot is really interesting and this makes a movie that drags you inside it.<br/><br/>And the beginning is very creative. The old ""Ghost House"" enhances the Evil Dead trilogy's taste.<br/><br/>Well, it's an excellent movie!"
"insomniac_rod","10","5","10","6 September 2009"," Having fun with the Devil. Sam Raimi's modern masterpiece.
","Do you know what is to drink some beers and party with prostitutes with The Devil? Me neither! But watching this movie should be the closest thing to hanging with The Devil. Oh, through ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi forces the evil spirits to have fun with you and scare the crap out of you at the same time.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's contemporary masterpiece demonstrates that he's an authorized voice in Horror. He managed to create the perfect film and without noticing maybe, he started a revolution in the genre.<br/><br/>Let me explain myself...<br/><br/>He created a non-stop Horror ride supported by brutality, gore, chilling scenes and without earning the infamous ""R"" rating. Where do I wanna get? He proves that fear and craziness in the likes of his masterpiece ""Evil Dead 1 & II"" can be created without following the tendencies of the new millennium. Raimi follows his own rules and adds the necessary elements in order to create a modern masterpiece. He didn't give a crap and inserted black humor and bizarreness into a straight Horror story.<br/><br/>He's the only Director capable of making you laugh nervously and be scared at the same time.<br/><br/>But the black humor doesn't means this movie isn't scary. On the contrary, this is one of the most chilling visual experiences in years. Sure, you will laugh a lot but you will be equally scared. Let's keep in mind that the movie deals about an ancient evil spirit and the devil so that should give you an idea of how scary things will get.<br/><br/>We get a thrilling exorcism sequence where you will cry in joy because it feels and smells like ""Evil Dead"". Milo dancing and grunting is just as terrifying and chilling but funny at the same time. I can't praise enough the violent moments such as Sylvia beating the hell out of poor Christine, or the tool shack fight. Oh, and I loved the cursing possessed goat! That was truly spectacular and creepy.<br/><br/>Sure, there are plenty of ""jump out of your seat"" moments but all of them are simply spectacular. You just don't expect them and that's how this movie will scare the heck out of you. For example, you don't see coming when Sylvia is lying next to Chris in bed, or what about Sylvia's appearance in Chris's cellphone? Pure genius! The whole Lamia explanation is creepy and is executed masterfully. Whenever the Lamia decides to make an appearance you are gonna get owned.<br/><br/>I praise Raimi's directing techniques. His brilliant use of shadows truly scared me because he knows that the things you can't see will make your mind originate scary thoughts but at the same time, he hits you in the head with diabolical appearances through f/x and sounds. Expect to be chilled.<br/><br/>The acting is excellent, top class. Allison Lohman demonstrates she has the wood to become the female Ash. She's so cute, perfect, slim and delivers a strong performance based on comedy and badass drama. Adriana Barraza steals the show whenever she comes as the medium who had ""unfinished business"" with The Lamia. Way to go for the talented Mexican actress! The rest of the cast is brilliant and it looks they were having a good time filming their parts.<br/><br/>The score is haunting and proves that evil sounds will always work. Yes, we have evil laughs, trepidant sounds, and it's so great that you can forget for a while about ""join us"" or ""dead by dawn"".<br/><br/>But nothing is 100% perfect. I didn't like the CGI at some points. When some is dragged to hell it looks particularly cheesy. Also, some dialogs feel way too much ""Spider Man"". But those are just minimal flaws.<br/><br/>Read my words, this movie will become a referent in future Horror. It's not a new way of film making, it's Sam Raimi's Horror.<br/><br/>Thanks again Mr. Raimi for this evil-wicked Horror ride. It's better than a diabolical roller-coaster.<br/><br/>I'm ready to be dragged!"

","OK, let me first make one thing very clear : I am not big fan of horror movies and have always avoided watching them (the reason is the obvious, that is I tend to get too scared watching them) In fact, this was the first horror movie that I saw after more than 10 years and apparently it was on the day that I was alone at my house (being a teenager, that doesn't happen very often for me). Despite everything else, I had heard some really good things about this movie and so, I decided to give it a try. Little did I know what was about to come next....<br/><br/>As the movie reached its last 15 minutes, there was a major power cut not just in my apartment but in the entire area and suddenly, there was darkness all over. It took me a few minutes to sink in everything that had just happened and as soon as it did, I peed my pants (metaphorically, of course). It was as if the movie wasn't enough to spook the hell out of me that now even the brightness was sucked from my world. I waited in silent contemplation as to what it would be like to be dragged into hell and just at that moment, the electricity was back and to my surprise, I was still alive...<br/><br/>As far as the movie is concerned, i give it a 10 on 10 because it did manage to do what it promised ie. drag me to hell (even though Sam Raimi had little to do with it)...."

","As a guy in his 30's, I grew up on the early work of Sam Raimi. After ""Army Of Darkness"" though, I noticed a change in his style and format. To be honest, I didn't care for any of the Spider Man films. I don't think they were terrible, just not as wonderful as the hype. Moreover, I don't think that they reflect the style of film that I came to know as Raimi's.<br/><br/>I opted out of seeing DMTH at first. I didn't think the trailer was all that interesting, and I figured I'd catch it on DVD down the line. At the suggestion of an old friend I went and saw it tonight, and was pleasantly surprised. More so than I expected to be. Although it is no ""Evil Dead"" film, the work embodies what I had come to define as Sam Raimi's style. With Spider Man and such, I felt like he played to his audience: kids. With DMTH, it becomes obvious that the guy felt like making a real horror film again.<br/><br/>I'll give him a pass on the CGI, as it is tastefully done compared to most these days. I'll also note that the acting was good, the flow of the film was good, and some the shots themselves are amazing. This film is by far the closest thing to Sam's older work that he has done since ""Army"", and should please his older fan-base. The kids today who aren't happy unless someone gets killed on screen every five minutes don't like this film, but those of us who are on the other end of that debate may just find a little slice of something worth a damn."

"Jonny_Numb","7","5","10","4 June 2009"," Drag Us Home, Raimi
","This much insanity shouldn't be legal...and so much fun. Thankfully, no one told Sam Raimi, who shakes off Hollywood expectation and demographic-appeal concerns with ""Drag Me to Hell,"" a back-to-basics horror flick that's one of the strongest original works of genre storytelling so far this year. To those who would bemoan or dismiss the vitality of this frequently reviled class of film...this one's for you.<br/><br/>Confession Time: I have never been a big fan of Raimi's work; his well-regarded ""Evil Dead"" trilogy never consumed me with the same sense of ballistic fanaticism it inspires in most. I could appreciate his distinctive way of mixing the extremities of the genre (demons, decapitation, dismemberment) with gleefully broad (and outright ludicrous) physical humor, but something always kept me from fully embracing this auteur's style. A theatrical screening of ""Army of Darkness"" last year had me thinking I might have been a bit harsh in my assessment of Raimi's work. After all, even his more streamlined, serious mainstream works (the masterful ""A Simple Plan,"" for instance) contain undeniable stylistic echoes of his macabre roots.<br/><br/>As with other horror directors whose humble beginnings have spun off into commercially and critically successful careers (David Cronenberg and Peter Jackson immediately come to mind), part of the thrill of ""Drag Me to Hell"" is to see the accumulated experience of a now-seasoned filmmaker played out in the genre he helped define. The result is classical in style while distinctly contemporary; silly and funny while genuinely jolting and unnerving; polished and slick while grungy and crude. These contradictory traits are a clear invitation for the already-initiated, and newcomers will have the pleasure of experiencing Raimi's now-highly refined joybuzzer shocks without the safety net of familiarity.<br/><br/>The premise is deliciously simple, creating a uniquely internal logic that gives Raimi free reign to pull out all the stops: Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a promotion-seeking loan officer who, in a split-second of avarice, denies Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an old gypsy woman, an extension on her mortgage payment; as a result, she visits a three-day curse on Christine that, if not stopped, will literally send her to hell. Supported by faithful boyfriend Clay (Justin Long, balancing the dramatic and comedic quite well) and the assistance of ""seer"" Rham Jas (Dileep Reo), Christine is driven to extreme measures in the battle to save her soul, leading to sequences that will leave even the most jaded horror hound uncertain of the outcome. In addition to the macabre elements and the suitably outlandish special effects, Raimi builds adequate suspense and even integrates some genre-crossing sidesteps (a great sequence where Christine meets Clay's parents is played liked a romantic comedy that segues into horror before once again returning to comedy) that deliver a one-two punch of terror, humor, and character development. Its initial scenes even invoke ""The Twilight Zone"" in the sense of bland domestic drama giving way to powers beyond man's ability to control.<br/><br/>True to its title, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a film without barriers or limits; nothing is definite in Raimi's world, and in the best horror tradition, the guarantee of a Happy Ending is punctuated with a solid question mark. All the more impressive given the film's PG-13 rating; in an era where horror films are stigmatized for whatever commercially-viable moniker the MPAA attaches to them, it speaks volumes for Raimi's tact and skill the wildly creative grotesqueries that fit within the seeming ""confines"" of this rating. With a generation of filmmakers that miss the point of ""horror"" and go straight for gore, it's downright refreshing to see a veteran (who made his name in gore) embrace straight-laced fear...and succeed wildly."

In the night, Christine is stalked by Mrs. Ganush in the parking lot and they struggle. Out of the blue, Mrs, Ganush removes a button from Christine's coat, curses it, returns the button to her and vanishes. Later, while going home with her psychologist boy-friend Clay Dalton (Justin Long), they pass by the fortune teller Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), and Christine decides to consult him. He advises that Christine has the fiend Lamia, the Black Goat, upon her. When Christine is haunted by the dark spirit during the night at home, she tries to fix the situation releasing the loan of Mrs. Ganush. However the old woman had passed away; Christine runs to Rham Jas that tells her that Lama will torment her for three days and then will drag her soul to hell. <br/><br/>""Drag Me to Hell"" is a scary horror movie from Sam Raimi that successfully returns to this genre. The story and the screenplay with many twists are excellent, with a creepy atmosphere and great special effects. Loma Raver is gruesome and very frightening, and I startled many times along the feature. I liked but I did not expect the dark conclusion. Surprisingly there are bad reviews of this movie in IMDb, probably from viewers that do not like a genuine horror movie. My vote is eight.<br/><br/>Title (Brazil): Not Available"

","This is a laughable, fun movie. The horror bit does not look real considering the technology we have now nowadays but that doesn't matter because it makes you laugh. This movie should be more of a Comedy/Thriller because the horror is done in a comedic way and it has more jump scenes then horror ones. The end of this movie is quite predictable when the boyfriend gets the button instead of the coin but you can only guess that bit way into the movie about 10 minutes to the end so it doesn't really matter. In my opinion I think that this is still a great movie and everyone who likes movies exp. (scary movie)should watch this."

","Was I watching the same movie as everyone else? I can't see how this movie is 7.1 out of 10 on IMDb. I consider myself a movie buff. Seen hundreds in all genres, but this has to be one of the worst movies I have ever seen. Horrible acting,parts of the movie that are supposed to be scary seem like scenes from the spoof series Scary Movie by the Wayans brothers. Throughout the movie Justin Long is hard to take serious, and Alison Lohman tries way too hard. Literally in utter amazement how this movie could get any rating from anyone beyond a 1 or 2 out of 10. Avoid this movie, wish I could have that 2 hours of my life back."

","Drag Me to Hell must be the single loudest film I've ever sat through in the cinema. At one point even the characters in the film were holding their ears and screaming. This, by the way, is a good thing.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi finally has a break from making Spiderman films and releases the horror film he's always been threatening to make for the last fifteen years. And it's good. I'd recommend that you see it as soon as possible because it's already being hyped to death.<br/><br/>A girl working in a bank is having one of those bad days. She's got a rival for promotion who's more ruthless than her, and apparently she's not good enough for her prospective mother-in-law. Sadly, she chooses to take things out on an old gypsy woman, and gets cursed for her troubles.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell must contain a record number of jump scares, so many that you're almost de-sensitized by the time it finishes. Raimi's no fool, however, and piles on the atmosphere, crazy editing, bizarre camera angles and a total cacophony of noise to create an hour and a half's worth of scares. Throw in some gross-out stuff, and some Evil Dead style antics and you know what you're in for. It's funny and scary, as people have been saying, and I enjoyed it immensely.<br/><br/>The only slight gripe I have is the CGI, which was terrible. Other than that, it's worth seeing."
"come2whereimfrom","5","7","17","30 May 2009"," Not the stunning return to form everyone is banging on about I'm afraid
","Raimi is back on form said one critic, he's cut loose and having fun said another. Well he maybe having fun but I didn't, someone should tell the director that it's not 1984 and to find some new ideas. What you have here is basically Evil Dead-lite, demons fly about and do funny things, there's a possessed hankie, talking animals and much more besides but there was just something missing and that was Bruce Campbell. Alison Lohman is OK as the lead; she looks pretty enough and gets suitably tortured by the devious mind of Raimi but everyone else? Her boyfriend looks just like a little Ross from 'Friends' and has the most punchable face since the actual Ross, the mediums cant act and Mrs.Ganush although good in places is just way to over the top to ever be genuinely scary. The story is cribbed from 'Night of the Demon' and written back in 1992 where it probably should have stayed. It tells of Mrs.Ganush placing a rather nasty curse on our blond bank teller after she doesn't extend her mortgage payments but I spent the whole time wondering why she was behind in paying. She clearly possesses the power to summon hell after someone so would she really be skint? The camera work is straight out of his early work, some of the gags are inventive but the story is paced badly and feels like it has bits missing. Although what did stand out for me was the sound work you can hear everything from the spit on false teeth to the ear bleeding loud scene at the séance. But ultimately it falls flat, its not that bad but its not that good either its just OK and sometimes just OK just isn't enough."
"trcky1","10","4","8","2 July 2011"," Gross and hilarious fun
","I think I figured out the recent spate of hate reviews on this movie. PETA got a social hate campaign together due to some scenes in the film involving animals that didn't even construe any cruelty towards them. I knew this was the case when one of the hate reviews (raddi8989) claimed that Ebert hated the movie, when he actually liked this movie. Go check RT for yourself. Then I clicked on other reviews w/ only 1 star and every single reviewer created an IMDb account just to boycott this film, pretty much proving that this was a boycott campaign against the film. Anyways, here's my review:<br/><br/>Hardcore Raimi fans are gonna hate on me, but I'm gonna say it anyways: this is Sam Raimi's best work yet. The jokes don't come as often as they do in Army of Darkness, but he uses more of the story to set them up, so that when they do come, they're even more shockingly hilarious than the ones in AoD. This is definitely a more jolting horror than AoD & the Evil Deads. But Raimi invests more in character building in this film, leading us to both squirm and bust up laughing at all the punishment that Alison takes. Other contemporary horror-film directors NEED to take notes from this film. I don't expect them to make their films as funny as Raimi's, but at least learn to build your characters and make the storyline worth the journey.<br/><br/>Anyways, if you like scary roller coasters, this is the maliciously fun film for you."

","This movie was downright awful. The scenes were predictable, not at all scary and i even found myself laughing throughout some of the scenes. I mean, an old woman without teeth going at it? The plot was poorly written, and without a doubt one of the worst background stories for a horror movie i've yet to see. The acting is mostly bad, and the main-character I just find not worthy of such a bad role. I saw all of the good ratings, and I must admit i was waiting for something visual and horrifying - but all it was to me was just a laughable comedy. This movie should as well had been named ""Drag me through hell"", for it is 1 ½ hour i will never get back."

I was beyond shocked at the terrible CG effects for a movie done in this day and age. The effects came across as more comical than scary. And the painful dialogue/acting skills of the lead female actress made it seem like I was watching some made-for-TV movie of the week. The movie could have been so much more.

"RainDogJr","9","4","8","30 August 2009"," ""I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!""
","Drag Me To Hell, Sam Raimi's first non-Spiderman film since 2000, was released in my city more than a week ago, on 21 August 2009, but just yesterday I finally had the chance to check it out on the big screen (last weekend was very hectic). I'm glad, my introduction to the non-Spiderman Raimi was fantastic and yes, even thought I own since more than a year ago Raimi's first feature film, The Evil Dead, on DVD I only can say that from him I have seen nothing more aside of this, the 3 Spider-man films and some parts of both Darkman and Army of Darknessshame on me, I f****** know! But I promise to myself that I will finally see The Evil Dead during this week (and Army of Darkness and Darkman as soon as possible), but well before that happens let's add some more words to this IMDb comment of Drag Me To Hell<br/><br/>Sam Raimi's film (he also wrote it together with his brother Ivan Raimi) opens in a typical way: we have the case that will be similar to the one that our main character will have to deal with, of course it happens many years before and of course it will be always be present in the course of the film to finally make the direct connection with our main character. And is Alison Lohman who plays this main character (thank god Ellen Juno Page dropped out the film!), she is the lovely Christine Brown and she is really great. Of course Christine will be the one dealing with the not quite normal stuff that of course would be just freaking unbelievable for almost everybody, and boy is she going to suffer. And she is basically alone, I mean sure her boyfriend (played by Justin Long) is there supporting her but is just her thing, certainly she will have to believe in well in f****** anything, the words of a psychic will be as believable as ever for her! Like I said, Drag Me To Hell is typical, is a simple film that works just about fine with the normal plot of having our main character cursed, suffering and of course seeking for help, for the way to give herself, and us, a happy ending. <br/><br/>And it works just about fine for those touches, for those really cool touches and for those really good and enjoyable performances by its entire cast. Justin Long, Lorna Raver, Dileep Rao, Reggie Lee, Adriana Barraza deserves a mention since they all are truly great, delivering lots of fun and memorable moments. Starting with a really cool and intense fight between the two main women of the story (Christine and, Lorna Raver's character, Sylvia Ganush) the film is full of ingenious parts, is of course full of scenes that will make your girlfriend jump off her seat and make expressions of disgust. The film is conventional in many ways of course but Raimi's touches are really terrific, those scenes that are simply funny and, mostly, those that are fun because of being sort of over the top are enough to make of this worth watching material. For example, the stuff with the cat of the protagonist: sure the ""hey kitty kitty"" is funny, and of course ultimately scary, but the ""I don't want your cat, you dirty pork queen!"" with the cat being returned to its owner is just f****** cool, just f****** fun time at the movies. Or the stuff with the boss of Christine (played by David Paymer), I mean the bloody problem of Christine, that is first scary and embarrassing for Christine, second f****** cool and fun with the boss soaked of blood and third just plain hilarious with the boss just worried for not having blood in his mouth. It's crazy time at the movies, with a crazy and vengeful old lady, an annoying fly (loved when it touches the camera), psychics that for once are not full of s***, a poor but ultimately insane goat and a poor young womanI just had a truly great time watching Raimi's latest work."

","Sweep aside all those Japanese psychological horrors, the torture porn and the 3-D specialities, and lets get back to basics.

Cue devilish goings on as our lead lady tries to exorcise the curse to little avail.<br/><br/>As a horror movie it will make you jump, but really it's a bit of gross out comedy as well (watch out for the fly sequence!). You will laugh and yelp in equal measure.<br/><br/>Keeps you more than entertained for the duration, and at heart it's a nice old fashioned popcorn horror movie that has been forgotten about of late.

The sound effects was amazing and even the story was pretty clever! I loved the Evil Dead movies but this was even better! I loved how I jumped out of mu chair without any warning or buildup whatsoever! Element of surprise was great! You must see this movie! It's the best horror movie of 2009, in fact its the best Horror movie in many years! I was entertained from the very beginning to the very end. There will be people that will hate this movie simply because of the humor that is used. I really pity those.. A horror movie doesn't have to be dead serious all the way through! In fact every horror movie should be like this.. One moment you are laughing your eyes out and in the next your heart nearly stops of shock! This is how it should be and I'm so glad I finally got to see a movie of this caliber again. If there is anything negative abou this movie it will have to be that it ended too soon! It's not a short movie but it's jus that good and you don't ever want it to end. The ending was really exciting and I wish it was a bit longer. Judging by the IMDb score on this movie, Raimi will certainly make more films like this and I can't wait to see them! If you haven't seen it already. don't miss out on this movie in the cinemas. Movies like this should be seen on the big screen and with proper speakers!"
"lee.burstow","6","4","8","5 June 2009"," A throw-back to the 80's horror flicks
","""Drag me to Hell"" is director Sam Raimis' latest offering to the horror genre. Having already had hits with such films as the ""Evil Dead Trilogy"", ""The Grudge"" and ""30 days of night"" – it didn't take a brain surgeon to realise the kind of movie I was about to view . The story centres around Christine Brown played by Alison Lohman – Working as a loan officer in the local bank, Brown has the unenviable task of dealing with a rather dirty, disgusting gypsy woman who has failed to keep up her mortgage repayments. <br/><br/>Torn between doing the right thing for the woman and demonstrating to her boss that she has management material, Brown decides against giving the woman a loan extension and in doing so shames' the old woman publicly. In retaliation for this humiliation, the gypsy woman places a supernatural curse on the unfortunate Brown.<br/><br/>In 3-days time a demon from Hell will enter our world and take Browns' soul to purgatory forever. The race is now on for her to find a way of preventing this from happening and to seek redemption. After enlisting the help of a ""Seer"", Brown is put in contact with a medium that has fought this demonic beast before - On that occasion she was defeated and the unfortunate soul was lost. Will the medium be successful second time around?<br/><br/>If you're looking for a truly frightening horror movie then this film is not for you. Think of Evil Dead and your well on the way to discovering what this movie is like. Comedic moments are aplenty and the music score and shock tactics which is Raimis' trademark provide you with enough material to look away in disgust rather than fear. <br/><br/>This movie is definitely a throw-back to the old 80's style horror flick and if that's your thing you're going to love it. If you prefer your horror movies a bit classier and a little more believable then stay away and rent it on DVD at a later date."

The last time I was really scared at the theatre was during Dead Silence. I literally had chills during the loud scary parts. Christine Brown works as a loan officer, and soon must deal with an elderly Gypsy woman named Mrs. Sylvia Ganush. When she is denied a third extension on her mortgage, she places a terrible curse on Christine. She begins hearing voices, sees the shadows of demons and a lot worse things. Within three days, Christine will be dragged to Hell, unless she can do something about it. I highly recommend that you DRAG ME TO HELL!!!"

When I heard this film was rated pg-13, I really didn't want to see the film because pg-13 rated horror films are not scary. This is an exception.

My whole entire theater crowed had a great time, we jumped, we laughed, we screamed, we were shocked when the credits rolled. This movie does not rely on gore or violence but it brings back the gross-in-your-face gags and LOUD jump-scares. Beware this movie gave me a heart attack literally!

"cultfilmfan","10","4","8","31 May 2009"," Drag Me To Hell
","Drag Me To Hell, for me at least was a much welcomed return to the old days of horror films that today's type seem to ignore. Instead of going for torture, or sadistic violence it relies more on a well written story, convincing acting and scares that don't come from graphic gore or brutality. The story I thought was very intriguing and was a rather original premise and once the macabre and horror film type scenarios come into play in the film, it grabs you and does not let go. I actually found myself jumping out of my seat several times during the movie and a lot of the time I did feel tense and exhausted because I personally really felt for the character in this film and after all that went on you felt as exhausted and scared as the main character of the film because it was handled so well and with tight direction, performances and script we feel like the character in the movie, which isn't always that great a feeling, but it leaves an impression on you and will definitely be a memorable experience. There were a lot of gross out effects and moments in the film that actually were a mix between being so gross and bizarre that it was almost humorous and at other times it made you squirm in your seat and feel nauseated. There still is enough violence and terror in this film, but I did not think it went into the hardcore violence just for sensationalism style that many of the films of the genre do today. This is a film that teenagers can actually see and those who are a fan of the horror genre should love it. In the theatre I was in it was mostly occupied by teenage boys and girls and there were a lot of screaming coming from the girls and various comments made during some of the grosser or more dark parts of the story. The film always got the atmosphere and the moments right, no matter what kind of a scene it was going for. The first part of the movie before it became a horror film was still interesting and played out as any well done drama would and the second half when it becomes a full blown horror film it had everything from music, to creepy sound effects and lighting and mood as well to really make one feel uneasy. This is one film that grabbed you and would not let go because a lot of it really happens so fast and there is so much energy and zest to this film that while you are grabbing the arm rests of your seat and your heart is pounding, you are still so into the film that you can not look away. This is thanks to a talented cast and crew who with previous experience, show that they know their horror movies and they can do them well, very well. This is one of the funnest and most uncomfortable (yet in a good way) horror movie going experiences I have had in quite awhile and this is probably one of the best horror films of the decade because it hit every note right and passed the originality test with flying colours and even while borrowing some trademark styles and techniques of older films, it didn't feel like a rip off of those older films, but rather an homage to them and honouring them. This film was a very fun experience and because I do have a taste for horror films this film really satisfied me and I look forward to seeing it again sometime soon and hope it leaves as big an impact on me as the first viewing I had. One of the best horror films of recent memory and one of the best films of the year so far."
"Red_Flag","10","4","8","28 May 2009"," Drag Me To Hell
","So many questions, so little time. I'm just going to come out and say it not only will this review be one of the longest I've written but folks I'm not holding back, this may include one or two spoilers. The movie I'm talking about, of course, is Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me To Hell"" which in theory is Sam Raimi's first horror films since The Evil Dead III: Army of Darkness. The main question, im sure, is does this director still have what it takes? Will he have me rolling in my seat nostalgic and immersed in the world he created with ""The Evil Dead"" or like some naysayers have been stipulating, has he been in Hollywood so long that he won't have the chops for this. I think its safe to say at this point that he still has it, in fact it's so apparent that I felt inclined to stand up at the end of the movie and shout ""yes!"". Fortunately I was in a theatre with several other Sam Raimi fans and I wasn't the only one. In that the rue brilliance of this movie emerges, if you go see this by yourself, you'll have a great time, it will be a fun, forgettable romp. See it with friends, at night, in a crowded cinema and you'll be on the floor, ""please stop it your killing me"" laughing.<br/><br/>For anybody that doesn't know, and the trailer can be deceiving, this is essentially a comedy. Granted there are several sense where the film ups the ante and you are genially terrified (for example towards the end of the movie there is a séance sequence that drove me insane, pulling my hair out) but for the most part this is a comedy, and boy if it doesn't work, almost perfectly, there are sequences that are do ultra violent and over the top that you'll be begging for an intermission just to change your pants. The movie is cast phenomenally, the supporting cast plays in well, and don't play dumb when it comes to the point where they know this isn't their movie. There no denying that the film belongs solely to Alison Lohman who is such a juxtaposition when in context. Being the young, pretty pixie of a girl it's devilishly cruel what Raimi puts her through but, god damn it it's just so much fun to watch from beginning to end. In that we get this films true motivation. It's a playground for Sam Raimi, whatever you may think of the movie one thing is absolutely undeniable, Sam Raimi had a blast making this movie twirling his Dick Dastardly moustache saying ""what horrible stuff can I do to this girl next"" If there's anything I can say that's bad about the movie and I almost don't want to after falling this deeply in love with it. (Spoiler Ahead) Raimi trys to pull a twist ending resulting in the immediate realisation of the audience, it almost plays as a merit if only because it will have you screaming in agony at the screen telling her, ""don't you even dare go in there"" As much as I may think the twist ending is a stooper, all is made up when the films takes you beyond the level you expected to...welcome to hell. Scant of plot and barren of subtext, the film is single-mindedly devoted to pushing the audience's buttons, and my god if my buttons weren't pushed. Only one other movie this year had me feeling like I was pumped full of adrenaline and that was, funnily enough, Crank 2. This is that kind of insane, over the top, exploitative fun that I enjoy so very much.<br/><br/>The 99-minute, eye-popping, bowel-twingeing, possessed-talking-goat extravaganza that follows must be one of the scariest things I've ever seen in the cinema. How bad? Well, I screamed out loud in genuine, save-me-now-Jesus terror for the first time since Evil Dead II. And I laughed through the fear much more often. Don't let the movies 15 rating deceive you, there may not be a whole load of blood on show (despite a horrific nose bleed sequence) but trust me you'll be throwing up your breakfast at the endless amounts of puss and slime and close up shots that may linger for days on end. You're unlikely to find a better night out this year and there not way this isn't going to make my ""best of"" list.<br/><br/>Verdict: It's a visceral assault on the senses and will have you gasping for breath as the laughs and scares mount. Raimi directs with the confidence and flair of a genre master. No Raimi fan would miss the opportunity at seeing the master filmmaker back at the helm of a movie that suits him so comfortably, this insane thrill ride grabs the audience full throttle and refuses to let go throwing blood, puss and slime in your face topping it off with a punch to the gut that is the nerve shredding ending. This is diabolically entertaining, ferociously funny and mind numbingly intense, go see it with friends, go see it at midnight. You have my guarantee you'll come back a new person, for better or worse. Muhahahaha!"

","Well....this movie is something different...sort of.<br/><br/>'Drag Me To Hell' is a very interesting movie. Thrills, chills, Sam Raimi, creepy old women, curses.....all of the stuff you just heard has been done in movies before, but not in the style it's done here in this film. I struggle to call it cliché, because it is and isn't at the same time (which sounds stupid). Well, let's basically say that it uses clichés in a different way. For example, the creepy old woman does haunt Christine Brown, but is as physically strong as Christine. Usually the old woman would just follow her around, but she doesn't just do that. She torments her. Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi have in a way, twisted the clichés to make a fresh film. I don't know about you...but I like it.<br/><br/>At the screening I went to, everyone went crazy for the parking lot scene. I think I know why. It's funny in a way, but you're not laughing at Christine Brown, you're laughing with her. This is more a fight scene than a you-have-no-chance-of-escaping scene. It gives you a new image of horror, by mixing it with other elements and genres. I personally loved how the director (Sam Raimi) thought well there's nothing holding me off from killing a child, so why not? He's a free-spirited filmmaker. GENIUS! The movie keeps you thinking and leaves you saying ""oh if only she did that"" or ""she shouldn't have ...."". This is what good thrillers and horrors should do. The PG-13 rating didn't bother me as much as I thought it would. It was creepy, even without the R-rating.<br/><br/>GO SEE IT! You'll have fun and be creeped out at the same time."

How could he have given life to something this bad..?! The horror does not work, the CGI is cheap, the 'comedy' makes you hide your head in shame. It has the glossy feel of a TV teen-squeal. A 15 certificate? Think a 12 would have covered it. Terrible. And when I think this was the guy that did Evil Dead. If this is Sam's return to horror then let me tell you the world has moved on a bit...<br/><br/>Don't believe the hype. Don't buy it!<br/><br/>AWFUL<br/><br/>AWFUL"
"tedari","2","5","11","27 January 2010"," Terrible
","Cheap scares, Swiss cheese plot. I really can't say anything good about this movie. The jokes were not funny, the acting was though. Why does every curse movie never address the fact that if these gypsy people could throw curses around willy nilly they wouldn't need bank loans as they could easily hold the world to ransom?<br/><br/>This doesn't even fall closely into the category of black comedy, because after the first hour and a half I was bored to tears. Utterly ridiculous gross out moments don't make a film good, good script and plot design do. I gave this a 2 being generous. I have no idea how this film has managed to hit 7.2 on the IMDb score. I can only imagine that the majority of people voting are as unhappy as me with the calibre of horror that has been available over the last few years and got a bit itchy with their rating trigger.<br/><br/>If you want my advice then stop watching American horrors. The big budgets destroy any feel of real horror that remains in a story. CGI has ruined the world of film with super graphical scenes. The films that really do scare; such as The Wicker Man (1973) and Psycho (1960) didn't have so much as a dancing puppet, and yet still terrify me if I watch them today.<br/><br/>I believe there needs to be an overhaul when it comes to the horror genre, because if crap like this is passing the threshold at the end of first decade of the non-believing millennium, then we are in serious trouble for what the future has to offer."

"CinemaClown","Null","2","3","27 August 2016"," A Unique Blend Of Startling Horror & Ludicrous Comedy That Actually Works.
","After freeing himself from the exhausting production schedule of big-budget blockbusters while he was working on those Spider-Man movies for nearly a decade, director Sam Raimi returns to a less hectic, low-budget & much simpler project and carves a thrilling mix of horror & comedy that's as jumpy as it is ludicrous.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell tells the story of a bank loan officer who, in order to convince her boss that she is perfectly capable of making the tough decisions, refuses to grant loan extension to an old woman who, in retaliation, places a deadly curse on her. As the supernatural forces begin to torment her, she turns to a seer for help.<br/><br/>Co-written & directed by Sam Raimi, the film delivers the shocks & laughs in equal doses and while the scares are spine-tingling, their impact is instantly doused by the absurdity of what follows next. Raimi clearly had a lot of fun while crafting this feature and the campy tone is evident in every frame. And if that wasn't enough, there are enough moments to simply gross its viewers out.<br/><br/>I mean, every now n then, stuff keeps going in or coming out of people's mouth from start to finish. Characters aren't that well-defined but they are still serviceable. Technical aspects work in tandem to encapsulate the whole picture with a tense & unnerving atmosphere. Jump scares are effective, laughs are plentiful, and the slightly exaggerated performances from its cast only contributes to its wicked tone.<br/><br/>On an overall scale, Drag Me to Hell is one of those rare entities that scores high in both horror & comedy aspects, finds its filmmaker in a much-relaxed yet creatively active mode, and is almost as frightening as it is funny. Its climax takes things a tad too far and pretty much kills all the suspense but it still manages to end on a satisfying note. In short, this unique hybrid of frights & laughter is a hellacious ride that actually works. Delightfully recommended."

The story is ridiculous. The writing is completely atrocious, i couldn't stop laughing. I didn't even have the strenght to laugh in the ""exorcism"" scene, what was that all about anyway??? A goat cursing at you, a guy who didn't know the director said ""action"" already, a demon dancing in a guys body, the unrealistic reaction of the girl...everything so awful that i couldn't believe it was real.

I considered turning it off after about 20 minutes but I thought I would give the film it's due and watch the rest.

","First of all, the plot was just dull. A cursed woman has to make a difficult decision, there's a talking goat, and a medium speaking Spanish (as if it's supposed to make the movie seem a lot more scary that it actually is). In essence, this movie is typical of Raimi's work: cheesy and fruitless. On the positive side, the picture was great and the music was decent. The acting was simply too facetious and bad (which I don't think at all meshes well with a horror movie setting). The dialog was also pretty poor. 1/10. Don't see it.

Raimi created a truly frightening n tense horror film inspite of it being pg13. It is very tense and horrifying, also laugh-out-loud hilarious—and sometimes it's just flat-out insane. It has tons of jump scares. There is ample amount of tension in all of these moments. A very entertaining horror film. The film seems to offer up something to gross out and disturb everyone, the mark of any horror film. The effects are top-notch.

","This film tells the story of Christine Brown, a woman of modest origins who, wishing to ascend socially by a job promotion and feeling despised by the rich boyfriend's parents, turns out to be responsible for the misery of an old (and disgusting) Hungarian gypsy, Mrs. Ganush. In retaliation, she goes after Christine and casts on her a terrible curse that threatens, in just three days, shoot with her soul into the depths of Hell.<br/><br/>This film marks the return of Sam Raimi to horror movies where he was so happy in the past, with hits such as ""Evil Dead"", a film that he will revisit here, in some scenes and details. Yes, because he not only directs this film as it is also one of the main responsible for its screenplay. From the middle of the cast we can highlight two names that really shone: the first is Lorna Raver, a veteran actress with a huge talent who has done most of her career in theater, despite some discreet parts in movies. By participating in this film in the role of the main antagonist, Mrs. Ganush, I dare to say that she did her most prominent role in the industry so far, and that was a very wise bet: she managed to make a truly disgusting and loathsome character, which contributes greatly to the dramatic tension. Another name that deserves congratulations is Alison Lohman, who plays the protagonist, Christine Brown, and easily captures our sympathy, making a psychologically complex character who will pass through an ""evolution"" during the film, becoming more altruistic. Another thing that makes Lohman deserve congratulations is the fact that she have done almost every scenes of the film without stunts.<br/><br/>I think many people haven't understood this film. I recognize that it uses many ""recipes"" and ""formulas"" used in other horror movies and it can become a movie more predictable... but I think this is a minor problem compared to the modern and absolutely pornographic oceans of blood, vomit and guts that we can see in some films. That didn't bring anything positive to the art of horror cinema but, in these days, it's easier to scares by that way than using more elaborate means. Maybe that's why ""Drag Me to Hell"" didn't achieve the recognition I think its deserves. It's a movie that works well and scares us, puts us under stress, anxious and nervous, as if we felt that Brown's punishment was too hard for the mistake she made. The ending is somewhat predictable, in fact: Brown is the only one who seems to think she can easily escape the fury that came for her. Despite this, and some comic details, it's a great horror film."

However, I laughed instead, all while getting the creeps sometimes shortly after laughing! Raimi can do that to you! This film threw me off, I thought Raimi was done with doing movies like this! Now even though I'm very familiar with Sam Raimi's style and loved the Evil Dead series as well as Dark man. But after seeing his film, The Gift, I expected this to follow the formula of that film, which was a serious take on the supernatural as in films like The Exorcist, and The Unborn, etc. But don't expect total macabre with Drag me to Hell. It's a film Id compare to the Evil Dead films. Typical Sam Raimi here and in the end, I was very entertained. I laughed a lot during watching the film, all while the others who saw it with me covered their eyes.<br/><br/>Now this isn't some campy Creep show type film.

","Sam Raimi's long awaited return to the genre that made him isn't so much a scary movie as it is a roller-coaster ride of jumps, laughs and retching that will serve as a reminder to many of us why his ridiculous brand of horror has so sorely been missed.<br/><br/>In ""Drag Me To Hell,"" Christine (Alison Lohman), a young career girl with a big promotion in sight and a devoted boyfriend (Justin Long), finds herself at the receiving end of the Devil's pimp slap. It seems as though an elderly woman (Lorna Raver) whom she denied a loan extension to has burdened her with a curse that gives her three miserable days before she is, well, dragged to Hell.<br/><br/>Without a doubt, Raimi is in full-form here, and in spite of its PG-13 rating, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is a hilariously outrageous and intense experience much in the vein of the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. Not only is the film precise in its effort to creep us out (Lorna Raver steals the show), it gives us a relateable heroine to root for and plenty of over-the-top and flat-out gross effects that only serve as the icing on the cake. Its running time will breeze by as you'll find yourself jumping for joy and trying to wipe the smirk off of your fan-boy face as you find a director who is truly in his element here. While the severe amount of hype that arrived in its wake may be too much for some to bare, it's a film that, if approached in the right mind-set (hint: lower your expectations and avoid all reviews -- even this one (oops!)) will prove to be a rewarding experience and easily one of the most entertaining horror movies in recent memory."

","After directing the infamous 'The Evil Dead', a childishly ghoulish ultra-violent splatter film, Sam Raimi then moved on to more serious projects, such as 'The Gift' and the 'Spiderman' trilogy. With all that going for him, he inexplicably decided to conjure up this deplorable garbage. The perhaps unintentionally comic moments are far more effective than the cheap thrills and shocks.<br/><br/>While 'Evil Dead' could be forgiven for its originality in the special effects department, and for the fact that there are some truly dark moments, ""Drag Me To Hell"" goes far too over the top with its repulsive graphics, with several scenes revolving around vomit, blood, mucus or some other unmentionable bodily fluids.<br/><br/>Although supporting actor Justin Long gives a remarkable performance – particularly towards the end – the rest of the cast have nothing special to offer.

However, it just isn't good, as camp nor as terror.<br/><br/>The gypsy curse plot can only go so far without requiring some shaking up, and DMTH is void of any form of twist to make it interesting, instead feeling like something typical in a half-hour segment of the Twilight Zone. The gore is relatively subdued (it is PG-13), and when it does show up in one ""eye-popping"" scene, its laughably CGI. It's hard to tell whether or not it actually wanted to be laughable, especially in one scene where a demon dances on a table, or an attack via handkercheif.<br/><br/>Credit where credit is due, Drag Me to Hell has some creepy bits, especially in the first half, but the movie just tailspins into stupidity. I really don't understand how this is so highly rated other than pure Raimi fanboyism. If you're a horror movie buff, you'll probably find something in this movie that you haven't seen in a long time, living in the environment of far too many PG-13 horror wannabes, but other than some nostalgia, this is a very run of the mill and forgettable horror flick."

Alas, where would we be without opinions. So, here's mine: Drag Me To Hell is irrefutably terrible. ""Modern day classic""...are you actually kidding me? It's just insanity. A loan officer is cursed after not extending a mortgage for an elderly woman which, after three days, will result in her being dragged down to hell. You can give me the ""Raimi resurrected his classic comedy horror"" or ""it's supposed to be campy"" excuses all you like, trust me I've heard them all. But after watching this four times throughout my life, I just cannot comprehend the adoration for this ""horror"". To purposefully make a film that's designed to be bad makes no sense to me. There's no enjoyment. No thrills. No legitimate scares. Heck, it's not even nostalgic Everything, and I mean everything, is abysmal. Lohman's acting, Raimi's unfocused direction, excessive jump scares, horrific visual effects, the obtusely dull conclusion, monotonous screenplay and the formulaic premise. The persistence of utilising the elderly woman's mouth to excrete maggots, flavoursome juices and probably discharge was wholly unnecessary. Way too many gross moments. It seemed Raimi loved reusing the same scenes to create laughs, whether it be ripping Lohman's hair or people whispering ""Lammmmiaaaaaa"", except it failed to make me laugh. The jump scares themselves just come out of nowhere, to the point where after the tenth scare you start to predict the film's next move. Do not even get me started on the goat seance. I will say the ghost slap at the start of the film was perfect, the sound effect was just beautiful. Seriously though, have I missed something? Honestly? Because as far as I'm aware, a bad film is a bad film. Whether you're intentionally creating atrocities or not. Residing in Hell would be more fun that watching this again. 'Army of Darkness' this is not."

Incredibly bloody and incredibly silly, those low budget schlock fests are huge cult favourites, and are considered by many cine-buffs to be amongst the greatest horror comedies of all time. Drag Me To Hell is Raimi's return to the genre that made his name, and is every bit as funny and frightening as his reputation would suggest it should be.<br/><br/>Put plainly, this movie is utterly absurd. It's being marketed as a straight horror film, but nothing could be further from the truth. Just consider the premise for a second: a demon is being denied a mortgage extension! In reality, Drag Me To Hell is a cheesy, gratuitous horror comedy filled with intentionally dodgy special effects, more gross out gags than you can shake a stick at, and, at one point, a talking goat. After the disappointment that was Spiderman 3, it's good to see Raimi at the top of his game once more; it's been fifteen years since Army of Darkness (the third Evil Dead film), but from the opening scene of this movie fans will recognize his signature campy style. The camera work is a testament to B-movies; the quick zooms and slow tilts are glorious to behold. The movie is gross hell, although in hindsight it's actually not that bloody. Instead, Raimi uses a bevy of other thing to disgust his audience and torment his protagonist – maggots, bile, flies, eyeballs – take you pick! But as well as being hilarious, Drag Me To Hell is also at times legitimately frightening. I am a big fan of classic horror, but in recent years I have found myself bemoaning the lack of decent entries in this Saw dominated era. Maybe it's just me, but I find little entertaining about watching people get tortured for two hours – it's not scary, nor is it any fun. My favourite horror films have always been a mixture of horror and comedy; aside from the Evil Dead films, movies like Child's Play or Scream or even Gremlins (that movie is PG, but it's still far scarier and more suspenseful than anything from Eli Roth). Drag Me To Hell reminds me of films like these; slow suspenseful build followed by a jump scare. It's good to see the old tropes in use again, things like shadows, the wind and thunder. At the same time, Raimi completely subverts the whole idea of a jump scare, using items like a phone or a handkerchief to provide the shock. This is not the kind of scary movie that will leave you with nightmares, but while you're watching it you certainly get your money's worth.<br/><br/>I should point out that fans of Evil Dead will enjoy this movie on a whole other level. Drag Me To Hell is filled with homage's and references to that trilogy, so much so that many scenes could be have been lifted out and inserted directly into Evil Dead 2. Come to think of it, my only real complaint about this movie is that there was no Bruce Campbell cameo! But even those who have never seen a Raimi movie before can still have a hell of a lot of fun. All in all, Drag Me To Hell is hands down one of the most entertaining horror films I have seen since I first saw the original Evil Dead. Funny when it wants to be, scary when it needs to be and stupendously campy throughout, this film is a repulsive, over the top tour de force, and a return to form for Sam Raimi, the master of excessive horror."

","This comment may contain ""spoilers."" I've tried to tell just enough to glean your interest and convey the premise of the plot -- but in doing this, I may reveal more than you want me to.<br/><br/>This film caught me from the very beginning. A young Mexican boy is attacked by an unseen entity as his parents and an unidentified woman look on helplessly. He plummets from a balcony, falling on the tile floor below. But, he is not killed by the fall. I expected him to get up and run. Suddenly, the floor itself begins to crack open, I could see the flames from Hell, and then the boy is literally ""dragged to Hell."" The unidentified Mexican woman who witnessed all this hangs over the edge of the balcony watching the boy's fate. The demon has won. The woman has one thing to say, ""We will meet again."" Fade out. Credits. Action continues years later. At least one person was hooked already (me).<br/><br/>The story centers on Christine who works for a bank. She is hoping to get a promotion, but faces competition from another, a male, employee. She wants to convince her boss that she is ""tough enough"" to take on the responsibilities of the new position. Enter an elderly woman. The bank is about to foreclose on her house. She entreats our heroine for mercy (literally getting on her knees at one point) so she doesn't lose her home. Please, give her just a little more time to pay. Not wanting to look ""soft,"" Christine refuses more time.<br/><br/>The old woman is ""escorted"" from the bank by two armed guards! I don't want to include too many ""spoilers."" It suffices to add that the old woman is not happy with Christine's treatment of her. She places a curse on Christine. The curse involves the unseen demon who killed the Mexican boy in the opening scene. The curse will take exactly 3 days to culminate. In methodic fashion, Christine experiences increasingly blatant demonic manifestations. A likable fortune teller/medium becomes involved. This medium takes Christine to the Mexican woman of the opening scene.<br/><br/>Christine has 3 days to either doom or to overcome The Curse.<br/><br/>Sheesh! It really hurts me to read some of the reviews here. Horror films are MORE than blood & gore -- they are a genre. As a genre (like Westerns, SciFi, Romances, Comedies) they come in many sizes and shapes. It amazes me how pompous and (almost) cruel some people can sound in their critiques. I guess some people love to ""bash."" I found this to be one of most fun, interesting, original, and camp horror films of the past decade or so. I believe it will become a cult favorite, and it is worthy to become a ""classic."" The writing was excellent. It was in no way ""overdone."" There is a LOT of tongue in cheek humor. I've viewed this again and again (about 8 times now), and continue to pick up on little nuances.<br/><br/>I do not believe this horror film was necessarily meant to ""terrify"" the audience; I believe it was meant to DELIGHT them and to elicit a balance of humor, expectation, and satisfaction. Perhaps those last two words ""expectation"" and ""satisfaction"" are beyond the appreciation of some of those who have posted here.<br/><br/>When it comes to horror, most of it has been ""done before"" in some shape or fashion. The key to excellence rests not on originality of subject matter as much as on originality of presentation. Give this a moment's thought. Take films such as the original FRANKENSTIEN, ROSEMARY'S BABY, INVASION OF THE BODY SNATCHERS, or THE EXORCIST. Each of these films has had ample imitators and ""wanna be""s. What distinguishes each of these classics is their originality. In each case, that originality is different. These films presented material in a new and different way -- that is what makes them classics.<br/><br/>I said that, in each case, the originality was ""different."" At first, that may baffle some readers; the simple truth is: ORIGINALITY, by definition, is ALWAYS ""different,"" that's what makes something original.<br/><br/>I found this film refreshing and original in how it was scripted and presented. It is an excellent balance of humor, spoof, earnest acting, and sheer delight.<br/><br/>I encourage anyone interested enough to read this to check it out for yourself. ""To Hell"" with all the would be critics (pun intended) -- that includes me. You may find it a fun, rewarding experience."

","After reading many user reviews regarding this movie, I cant believe all the negative feedback. I watched this movie with no pretentious head on and I really enjoyed this movie. This is a movie not to analyze every scene, its a throwback horror and it's a breath of fresh air. Sam Raimi I must admit Im not a huge fan, but I did enjoy this movie as I did with his previous Evil Dead movie. The acting in Drag Me To Hell is solid , the visuals are decent and the pace keeps you watching. I found some of the scenes very funny, for example the scene in the car park when the old lady attacks Christine and loses her teeth. This is a horror/comedy and that was funny, as is the seance scene with the talking goat and the dancing. People found this silly...Well just to let you know its meant to be , its a horror comedy. In an age of many over the top dull , depressing and pretentious movies this is a throwback and is a lot of fun. The ending I wont reveal to anyone, but it isn't obvious and ''caps off'' not a classic but a fun movie. Critics, I agree did go overboard but it still is enjoyable. It isn't really scary except for a few jumpy moments and it isn't a masterpiece but it isn't terrible just watch it as its meant to be viewed and you will have a fun time...."
"mattboy61992","7","3","6","20 September 2009"," Finally, something original
","When I saw Drag Me to Hell, I thought it was very well-made and decent. The main reason I loved this movie because it was something original, which is rare in the horror movie business these days. So far, this is one of the best movies of the year.<br/><br/>I had really high expectations going into this movie, despite the fact that it was a horror movie that was rated PG-13. I was excited because it was made by the same people who made The Evil Dead, which is one of my all-time favorite horror movies. Also, Alison Lohman, who plays the lead, wasn't the girl screaming and whimpering multiple times, she was someone who was determined and took risks to get what she wanted. Lorna Raver, who plays Mrs. Ganush, the villain, was creepy as hell. No pun intended.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie is very well-done, the scary scenes had perfect timing, and the story was well-structured. It was a horror movie that knew its tone, which was a bit campy. This is definitely one horror movie to check out.<br/><br/>Rating: 7.5/10"
"kmier-2","8","3","6","25 August 2009"," Scary as ""Hell""
","Some people have been anticipating director Sam Raimi's return to the horror genre (while he's produced some horror flicks, including ""The Grudge"" and ""Boogeyman"", he's taken a long hiatus from horror films; after ""Army of Darkness"" in 1992, he's directed such movies as ""For Love of the Game"", ""Spider-Man"", and the soon-to-come ""World of Warcraft"" movie), while some have not. Do not agree with the latter. It's very scary from beginning to end, along with its bits of dark humor and creepy moments (after all, we are talking about Sam ""The Evil Dead"" Raimi, aren't we?).<br/><br/>""Drag Me to Hell"" is the story of Christine Brown (played by Alison Lohman), a bank loaner whom, as the tagline claims ""a good job, a great boyfriend, and a bright future"". Unfortunately, all that changes when she denies an old woman's loan. As payback, the old lady decides to put a curse on her, putting her life in a bit of disarray. Although she still has the job at the bank, the horror her curse brings begins to grow worser and worser every day. Is she dragged to hell? You'll have to find out for yourself.<br/><br/>This is one of the best horror movies of the year, for many reasons. It doesn't require blood to scare you (at least not too much), and lets the moments creep you when it wants to, and, it's also original. So, to say the least, Sam Raimi has not failed to scare us, and he's doing it again here. So, Sam, please don't make us wait for another horror film from you that long. Otherwise, bravo!"
"Hawley_Griffin","8","3","6","20 August 2009"," Sam Raimi, finally away from a Spiderman movie
","Wow. I can't believe it's been 9 years since the last time Sam Raimi's name was up on the marquees on anything non-Spiderman related. I can't believe his distinctive camera style once again seems so refreshing and potent when applied to other genres other than the naturally bombastic superhero stories.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell has a storyline which could have easily been taken from an EC Horror comic from the '50s. In keeping with the nostalgic material, the movie even has the old '80s Universal logo. Allison Lohman portrays the damsel in distress, a loan officer who turns down and humiliates an old gypsy lady for fear of losing a job promotion. The gypsy, as gypsies tend to do, gives her an evil three-day curse. During these three days, the girl will see the old hag's face come out of nearly everything, from a cake to a cell phone screen. She will also be chased around by shadowy horned devils. When those three days are over, she WILL be dragged down to the depths of hell.<br/><br/>As good Horror movies always should, this one uses fantasy as a mask for a message, and that message is about capitalism, greed and what we'd be willing to put at stake for personal gain. Raimi mocks the protagonist viciously, showing her as a blank slate of a perfect, smiling, straight-out-of-high-school girl and then deconstructing that by showing us a nervous being who's desperate to escape her country roots and depressing family life. Although the movie is hardly big on character development, Raimi gives the audience enough hints about this to make it the film's major theme apart from itself. True, Catherine is not a bad person, and ultimately doesn't deserve everything that happens to her, but it's her selfishness what gets her into trouble. And that same absorbed behavior is what she needs to break free of the curse, a process which involves harming others who are no more guilty than herself.<br/><br/>Ultimately, though, Drag Me to Hell is all about the set pieces. It's a loud, shrieking movie from beginning to end and it features talking goats, swallowing embalming fluid and eye-stapling. Although definitively not as gory as any of the Evil Dead films (even less than Army of Darkness), there's a trend of extreme slapstick physical violence which is bound to get most movie audiences (that is, people not as desensitized as me) to cover their eyes and go ""ewww"" - which is what most were doing at my showing. Raimi's magic is how he can get a scene to be physically intense and morbid while at the same time showing the ridiculousness of the fictional movie strings that are holding it together. On that balance, the only one who can claim to challenge him is Tarantino. But QT loses because he never capped off a Horror scene by stealing a trick out of the Looney Tunes."
"LoneWolfAndCub","9","3","6","24 July 2009"," Drag Me to the Next Screening
","It is about bloody time Sam Raimi returned to what he does best: insanely awesome, scary, tense, funny, gross horror!! Ever since I first saw and fell in love with The Evil Dead three years ago I knew Raimi was a master at scaring people one minute and making them laugh the very next. Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness only proved my theory further. But after Army of Darkness there was a long break from horror, which was not a bad thing, as he made some excellent movies in this time (The Quick and the Dead, A Simple Plan and Spiderman 2). So, after 17 years he has returned with Drag Me to Hell, a terrific comeback and one of the best (and the most original) horror movies since 2000. What makes this film so good is that Raimi knows what he is doing, what he wants and who he is making this for. As he said in an interview I recently saw, he does not make these movies for art snobs, but for the horror crowd of which he says are the most welcoming of audiences. Everything from his flawless direction, the fast pace, a strong story as written by the Raimi brothers and a solid cast combine to make this a movie worth seeing more than once! Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer gunning for the assistant manager position, but has to compete with the new guy, Stu Rubin, for it. Her boss mentions that he is not afraid to make the tough decisions, and that she should think about that while working. Unfortunately for her, the tough decision she makes involves Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) and this does not end well for her when Mrs. Ganush places the Lamia curse on her. This curse will lead her into hell if she can't find a way to get rid of it, and it does not help her boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) is skeptical.<br/><br/>What follows is a non-stop, freaky, funny, disgusting roller-coaster ride that leads to an astonishing ending. Lohman does not get a rest as she is thrown around like a rag doll, berated, vomited on and has various body fluids spray onto her and into her mouth. All this is completely over the top, and is incredibly funny, however, Raimi does manage to pack some genuine scares. He knows how to seriously ratchet up the horror, and he knows how to work the camera to his advantage (much like he did in The Evil Dead).<br/><br/>Alison Lohman does a fine job of portraying Christine and the character arc that she goes through. Lohman is able to bring the charm and diversity to the part, she sure can scream! Justin Long is good as usual and manages to keep his role interesting rather than clichéd, had it not been handled correctly. Lorna Raver is just plain amazing as the villain of the piece, she is just so frightening and really, kudos should go to her for her hard work. Also, Dileep Rao (as Rham Jas, the Medium) is convincing in his supporting, but important, role.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is a complete success, a fantastic movie that encompasses everything that makes horror great fun! The audience I saw it with had a great time, with scream, laughs and groans of disgust resounding throughout! 4½/5"

"Aaron1375","8","3","6","2 June 2009"," Sam Rami shows how to make a horror movie with comedy.
","This movie was a very good horror movie, the best I have went to see all year. I was a bit guarded about it at first when it received a pg-13 rating instead of an R, however it is most likely a rather hard rating as I am sure just a bit more and it would have been an R. The only thing it really lacks is a lot of cussing and there is no nudity and there are no trees raping girls as in the evil dead movies. This movie has a cute loan officer in line for a promotion at her job, it is between her and a very unlikable butt kisser. Well in walks a very frail looking and somewhat gross old lady who has a problem, she needs her loan extended because her house is about to be repossessed. She goes to her boss and he tells her it is up to her, so she takes the hard line and denies the request. To make matters worse when the old lady proceeds to beg for an extension the girl calls security on her and the old lady really gets mean at this point. We have a rather nifty scene in a parking garage that is rather disturbing and oddly humorous at the same time and a curse is set in motion, one that at the end of three day drags the one who is cursed straight to hell!!! So for the rest of the movie the girl desperately tries to overcome the curse with almost all of her attempts failing miserably. You also get camera angles and scares that will make one think about the evil dead movies and the humor should be familiar to any who have seen the evil dead movies as well. Though I thought the scene at the parent's house would have been more funny. Overall I enjoyed the movie, I did not care for a couple of plot points however which is why I gave the movie an 8 also a couple of effects looked a bit to fake for my tastes. Still, the way it ends is very well done, basically you get a sense of dread as you can plainly see there is nothing to be done, but watch. However, I can see a possibility of a sequel too."

","Just got back from the cinema after seeing this! As a huge fan of the Evil Dead trilogy and Sam Raimi i was obviously very excited about seeing this film! I was not at all disappointed! Part of me was slightly worried when I heard about the film because part of me thought ""After all these years doing Spiderman can Raimi pull it off again?"" After watching the answer is simply yes.<br/><br/>The film blends genuine shocks and scares with an enjoyable plot and Raimi's trademark black humour. You will jump out of your seat and then laugh within the same scene.<br/><br/>Lohman's character in the film is also a very likable heroine, a refreshing change to the usual teens thrown in the film JUST to get killed. You felt for her character and were completely gripped in her struggle. She was backed up with great performances from Lorna Raver as Mrs Ganush and Justin Long as her boyfriend. You feel Lohman is Raimi's new Campbell in this film, a fresh actress which he can chuck anything at and torture all she wants and she'll keep going.<br/><br/>I'll stop now to avoid spoiling the plot but if you like Evil Dead and Raimi then this film is pretty perfect!

","Sam Raimi sinks this project fast right away in the prologue, when a bunch of Mexicans are dragged to Hell with excessive and silly special effects. Here might be a good ending, making the boredom 4 minutes. <br/><br/>Mr. Raimi undercuts dramatic development by making the evil gypsy woman 100% ugly, disgusting, and prone to biting people's faces with her rotted teeth. She could have been presented with some sympathy for her very real plight of being evicted from her lifelong (and shabby) home at a very old age. But no, she's painted as a pain-in-the-neck with bad teeth.<br/><br/>Mr. Raimi seems obsessed with vomit, so let's talk about that. The big vomit scene might have been where she pukes up her dead pussycat, whole and covered with fur. But Raimi can't restrain himself, so before this he has the girl vomit up buckets of blood, hundreds of houseflies, and a bathroom towel. Not disgusting, not horrible, just boring. I'm not getting emotionally involved with a girl who gets into multiple vomit scenes as if it's her #1 priority in life. It's bad enough she has a weight problem and could delve into an ice cream overdose any minute.<br/><br/>Because of Mr Raimi's commitment to excess, he's developed no skills at building suspense, and the one-and-only fright factor is the old trick of quickly throwing something in the audience's face while suddenly making a loud noise on the soundtrack. Pitiful!<br/><br/>Make no mistake, Mr. Raimi's movies are for (and by) morons. Truly, there isn't even a laugh-at-the-bad-movie value in this mess."

He has hit a perfect balance between scares and laughs, just like he did with ED 2. This film feels very much like a cousin of the ED trilogy. I haven't been so tense watching a film in a long time, there are some seriously scary moments in this film, then some genuinely funny ones, in true Raimi fashion. It's brilliantly shot, paced and acted! I for one will never p**s off a gypsy, you can count on that! I'll be honest and say I did expect it to be a bit more ""insane"" from all the over the top reviews I'd read, but I don't know if my heart would have lasted the full 99 minutes if it had been. Poor Alison Lohman's character, she really doesn't deserve the horror she endures in this film, she really is a sweet, kind woman. Which makes it all the more insane when she starts to suffer at the hand of the evil Lahmia (spelling????) that comes for her soul! I did see the ""twist"" coming a mile off though, and everyone goes on about the ""stella"" ending, I found it a bit weak considering, but I guess it was only meant to be a ""1 last scare"" thing, when I wanted mayhem! LOL. Either way, I cannot wait to see it again, without expectations, as I believe I will truly fall in love with this film when I do!

So, after 5 years of hype surrounding how excellent a return-to-form this film was for Raimi, I finally sat down to watch. <br/><br/>Frankly, the balance between horror and comedy is WAY off. We're supposed to be menaced by, or afraid of, the gypsy woman. But her entire introduction came across as a terrible attempt at gross-out humor. This continued in the parking garage, where the gypsy woman tries to gum the protagonist's face. These were the wrong decisions, implemented with poor consideration for pacing and tone.<br/><br/>The same applies to the ""shooting blood"" scene in the bank. It was intended to be humorous, since I can't imagine that Raimi actually thinks blood shoots out like that. But as soon as we get into the sense that it's supposed to be a darkly humorous scene, the tone shifts 180 degrees again, and we're supposed to take it seriously.<br/><br/>This film simply fails to find the right balance, and the right time to attempt striking that balance."

Also, the little boy in the beginning of the movie died because of stealing (even when the parents returned the thing, he couldn't be forgiven).<br/><br/>But that alone doesn't make this movie a bad horror movie to me.

","Drag Me to Hell (2009) Desperate for a promotion, loans manager Christine (Lohman) refuses an elderly customer, only to become the subject of a terrifying gypsy curse that will see her dragged to hell by a demon called the Lamia...sounds good? yes it does but it is not a good film it's neither scary or suspenseful why don't i like it? simple there is an annoying overabundance to using unrealistic digital visual effects which are not only glaringly fake they seem taken from another film entirely perhaps Mr Raimi should have stuck to the method of 'less is more' why cant Sam Raimi stick to what he's good at the Spider= man films come to mind,"

","Although the ending was rather pedestrian (especially considering who the director was), I thought THE GIFT was a decent movie. Nothing to write home about, to be sure, but a minor diversion on a minor scale. The rough cut of A SIMPLE PLAN that I saw was likewise well crafted, but, again, nothing to get worked up over. The second SPIDER-MAN movie had a lot going for it, but it also had an elderly woman hanging from a building by an umbrella (and clobbering Doc Oc), not to mention yet another outing of a masked superhero (is Maguire claustrophobic?), so it, too, was a mixed bag. Cribbing from everything from CURSE OF THE DEMON to THE EXORCIST to THE HAUNTING and THE LEGEND OF HELL HOUSE (as well as several of the Japanese horror movies that've made the rounds the last couple of years), DRAG ME TO HELL is just plain bad. It's almost as if Raimi were sleepwalking his way through this one- or feeling his way along blindly. The ""big scares"" are about as uninspired as something from a Knob Zombie movie. A big disappointment."

"chaos-rampant","Null","3","7","3 October 2009"," Raimi delivers Evil Dead balance between shock horror and grotesque humor.
","Imagine a group of unsuspecting honest godfearing citizens and their meek housewives invited for a test screening of Drag Me To Hell in a remote suburban theater, doused in acid, and forced to watch the movie in a humongous screen that occupies their entire vision, surrounded by a wall of speakers 20 feet high, sound booming out on all directions in the levels of a Jumbo Jet taking off. No quarter asked and none given. No escape, no bejesus left in the end. This is the perverse pleasure I take from Sam Raimi's latest. The gleeful satisfaction of being scared out of your skin and watching others being scared out of their skins along with you. I'm talking shivers and palpitations and your guts relocating in your urethra, pure bodily reactions like only porn, fierce substance abuse, and meeting a gang of drunken Hell's Angels in the middle of a raping spree in a dark alley can elicit. And good horror. Inland Empire did it for me but Inland Empire is subversive and hallucinatory whereas Drag Me To Hell is a celebration of horror in its purest generic/traditional form, at once a homage to Sam Raimi's movies and those he grew up on and a beast that feels completely fresh and modern. Raimi throws every trick in the old horror book but does it with such conviction ferocity and sheer deranged pleasure you'd think he was locked up in an attic after Evil Dead for 25 years without food and water and no release until he came up with something to chill the bones of the worst sonofabitch out there. And this is what he came up with. A sheer act of cinematic vengeance. While former horror pallbearers like Romero scratch their heads trying to figure out what made their movies work 30 years ago while their fanbases evaporate in apologetic frustration, three Spider Mans later and Raimi positions himself ahead of the game. The first 30-40 minutes are pure ecstatic horror bliss. The spirit of Jacques Tourneur and Night of the Demon lives side by side with modern horror hijinks, loud jump scares around every corner, curtains blowing in the wind and iron gates rattling, old gypsy curses and Baphomet shadows swirling around, the faces of old women cackling maniacally, pure hellish Armageddon, no quarter asked and none given. Raimi orchestrates a symphony of terror playing in a feverish pitch. Even the occasional comedic relief required to break the nerve-wracking intensity and make the movie watchable is nothing short of blood geysers, toothless jaws oozing slime, anvil-smashed faces and flying eyeballs. Awesome."
"Kinetek","8","3","7","2 October 2009"," Off The Wall
","If you're anything like me, then you remember the good old days of Betamax. If you're quite like me, then you knew of an old video rental place that would hire 'video nasties'. If you're just like me, the first one you got your hands on was The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>It was the stuff of legend - the horror movie that most parents wouldn't let their teenage kids watch - under NO circumstances. Perhaps it was the demonic voices. Perhaps it was the pencil scene. Perhaps it was 'that scene' involving the tree. Who knows. Nonetheless, we got to watch it anyhow - and boy did we rave on about it when we did.<br/><br/>Some 28 years on (yes, I know) and it is still considered (and rightly so) as one of the best horror flicks the world has ever seen. Then there was Evil Dead II, which was just as good but with a little more humour, then Evil Dead III which was just as good again - but this time completely off the wall.<br/><br/>And I guess you could sum Raimi up like that - a little off the wall. He loves to scare you witless, then make you laugh a little, just before scaring you out of your seat again. So when I heard rumour that he was 'going back to his roots' with Drag Me To Hell, I licked my lips in anticipation. Despite several attempts to watch this in the theatre, I never got the chance. Nonetheless, I have finally managed to watch it on DVD - the question is... what's it like?<br/><br/>Well, fans of the Evil Dead franchise (if there is such a thing) will be squealing with delight over this outing. Imagine that Betamax was still in your living room. Imagine that little video store was still open for business and imagine the guy who works there just hired you a copy. Sit back and prepare to jump more often than a cricket for the next couple of hours.<br/><br/>The look and feel of the movie is very much that of an age gone by - it relies on the simpler vehicles to get what it wants from the viewer, namely misdirection, REALLY loud noises and the now trademark 'Raimi Slant' camera angles to create a feeling of vertigo. There is a nice combination of CGI and prosthetic work here, but sadly no plasticine (if you know, you know).<br/><br/>There is plenty of viscera - be it blood, maggots, bile or other unknown, unearthly liquids - and it makes for a whole lot of fun. The humour that is sadly lacking in some of Raimi's later outings has returned with a vengeance here, he clearly has missed grossing people out and then making them belly laugh right after.<br/><br/>The acting is deliberately confused and dizzy, and the backdrops are straight out of a 50's horror movie - you almost expect Cushing or Karloff to walk out onto set at any moment. The overall feel is that of impending doom at every turn and it doesn't give the viewer a moment's rest from the outset - which is something I have personally missed in horror films of late. Did I mention the soundtrack and effects - sheesh...<br/><br/>And so to the plot. What plot? Who cares! This is a SAM RAIMI movie for goodness sake! Girl gets cursed, chaos and madness ensues... THAT'S ALL YOU NEED TO KNOW! Yes you'll see the end coming, and yes you've read the script before you've heard it - but I am not rating this movie on it's 'artistic contribution' or 'aesthetics' - I'm rating it on the basis that it really does do what it says on the tin - and that is scare the bejeebus out of you!<br/><br/>So, a final note to all horror fans out there - if you haven't caught a viewing of Drag Me To Hell yet, I advise that you do it - NOW. If you wondered what all the fuss was about with The Evil Dead series, but are a little wet behind the ears - double march to your local store pronto.<br/><br/>And finally to Mr. Raimi (if you're reading) - please, please, PLEASE make more horror flicks and show the pretentious wannabes that claim the throne these days how it's REALLY done.<br/><br/>Enough of my yakking. I rate Drag Me To Hell at 8.1 / 10 - and that is a meaty score for a meaty movie. Awesome stuff!!"
"Superunknovvn","7","3","7","27 September 2009"," You don't like horror, if you don't like this movie
","It's come to a point where I had forgotten that Sam Raimi was once an important figure to the horror genre. Sure, the ""Spider-Man"" movies were all nice and entertaining, but what really had made the man a legend was the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy. When Raimi produced all these awful little horror movies (""Boogeyman"" anyone?) I was about to think we had imagined all this time that he ever had any taste. Along comes ""Drag Me To Hell"", the most entertaining horror movie in a LONG time, to prove me wrong.<br/><br/>Let me just make a list of things that I love the most about this movie:<br/><br/>1) The script is original, i.e. the story is not about a ghostly girl, zombies, vampires, a slasher or a torture chamber in Eastern Europe. No. This is fresh. For once a movie involving curses, séances and demons is GOOD. When has that ever happened before? The pacing is just right, the characters are fleshed out and believable. In a word: perfect.<br/><br/>2) The cast is great. Alison Lohman is adorable as the warm-hearted main character who has so many bad things happening to her. Justin Long does a good job at portraying her loyal boyfriend. Lorna Raver is just creepy. THIS is how icons are being born. You don't just put a killer with a gimmicky mask into a below average horror movie. You need a great story and someone like Raver to create a cult.<br/><br/>3) Raimi's direction is masterful with just the right balance between some signature tricks and very original angles and camera movements. The score is great, too. You don't think too much about it, it just works.<br/><br/>4) Most of all: ""Drag Me To Hell"" is so much fun without ever being funny. It's almost more like an adventure movie in the vein of ""Raiders Of The Lost Ark"". Sure there are jumps, sure it's disgusting at times - but ""Drag Me To Hell"" is really about the adventure, and it never makes any excuses for it. That's just adorable, and few screenwriters/directors can pull something like this off. The ending may be predictable, but it's still a pleasure to watch, especially since you're rooting so much for the heroine.<br/><br/>Now, if there is one thing to complain about it's the CGI. Raimi makes too much use of it and it never looks completely convincing. In fact a lot of the shock sequences look rather silly. If only they could redo these scenes in question and maybe tone down the gross-factor on a few sound effects. At times less would have been more.<br/><br/>Still, ""Drag Me To Hell"" is everything a horror movie should be, except for maybe scary. That may sound like I'm kidding, but I'm not. The cheap thrills, the good time - it's all here. Please, Mr. Raimi, PLEASE: Keep making movies like this one. In these awfully uncreative, narrow-minded times horror needs you back on board."
"berryj6","8","3","7","6 September 2009"," Finally, American horror lightens up and goes back to the infamous days
","Outside the golden gates of Hollywood Sam Raimi, best known for the Spiderman trilogy, is something of a horror legend. He originally gained fame for his openly grimy and dirty video nasties, which soared into the ranks of cult status. But now, after a hiatus of 15 years, he has finally gone back to his roots with the eerily delightful Drag Me to Hell.<br/><br/>The simple story of Christine Young, a lawyer who is cursed by a gypsy, seems somewhat formulaic, but to me I find it is purposely so. It's frank use of stereotypes and corny economic messages provide a quiet underlying chuckle throughout the film. My favourite example is in the title, as poor Christine has four days to break the curse or she will be dragged, kicking and screaming, to the red-hot bowels of hell.<br/><br/>During her journey, every imaginable horror device is utilised magnificently, intensified by thrillingly creative visuals. One sequence depicts an eyeball lodged in cake, with the jam and cream as the blood and pus. All this supplies a rich tone and novelty to what is considered a dated and exploited genre. The traditional and overstated score is almost of parody of sorts, with harsh, sudden screeches from violins adding an extra few centimetres to that jump in your seat. Because, believe me, there are many noteworthy frights to be found in Drag Me to Hell, some straight out of the horror textbook, some unique and bizarrely humorous. Refreshing, aptly concise and damn-right original."
"TOMNEL","9","3","7","30 May 2009"," Fans of Sam Raimi or the horror genre in general should be in for a real treat.
","After Sam Raimi's last film, Spiderman 3, which can be considered by many to be a disappointment to Spiderman fans, Raimi decides to direct something completely different. Going back to his roots in horror, Raimi directs this film with the precision of the Evil Dead films, only this is much scarier than either of those films. And, to top that off, Sam Raimi uses his typical tongue in cheek style, that was largely missing from the first two Spiderman films, but all too present in the third, and he uses just the right amount here, never going extremely over the top, but reaching close many times. Really, this is the best horror film that's been released in years.<br/><br/>Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) is a loan officer who really wants that new promotion from her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer). But her competition for the promotion is the new guy, a notorious kiss-up, Stu (Reggie Lee). In order to curry her bosses favor, she turns down an old woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), on her third mortgage for her home. Ganush ends up putting a gypsy curse on her that causes her to see a shadowy figure that beats her up and shakes up all the pots and pans and such. After going to a psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), she finds that she has a curse that will drag her to hell in three days. Chaos ensues as she tries to beat this thing, and as her educated boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) begins to see her mentally deteriorating.<br/><br/>This movie has more jump scenes than most horror films do, but these one's actually catch you off guard. In a few scenes, Raimi tries to build the tension, and you know a scare is coming, but in many other scenes there is no way of knowing when something will strike the screen and your heart will start racing. Knowing that horror is better with a pinch of salt, Raimi adds humor throughout the film. The scares are genuine, but the action scenes are usually very funny. This includes random blood squirting, mucus jokes, and a running joke of gumming to the face. And to add to the humorous horror, there is funny dialogue also. It's really an excellent mixture.<br/><br/>The performances were spot on. Allison Lohman plays her performance as a nice girl well, but also manages to portray the characters dark sides. Justin Long is convincing as the boyfriend who is losing faith, but constantly convincing himself that his girlfriend isn't crazy. Dileep Rao as the psychic is great. An actor who was surprisingly amusing was Reggie Lee as the kiss-up co-worker, and he really provides quite a few laughs, despite an over the top performance.<br/><br/>The final touch on the film is the musical score. This had a really pretty score by Christopher Young. It's probably supposed to sound like gypsy music, led by a violin, and as a stand alone score it's still good for a listen.<br/><br/>Overall, this is an effective, oftentimes funny and scary horror film, and an impressive return from Raimi to the genre.<br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 99 mins. PG-13 for some bloody violence."
"ocheremnykh","8","2","4","7 October 2013"," One of the best horror movies I have ever seen
","I just saw this movie on SyFy Channel A very good movie. Plot, directing, editing – everything. One of the best I have ever seen. <br/><br/>Interestingly enough, it is also a very Christian movie. It contains two very powerful – and very Christian - messages. The first one is very simple; the second a bit more complicated. The plot focuses on loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), who tries to impress her boss (and win a promotion to assistant manager position) by 'being tough' and refusing to extend a mortgage to a gypsy woman. Hence, the latter loses her house. In retaliation, the woman places a curse on Christine that, after three days of escalating torment, will plunge her into the depths of Hell to burn for eternity. And, indeed, it does. <br/><br/>Hence, the first message. If you use your neighbor for your sinful purposes – be it money, fame, career advancement, etc. – you will go to Hell. Period. To be saved, you need to love and serve your neighbor, not use her (or him). <br/><br/>The second message is a little more complicated. Being an IT professional, I'd call it a multipart message. The first part is fairly common in American-made horror flicks. It shows how vulnerable to demonic forces is the modern 'post-Christian' American society (the European is vulnerable even more). By removing God, Christianity and the Church (I mean, Roman Catholic Church) from society, it removed all reliable defenses against demonic forces (that are, alas, all too real). <br/><br/>The second part is much more realistic than in your typical Hollywood- made horror movie. Usually, there is a happy ending – at least some characters manage to survive and destroy the demonic force in question (at least for now) without any support from the Church. Which is totally unrealistic as only the Church has enough power to do away with the forces of Evil. <br/><br/>Two notable – and realistic – exceptions are the very recent 'Conjuring' where the Evil is destroyed by a very Catholic exorcism (realistic happy ending) and this one (no less realistic unhappy ending). In this movie, the unfortunate loan officer tries all means available to save herself from inevitable Hell except going to the Church for help. In fact, the Church (or any Christian church, for that matter) is never even mentioned. Which leads to very predictable consequences – when the protagonist thinks she is safe and gets the coveted promotion, Evil suddenly returns and drags her to Hell. <br/><br/>A very Catholic ending. No salvation outside the Church. Period."

"slasherstudios","8","2","4","7 December 2011"," ""Hell"" of a Good Time
","I will start this review off with one simple fact: I love Sam Raimi. I remember staying up late at night as a child watching the original ""Evil Dead"" through the corners of my fingers. It scared the hell out of me but, at the same time, there was something genuinely gratuitously amazing about the film. It was bold, bloody, filled with puss and maggots, and gore. It was incredible. If the nine year old me at the time could have married anything, it would have been The Evil Dead.<br/><br/>After the Evil Dead trilogy, Raimi pretty much stayed away from horror (not including the excellent and sorely underrated ""The Gift""). That is until 2009 when Raimi splashed his way back into the scene with ""Drag Me to Hell."" I'll be the first to admit that I had no desire to see ""Drag Me to Hell."" PG-13? Yawn. Ancient spirits? Double yawn. Justin Long? I think I'm falling asleep already. Little did I know what I had coming.<br/><br/>The plot is relatively simple. Determined to impress her boss and get a much-needed promotion at work, Christine Brown lays down the law when mysterious Mrs. Ganush literally comes begging for mercy at her feet. In retaliation for being publicly shamed, Mrs. Ganush places the dreaded curse of the Lamia on her unfortunate target, transforming Christine's life into a waking nightmare. Her skeptical boyfriend, Clay, casually brushing off her disturbing encounters as mere coincidence, Christine attempts to escape eternal damnation by seeking out the aid of seer Rham Jas. But Christine's time is fast running out, and unless she's able to break the curse, she'll be tormented by a demon for three days before literally being dragged to hell.<br/><br/>What follows is gore, gore, and more gore. How this film was granted a PG-13 I'll never know. A waterfall of a nosebleed, gooey dentures, dancing goats, maggots...if you can imagine it, it's here. The film works as a social satire (the death of the middle and lower classes) and as a horror/comedy (the ritual at the end has to be seen to be believed). The performances are top natch and the ending is quite ballsy in its conviction (you'll see it coming a mile away but will be surprised they actually follow through on it). Overall though, if you love movies like ""The Evil Dead"", ""Army of Darkness"", or ""Cabin Fever"", it's a must watch. It is one of the best horror films of 2009."
"Fishman1966","7","2","4","26 October 2010"," Well, after all, it WAS Sam Raimi
","I remember a few thousand years ago when I first saw Evil Dead, I was a teenager at the time and didn't quite understand the whole horror-as-comedy concept. The beginning of Evil Dead WAS scary, but then it just got silly. ""dead by dawn, dead by dawn"" was ingrained in my brain for months afterward. This movie is very much the same, it starts out good, it starts out scary, the lamia/shadow effects are good. Creepy. Then the girl drops an anvil on Sylvia (Baba?) Ganush's head (ala roadrunner/coyote) and her eyeballs pop out (ala Evil Dead or was it 2?), it went downhill from there. I shouldn't say downhill, just not scary anymore and it got sillier and sillier. Heck, it's Sam Raimi for gosh sakes! I did like the ending, but what kind of bird-brain boyfriend leaves a rare coin on the floor of his car? But as another reviewer said, I didn't really care that she got dragged to hell. Just goes to show, always be nice, especially to old foreign women. ;-)"
"bsvends1","5","2","4","6 August 2010"," Somewhat disappointing
","I simply had too high expectations for this movie. Had heard good things and read positive reviews, but all in all I was disappointed. The acting was not convincing and there are moments in this movie that are plain stupid and the whole thing just becomes silly and far from scary. The first 20 minutes are good, but then things get out of hand. It seems the director went home.<br/><br/>OK, so this movie is not meant to be taken seriously, and maybe the parts I found stupid was made that way on purpose; maybe to make us laugh? Who knows? I just wanted a good scare and ended up laughing! If I wanted to watch a comedy I would have chosen a comedy, not a movie that pretends to be horror!"
"lewiskendell","7","2","4","14 July 2010"," A funny, dark, and gross horror flick.
","Drag Me to Hell is not slow-paced by any stretch of the imagination. It's a literal onslaught of shocks and gross-outs. Some parts of the movie work better than others, but it was by far the most memorable of the horror movies that I've seen this year. <br/><br/>I'm sure that die-hard Raimi fans probably have a different opinion about his unique little humorous touches, but as a casual fan I found his little flourishes occasionally distracting. I know that horror movies often benefit from some humor, but some scenes (the anvil in particular) just felt unnecessary. <br/><br/>Drag me to Hell is also loud. I mean LOUD. You will jump. A lot. And not necessarily because you're afraid. You may just be jumping because it sounds like a fully-loaded freight train is about to come crashing from the speakers. Some of the frights are genuine, but your body will slowly become numb to the quick-cut jump scares, and by the end of the movie they really won't affect you much anymore. At least that's the way it was for me. <br/><br/>The story is cool enough, but a few of the plot devices are all too familiar. The certain length of time to break the curse before it's too late for the protagonist, the desperate séance at the end of the movie, and the last second twist that's pretty much telegraphed to the viewer with more that 30 minutes left to go. Do those things spoil the movie? No. I actually enjoyed DMTH a lot. But these ticky little flaws stand out when the rest of the movie is so enjoyable.<br/><br/>I thought the Alison did really well, and her beastly tormentor was suitably freaky. The old gypsy woman was a scene-stealer. She was equally frightening and disgusting. There's also a memorable goat that I would have loved to see for a longer period of time. Raimi really makes the curse seem horrible, and we can completely understand our heroine's (I use that word quite loosely) desperation to put an end to it. <br/><br/>DMTH pushes the right buttons most of the time, and it's a really good movie to watch with your girlfriend or a few of your buddies. It's not perfect, but don't let the few flaws that I've pointed out stop you from seeing a pretty cool horror flick."
"freemantle_uk","7","2","4","11 June 2010"," Raimi's return to horror
","Sam Raimi is known as one of the best horror directors around in recent years: but he had left the genre to do some small projects like the Spider-man trilogy. He returns with a story idea that he wrote with his brother wrote 10 years before filming it. He also set out to get his production company Ghost House back on track after a very unsuccessful run.<br/><br/>Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) was a young woman and loans officer at a local branch of a bank. She has a simple ambition to become the assistant manager but has to compete with the new employee Stu (Reggie Lee). She is a kind-hearted woman, in a long term relationship with Clay (Justin Long), a psychology lecturer at a local university. Christine is told to make some touch decisions if she wants to get the job. She refuses to give an old woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) an extension on her loan: a decision she regards because Ganush places a curse on the young woman. Christine ends up being haunted by a demon and she has only three days to save her soul from being taken to hell for all eternity. With the help of Clay and an Indian psychic, Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) Christine does everything she can to break the curse.<br/><br/>With the horror genre you get a number of different types: serious like Let the Right One In, 28 Days Later, the Exorcist; slashers, e.g. Halloween, Friday the 13th; gorno like Hostel, Saw; comedy, e.g. Shaun of the Dead. And of course you can also sub-divide into types like Supernatural, monster-based, psychological, realistic, etc With the best horror films there is often deeper message behind the story and often focuses on great characters. Raimi obviously knows about putting a compelling protagonist in his film and the audience will care about Christine, a decent person who ends up having to explore her dark side so that she can save her soul. Christine extremely well played by Lohman who shows she is a competent actress, playing the lost young woman who has to toughen up quickly. She is joined by a decent cast, Rao and Raver were of particular note. Raimi did not set out to make the film too serious. There is not much of message except showing someone's dark survival instincts, but trying to retains some good and don't upset gypsies. Does not treat the film too seriously with violence moments of slapstick, like Christine using a stapler as a weapon and dropping a anvil on top of Ganush with the eyes popping out like in a cartoon. Raimi deliberately makes Ganush an over the top stereotype and very entertaining, you would have to be of a very sensitive disposition to be offended. Also, there is nothing funny and more surreal then a talking goat.<br/><br/>Raimi also knows how to create an effective creepy atmosphere, using shadows to show demon was very well done. With his experience with Spider-man Raimi uses a lot of CGI in the film. Admittedly I am a traditionalist, CGI should only be used when there is no other alternative: but Raimi is skilled to make keep the film engaging and it allows him to use to do some extraordinary things. Raimi also mixed slapstick level violence and some gross out with more realistic style which at times effective, other times, not so fitting. Raimi was even able to fit in a few one liners, particularly with Christine nearing the end of the film. Raimi also shows his skill with a few clever camera and editing tricks, like when Christine was in a rainstorm and it turns into her being in the shower, which were nice touches.<br/><br/>Plot wises the film was a little like Paranormal Activity: but it was a lot better then that poor excuse for a film. The main reason being that there was a real threat to the main character of the film to make you actually care about her and the events of the film. The demon was actually a creepy being, not a minor nuisance.<br/><br/>Raimi shows that a horror film can be violence but does not have to be meaningless or violent just for the sake of it. Raimi gets the balance just right and the body court is surprising low in this film.<br/><br/>But whilst Drag Me to Hell is a good film this is really a film for fans of the horror genre. Outsiders properly won't be won over."

","Regardeing the plot, its OK, they could have used less graphical detail and leave more mystery out in the open. What really makes this movie go WRONG, is the excessive usage of gore, visual and sound effects, they look and sound as brought out of a cartoon. The evil characterization is so eagerly exaggerated, that instead of causing fear, it turns out to be really funny. To make things worse, I don't believe any of the actors performance. I mean...COME ON, eating ice cream is a ""hart broken"" cliché! Not a ""scared to death that Satan is coming for my soul"". Other than that, you can watch this movie, if there is nothing better to do."

Back in 1983 when i was 15 years old i saw a film that not only shocked me but laid the foundations for me being the movie lover i am today and that film was Sam Raimi's "" The Evil Dead"" . Although at the time i saw this film purely as a kick arse horror movie , it wasn't until later that i saw the humour in it . Although Drag me To hell is not a patch on ""The Evil Dead"" you can see it's a Raimi movie , as it has all his brilliant hallmarks. <br/><br/>Determined to impress her boss and get a much-needed promotion at work, Christine Brown lays down the law when mysterious Mrs. Ganush literally comes begging for mercy at her feet.

The story is not unique and the film relies more on Loud noises and quick movements to provide the scares .

Although at the time i saw this film purely as a kick arse horror movie , it wasn't until later that i saw the humour in it .

In retaliation for being publicly shamed, Mrs. Ganush places the dreaded curse of the Lamia on her unfortunate target, transforming Christine's life into a waking nightmare. Her skeptical boyfriend, Clay , casually brushing off her disturbing encounters as mere coincidence, Christine attempts to escape eternal damnation by seeking out the aid of seer Rham Jas .

"eddax","8","2","4","15 January 2010"," I was surprised to like this, since I'm not an Evil Dead fan.
","I haven't been a fan of writer/director Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead trilogy, and his track record with Spider-Man has been spotty (I only loved the second one), so I was pleasantly surprised to really enjoy Drag Me to Hell.<br/><br/>This movie isn't unlike The Evil Dead series in terms of humor and camp, but this time, with a bigger budget and I think more of an inclination towards horror than comedy, it appeals to me a lot more. There's a good lot of suspense and a coherent story (that's definitely unlike The Evil Dead), and I liked the change in acting style too. As opposed to Bruce Campbell's OTT tongue-in-cheek acting, Alison Lohman went for straight- faced naiveté that could've almost be mistaken for bad acting until she started ghost-wrangling. As her beau, Justin Long also plays it straight, and it's refreshing that his character is not an arse who stubbornly refuses to believe she's being haunted. And it's nice to see Babel's Adriana Barraza get gainful employment, even if it's for a kooky medium role."
"Movie_Muse_Reviews","7","2","4","6 January 2010"," Throwback Raimi horror film that twists expectations for thrills and laughs
","One would suppose if Sam Raimi really wanted to do a masterfully frightening horror film that he could easily do so -- but that would be too easy. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is like a thesis statement for why horror films should stop wasting their time with realism and trying to frighten people in the most ""realistic"" ways possible. Raimi possesses the ability to scare audiences in that way, but he doesn't see the point. Instead, the cult classic horror director of the Evil Dead trilogy continues to employ his masterful skills for the sake of audience misdirection, outrageous gore and hysterical thrills.<br/><br/>This was my first Raimi horror film, so now I can understand why there was much clamor for him to set the Spider-Man work aside this past decade and go back to his roots. ""Drag Me to Hell"" is definitely a throwback to older horror movies and a shout out to Raimi's fans. With a classic score and even the 1980s Universal logo at the beginning, this is supposed to evoke a little nostalgia.<br/><br/>The film follows Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a young loan officer who gets cursed by an old gypsy woman when she denies her an extension on her mortgage payments, mainly because doing so will get her closer to a promotion and she's trying to wipe the slate clean of her redneck past. The curse causes a shadowy demon to torment her for three days and on the third he will come to take her soul into hell. That and the old woman keeps showing up in some form or another to attack her.<br/><br/>Raimi has a fine understanding of suspense and how to get an audience on edge and prey on their expectations. Horror films have such a clear rise-and-fall scene structure and so many of the same techniques are utilized that an audience can predict a film's movement. Raimi uses that to his advantage rather than just using it period. Twisting it in this way allows him to create unexpected laughs and enhance the interest and entertainment level of the story, even if the plot is quite simple like ""Drag Me to Hell.""<br/><br/>Some people, I imagine, don't appreciate the scary parts of films being diminished by laugh- out-loud gore such as an old lady vomiting maggots and other comedic surprises, but I think it serves more as a reminder that horror doesn't have to make you wet yourself and give you nightmares to be entertaining. In fact it really celebrates the subconscious pleasure we get from scary movies to use those nerve-racking techniques to lead us where we least expect yet find quite entertaining.<br/><br/>When you look back at ""Drag Me to Hell,"" you'd be crazy not to find it ridiculous and absurd, but it finds a wonderfully entertaining balance of horror, comedy and realism. Christine feels like a very real protagonist despite the outrageous things that happen to her. She has a boyfriend (Justin Long) who legitimately loves her and she wants a promotion like the rest of us and she has moral dilemmas like the rest of us. Even if the Raimi brothers negate that with bizarre scene climaxes, they've done their job to create a complete main character and we can't label anything with fully realized characters as pulp or trash. It seems dumb, but the intention is clear and anyone who checks their expectations imposed by the bad horror films of late will see that and enjoy ""Hell.""<br/><br/>~Steven C<br/><br/>Visit my site! http://moviemusereviews.com"
"brandon_lee420","9","2","4","23 December 2009"," Sam Raimi has been reborn!
","Drag me to hell is nothing but a horror film mixed with drama and a little bit of comedic violence. I was expecting nothing much from this film but what I got in return was something more satisfying. After hearing that Drag Me To Hell got positive reviews at Rotten Tomatoes (92%) and various other sites, it sparked an interest in me. I had the choice of buying this or Inglorious Basterds but I chose DMTH.<br/><br/>After evicting a old woman from her home, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), becomes the target of a supernatural curse released upon her by Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver). Now she has to undo the curse along with the help of her boyfriend and a medium and maintain peace in her life from the ""Lamia"".<br/><br/>The horror in this film is superb and the séance scene is absolutely terrifying and funny but can Drag Me To Hell live up to Sam Raimi's other work, that is nothing but The Evil Dead series, and the answer is obviously no! The gore scenes are often funny and that is a fantastic mix of genius. I always knew Sam had it in him. The only actor that amazed me was Justin Long. If you guys take all that supernatural crap then this movie is not meant for you and you'll probably miss out on a treat!4.5/5.0"
"willwallace-1","8","2","4","9 November 2009"," the scares are there and the laughs are there and very often the scares are funny
","So I've finally got round to seeing Mr Raimi's much anticipated return to horror. Being a long time Evil Dead (and to a much lesser extent, Spider-Man) fan – I've completed all the Evil Dead video games, score! – I was excited as everyone else to see what I am still willing to describe as Evil Dead 3 ½.<br/><br/>From the buzz at the time I was told to expect a fun and frightening ""ghost train"" type thrill ride – a scary movie ideal for dates and such. And I have to say this was bang on, the difficulty lies in the following; this is, after all, a DVD release review and this film is made for the cinema. Where this finds a bigger market on the home viewing front is the nerd factor. This film is chocka with references, predominantly to Raimi's past in gruelling horror and arguably to horror staples such as Night of the Living Dead (1968) (which I gleefully enjoyed this Halloween) and Night of the Demon (1957) (as also referenced in The Rocky Horror Picture Show (1975) ""Dana Andrews said prunes gave him the runes""). The great camera work is very reminiscent of the unique attempts of Evil Dead, though refined greatly at this stage in his career, and there are many sound effects and moments – notably the laughing furniture - that will appease the nerd demons. And of course the ever present cameo of the directors 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 is not forgotten.<br/><br/>Don't see this film if you're the kind of person to say ""Oh what a stupid film they heard a noise and went down into the cellar"" because this a fun light-hearted and gross-orientated flick. The film continues those horror staple sensibilities and would certainly be more at home in the 80s or 90s - it even uses the 1980's Universal logo at the start. It does feel like a breath of musty air from the past, I imagine this film was made partially to counter the gorenography wave with a return to a night at the drive in, to suck-face with your score and nearly poop yourself whilst still having a sweet time. Interestingly, the script was written by Sam and Ted Raimi shortly after Army of Darkness [1992] but Sam started off on his road to the big time that would end up in the multi-million dollar Spider-Man franchise. This does however allude to the ongoing question (mainly posed to Evil Dead star Bruce Campbell – now getting some prominent TV work which is nice to see) as to whether he will return to the Evil Dead series. It could be argued that this is merely a warm up but I would guess due to the fact the script was written after Evil Dead, there's probably little intention to go back, in the meantime unfortunately a remake is expected shortly, as the industry dregs up more and more head-bangingly dull 70s/80s horror classics remakes – they'll have to run out soon, the barrel scraping will come ... and drag you to hell ... sigh.<br/><br/>It has to be remembered that despite this return to gruesome form, Sam Raimi never really intended to work in the horror genre. Growing up as a budding film maker with a love of The Three Stooges, often making direct rip-offs with his friends and siblings, his intention was always to work in comedy. However, the most money is made in horror and so Evil Dead (originally titled ""Within the Woods"") was Sam's break – despite being banned under the obscene publications act. Cheeky.<br/><br/>However, this does make a unique viewing experience. Raimi's comedic sensibilities never left his films, more notably in the follow ups Evil Dead II (1982) and Army of Darkness (1992) horror and comedy are melded very effectively – the scares are there and the laughs are there and very often the scares are funny. This man really understands the comedic potential of someone being thrown, really hard, against a wall by a spirit – though I must say its funnier when its Bruce (who unfortunately has no cameo here), but maybe I'm just being feminist.<br/><br/>Something else that sets this apart from many horror films that have this more fun/comedic approach is the quality of the acting the central cast are all great, have a fair amount of depth but also sum up their characters perfectly. And Dileep Rao is great as the horror movie fortune teller – the film teeters between genre stereotypes and deeper performances. To summarise, if you missed this film at the cinema, like me, you missed out to an extent. That's this films real home, if not the drive-in double features of the 1970's. And yes the double feature comment does have something to say about the substance of the film but Sam Raimi's a more than capable director and the film is without question 95 minutes of fun, frights and ""eeeeeewww""s. This horror-comedy dynamic, often totally mishandled by others, still works brilliantly here and makes for an enjoyable film. On the other hand it will very likely disappoint if your looking for a proper horror such as the first Evil Dead, but then with Raimi's back catalogue you should know what to expect. Evidently the release on Halloween was an apt move. Watch this for a fun night with the lights out and, even without your Oldsmobile, you'll have a great time. Don't forget the pop corn – it will fly."
"nu-arc","9","2","4","6 November 2009"," How It Would Be Like To Be Plagued?!
","How would it be like to be plagued?!Terrifying, terrifying I tell you. Gypsies, I must say have always been a mystery to me (I don't know about others) and that is why people create these films about gypsy curses like Stephen King's Thinner for example. A fear might murk within us about making these mysterious people angry as they have been persecuted by society and thus might take their anger out of those of high power; just like what happened between Christine Brown and that sinister Gypsy grandmother who plagued her with a demon who would drag her to hell for not allowing the gypsy to keep her home.<br/><br/>I don't want to spoil the rest, but this movie was so intense; and there are very disturbing parts to watch which may offend sensitive viewers. Tell me, would you kill in order to survive or would you rather be dragged to hell. I'd rather be dragged to hell. Watch the movie and you'll understand."

","I decided to go see the new movie ""Drag Me To Hell."" Here is what I thought:<br/><br/>For a Sam and Ivan Raimi flick, it was pretty cool!!!! I was very surprised to see that there were so many great 'jump-out' scary scenes for a PG-13 and there were some great make-up effects too. There were points where the movie scared the hell out of me and I would jump back or scream out obscenities.<br/><br/>For those who know the Raimi bros and their unique style of horror, you'd know that there would be some pretty funny moments in any of their horror movies. This movie isn't an exception. There were several subtle humor points throughout the movie and I really enjoyed the scene with the goat (It's not that kind of scene) and the scene where the old lady attacks the young woman both alive and dead. There were some points where it was so sick and gross that it was funny. Overall it was pretty scary and pretty funny at the same time."

","Somewhat spoiler. If you're a fan of the man, and you like the wackiness of Army of Darkness, then you have to run to go see Drag Me To Hell. Don't walk, Run. Right from the opening credits I knew I was in for a treat. I felt like was in a theater for a 60's – 70's good old fashion horror flick. But not just the corny campy type, the coolness of it. Thought the way he pushed in the camera was brilliantly and intentionally done at the exact times he meant it to in order to goof on the genre yet do it in a way that we were not insulted but along for the ride. The séance scene was just down and out funky and the moment when the gypsy woman was 'gumming' the jaw of the lead girl in the parking garage was tastefully insane, scary and at the same time funny as all heck. Love the scene with the cat and the outcome, not a cat hater, have two, just didn't expect. And man oh man, was I surprised with the ending. Thought old school feel was awesome. Sam Raimi does it again!"
"ClaytonDavis","7","2","4","15 June 2009"," Drag Me Through the Laughs
","Drag Me to Hell is simply put, one of the best horror films in years. It never takes itself too seriously and lets itself take its course to where it's destined to go, a comedic-horror gem. A bit of a copycat from Stephen King's Thinner, it tells the story of Christine Brown, a bank loan officer trying desperately to become assistant manager. When a old gypsy woman comes in to ask for an extension of her mortgage, Christine decides to take control and deny her claim. The gypsy woman then curses young Christine and prolong her final days before being 'dragged to hell.' <br/><br/>Sam Raimi, director of Spider-Man takes this on and shows he's the perfect match to breathe new life into the horror genre. Alison Lohman, who once was very promising in her outstanding performances in White Oleander and Matchstick Men, doesn't capitlize on that promise. The role doesn't demand much of her but she remains throughout the film, extremely unlikable. Even her boyfriend Clayton played by Justin Long can't give her sympathy for the viewer. <br/><br/>The comedy in the film doesn't walk the comedic line like Old School or Wedding Crashers but recreates a grotesque new type of humor in which the audience enjoys the pain and suffering of our protagonist and you shouldn't feel guilty about either. Drag Me to Hell doesn't pretend to be anything it isn't and that's what you have to admire most. Is it Oscar worthy? Absolutely not but its definitely worth a watch if you're into the genre and you shouldn't be afraid to like, if not love it for its personality.<br/><br/>***/****"

","Director Sam Raimi undoubtedly reached the biggest audiences of his career to date through his work on the ""Spiderman"" franchise. However, in the Eighties, his work on the ""Evil Dead"" movies assured him a place in that elite Valhalla reserved for masters of horror. After years away from the genre, ""Drag me to Hell"" is renewed proof that few filmmakers posses his ability both to terrify an audience and then have them in convulsions of laughter- while reminding them that nobody can outrun their conscience.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty straightforward: Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer who has been told that she needs to show toughness in order to secure a promotion that she covets. Hoping to win points with her boss, she refuses an elderly Gypsy's request that her mortgage be extended- causing this obviously ailing woman to lose her home. The old woman wreaks a horrific revenge by uttering a curse that unleashes the Lamia- an ancient demon that torments it's victim for three days before taking their soul to Hell for eternity. Christine is then subjected to increasingly terrifying manifestations of said entity (invisible to everyone but her)and enlists a medium to save her from damnation, but time is running out...<br/><br/>The plot moves along at a cracking pace and there is no shortage of genuinely scary and shocking moments. However what really makes this film a joy is the mischievously surreal humor that permeates the whole enterprise, for example when a demonic eye appears in a slice of fruitcake. All in all, this is a terrific horror film that has no problem scaring it's audience while staying in touch with the idea that movies are all about having fun. Top-notch entertainment."

The first scene of the movie is very scary, and a good set-up for the rest. Some parts of it were funny as well as scary, like the fight in Christine's car. Sam Raimi does an excellent job of getting the audience scared for Christine.

I have to admit that I did not have high expectations from this movie so, I did not expect much from it and I was wrong. The suspense that you are going to have while you are watching this movie it would be at the maximum level. I also think that you aren't going to waste your time watching it. I liked the interpretations of Alison Lohman who played Christine Brown and Dileep Rao who played Rham Jas. The direction which was made by Sam Raimi was very good and also the visual effects which were used in it. <br/><br/>To sum up, I believe that ""Drag Me to Hell"" is an interesting movie to watch, with many good scenes which will keep you alert for the whole duration of it.

","When a young woman denies help to an old woman at her bank, her angered actions force a curse of demonic intensity that soon forces her into grave and dangerous acts in order to save herself and her loved ones from the series of demonic attacks that have been thrust against her.<br/><br/>This one here was an enjoyable if somewhat flawed effort. One of the better aspects of this one is the rather enjoyable sense of suspense that comes about from the infliction of the curse. The atmosphere is great because of that, as the introduction of the curse offers up plenty to like here starting from the initial meeting in the office that sets it in motion to the backstory that gives us more information on the events that are offered here really giving this one some dark tones to be had. That also leads into the other big plus here in that there's plenty of action since it doesn't really slow down all that much, driving forward nicely with a fantastic pace about it that has numerous great supernatural action scenes. The opening seance at the mansion that depicts the original encounter with the spirit offers plenty of strong work including a strong jump-scare, while the scenes of the woman trying to inflict the curse upon her give this one a strong series of scenes that manage to come off rather nicely. Even better are the scenes later one when she's already cursed, from the freakout in the house to the different encounters with the ghostly woman coming after her in the various locations around her including the barn sequence or the dinner party encounter. There's also the sequences in the final half that really make this one fun, from the big encounters with the supernatural beings attacking her to the graveyard confrontation that has a lot to like about it. As well as one of the better twist endings that's not only logical but works well, this has plenty to like although there are certainly parts here that need fixing. One of the biggest issues is the fact that there's way too much familiarity in the film to really stand out here. Basing your entire collection of scares and jump scenes around the exact same ploy, having the music stinger accompany it turned up incredibly loud on the sound, grows tiring and shows a discernible lack of imagination through and through. From the ghastly-looking woman screaming loudly appear suddenly out of the darkness to grab her or seeing the flash visions of the ghostly demons floating around ready to grab a loose appendage just keeps getting used here and that really doesn't make the film standout all that much. The other issue is the fact that this one makes it very clear that there's no real danger to the girl as she has a few days to wait until the curse finally takes hold which keeps her relatively safe throughout the film. No matter how tortured she gets, it has no interest in harming her until then and it makes this one feel a little tame during that section. Otherwise, there's not so much wrong here.<br/><br/>Rated PG-13: Violence and Language."

","Drag Me to Hell is a horror movie directed and written by Sam Raimi about loan officer named Christine Brown who evicts an old gypsy woman from her home, ultimately refusing to give her an extension. Seeking vengeance on her, the old woman curses Christine to be tortured by an evil spirit and eventually dragged into hell. Christine has to figure out how to lift the curse before its too late. 
The film at times can be very over the top, such as the scene when the old woman attacks Christine in the car. It becomes especially over the top when more disturbing scenes come up, kike gore scenes or the sÃ©ance scene. However, I found myself curious to know what happens next, and invested in the main character's plight. The writing is pretty good, and the overall direction is spot on. The actors, especially the lead, carry the film very well. Overall, it was a strange experience an interesting view on paranormal horror."
"dvd4040","9","0","0","8 February 2018"," This is how you do a horror movie right.
","Back in 2009, the brilliant filmmaker Sam Raimi journeyed back to his horror roots and made a fun-as-hell horror-comedy film called 'Drag Me To Hell'. For those of you who don't remember who Sam Raimi is, movies like 'Evil Dead II', 'Army of Darkness', 'The Spider-Man Trilogy', and 'Darkman' are some of his accomplishments. Raimi and his brother and frequent collaborator Ivan Raimi had an idea for a horror film called 'The Curse', but when Raimi booked the 'Spider-Man' gig, that film was put on hold for the next decade. After 'Spider-Man 3' was released, Sam and Ivan went quickly back to their idea to work on a low budget horror film again, which turned into 'Drag Me To Hell'.<br/><br/>
If you've seen the British horror film 'Night of the Demon', you'd see some good similarities between the two, but Sam wanted to make a movie about a pleasant and very nice individual who makes one bad decision out of their very own greed, which comes back to haunt them in a the most horrific way. 'Drag Me To Hell' centers on a young woman named Christine (Alison Lohman), who is a sweet and well-mannered loan officer at a bank. She's kind, funny, and has a good boyfriend she loves (Justin Long). Her boss at the bank is always riding her to make the ""hard decisions"" in order to keep bank profits up and not allow people who need help with extensions or past payments. Christine doesn't agree with this sentiment, but when an elderly gypsy woman comes in and kindly asks for an extension on her house, Christine does not allow it in order to impress her boss and gain a small promotion.<br/><br/>The old gypsy woman, played perfectly by Lorna Raver, curses Christine to hell for eternity. The rules are that Christine is now in possession of a button from the gypsy woman and must pass the button along to someone else within three days or she will be devoured by demons in a fiery hell below forever. Of course, none of this seems believable, but when strange and terrifying things start happening, Christine must try to make things right. The film is rated PG-13, which for a horror movie on Sam Raimi's watch, isn't the way to go, but Raimi wanted to do something different and rely on a psychological horror rather than a ton of gore.<br/><br/>
Needless to say, Raimi succeeded here on all levels. His ability to show shadows behind doors or evil footsteps lurking is highly suspenseful and works in each scene here. The more potent scares are in your face and downright terrifying, which might leave you nervously laughing at any moment. With the horror genre, Raimi perfectly inputs his comedic genius that rallies behind that of 'The Three Stooges' and some other off-beat dark humor, which is such a delightful and delicious mix of dialogue and gore. The performances are all solid, but the person who stands out is by far Lorna Raver as the old gypsy woman.<br/><br/>Raver is a stage actress who is sweet and kind, but in this film, she is ugly, ruthless, and scary-as-hell. It's a great transformation and Raver just jumps into the deep end with her character and never swims back to the edge. At it's core, 'Drag Me To Hell' is a tale of morals and ethics, where you might be a sweet and kind person, but even one slip up and come back to bite you. It's a damn fine message and premise that will make you laugh and hide under the covers with the lights one. This is how you do a horror movie right."

","I started reading a couple of pages of the screenplay before I watched this film. What I read was disappointing. The movie was also. I couldn't figure out what this movie was, it wasn't scary, funny, or thrilling. Couldn't put my finger on it. This is basic cursed story that doesn't add anything new or exciting to the genre. At times very predictable, we all remember the scene where she dropped the envelope in the car, what a random accident wouldn't ya say? It felt mechanical with no unique take on a story told before. I think why this movie failed was because the script was crap in the first place. I remember a lot of unnecessary crap in the opening pages,like saving a cat from being run over, which adds nothing to the story except the fact that she ""Saved the Cat"" Could it get less original?"

","I feel like Drag me to hell is a real rarity, you don't see horror films this good on a regular basis. This film is very well written, well acted, and the visuals work well. I was very pleased with the main actors performances and I like the plot, it was interesting, I don't know of a another movie with this specific kind of plot, it is unique in that respect. The movie is definitely exciting, it keeps you guessing what's gonna happen next, and on the edge of your seat. The horror sequences work well thanks to the creepy/eerie atmosphere, the actors in them, and the well constructed special effects. The possession scene/seance scene is one of the best parts because it is so creepy and cool to see. The attack scene in the beginning is cool too, it's scary and makes for a very twisted/eerie atmosphere. The ending is something that I have mixed feelings about. Part of me liked it cus it was a twist, and part of me didn't Cus it wasn't really settling lol, trying to pinpoint the correct word to describe it. Well anywho, I'll just let you check out this well made horror movie for yourself and see what you think about the ending. 9/10 for Drag me to hell."

","I went into this movie with some expectations. Considering the incredibly high metascore I was interested. It's a horror with a high score like that, but somehow a much lower user score. I'm happy to say that the critics were the right ones here. <br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell has a relatively unoriginal plot. Someone gets cursed and is trying to get rid of it before she falls victim to it. The movie is, although not called a comedy on IMDb, definitely supposed to be a comedy, or more of a satire. It's pretty much making fun of movies like this the whole time with just how over the top and goofy it can be, while still maintaining a serious enough plot to keep you invested. It's one of those rare scenarios where humor and seriousness blend together super well. <br/><br/>The characters are well done too. It's not just entirely focused on the horror and satirical jokes. The characters all have a real life outside of being cursed, and it adds a layer of depth to the story. It shows how the character's lives are affected by the curse, and it's not just through some dumb series of events that we've all seen before. <br/><br/>The horror itself is done pretty well too. While sometimes it feels like it's indulging in horror clichÃ©s it always feels very self- aware, considering how satirical it is, and it often ends up feeling like it's just making fun of those clichÃ©s. Nevertheless, it still indulges in them, but it works. Because of how unique the movie already is it still manages to create some tension. You know this isn't any ordinary horror movie, so the outcome isn't exactly predictable. <br/><br/>Overall Drag Me to Hell is really well done. The plot is, although done to death, presented well in good satirical fashion, the characters are quite well done, and the horror is quite good. How this movie got such a low user rating it beyond me, but I guess great horror movies just aren't for everyone. In the end I'd definitely recommend this movie, but mostly for people who like horror or satires or both."

","The young Sam Raimi became famous with the Evil Dead trilogy and Darkman, and then went to do the Spider-Man trilogy. After the middling response to the third Spider-Man, Raimi went back to his roots, and this Drag Me To Hell is the result.<br/><br/>And it is a very good horror-comedy movie. As this genre is not for everyone, some people may not like it, but Raimi walks the fine line between both genres and delivers.<br/><br/>The story is simple enough. Christine works at a bank and is hoping for a promotion, working as hard as possible but seeing that a male partner may get that promotion, even though he just recently joined the bank. She also has a boyfriend, son of a very posh family, whose mother wants to introduce a prospective girlfriend to him as she sees Christine no more than a fleeting relationship for her son. So when Mrs. Ganush, an old woman, goes to the bank asking for an extension on her loan, she tells her than no, she can't have it, thinking more about her promotion than about Mrs. Ganush plea. The old woman gets on her knees, Christine calls for security, Mrs. Ganush tells her ""You have shamed me"", and from that moment we get what we could expect from Mr. Raimi: lots of fun, horror, and amazing camera shots. It's possible to recognize many of the tricks that he used in his first works, polished with the new technology available nowadays. All the actors do an excellent job, overacting a little bit, as should be expected of this kind of movies, to add to the fun. And Raimi does a perfect job of playing with the conventions and twists of the genre, winking his eye at every plot development.<br/><br/>An excellent time at the movies. Just leave your brain at the door and enjoy Raimi's trademark craziness."

","Drag Me to Hell (2009): Dir: Sam Raimi / Cast: Alison Lohman, Justin Long, Lorna Raver, David Paymer, Reggie Lee: Innovative yet disgusting horror film with a title that seems to symbolize our ever descending fall into sin. It stars Alison Lohman as a loan officer ordered to evict an elderly woman from her home only to be cursed. Now strange occurrences threaten her life if she doesn't find a way to reverse the curse. Starts out fine until becoming a repetitious spin on special effects with a cheat ending. Director Sam Raimi returns to his roots with innovative visuals. This is a reminder of Raimi's work in the Evil Dead films before hitting the jackpot with the Spider-Man franchise. Lohman holds strong as the tormented victim who is showered face first with several gross gooey substances. She is like a female version of Bruce Campbell being constantly punished but she lacks the humour element that served Campbell so well. Justin Long as her boyfriend is wasted. He pretty much does little more than doesn't believe her. Lorna Raver is a hoot as the gypsy who begs for mercy when a loan is turned down but has Lohman begging for mercy through supernatural fury. David Paymer plays Lohman's boss as typical and cardboard. While Raimi is never short on ideas, the screenplay is short on genuine suspense. It feels like being drug to hell and back. Score: 5 / 10"

","""Drag Me to Hell"" is a sometimes funny and often startling horror movie. That is what it wants to be, and that is what it is. Raimi mastered the art of the screeching, zombie hag in The Evil Dead, and 28 years and three Spider-Mans later, he's still got it. <br/><br/>Christine Brown is a young and determined loan officer on the fast track to success. When she makes a tough decision which results in the eviction of an elderly lady, she finds herself victim to an evil curse, and finds she has only three days to persuade the dark spirit to relent, otherwise she'll be dragged to Hell to be tormented for all eternity. <br/><br/>Pretty simple, basic plot, sure, but Raimi gets quite a bit of mileage out of it, and it really is a nice return of sorts to the darkly comedic tongue-in-cheek, horror schlock he cut his teeth on. He employs every kind of trick imaginable, and the result is a pretty fun and slick supernatural coaster ride. However, even though the film has a nice creepy vibe, it mostly relies on jump scares, shock moments, and gross outs instead of pure outright terror.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman takes the lead, and she really gets put through the ringer here. She is also to be commended for doing her own stunt work as well. She gives a nice, and backing her up are Justin Long as Christine's supportive boyfriend, Dileep Rao as a spiritual adviser who tries to help her, and Lorna Raver as the old woman who unleashes the curse. She's the real breakout her, and makes for a quite creepy and memorable presence.<br/><br/>It's a little tough at first who the audience should sympathize with, but the case is made for each side, and there is some development instead of just being a showcase for effects and directorial flair. It's not really anything more than light fare, but it does have a strong ending, and proves quite entertaining, so give it a shot."

","'Drag Me To Hell' invokes a ton of mixed feelings, like a lot of Sam Raimi's work does, for me at least. The opening scene starts off strong, the prologue is always creepier and more authentic when filmed in a language other than English (lol?), but quickly diminishes into the type of movie that the lame ADD-ridden junior high school crowd will think is totally awesome, but completely fails on any level of maturity. I'm probably being overly harsh, but it could definitely have been better, and a lot of what killed it was the fact that Sam Raimi seems to favor ridiculously cheesy special effects. And we are talking like extreme levels of cheese, here. I didn't like the effects in 'Spider-Man', either. They too, were packing on extreme layers of cheesiness. Which is fine every now and again, but not when you're working on something like 'Drag Me To Hell' which had a lot more potential to it than some ridiculous looking FX.<br/><br/>It pains me to say that 'Drag Me To Hell' was a slight disappointment, especially when I loved Raimi's 'A Simple Plan' so much, but he had a very strong story and extremely well-written book by Scott Smith to go by on that one.<br/><br/>On the other hand, 'Drag Me To Hell' definitely does have some genuine scares to be had. Alison Lohman does a fantastic job, and Dileep Rao adds a nice touch, but Justin Long is what helped attract me here because this dude rocked the sh*t out of 'Jeepers Creepers' hard and I wanted to see him do it again, but he does his best job at being a ""grown-up"" with a ""career"" and he has such ""nice"" parents, and his whole character is another one of those potential wastes.<br/><br/>All in all, I enjoyed it, but I don't know how many more times I am going to wanna see it again.<br/><br/>DRAG ME TO HELL -----6/10"

Thus, it is morally justifiable that she be condemned to hell for all eternity for not granting a third mortgage extension. 2) ?Ethnic types? have magical powers - in this case the eastern European Ilenka Ganush can condemn people to hell (yet somehow can?t keep up with house payments) and Indian Rham Jas and Hispanic Shaun San Dena can protect people from this fate (provided the condemned have a platinum card). In Bollywood films, are the White Christian characters imbued with supernatural powers? 3) White Anglo-Saxon parents are bitter snobs, yet their prejudice melts away if you just stand your ground - such as when Christine Brown exhibits ?backbone? to the boyfriend?s mother by bringing a cake to a dinner party 4) Scientists instantly become believers on the thinnest exposure to the supernatural ? the boyfriend character (played by the guy who sells MacIntosh computers on the television) starts as a Prius-driving disbelieving psychological researcher and professor but lays down 10 large for a séance because his girlfriend thought she saw a demon 5) Cats and goats are substitutable for human souls ? vegetarian Christine chops up Fluffy on the advice of her fortune-teller and Shaun San Dena and her supernatural crew plan to sacrifice a goat because apparently while he would like an immortal soul, Satan will take small to midsize domestic animals instead<br/><br/>Having said all that I do give Raimi credit for slipping the M.

The delivery overall is engaging and not completely disgusting or downbeat for that matter. The comic relief is well-needed and well-used to the film's benefit. Personally I would choose Raimi's lower budget horror above this but it is still interesting entertainment and full of lots of scary creature effects that are always effective when on screen. Raimi has his biggest commercial if not artistic triumph since his Spiderman movies."

","Being that Sam Raimi has become my fav. director (Spider Man and The Grudge) Drag Me To Hell (DMTH) is a master piece in my mind. I loved DMTH for various reasons. The movie comes from a realistic aspect in life (Satan, hell, evil, etc.). I loved that the movie didn't have a happy ending to it. It almost seemed like it did but then we of course found out that it wasn't the button she returned to the descent it was her fiancées coin. and of course she falls on the train track and . . . you guessed it. gets dragged to hell.<br/><br/>i noticed something while watching DMTH. in the opening scene when Satan is trying to get the little Mexican boy. Did you notice that it looks like you have to die first before the devil can drag you to hell. because there is no way that child could've survived a two story fall so I'm thinking that Christine had to hit the back of her head on the railroad track before being dragged to hell. its just a hunch."

","I'm not sure why so many people hated this movie so much. I liked it. It was different and fun. Alison Lohman plays Christine Brown who is a loan officer at a bank. She's vying for a promotion to assistant manager against a very determined office colleague. She thinks the boss will favor her more if she shows some backbone and refuses a poor old woman an extension on a loan. The woman, Mrs Ganush, faces loss of her home immediately.<br/><br/>The woman begs her and even attacks her, but Christine is unyielding. In revenge the old woman puts a curse on Brown to be taken to hell in a few days. She tries to get rid of the curse, but it's not as easy as it would seem. Raimi goes back to his Evil Dead credentials on this one combining black comedy and real scares for a funfest only Raimi could deliver. So forget the naysayers and check it out if you haven't already."

","Nice try anyways. With his brain running on his Spidey-man films, Sam has lost his touch with horror films. I wonder why he ever was chosen to direct the Spider-man films. To me, I think John McTiernan, Ridley Scott, Michael Mann, David Fincher, David Cronenberg, Spielberg and Lucas team when they were in top form ages ago. Come to think of it, even Brian Yuzna (Re-animator 2, Beyond Re-animator) is a good choice.<br/><br/>Well all said and done, Spidey is OLD NEWS now. Back to SAM I AM. This film is based on a Gypsy Curse cast by an old woman called Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) whose house was repossessed (I'm in tears already). The curse is cast on bank loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman). With the curse in effect, Christine must do all she can before time runs out and she is dragged to hell (literally speaking).<br/><br/>This film claims to be made on a $30 million budget. Do you know how much that is? After watching the film any fool could notice, that it was made very ""CHEAPLY"" as in SCI-FI channel films. This film is no Lawrence Of Arabia type of GRANDE film with scenic locations that are NON-US. This crap was shot in location in Pasadena, California.<br/><br/>Question: Where-did-all-that-$-go? Answer: S.R's over-saturated piggy bank (or Hoggy-bank).<br/><br/>I admired S.R for Evil Dead Trilogy and Darkman but this one is a below par effort.<br/><br/>The acting in the film is similar to U.S. TV SERIAL STANDARDS.<br/><br/>P.S I recommend you all to see Intruder (1989 film) written and directed by Scott Spiegel, the co-writer of Evil Dead 2. After watching this film, compare with Drag Me To Hell. Make your own judgement. U.S. Horror films churned out after the late 1990's are mainly crap. In fact this marks the point of decline..."

","Horror can be a tired, old, clichéd franchise. Many horrors attempt to scare the wits out of their audience by providing insanely loud noises or incredibly strong killers who refuse to die wielding a nasty weapon and some obscure face mask but Drag Me To Hell pulls itself away from both of these boring problems. <br/><br/>Lohman is Christine, a loan officer at the bank. She has recently been making progress in her work and is in line for a promotion to Assistant Manager. Only thing in her way is her manipulating colleague Stu (a brilliantly love to hate character played by that brilliant love to hate actor – Reggie Lee). According to her boss Stu is more willing to be aggressive, a skill recognised as highly important in the bank loaning industry. Seeing that she needs to be more firm with her customers, Christine rejects a mortgage extension to an ill, old woman with nothing left but her long term house. Christine though decides that a promotion is much more important than this old witch's life. Upon this rejection the old woman, a gypsy who can conjure black magic, sets a curse on poor Christine, a curse that will have her tormented for three days and then dragged down to the depths of hell. By enlisting the help of her boyfriend (Long) she attempts to tackle this demon before it burns her in flames. <br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell brings back the typical old school horror, reverting back to previous Raimi classic The Evil Dead. The thing is though with the technology imputed into films of today, this approach seems to wear thin and instead of finding myself scared, I found myself laughing. Raimi may have had this in mind and attempted to make this film in that way but where the pea soup for sick worked in The Exorcist it fails here. Filmmaking has moved on in such a way that most audience members like to see things look a little more realistic. (Not saying that CGI makes things anymore realistic but brown goo doesn't either)<br/><br/>Having said that though this film isn't that bad. The scares are still there just shown in a different form. The high screeching music and the brilliant sound affects mean you could close your eyes and really imagine what is happening on that screen. The different thrills in seeing an eye opening in your cake or an old woman try to eat your face without any teeth. These things people not only freaked me but sent a tingle down my spine.<br/><br/>The acting and directing of the film is not up to the participating people's usual standard. Lohman is sometimes good and as soon as you think that, she acts in a way that makes you strip it all back. Long is even worse but whether this is the script, the acting or the casting is another thing. He just doesn't seem old enough to be a college professor with bag fulls of knowledge. In fact the only actor I really liked in the film was Reggie Lee. Maybe this was Raimi's objective all along though. To implore a sort of sixties feel to a naughties movie. Lame special effects, poor acting, comic horror. If that's what he was going for than to be fair he did succeed.<br/><br/>All in all Drag Me To Hell does bring a fresh view of entertainment. Something different for all to watch as it is not entirely what you expect. I didn't mind this film but I think that those who loved Raimi's classic The Evil Dead will love it and those who don't or haven't seen it will find this cheap and nasty."

","Don't get me wrong, since it is a horror film you do expect a certain amount of far fetched events to occur, its part of the experience especially when it deals with the supernatural like drag me to hell does. Also with fairness the concept itself is a pretty scary one. But i wish they had concentrated on the hell aspect a little more and concentrated a little less on the over the top gross out scenes that occur once every 10 minutes as if their worried the audience might have started to follow the plot too much since the last one. That wouldn't be so bad if the scenes were not so poorly delivered they are more comical then frightening. There is one scene in particular about half way through the movie where i honestly couldn't tell if it was meant to be a comedy scene or not.<br/><br/>That said although i thought it was awful, I am giving it a 5 because I got the impression i might have gone in expecting too much. A few people I know told me how great it was so I ended up with true terror on the mind and got nonsense instead.

While the movie's story seems to be a variant of those seen before, the horror and scares depicted are often competently put together. (spoiler) The only scene I thought was way over-the-top was the car-fight scene. Yes the car-fight had a stamp of Raimi about it, but I guess you cant help your innate tendencies as a director in whatever you're doing. Both Lohman and Long are OK co-Stars, but may be better suited for supporting leads as evidenced in better prior movies. Enjoyed the Ending. Recommended for the Horror genre definitely."

Blimey, i was in for a ride. it is a typical horror movie, everything is creepy as always. but also its funny.!<br/><br/>the old lady in the movie is one disgusting human being. numerous making out scenes with out protagonist Christine, did gross me out but what is a movie without lesbianism. The old lady named Ganush, tries to exchange fluids with Christine even she is dead, literally tries to eat her mouth when in a fight in the car, pukes in it a few odd times.. clearly tries to get on top of her when Christine come to visit her in the coffin which is well desperate and just not jolly. well it goes to the extent that Christine digs Ganush's grave and well obviously Ganush doesn't like it alone so she gets up from the grave and hugs her tight to take her down. well clearly an undertone..<br/><br/>Sam raimi has tried everything. demons, scary goat , killing kitten, eye in a cake, hell, cursed button, hairy Indians.! who knew buttons are your one way ticket to hell, for now thanks to raimi the Velcro industry will see many new buyers.<br/><br/>why is the lousy fortune teller always stereotyped as an Indian, and inflation has hit here too.. with his energy sensing powers the fortune teller robs the boyfriend blind. yes Mr Rham jas has awareness. so much so that he touches the hand finds the demon is cast upon the girl. and later instead of telling her to give the button to someone else, he asks for 10 grand for his lady friend who will risk her life for the girl and conveniently die afterward.<br/><br/>Christine in dire need of an exorcizer sells all her stuff to realize, she doesn't have even half the amount of stuff at her place.. so again the boyfriend burns a hole in his pocket for his promise to look out for her. well love might be involuntary and a tedious process for some, but Christine does kill all the birds with one arrow. Now the summoning takes place in the dark and candles (because of the ghost and demon penal code 145: they are only permitted in the dark.) ultimately results in death of the lady who summons the goat demon. (a talking goat, with big eyes ha-aha.) the idea of the perfect scare. even the psychedelic rabbit in Donnie Darko was scarier.<br/><br/>well in the end, its movie worth watching for its bitch fights and learning that fortune telling is a profitable business these days."

Drag Me To Hell is the best horror flick of the year but to be fair there hasn't been a lot of quality competition. The film is non-stop horror with a dash of humor and that isn't a bad thing. The choice of casting Justin Long was a bit strange to me because i just couldn't imagine him in a horror movie but he pulls it off quite nicely and surprised me a lot.<br/><br/>The only problem i have with this film is the main actress i thought she was often a bit off character and just didn't work for me for some reason, I felt she wasn't as good as the other cast members. The story is brilliant from beginning to end and is very well done for a horror movie i say that because often i feel the quality factor is often neglected in horror films and the scary factor is a bit over the top but in this coaster ride everything is well balanced and deserves great applause just like most films Sam Raimi has anything to do with. This brilliant mix of comedy and horror deserves at least the title of best horror film of the year.<br/><br/>8/10"

Was it? Well, the short answer is, no. One reason, it wasn't funny. I get that it was supposed to be campy, and there were a few humorous parts, but overall, it just wasn't the laugh-out-loud comedy I was hoping for. Two things really ruined the comedy for me. One was the death of the kitten, I mean come on, a kitten, that would be if the movie stopped, came to you, and hit you in the stomach. The second was the ending, I can't see the funny in a nice woman being dragged down to Hell, to burn for eternity. Just to be clear, she never did anything wrong, and she is being punished with everlasting pain and suffering. Unless they make a sequel with her being a stripper, or being whiner to the devil, I can't see it ever becoming a comedy.<br/><br/>But it definitely works as a horror film.

","Drag Me to Hell written and directed by Sam Raimi is to put it bluntly...Awful. I have to say that when I heard Sam Raimi was taking a break from Spider Man to go back to directing his first true horror film since Army of Darkness, I was looking forward to it. Then when I saw the trailers and now the film, I feel like telling Sam to stick, with Spider Man for now because he's lost his horror movie directing edge.<br/><br/>A tale of bad things happen to good people is taken to the extreme when a sweet, innocent loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) fails to give an extension on a mortgage to a decrepit gypsy woman Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), Mrs Ganush decides to put a hex on sweet little Christine whereby a demon will come to...you know, the title gives it away, unless she can find a way to reverse the curse. She sets out doing this with the help from her ever so accommodating boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long) and a psychic medium Rham Jas (Dileep Rao).<br/><br/>The film is boring, full of horror clichés that are not scary and the laughs are not that funny. There is one scene featuring embalming fluid that was pretty funny, I'll give it that. The key ingredient missing in this film was Bruce Campbell not having a cameo, which would've provided needed comic relief. The acting is sorely lacking. Alison Lohman just doesn't live truthfully under any of the given and imaginary circumstances that befall her. She certainly didn't have a feeling about what was happening to her. Don't get me started on Justin Long. He simply looks clueless and I am just not sure why he is so popular. He looks like he is sleep walking through the film. I will say that Dileep Rao brings some sort of depth to his character as the medium and there are times when I felt something from him. Lorna Raver does a good job as the hexing gypsy woman but unfortunately neither she nor Dileep can save the film.<br/><br/>As for Sam Raimi, I was expecting more from the horror maven. This is a boring and sloppy film. I felt cheated. He essentially rigs up a lot of the same cheap gimmicks from the Evil Dead series into this mind numbing story. It was disappointing because it feels like Sam just needed something to do while waiting to make Spider Man 4. If you are a fan of mainstream horror that lacks any depth or thrills than this is the film for you. Otherwise, save your money."

Yes--I jumped a few times (but that was from the loud noises on the soundtrack). Yes--it WAS funny. But was it scary? No. Did it make much sense? No. Director and co-writer Sam Raimi made ""Evil Dead"" and ""Evil Dead 2"". They were VERY gory (and both unrated) and full of pitch black humor and were genuinely scary. Unfortunately Raimi here seems to be held back by that all-important PG-13 rating. The scenes are somewhat gross and funny--but never scary. I kept getting the feeling that Raimi was forced to pull back because of the rating. The minimal gore should have been more extreme and the humor darker--but it never was. The only sequence which went full out was a truly funny and somewhat scary exorcism at the end. THAT one sequence managed to be more chilling than anything else in the movie. This isn't terrible by any means but I couldn't stop thinking of how much better it might have been if Raimi had been given complete creative control.<br/><br/>Acting isn't really important in this but Justin Long (as Christine's boyfriend) and Raver were pretty good.

","If I could change the title of this film, it would be called ""Dog terd on Toast"" cause this has been one of the most horrible movies I've seen in a while. The special effects were corny, the acting was bad, and the main plot of the film is just pointless. Most of the scares in this film were like any other type of scare with the demon jumping out and going BOO!! This is also repeated over and over again in which gets really dumb after a while. (spoilers up ahead) The story is this, a young girl in her late 20's named Christine Brown is in the mist of a promotional challenge with another co-worker at a bank she works at.One day she is confronted by a estranged looking old woman named Mrs.Ganush who is in desperate need in an extension on her mortgage to stay out of being evicted. The real problem is that this is the third time she has done this, so Christine goes to her supervisor for some guidance. The supervisor gives her the choice of either extension or eviction, But with her brilliant blondish brain power, she chooses eviction. Once Mrs.Ganush gets the message, she starts to beg her on her knees(literally) for the extension. Mrs.Ganush then starts to act really weird as she is escorted out of the bank by authorities. Christine goes on throughout the day, wondering if she made the right decision(which of coarse, was not due to the trailer). As she gets in her car after work, she notices a very mad grandma in the back seat in which happens to be Mrs.Ganush. They immediately begin fighting( in which is tampered with a great deal of cgi) as the car swerves around in the parking lot(which has been done one too many times don't you think?). The fight ends up going to Mrs.Ganush as she lays down a curse upon Christine in which she has to encounter three days of hell before actually being dragged there(literally) for an eternity.<br/><br/>This is only the first ten minutes of the movie and it already had me thinking ""why, why was this movie made in the first place?"". That's just the first ten minutes of the film, but the last 30 minutes of the film are just the worst. The visual effects in this film were a complete letdown due to most of the film's scare sequences being repeated about a dozen times.The goat sequence was practically the worst of them all being the fact that the bastard was talking and the fact that it was the most used cgi sequence in the entire movie.<br/><br/>There is one scene in this film that completely foreshadowed the ending for me, it's not hard to figure out what it is since you are already given a hint in the beginning of the movie. This is the one thing that really ticks me off in a movie, when there is a certain scene in the film that foreshadows or ruins the ending, especially in horror movies.<br/><br/>The acting that took place behind all the visuals gave no justice what soever. A blond that has no sense and the everyday skeptical boyfriend whom only makes the situation worse by just being there in the first place whose dialog has been used once before in other horror movies.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a huge failure in which the only thing that could have saved it would had been the director, Sam Raimi, whom is at the urge of dying in the industry due to the flopped Spider-man films and the goofy-but-used-too-much style of film-making that he only has to offer.Don't waste your time with this, watch something else or better yet, read a book and learn how to write something better than this terd."

","Lots of noise and a predictable ending.<br/><br/>The problem with SR is that he isn't particularly bright. Even the basest, most one-dimensional slasher film director knows the cardinal rule that you need victims that aren't too likable, and it helps if they're downright awful, in order for the audience to have some cheap, grisly fun. (What other purpose can horror films possibly fulfill?) But SR doesn't care about that, or is utterly unaware of it: his main character is a fairly blameless, likable, hard-working blonde, hence a poor choice as the victim of an evil curse. It was a poor, illogical choice - unless, of course, SR wanted to annoy the viewers. But considering how successfully, abundantly, and excessively he'd annoyed us with his inept Spiderman films, a change of strategy in this regard would have been well advised.<br/><br/>So confused is the director, that he tried to make the girl less likable - deserving of Hell - by making her ambitious, career-wise. Her ""great unforgivable sin"" was to refuse the witch's wish to go on ignoring her mortgage payments. (Huh?) Sam, you were a poor, hard-working young director with ambitions of producing daft super-hero flicks once, remember? Does that make you curse-worthy? Actually...<br/><br/>The medium says she'd been ""waiting for years to redeem (herself) for losing the boy's soul to the demon"" - but how does that fit with in with her demands for a 10,000-dollar cash payment for her failed anti-demonic séance? So basically her feet itched for this opportunity to arise again - but when it does, she places an obstacle by charging a ridiculous amount of money for it. That's SR logic for ya, right there... Those 10,000 bucks could have been put to better use: a tighter script, and with any money that's left over, a lobotomy for the director too.<br/><br/>The brief excursions into slapstick comedy (a-la ""Evid Dead"") only underline SR's confusion. He couldn't quite make up his mind whether he wanted this to be an all-out cartoonish comedy or a proper horror film.<br/><br/>So what exactly is the moral of the story, the whole point? I guess it must be this: mortgage payments should be optional, especially when it comes to evil grandmas, and anyone who refuses to pay them should keep his house anyway. And anyone who dares stand in their way (an ""evil"" bank, for example) are immoral bastards who need to die and go to Hell. This, in a nutshell, is SR's value system. (You old Socialist, you...) Or am I a looking too hard into this, expecting naively for SR to actually have a point to make in his Donald Duck movies? <br/><br/>The fact that SR vents all his frustrations on a cute blonde also makes one wonder about his past. His past as a young geek getting rejections left-and-right from the school's cheerleaders. Is SR just a plain old vengeful nerd who can never forget?<br/><br/>DMTH offers a plethora of SR's own 80s clichés. He recycled, pillaged, and ransacked his ""Evil Dead"" trilogy like there was no tomorrow. Perhaps he had felt that he'd quasi-sold his soul to the Devil by making ""Spiderman"", hence tried to redeem himself by going back to his young days, his earlier years as a useful director (as opposed to his current state of being a tired imitation of his younger self.) The ending is pitiful. Has any viewer older than three really been surprised that she will get killed in the end? The envelopes had been switched! Wow. A cinematic revolution is nigh..."
"prbocchi","3","3","8","30 December 2009"," Bad mix of comedy and cheap ""horror""
","While watching this drivel I was confused as to whether the intention was for it to be a horror or a comedy. (It did in fact remind me of Evil Dead even before I found out it had the same writers.) Trying to mix horror with comedy is like mixing oil and water. They don't mix well and are not complementary.<br/><br/>This is one of those annoying ""horrors"" that employs cheap scare tactics by forcing you to turn the volume up loud so as to hear the dialog, and then have something jump at you at full scramble-for-the-remote volume. This may have been entertaining when I was 12, but now only gets on my nerves.<br/><br/>The séance scene was so laughable that again I was confused as to whether the main intention was to invoke fear or laughs. I believe it may have been the latter. Unfortunately I experienced neither.<br/><br/>This movie could only be enjoyed by teenagers that may be more forgiving of the films shortcomings and its reliance on special effects for cheap entertainment. Personally I found it difficult to sit through."

","When Sam Raimi gave us his first feature film ""The Evil Dead"" in the 80s. It shocked the world and many people were outraged by the content of the movie, but none the less it quickly became a cult hit and a must-see among horror fans.<br/><br/>16 years have passed since Raimi released ""Army of Darkness"" leaving us craving for more, and during those years we have constantly being massacred by what we've now come to know as torture-porn, films who constantly use violence and gore as the only medium to scare its audiences, americanised version of Japanese films and countless remakes.<br/><br/>So it comes as no surprise when horror fans around the globe rejoiced at hearing that Sam Raimi would be coming back to the horror genre with his new film ""Drag Me To Hell"".<br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell tells the story of Christine (Alison Lohman) a loan officer at a bank who is trying to score a promotion as manager, she is told by her Boss (David Paymer) that in order to secure the promotion she will need to make the hard decisions just like one of her colleagues is doing.<br/><br/>Along comes Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) an old gypsy woman who is having trouble paying her mortgage because she has a disability so she asks Christine to please give her a third extension. Christine wanting to really get her promotion denies the old woman a third extension. Mrs Ganush becomes enraged and after a hilarious yet terrifying fight in the parking garage she curses Christine with a Lamia demon. A demon who torments the victim for the first three days and on the last day, takes the person to hell where they're bound to suffer for eternity.<br/><br/>The great thing about the film is that it doesn't take itself seriously, in fact during the scene where Christine looks for her cat it will have audiences laughing when instead they should be feeling a bit shocked of what she's about to do, but when it comes to jump out of your seat scenes, it will literally make you do so.<br/><br/>This film is funny, scary and revolting at times, and Lohman and Raver's performances are so considerably high that it will make you sympathise with Christine throughout the whole film and Mrs. Ganush will have you hiding your face every time you see her.<br/><br/>The ending will have some audiences gasp in horror and some even clapping knowing that Sam Raimi has truly come back to what first made him a star director. This is definitely the film to see this 2009."

","Where to begin...<br/><br/>I had hopes for this movie, read some positive opinions on it and generally felt like it could be a good movie (Sam Raimi, huh). Note to self: stop trusting ANYONE's opinion.<br/><br/>This is bad. No really, it is. It's a bunch of AWFUL shock scenes (you know the type, calm cuts, quiet orchestral music, pastel colours, then OH F$%K screeching noise that blasts your speakers (it's even worse with headphones), close-up of some CGI Halloween mask and following seizure-cuts) with some generic dialog and product placement strewn in. This is effective, yes. Is it scary? Well, if you think reflexes and startling are the epitome of horror, that's a definite positive. Personally I think it's annoying as hell (dragged me to it! HEH!) and nothing that should be in a horror movie except in a few well-placed doses. Passages of pure terror are great, think of Evil Dead 1 and the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre. Hell, PLANET TERROR creates an atmosphere without this crap - not even going to mention a certain movie from New Zealand. The story reminded me of Thinner a lot, the usual cliché stuff. It's so stupid. A cabin? Seriously? The whole bank thing is so unnatural as well. Also, Justin f&%$ing Long. Bruce Willis BARELY made Die Hard 4 a watchable movie. Oh well.

"Coventry","7","3","9","20 July 2009"," ""The Evil Dead"" it ain't, but damn fine horror nevertheless!
","I actually don't even know why I'm referring to ""The Evil Dead"" in the subject line of this user-comment. Presumably because, like the majority of die-hard horror fanatics, I was really looking forward to director Sam Raimi's return to the genre that promptly made him immortal back in 1981. ""The Evil Dead"" is a timeless masterpiece and a milestone that helped determining the fundamentals of an entire genre. Even though nobody expected ""Drag Me to Hell"" to be on the same dazzling quality level as ""The Evil Dead"", it's nonetheless a refreshment to see Raimi directing a good old-fashioned grueling movie that doesn't feature any comic book superheroes in tight spider maillots, massive 200 million dollar budgets or hi-tech spectacular stunts. <br/><br/>""Drag Me To Hell"" has a fairly simplistic plot and even regularly reverts back to some of the most ancient clichés of the horror genre, but at least the excitement is non-stop and fast-paced with a handful of authentic jump-moments. The story is a bit of a mixture between Stephen King's ""Thinner"" and the legendary classic ""The Exorcist"". Over- ambitious bank employee Christine Brown becomes the victim of a terrible curse when she refuses to extend the loan of an ageing gypsy woman and subsequently puts her to shame in public. The evil-eyed gypsy wench Sylvia Ganush (glorious role for TV-actress Lorna Raver) possesses Christine with the spirit of Lamia; a malignant and insurmountable goat- lord demon that demands animal sacrifices and can't even be controlled during professionally staged exorcism sessions. Experienced horror buffs know that a plot description like this guarantees a giant amount of sinister séances, magic talismans and hysterically rampaging witches. Especially the first half hour and the climax of ""Drag Me To Hell"" are downright fantastic and genuine 'oldskool' horror material. The middle section is more or less familiar territory, with derivative twists and irrelevant sub plots, but Sam Raimi nevertheless professionally sustains the moody atmosphere and even gradually builds up towards the stupendous finale. Obviously I can't reveal anything about the ending, but I assure it's the best frikkin' climax I saw in cinemas in decades! The make-up and sound effects are sublimely unsettling without ever becoming overly tasteless or shocking, and the acting performances are really satisfying. Alison Lohman is very good as the tormented protagonist – not at all hysterical or irritating like I initially feared – and she received adequate support from Justin Long, David Paymer and the aforementioned Lorna Raver. <br/><br/>The only thing missing here is a cameo from ultra-cool dude and regular Sam Raimi buddy Bruce Campbell, but according to the trivia section he got in conflict with other filming responsibilities, so even that's forgiven."

People were laughing in the cinema, yet some people somewhere seem to have loved it. There was no suspense, the jumpy parts were too obvious, the story line with the button was just horrific. The slapstick was awful there was too much fake gore which just amused and grossed people out more than anything. The acting was very mediocre and i just think thrill seekers and anyone with half a brain can see that this film must have been low budget and clearly in my opinion one of the worst i have seen.

","This is the Sam Raimi that made the Evil Dead films. After holding back for the last decade, he really lets rip with the OTT camera-work and gross outs. Once the plot is established, he steams from one set piece to another with barely a pause for breath. It's amazingly suspenseful. You WILL jump. It's physically impossible not to with the volume of the shock cuts, but Raimi actually delivers on the creepy visuals to accompany the jump, which instantly elevates it above the cheap-scares of a typical modern horror flick.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman and Lorna Raver really kick the crap out of each other. The séance scene is AWESOME. The make-up and practical FX are fantastic. The CG is good for the most part, although there are a couple of dodgy moments. You see the ending coming a mile-off, but it's so well done and fantastic to watch that you don't care.<br/><br/>People, check it out. It's a ridiculously enjoyable motion picture."
"jaymart-2","3","6","24","26 May 2009"," Not really that scary
","Sam Raimi holds a special place in my heart for helming the seminal first of the evil dead trilogy many moons ago when it's 'video nasty' (and therefore hard to obtain), status made it 'the film' to see. So it was with great expectation that I took a look at his latest return to the horror genre after big budget excesses with peter parker.<br/><br/>Alas after a promising opening twenty minutes the film began to stumble, so intent on shocking us in scene after scene that it became unsteady on its feet, apparently undecided as to what kind of horror film it really wanted to be.<br/><br/>Prevented from being genuinely scary by it's prohibitive Pg-13 certificate, it veers towards the zany, Tex Avery like horror you would expect from the director of Evil Dead 2, but it also sought in vain to recreate the more subtle shockers of old (by the likes of Jacques Tourneur and Val Lewton), but without the confidence to let scenes breathe and let the audience sweat, papering over the lack of genuine frights with aural bluster and shock sound effects for much of it's mid section. The eventual appearance of the main demon proves disappointing as it was vanquished so simply. <br/><br/>To be fair the film does contain one or two unsettling moments, one being a scene near the beginning, as the gypsy woman attacks the heroine in an underground car park. <br/><br/>Amusingly the film's most original element seemed to be the toothless gypsy's penchant for 'gumming' the lead actress's chin, a persistently effective route to making the audience groan and squirm with disgust."

","Firstly, I want to say that I actually can't understand the high rating that this movie has been given. When I saw the 83 metacritic score I thought 'yes! this movie is going to be awesome...' and sat back with my glass of wine ready to be terrified. It didn't happen. Not once.<br/><br/>Now, I understand that this film is supposed to be a horror/comedy...but to me it fails to be either or both combined. At no point is this film scary, in fact, the music and the amount of stuff that ends up in Christine's mouth (embalming fluid, eyeballs, a fist) mean that actually it's quite ridiculous. And what is up with an old lady 'gummimg' someones chin?! Unfortunately I think the film lost me at that point, and it's pretty close to the beginning.<br/><br/>Nor is the film funny. I laughed a couple of times while turning around to my friend and saying 'seriously, what the hell is up with this film?', more in confusion than anything else. The whole things strikes me as really lame...something that kids would think up for a school play.<br/><br/>Something else, and actually probably the biggest fault of the film, are the characters. The reason behind Christine being cursed is stupid, and actually she is so whiny and pathetic that I didn't actually care if she got dragged to hell. In fact, I wish it had happened sooner."

","Being introduced to Sam Raimi through Spider-Man, which was a defining (if not great) superhero film, and Spider-Man 2, which approached being great, Spider-Man 3's total and abject failure came as something of a shock to my system. If only I'd had Drag Me To Hell (or Raimi's 80s flicks) to prepare me.<br/><br/>DMTH is listed under and was marketed at as ""horror."" God knows the genre's boundaries are wide enough to let just about anything in, and DMTH certainly has its bases covered: animals jump out at inopportune moments, branches hit windows, the music builds up and up during intense scenes, just to reveal that there's nothing in the closet, after all, and so on. But it's not good horror. The startles are effective, but cheap and instantly forgettable, cut-and-pasted from a thousand other movies that have been made since the 1980s.<br/><br/>Here the film's defenders will chime in that, really, everybody ought to understand that this is a comedy. But it isn't. Comedy is Johnny Depp in Pirates of the Caribbean, Heath Ledger in The Dark Knight Rises, Brad Pitt in Burn After Reading, Mandy Patinkin in The Princess Bride. Comedy is, dare I say it, Bruce Campbell in the Spider-Man films. Those will make you laugh. DMTH is camp, and in trying to amuse you with its deliberate predictability, it will instead confuse you with its incoherence. After all, the film does not hate the horror genre that it is so loosely affiliated with. It loves it. It wants to make fun of it, but can't, because it believes wholeheartedly in everything that cheap, disposable horror stands for, and for every scene that is uproariously over-the-top, there is another that would belong beat-for-beat in a straight horror picture. Never mind the fact that it is just as ludicrous, and that the only reason we've come to accept it is through familiarity. <br/><br/>As for what humour there is to be found in scenes of projectile vomiting, and others such - I hold that it is not much at all - it deserves no more or less adoration than fart jokes in an Adam Sandler movie. That's the sort of cleverness on display here. <br/><br/>Raymond Chandler said of a run-of-the-mill detective novel, in his essay The Simple Art of Murder, that ""...the strange thing is that this average, more than middling dull, pooped-out piece of utterly unreal and mechanical fiction is not terribly different from what are called the masterpieces of the art. It drags on a little more slowly, the dialogue is a little grayer, the cardboard out of which the characters are cut is a shade thinner, and the cheating is a little more obvious; but it is the same kind of book."" <br/><br/>DMTH is that average detective novel. It's the average sci-fi Star Wars wannabe, the average fantasy Lord of the Rings knock-off, all of which you can find in excess quantities at your local chain bookstore, each one targeted at a specific audience but fulfilling, inescapably, precisely the same function. For all its surface vulgarity, Drag Me To Hell is as safe as safe could be."

There was no relationship, there was just a room full of actors pretending to be believable, they weren't feeling it and neither was I. I felt like I was watching a school project, it was cast badly, the script was tedious and dense.

","This review contains very minor spoilers.<br/><br/>I really wanted to see Drag Me To Hell because I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi's The Evil Dead movies. I've always thought Raimi was a brilliant horror film maker. Drag Me To Hell's opening scene is extremely effective. It just keeps you wanting more. Raimi works brilliantly at letting the audience know what they're in for.<br/><br/>There's more than just a hint of The Evil Dead in here. Raimi works on convincing you that the characters are just every day normal people in which extraordinary things are going to happen. Within 15 minutes, you know Lohman's character is in trouble and that's where the jumps start. Most of them are cheap shocks in truth, but they all work really well. You'll know what I mean when you jump out of your seat because of a handkerchief.<br/><br/>When I went to see this at the cinema with friends most of them had pretty much the same reaction. Not being familiar with Raimi's work or that the movie was intended to be tongue-in-cheek and quite funny in parts, the general opinion was that it failed as a horror movie, but succeeded as a comedy movie. The 'gumming' scene comes to mind as a particularly funny scene which is also quite sinister at the same time.<br/><br/>I find it particularly amusing that I went to see this movie three times at the cinema and this is my second view of it on DVD and I still jump out of my seat at some of the scares. Some of them are just so unexpected that when you watch it again you just forget they're there.<br/><br/>There are two different versions of the movie available in the US, theatrical and uncut. The uncut version is the only version available in the UK, although the DVD artwork does not specify this. A few scenes are bloodier and the F-bomb is dropped. The certificate is still 15 though.

"ryanricky1993","10","2","5","6 January 2010"," Guess what? It not originally from Japan or a Remake.
","When I first heard of this movie, the title told me what I wanted to know. With the grade A pieces of crap ""Horror"" movies in 2009 such as Friday the 13th or The Unborn being released, I had little interest to see any horror film in theaters, and Drag Me To Hell sounded like it would be like one of these movies. Needless to say I didn't pay attention to the movie, and can't recall even seeing a trailer on T.V or looking for one on the internet. Eventually however, I saw that Sam Raimi was making this film. I have known of Raimi's work ever since I was smaller, but being a bit young to see it in theaters during the time of Evil Dead's release, I eventually saw them when I was in my early years of 10 and 11. I remember sneaking in to see my brothers watching Army of Darkness at 6 however, and being scared ****less for weeks. Now, with a bit of fresh nostalgia to motivate me, I decided to research this movie. I was surprised to find it holding a 93% fresh rating on rotten tomatoes, and decided to wait and buy it on DVD, my hope that it being critically acclaimed and coming from Sam Raimi would provide a brilliant horror movie. And it did. When I finally saw Drag Me to Hell, I was blown away. I must applaud Raimi's work on this original concept that certainly ranks itself among films like The Exorcist or A Nightmare on Elm Street. So now, lets begin the breakdown shall we? The Story takes place in a suburban Los Angeles where the films opens up to a slightly disturbing set of scenes in the mid sixties that establishes some character plot and to give us our first look at what Hell has in store for the cursed. It then takes us straight from the action experienced a few seconds before into the opening credits. I particularly thought the score for this certain part of the movie was incredible and quite eerie, while giving us some background on the accounts of demons in the old times. We then meet our main character, the brilliantly played Christine Brown, who is a loan officer for a bank, and as we all know she gets in some deep **** with an old gypsy woman who pleads for an extension to pay off her debt or her house will be seized by the government. Christine gets cursed for she doesn't give the old bag her extension and we have our movie begin its chain of events. The story gives us characters who become deeply scarred, and the process in which Christine's life get absolutely destroyed is portrayed perfectly horror wise. The séance room scene without giving much away is one of the eeriest parts of the movie. Its combination of dialogue, music, and images spread out through the entire scene worked out perfectly to develop the character of pretty much, Hell. Drag Me To Hell scared me, but not in a scream fest rather in a smart form, by clever camera angles combined with scenes of the monsters and demons we have in the film. So much could have gone wrong with this, but it all played out effectively. Michael Meyers for example, never popped up and screamed, most times you just saw him appear. People didn't say Halloween scared me because of the pop up moments; they say it scared me because of Meyers. Same goes with Freddy Krueger, he just talked and it creeped you out. When you hear the Lamia talk or see Mrs.Ganush it has that sort of effect. It's creepy and scary, but you're not jumping out of your seat when you hear it. There are a few pop out and scare you moments but don't feel cheap or out of place at all. In the way that they are used, they contribute well to the pace and horror aspect of the movie. Then ending I will also add, is one of the best parts of the movie. Its not prolonged as neither is the first one in the beginning (This will make more sense after you watch the movie) and its just ends leaving us to think, and actually think of what really happened to the character. It's not real, but in the movie it is and in that sense it's pretty intense. Closing Comments: The effort and brilliant screenplay is proof in the finalized product. This film isn't supposed to make you laugh in my opinion, but I did find some of the scenes offer some comical lines, but again they did not feel out of place and never broke the horror feel to the movie. There were times throughout the movie when I would think ""Sam Raimi is the only one who would write that."" Those who don't understand Raimi's style of horror films will find this movie unenjoyable because it isn't the cheap stereotypical high school kids/hot girls with a mildly scary slasher movie, where there are at least two sex scenes to keep the college kids attention. Horror movies have become a social object for older and younger kids to bring their friends, to get cheap scares and then talk about it for weeks. Subsequently directors and producers create terribly put together pieces of pedestrian **** to please them, but really only to please their own wallets. If you are one of these movie goers odds are The Eye or The Grudge would be more your kind of movie. Raimi didn't make this film for those people, and clearly kept fans in mind and doesn't disappoint. If you want to see a thought provoking brilliant sound track and visual image combination of a movie that is intelligent and one of the best true Horror films I've seen in years, you'll find your Michael Meyers with Drag Me to Hell."

","Not recommended. As evidence for how unimpressed I was with director Sam Raimi's (The Evil Dead, Army Of Darkness) Drag Me To Hell, part way through I flipped over to a ten-year-old episode of Frasier and found it much more shocking and funny. Oh where to start? Although Alison Lohman was super in Matchstick Men, she cannot carry this lead weight and Justin Long, as her boyfriend, is similarly plumbiferous. Lorna Raver was great as a repulsive old gypsy woman but she was never scary; only one jump shock caught me. The send up of previous movies (The Exorcist, Amityville Horror, Poltergeist) only showed me how much fun we were missing. I was gulled by the final plot twist only because, in rapt inattention, I ignored the first rule of set decoration. But so many people did like this movie that I wonder . . . what gypsy cursed them?"
"Sir_Ipkiss","4","2","5","1 December 2009"," No Sleepless Nights Here
","I'll admit firstly that I hate horror movies. I hate watching them and loving them and then not being able to sleep for a week. And knowing that the mark of the best horror movies is that inability to sleep.<br/><br/>I'll admit secondly that after seeing the trailer for Drag Me To Hell, I was genuinely looking forward to it. And I even braved myself to watch it well after the sun had set.<br/><br/>Yawn. Is it over yet? I was really disappointed. Because I lost so much interest about twenty minutes into the movie, I missed a lot of the fun stuff. Those holes in the story that critics love to point out. And this movie was full of them.<br/><br/>But first, let's stick to the horror side of it. And keep it clean. This movie wasn't that. Clean. It was downright disgusting. Which doesn't equate to scary. An old, hideous woman who can't keep her teeth in SUCKING on a girl's jaw is really not scary. And the only time I even thought about closing my eyes was when the old woman threw up bugs and stuff on the girl's face. Yuck. Not eeeek.<br/><br/>Also, I think I've passed the age where a shadow on the wall is scary. It's not about the lack of shock effect. It's just not...scary. Gremlins was scary compared this (and a much, much better movie). Oh, while I'm at it, I would have thought that flying hankies with faces on it would be relegated to Scary Movie type movies. Seriously? Hankies!!! And don't get me started on the talking goat. That was hilarious. For a second. As for the button - was that huge fight really necessary for the old lady to get the button off.<br/><br/>Actually this movie is pretty funny. But in a shake your head funny sort of way. And then the gaping plot holes. I won't point out all - just the first couple remember.<br/><br/>1. The old lady attacks the girl in a parking lot and there's no doubt it was her; and there's no doubt it happened, and the police were there - to take statements and cordon off the area...but not arrest the old lady. Or maybe they did, and she died.<br/><br/>2. This girl has a hellava lot of money for a farm girl who's trying very, very hard to become assistant bank manager. I mean look at the house she lives in. Not a drudgy apartment at all. And yes, she can't raise 10k.<br/><br/>3. anvil? on a rope? in the garage???? 4. She gets a pretty fat lip in the fight in the parking lot. Don't worry, she's part wolverine. She heals pretty quick from all her bumps and bruises.<br/><br/>There's a lot more. But it's not even funny to type out.<br/><br/>So why did I give it a 4. Not a 1.<br/><br/>The sound's awesome. If it wasn't supporting a shadow, a tap dancing Mexican and a hanky, it would be very fitting. The acting is OK. The old lady is convincing, if she had been less disgusting and more scary - yay. Justin Long is miscast but he doesn't do anything wrong. At the end of the day, it's a movie I'd a complain about. But I probably wouldn't be compelled to walk out on it.<br/><br/>And here's a to a good night of sleep."
"jjack929","3","2","5","21 November 2009"," Don't let sentimentality override good judgment.
","No spoilers here, just some general points. This movie is a poor attempt at recreating something like The Evil Dead, but if the fact that I laughed through this entire flick tells you anything, it should be that it's not a horror movie. Not by a longshot. It's more like a disgusting comedy, with a lot of things that are so badly done that they make you laugh instead of scaring you, and a lot of really gross stuff thrown in to try to make you stop laughing.<br/><br/>The movie didn't really look interesting from the advertisements but I gave it a chance because it's Sam Raimi. In terms of quality, think less ""Spider-Man"" and more ""Evil Dead 2"" with a bigger budget. And then even if you liked The Evil Dead 2, think of this as an even less-scary version of the same basic idea. (To be fair, I did enjoy TED and TED2, and particularly TED3: Army of Darkness, but they weren't very scary unless maybe you were 12 when you saw them.) Then again, any time they refer to a movie as having a ""cult following"" it usually means it sucked but some people liked it anyway.<br/><br/>Compounding the facts that this movie wasn't scary, overly interesting, or particularly well-done is the fact that at its root, it's an 1:39 Mac commercial. Yes, it stars Justin Long, the infamous ""Hello, I'm a Mac"" tool who already owns your television for a good portion of the day by virtue of his employer's bloated advertising budget. The man should stick to Mac commercials because his acting is appallingly bad, so much so that my wife said he could easily be Keanu Reeves' son. Everyone in the movie has an iphone, and uses a Mac, because Macs are great computers. Oh wait, no, it's because Justin Long works for Apple, and Apple blows ridiculous amounts of money on ""subliminal"" advertising. Say, how come those ""I'm a Mac"" commercials never mention that Apple would've gone out of business if PC, er, Bill Gates hadn't bailed them out? Ooops.<br/><br/>Back to the movie - overall the characters were very caricature-ish, hardly believable, the story was weak, the acting was bad, it wasn't scary, and the special effects - well, they were Sam Raimi-ish, if that means anything to you; again, think Evil Dead 2 with a bigger budget. All in all, a total failure of a movie, and don't let the people who are still pining over The Evil Dead and its sequel convince you otherwise. This movie is BAD."
"NotMoreMovies","7","2","5","23 October 2009"," Very well written, but based on an age-old genre
","Don't worry, I'll make my negative comment (just one) quick and painless -- This is another ""someone ticks off an old gypsy, gypsy curses the person, the person suffers tremendously, the person tries the whole movie to undo the curse"" story. Aside from that, it held my interest and the acting was quite compelling. This is a movie where you're left to wonder...is any of this real, or could all of it just be psychological suggestion? Do we need to believe in curses for them to be real, and if so, do things truly happen due to a curse, or because we talk ourselves into thinking something bad will happen. As you'll see in this movie, nothing bad happens until the cursed individual believes they have a reason to think something will happen. The ending is the best part because it leaves you to wonder -- ""Is what I just 'saw' what really happened, or is it just what happened coming from the mind of the one who was 'cursed'?"" I definitely recommend this one for all horror fans, it will really make you think! 7/10 (lost 1 point for using a clichéd story line)"
"Monotreme02","7","2","5","15 October 2009"," A clever throwback: A good, old-fashioned time at the movies
","Over the past decade, I couldn't help but notice that Sam Raimi and Peter Jackson have been following very similar career paths. Both started out directing zero-budget, hilariously schlocky and highly stylized horror films, eventually upgrading and by the turn of the century directing big-budget studio-produced fantasy films. Jackson lent his unique vision and style to the Lord of the Rings trilogy, while Raimi's Spider-Man films featured a fascinating combination of low-budget horror sentiments and stylistic choices with enormous-budget production values. Now, after he finished his original Spidey trilogy (and before moving on to the upcoming sequels), Raimi went back to his roots and delivered a good, old-fashioned schlocky horror entertainment. And boy does he deliver.<br/><br/>Unlike the two Evil Dead sequels, this film isn't a straight-up horror comedy, although it is quite hilarious. It's not a parody, though, and doesn't feature visual gags or jokes or anything like that. But rather, it just features scenes and concepts that are so over-the-top, one can't help but to laugh. In fact, this film can be seen as the exact opposite of ""modern"" horror movies: those films push the gritty realism of the situations they depict (even if they are usually nothing more than cheap torture and gore), while in this film, Raimi makes a point to emphasize the mythical, fantasy element and how over-the-top it is. By not taking itself seriously, the film leaves itself room to basically do whatever it wants, and stylistically, it really feels like a throwback to a more old-fashioned style of horror entertainment. It's not even that intense a film – it's rated PG-13, features no nudity or gore (but it does feature a lot of gross-out scenes featuring various insects and liquids) and most of its scares come from its sound design and editing.<br/><br/>Speaking of the sound design and editing, the film is a technical wonder. Because it's so stylistically over-the-top, Raimi has the freedom to do what he wants with his camera, and the film features some really well-shot and well-crafted scenes and sequences that greatly intensify its sense of style. Probably the most inspired technical element of the film is its sound, from the brilliant sound design and effects to its pounding musical score which is also one of its biggest throwbacks to an older-fashioned style of film. The performances are also top-notch; good casting choices led to actors who don't phone in their performances but rather invest a lot of effort, both physical and emotional, into their roles, and the results are most noticeable. Alison Lohman particularly stands out, and she's also an underrated favourite of mine so it's great to see her get meaty leading roles like this one. Justin Long can be absolutely hilarious when he wants to so it's still strange for me to see him in completely straight-guy roles such as in Live Free or Die Hard, but it actually works in this film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, what makes this film work so well is that it never takes itself seriously. Raimi uses the best stylistic flourishes at his disposal to lend it an atmosphere and feeling of an older and more classic type of horror film, a film that isn't really scary at all (except for a few jump-out-of-your-seat scenes which are just part of the throwback) but one that works on a purely entertaining level as an old-fashioned good time at the movies."

I delayed seeing it for a long time because I didn't want their opinion to color my feelings for the film. I like the film once it gets going. Once our heroine is cursed I think the film really works (though I think something towards the end is a bit of a cop out). The trouble for me was getting through the first third or so of the film. For me it was a long tough slog made difficult by several unlikeable characters. (I'm also not a fan of the old woman who places the curse since its clear from frame one she, and her family are just totally evil),].

","In my perspective this is probably the most flawless horror movie ever made. The movie does what it’s supposed to do: horrify the audience and instill fear in them even after they have left the theatre. It does follow some guidelines of a horror movie of its genre like including a fortune teller, a séance and some gory scenes (that have enough of a kick to make you disgusted but keep your eyes fixed on the screen.) I have to say that even after reading the entire storyline and knowing what will happen in each scene I was surprised with the amount of jerks I got when I watched it. The acting of Alison Lohman has its peaks and valleys but Justin Long and Lorna Raver did a top notch job in executing their roles. The twist in the end is almost Hitchcockish but you will be shell shocked while exiting the theatre. The direction is absolutely amazing leaving you wanting more and more after every scene. I only wish people make more horror movies like this."

","I wouldn't say I'm a total Sam Raimi fan, but I do like me some good horror. For the most part, DMTH was good. Not great, not fantastic, but just good. Beyond very minor elements, the story of someone being cursed is an old one.<br/><br/>A loan officer finds that a particular customer has placed a curse on her, for, umm, not granting her loan. That's right. She didn't steal her kids, didn't run over her family while driving drunk or stab her in the back, she was just doing her job and WHAM! got a curse. For the rest of the film, she tries to shake off this curse by magically going to the only fortune teller within a 1000 miles that can actually help her.<br/><br/>I've read as to how funny this movie is, yet I didn't laugh much. I saw the dark humor, two in particular involving animals. (Justin Long, who is at least funny in films such as Dodgeball, doesn't have one, not ONE funny line.) But dark humor is done much better in so many other movies. And about the story line, I have to say that it kept reminding me of the Steven King movie ""Thinner"". They were both cursed, and they both had to hunt down a cure before they were gone. Thinner's curse, was of course, much better and a hell of a lot funnier. And let's not even go into the predictable ending.<br/><br/>But I can't totally condemn the movie. There were plenty of creepy scenes, and Sam's got an eye for shots. Wait for a rental, though."
"cr608","10","2","5","18 June 2009"," A young woman's act of cruelty summons demonic forces to torture her.
","This review contains a Spoiler about the movie, that I make in hopes of countering a popular criticism of the film. Knowing it will, I believe, help many people enjoy the movie MORE.(Spoiler commences in the next paragraph).<br/><br/>Before I say anything else about this movie, I have to make a comment about what other reviewers have said about the film, and correct a general misinterpretation of the film. I made the same misinterpretation when first viewed it, but on reflection, (which a rewatch confirmed) I realized that what many people describe as a ""gypsy curse"" is in fact a demonic curse, and nothing to do with the gypsy woman at all. Raimi in his interviews has emphatically stated that the character of Mrs. Ganush is the victim in the story, and the way he shoots the parking lot scene, and the reality-bending events that happen there, indicates quite clearly that Christine is already haunted by the Demon, and the thing in the parking lot is NOT the pitiful old lady who was begging her for mercy in the bank. Thus, all the reviews that claim Mrs. Ganush is a villain are quite wrong, and do Raimi's masterful film no service. Later in the film we see multiple examples of demonic ""Ganush"" appearing, and we know it's the Demon in her form, so why believe that the thing in the parking lot is the real Mrs. Ganush? And more importantly, this means that the ""curse"" is just a trick of the demon's. Christine damns herself by believing in this ""curse"" and in her descent to further depravity, including her final horrible crime against the REAL Mrs. Ganush at the end of the film. The Parking Lot creature is an exaggeration of the aspects of the real, pitiful, old lady that Christine found repulsive.<br/><br/>What is brilliant about the film, for me, is the way Raimi tricks the audience into believing the lie along with Christine, and sympathizing with the choices that damn her at the end. People who call this a ""comedy"" are truly off the mark ...this is a deadly dark horror film ... just because it includes an anvil gag doesn't make it a comedy, since the anvil gag is clearly constructed by terrifying supernatural forces. It's not a cartoon if it's constructed by Demons to torture you.<br/><br/>I did not see the original Evil Dead films, so any references to those films were lost on me. I prefer it that way, since I enjoyed this film as perfect by itself, without the distraction of referencing.<br/><br/>I have gone back and seen this film 4 times in the theater now (though I did wait for Bargain Tuesdays and a Matinees). It really is beautifully constructed and shot. A real honest to god FILM. If you pass up the chance to see this in the theater, you really have missed a treat, because Raimi really makes use of the whole screen. (Note Clay's reactions in the background during the reading of Christine's fortune .... Justin Long does incredible work in this).<br/><br/>My only quibble with the film is that, while Raimi pulls a great deal of subtlety out of Allison Lohman (as Christine), I feel her acting fell down slightly whenever she was required to show real anger ... when required to be truly angry she didn't really pull it off, but I saw what Raimi was going for, and it still worked. Brilliant film. Don't miss it."
"greg_arganda","10","2","5","17 June 2009"," Gumming to death goodness
","Sam Raimi's ""Drag Me To Hell"" claws out of the ground through the depths of hell and pukes on any on-lookers in horrifying glory. <br/><br/>This film is a glorious approach to horror films today, the presence of the antagonist Mrs. Ganush is absolutely terrifying, the film gross and disgustingly beautiful and the usage of C.G.I. to tell the tale of the Lamia's evil spirit is fantastic. The blind eye of Mrs. Ganush staring deeply into the eyes of Christine Brown says so much with no words at all. Her appearance is like that of the walking dead, she carries a powerfully terrifying figure that I just loved. The film's no holds barred approach to grossing the audience out will please to no end because of how it will make one cringe and squirm. Seeing Mrs. Ganush's false teeth fall out and her attempting to bite Christine Brown in the face, slobbering all over her will simply make you laugh and cringe at the same time, it's a load of gross fun. The C.G.I. usage in the film was incredibly tasteful, we the audience get to watch as the Lamia's spirit crawls up the wall like a shadow. It's really reminiscent of Bram Stoker's Dracula because we see the Lamia's shadow crawling up the walls like Dracula's shadow which is a wonderful tribute to make. <br/><br/>I give this film two damned thumbs up for being a terrifyingly fun experience that will please to the depths of hell. I recommend everyone to go see it."

","I don't usually review movies here when there are already nearly 300 reviews, but I liked Drag Me To Hell a lot, so what the hell. First off, I like the title, in an I Spit On Your Grave sort of way. Secondly, I like the timeliness of it being about a woman who gets a curse put on her for foreclosing on a loan, you know, in this day and age of loan foreclosure horrors. But what I really liked is that, although it has its funny moments, its not one of your camp, stupid gory movies like the Evil Dead sequels, but instead is made to scare the hell out of you, and it does a pretty good job at it. I must say, the old gypsy woman is a great villain ranking up there with Freddy. Few movies have legitimately scared me. Let's see, there's the original Evil Dead, there's Descent about the cave exploring chicks, there's The Exorcist, there's Suspiria, Seven and Silence of the Lamb were both good and creepy, there was that Italian ""Zombie"" movie with the zombie fighting a shark underwater, the original Texas Chainsaw Massacre (forget about all the remakes), Invasion of the Body Snatchers 1978, The Thing 1982 is good for a heart attack the first time you see it, I actually liked CHUD a lot, and . . .and . . . and now there is Drag Me To Hell. It really does deserve to be ranked up there with the greats. It's really a shame that the so-called modern masters of horrors usually just make crap. I mean, look at George Ramero. What has he done since Dawn of the Dead? Nearly every Stephen King movie with the exception of Carrie and the original version of The Shining is just doo-doo. John Carpenter made a bunch of cult classics, granted, but he's also made some dogs such as Prince of Darkness. Seriously, when is the last time Wes Craven really scared you? I'm truly happy to see Sam Raimi back in action with his original genre. I hope he pumps out a bunch of good, old fashioned shock schlocks to entertain the hell out of us all."

","Intro: Sam Raimi is back to the horror genre with this scary and quite humorous tale of demonic proportions.<br/><br/>Synopsis: Christine Brown is a loan officer for a local bank, when she denies a very scary gypsy's mortgage claim, forcing her out of her house, she is cursed to be sent to hell in 3 days time. (yes even scary monsters have tax issues) Review: The difference, for me, between the Evil Dead trilogy and Drag Me To Hell is that Evil Dead made me laugh and entertained me. Where as Drag Me To Hell made me laugh and genuinely scared me. Sam Raimi makes a great composition of eerie camera shots and borderline disturbing imagery. A great jump on horror for a PG-13 rating. Another reason it was good is because it kind of brought back that classic horror movie feel, and had a lot of originality, something that is hard to find in the horror genre these days. Now somethings that kind of got to me were some of the more comedic scenes. A lot of the scary parts had humorous parts in them, and there were a couple times where it took away the scare for me, still however entertaining. As far as special effects, well I'm not sure if they had a lot of money for some of the CGI or what the deal was, it's nothing that would ruin the movie for me.<br/><br/>I think the real winner in this one though was the bone-chilling score, which was flawless. It is truly amazing how much a musical score can set a terrifying mood.<br/><br/>Also very good performances by both Alison Lohman and Justin Long"

","I admit it, I've got a soft spot for horror movies, and because of this I tend to be more forgiving than most when it comes to this much-maligned genre. Yet, in spite of all this, I can find nothing redeeming to recommend in Sam Rami's Drag Me to Hell.<br/><br/>Garnering a stunning consensus of positive praise from both Rotten Tomatoes and Metacritic websites, I have to wonder if perchance I was screened an alternate print from which all quality had been stripped? To describe the plot as basic is being kind. Filled with claptrap and predictability (things are telegraphed to the audience so far in advance as to be insulting), it tells the story of Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), an insecure and somewhat timid loans officer at a bank. In an attempt to portray herself as worthy of a managerial promotion she's in contention for, she snubs a request from an elderly gypsy woman (Lorna Raver) who's seeking an extension on her mortgage payments. Denied, the woman places a curse on Brown in which an invisible demon known as a Lamia will torment her for three days before ultimately dragging her and her soul to Hell for eternal torment.<br/><br/>While much of the accolades for this film focus on Raimi's return to the humor-infused approach he used in the latter two installments of his Evil Dead trilogy, Drag Me to Hell's ""humor"" is largely of the gross-out variety. If your idea of funny is the sight of the old woman slopping out her disgusting goo-covered dentures, or puking green embalming fluid down Brown's throat, then no doubt you'll find this a laugh riot.<br/><br/>The problem is that while Raimi has learned to restrain himself over the years and become a commercially viable go-to choice for big, largely non-demanding Hollywood projects (Darkman, The Quick and the Dead, The Spiderman franchise), he hasn't really broken through and elevated himself to auteur status. At his core he's still a hack – albeit one with a love for comics, slapstick and parody – but a hack nonetheless. At a moment when Raimi should be stepping up and claiming the mantle of horror maestro, he's instead regressed and churned out a product that is puerile, simplistic, and gratuitous. Still, if the positive reviews keep flowing his way (this one excepted), Raimi will no doubt follow things up with a sequel, likely titled Drag Me Laughing to the Bank."

","I don't get it. So the movie was predictable. It wasn't at all scary, unless Buffy the vampire slayer the series is scary to you maybe. From what i've read purposely bad humor. And these are good qualities? This is what was missing from horror films? Sam Raimi makes a new evil dead 2ish film and it wins on originality? So horror movies are not supposed the be scary now. They are not supposed to have surprising twists or fresh humor. No need for originality. Horror films are supposed to be laughingly horrible and thus considered a comedy? Oh, and throw in a random loud noise and sharp visual change for a dame to jump and now we have a classic? I admit there have been some bad movies lately but giving this anything other than a 1 is just searching. Maybe that is the joke I don't know."

","'Drag Me To Hell' is a god-damn good film, floating in a sea of horror plagued with sunken Hollywood remakes, and it also gives a revitalising kick to the comedy-horror genre.<br/><br/>Christine (Alison Lohman) is told to make the 'hard' decisions in her job at the local bank to seal a promotion, and the weathered old gypsy Mrs Ganush (Lorna Raver) is the unfortunate victim of this selfish act of personal greed and capitalism. But, she gets the last scratch (laugh, ruler, bite...) as she places a Lamia curse upon Christine. In three days she will be dragged into the depths of hell by an unspeakable evil force. What follows is a thrilling, edge-of-your-seat, over-the-top, suspense fuelled ride (reminiscent of Sam Raimi's early Evil Dead films) through ninety-minutes of scary, disgusting and at times quite humorous (anvil, anybody?) scenes that make 'DMTH' an enjoyable and impressive film.<br/><br/>Raimi does what he does best, by allowing the surroundings to come to life – the rattling of doors and windows, the use of shadows – he takes a hold of the age old cinematic device of keeping the vision and display of the Lamia at bay and allowing our minds to fill in the blanks. A perfect example is a scene in which Christine is tripped in her own bedroom by the forces beyond. How can you combat, defeat or avoid something if you don't know what, where or who it is. The tried-and-tested common horror conventions coupled with the slick editing of Bob Murawski (who virtually creates and sustains the menace of the penultimate scene), a solid central performance of Alison Lohman (who now knows the dangers of refusing a loan extension!) and the knowledgeable direction and experience of Sam Raimi makes 'Drag Me To Hell' one of the fair few horror films worth the admittance fee.<br/><br/>This film is nothing new, and nothing different. You will notice the subtle nods and homage's through the humour and disgusting inventiveness of Raimi to the various films of the same veneer in the 1980's and the early 1990's, but what makes this film stand-out is that it ticks all the right boxes in audience expectation. It will make you jump, keep you tense, release a giggle and squirm a little, and most importantly: it is fun."

The only one I really liked in this was Justin Long and he's severely underused. I didnt like that she got cursed for literally doing her job. Maybe Sam Raimi thought it would make for a more compelling reason to feel sorry for her, but it just annoyed me more than anything. And then at the end, her whole conclusion is ""I could have given her that extension and I didn't and that was wrong""...like.....no. As Justin Long pointed out earlier in the film , she already was given an extension twice. Its not your fault she isnt paying her mortgage. Also after failed advice after failed advice, the medium finally tells her she can gift the button away and even Alison Lohman's character has to ask ""Why didnt you tell me that before""? Like, it just felt that they need to pad the runtime a bit and so they came up with something new for the character to have to do. <br/><br/>I think Evil Dead is great. I know Sam can do horror.

","How can any reasonable human being give this movie a good rating? I abhorred every second of Drag Me to Hell and despite admitting that it wasn't badly made in terms of set design, cinematography, or editing, for example, it suffers from a director who can't seem to decide if he wants to make a parody on horror movies or an actual horror movie and ends up making one of the hugest pieces of feces in recent years (I could, in fact, re-use all of these words when writing a review for The Cabin in the Woods, another outrageously overrated rubbish). Limiting himself to a PG-13 rating, Raimi at least spares the audience more atrociously surrealistic CGI gore effects, but the 3rd highest as well as lowest of MPAA classifications still leaves space for idiotic dialogs, shameless copying from other horror flicks, and blatant predictability. I'm not saying that I wasn't frightened by parts of it, yet for most of the time, I was offended and disgusted by this ghastly made movie. Critics that call it ironic or even hilarious just have to be paid by Universal Pictures since there is no other valid explanation for entitling a movie 'ironic' when it obviously isn't aware of how stupid it is. And now don't come to me with ""it's only for the purpose of entertainment"" – besides all of that it's still a dull and dreary movie that is laden with tons of clichés. Drag Me to Hell?

If I had to single out the worst performance, it would have to be Reggie Lee as ethics-free loan officer Stu Rubin. Lee plays his character as an utterly transparent, exceptionally dumb sleezeball. In the real world, Stu wouldn't last a week in his job. But in the movie he's presented as a deadly threat to the career prospects of plucky heroine Christine Brown (Alison Lohman). Yeah, right.

"mvanier","1","2","6","19 November 2009"," Consider yourself dragged
","This movie was really a letdown. I got about halfway through and couldn't continue. (That's a policy I've had ever since I forced myself to sit through all of Synecdoche, New York -- if a movie sucks up to half-time, it hasn't earned the right to be watched all the way through.) Let me start by saying that I'm a HUGE fan of Sam Raimi's work in general and the Evil Dead series in particular, which this was supposed to be some kind of homage to. Bottom line: the title is accurate but ironic, since the person being dragged to hell is in fact the viewer, and the hell is not one of horror but of horrifically bad film-making. There was nothing in this movie that I liked. I couldn't care less about the characters. To say the plot made zero sense is to ignore the existence of negative numbers. Even by the low standards of horror movie plots, this movie is ridiculous. Every scene made me say ""there is no way that that could have happened, even given the existence of the demons in the movie world"". Just for starters: if the old woman is able to control such gigantic, enormous, world-shattering Satanic powers to torture the poor young girl, don't you think she should have been able to use those powers to pay her mortgage? Maybe by robbing a bank or something? The filmmakers must think we're idiots. Also, whatever scares the movie had were of the ""BOO!"" variety, when something unexpected happens (but which you can anticipate is going to happen due to the oh-so-obvious buildup). This is the lowest form of horror, roughly akin to fart jokes for comedians. And as (I suppose) a way of compensating for the lack of real horror, the movie is full of gross-out scenes, like the old woman vomiting up various things into the young girl's mouth or flies crawling into the girl's nose and mouth (in close-up). I watch horror movies to be scared; if I want to be grossed out I can always watch a Judd Apatow comedy. This movie fails on every conceivable level -- just pray that there isn't a Drag Me To Hell, part 2 (Drag Me Back To Hell? Drag Me To Hell One More Time? I Know Why You Dragged Me To Hell Last Summer? You pick the title. Just avoid this movie.)"

I can't say which of the two Alysson Lohman or Justin Long is more bored in this film.

The one major plot twist is more than predictable enough to ruin the end of the film.<br/><br/>But who cares about that, it's a horror flick for god's sake! At least, there's plenty of suspenseful moments and scares right? Of the two dozen or so 'Old-Lady-Jumping-out-at-you scary parts', maybe one of them was a little bit startling. If I'd seen it on a big screen rather than at home, 1 or 2 other moments might have made me lift a pinkie in surprise as well. The only other shock value was the 'Two Girls One Cup'-like episodes of everything from embalming fluid to eyeballs projecting from the old gypsy to the cute blonde's mouth.<br/><br/>The Cute Blonde, portrayed by Alison Lohman (her character doesn't need a name), did a surprisingly 'ok' job of gaining sympathy despite a horrible script.

If you want to see a good Sam Raimi film rent 'Spider Man 3', even '30 Days of Night' was better. You don't necessarily expect a B horror movie to have a great plot or Oscar winning acting.

The jokes and gags don't come as often as they do in AoD, but he puts more into setting them up, so that when they do come, they're even more shockingly hilarious than the ones in AoD. Raimi invests more in character building in this film, leading us to both squirm and howl even more at all the punishment that Christine (the heroine) takes. I like the horror movie genre, but I'm sick of all the predictably bad schlock that the movie studios put out there just to make a quick buck. Thank god Raimi has returned some credibility to horror.

He refrained from presenting an overwhelming amount of blood and gore (come think of it this film didn't even have any blood and gore in it) and that is the beauty of Sam Raimi's direction. Unlike his previous entries such as Evil Dead 1&2 (filled with Zombies and violent and bloody scenes), Drag me to hell relies much on loud bangs and eerie musical scores that can make anyone jump off their seat at any given time. Although I've never heard of Lorna Raver before watching this film, her disturbing and creepy character kept giving me nightmares for a couple of days after watching the film. The plot of the film is also short and to the point There were as many characters as needed to be and all the actors played their roles perfectly.

Of course, the plot is admittedly pretty silly (the stuff with the pesky possessed handkerchief in particular is positively sidesplitting!), but luckily Raimi has an absolutely field day piling on the deliciously disgusting gross-out moments with infectiously giddy aplomb (revolting highlights include a fly going up Christine's nose, Christine suffering a severe nosebleed at work, Ms. Ganush's corpse spilling embalming fluid into Christine's mouth, and a possessed man vomiting up the corpse of a slain kitten). The PG-13 rating is pushed as far as it can go, with a pleasing amount of unapologetic in-your-face ickiness compensating for the lack of hardcore graphic gore. Better still, the cast play their parts with admirable sincerity: Lohman makes for a fetching and appealing lead, Raver is impressive as one extremely creepy and nasty hag who still elicits some pity because she's a victim of ill health and poverty, Justin Long contributes an engaging turn as Christine's loyal and concerned college professor boyfriend Clay Dalton, and Dileep Rao shines as helpful spiritual expert Rham Jas. Christopher Young provides an appropriately roaring and dynamic score while Peter Demming's polished cinematography boasts lots of wild angles and hyper-kinetic camera movements. The special effects are very effective and outlandish. The startling downbeat ending packs one hell of a punch to the gut. Okay, we're not exactly talking all-time classic here, but boy does this entertainingly over-the-top hoot deliver the blithely grody goods all the same."
"misterembryo","10","2","6","7 June 2009"," Drag Me to Hell is an Instant Horror Classic
","In the spirit of the Evil Dead Trilogy, Director Sam Raimi drags you into a world of complete insanity with this soon-to-be horror/comedy classic ""Drag Me to Hell"". The movie is everything I expected it to be: no holds barred, good old fashioned fun. It knows no bounds and goes completely over the top, and just keeps going. It's loud, imaginative, as scary as it is hilarious, and especially enjoyable to go see at the movie theaters. Sam Raimi's blend of humor and horror is unique and exciting, his timing is amazing (which is difficult enough when the two genres are separate), and you really do enjoy every minute of it.<br/><br/>The premise is simple. A loan officer (played by the lovely Alison Lohman) is cursed by a really creepy old gypsy woman after denying her of a third extension on her mortgage payments. She visits a psychic, who tells her a very evil spirit is now after her soul and she only has three days to rid herself of this black curse. Justin Long plays her immensely supportive and incredibly wealthy boyfriend. He is a realist who believes her experiences are merely the product of post-traumatic stress, but is willing to accept the notion of supernatural forces if it helps her.<br/><br/>The movie does not take itself too seriously, like many horrible horror movies tend to do. Instead, the movie plays like one of those walk-through haunted houses you visit during Halloween, or those creepy carnival rides with spooks that make you jump at every corner, for the sole purpose of keeping you fully entertained. ""Drag Me to Hell"" makes it fun to go the movies, and it will definitely endure as a great feature for decades of horror movie nights to come. Ultimately, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is just a classic campfire horror story, and Sam Raimi just so happens to be one of the greatest storytellers of our time."
"khworld","10","2","6","5 June 2009"," Horrifying, disgusting, and one Hell of a thrill ride
","I went into this movie expecting a somewhat intense supernatural horror movie. I had not seen Evil Dead, but after watching the Grudge, I thought I knew what to expect (Not a very good movie if you are wondering, really just a couple of silly scares. If you saw the grudge and had issues, I HIGHLY recommend avoiding this movie) Well, this movie took what I had expected and turned it on its head. From sacrificing a cat, to vomiting worms, spraying blood, and being doused in embalming fluid, many parts of the film were outright disgusting. The scares were also sometimes absolutely ridiculous. I would say the grudge had maybe 4 or 5 jump out scenes, whereas here I stopped counting. Around 15 or so people just left because it was too intense. However, a couple parts actually had me laughing, like when the goat became possessed it was hilarious, along with when Ms. Ganush attempted to gum Allison Lohman to death.<br/><br/>While, at some points, it could be predictable, as are many horror movies, this was a very fresh and unexpected trip to hell. I strongly recommend you avoid watching this if you are at all unsure about it. It is incredibly intense. It is now my favorite horror movies, but it is certainly not for the weak of heart. People go into this movie, thinking they can take it, and end up having to leave because it is too much. It is a good hour 40 minutes of pure adrenaline rush.<br/><br/>Another thing that I really found interesting in this movie was the fact that the reactions it got from the crowd were incredible. Everyone there was either completely into the movie, or outside waiting for it to finish. I do not think I have ever seen a movie that got a noise from the crowd every time something significant happened. It was almost like actors were planted in the crowd to elicit a response to the film.<br/><br/>Overall, I recommend it 100% if you think you have the balls. And if not, good luck with the nightmares :)"
"The_Void","9","2","6","1 June 2009"," Pure horror, just the way it should be!
","Just when I was starting to agree with all the people that regularly complain that no good horror movies are being made these days; along comes Sam Raimi to deliver what is surely one of the best horror films of the decade! Drag Me to Hell is pure horror just the way it should be; very little time is spent on the plot and characters, and a lot of time is spent on the actual horror - the result is a shallow, but expertly made and very exciting film. And best of all the film is clearly aimed at Evil Dead fans, which gives it tons of cult appeal. Parts of the film are gruesome and disgusting, while others are manic and cartoonish; and it all slots together very well indeed. The plot is very simple and we focus on Christine Brown; a loan officer at the bank. Her world is turned upside down one day when an elderly woman turns up wanting an extension on her mortgage. With one eye on a promotion, Christine tells her there's no way she can get an extension; leading the old woman to place a gypsy curse on her...which will end with her being dragged to the fiery pits of hell! <br/><br/>The film doesn't rely on gore to deliver its shocks. It's Sam Raimi's direction that really makes the film exciting. The plot is very well plotted and we're never very far away from another jump scene. Most of the sequences featuring the villain are fast and exciting, which ensures that the film is very entertaining. It has to be said that the plot doesn't make a great deal of sense and there are some very big holes in it; but really I couldn't care less, because when a film is this exciting; it doesn't matter. Aside from the scares, Raimi delivers some laughs too and the pitch black humour is very well placed; a dinner sequence was a particular highlight. Alison Lohman at first seems a little too lightweight for the central role, but she grows into it as the film moves along and proves herself a very good sport by the end. Justin Long is, as usual, entertaining in a co-starring role; while big credit has to go to Lorna Raver, who is brilliantly effective as the villain. The film builds up nicely for the most part; and we boil down to a fantastic séance scene that is pure Evil Dead. Clearly this film isn't going to appeal to everyone; I expect a lot of complaints about the plot, but if you like entertaining horror and/or are a fan of Sam Raimi; you owe it to yourself to check this beauty out!"
"mraussieuk","8","2","6","30 May 2009"," Seriously Entertaining
","I enjoy the horror genre but have for quite a few years now been disillusioned by the horror films i've seen. Most modern horror films i find are predictable and unoriginal. However, Drag me to Hell was a surprising change to the norm. i found it to be engrossing and very atmospheric whilst having a touch of humour reminiscent of Raimi's Evil Dead series that ensures that Drag me to hell doesn't take itself too seriously while still managing to be pretty damn frightening. i can't remember being genuinely scared by any horror film in my adult life but this film s#*t me up on many an occasion.<br/><br/>Entertaining, engrossing , just a touch amusing but bluddy frightening!"
"Zombafyed","8","2","6","29 May 2009"," Yes!!
","This movie was the most fun I've had at the movies in a really long time.<br/><br/>Mr Raimi has definitely redeemed himself from Spider-Man 3 in my eyes. I had a premonition that this movie was going to be good, but it was nowhere near what I expected.<br/><br/>It's not profound on any level, so you better leave those notions at the door. It's crude, revolting, and loud. <br/><br/>As a big fan of Army of Darkness, I was pleasantly surprised and had a blast. This film is not a true horror, but a fun one. It really is a popcorn movie. Take a bf or gf, or better yet, go with a big group. <br/><br/>There's not much else that can be said about this film without spoiling it. <br/><br/>Suggestions to the public: Don't decide whether or not to see this movie based on reviews. Don't read any threads about the film's subject matter. Don't eat anything really heavy prior to seeing it.<br/><br/>Again, don't expect anything profound, or even serious. Plenty of ridiculous and disgusting images and scenes await you! We went to see it early and there were only a handful of other people in the theater, but everyone was screaming and throwing their hands up in disgust and shock!<br/><br/>The best spent $30 in a long time."
"jaw-5791","7","2","6","28 May 2009"," More than just a PG13...!
","I must admit, about mid-point of the feature; you could probably guess who directed/wrote the script if you didn't already know. <br/><br/>Sam Raimi (Writer and Director of Evil Dead sequels) employs pretty similar techniques as the Evil Dead features (wind noise/disasters, clay-mation, demonic possessions etc). Even the typography is almost too identical <br/><br/>At first, I was very sceptical and questioned; 'what the hell is all the fuss about?', but as I chewed on a handful of popcorn, took a long draw of the large Coke in my left hand, I came to a sudden halt! The intro (within seconds) grasped the atmosphere kicking everyone in the audience; straight in the 'teeth', whilst mildly touching on the 'laws' of film taboo<br/><br/>Quite typically, 'Drag Me to Hell' does imply overused/dried-out/ 'not-so-scary-anymore' conventions of Hollywood, i.e. hysterical sexy female, (Alison Lohman), cheesy dialogue, predictable moments of horror etceteraetcetera. BUT don't let that get in the way! Because the film does reimburse you with more 'SHOCK'. <br/><br/>There were moments when the surround sound literally pained my ears Elements of the film were identical to The Exorcist (i.e. humorous yet very disturbing demonic processions), and so whether or not your 'eye lids' shut off the visuals, it WILL NOT alleviate the 'scare factor'(because it is just so darn loud!)<br/><br/>There are moments when you may ask yourselves 'what the hell just happened?', 'how weird was that?', or 'oh dear god, why is this film a PG13!?' – Regardless, don't spend too much on popcorn because you might be put-off eating at least for a while! <br/><br/>Anyhow; I give this film a 7 out of a possible 10. It was scary, humorous, shocking/thrilling, and definitely worth the money. <br/><br/>So if you think you're not scared of demons, or you doubt any of the above, Go watch; Drag Me to Hell – and just find out for yourself!<br/><br/>And Remember Don't 'shame' the Devil ;)"
"aram81","5","1","2","8 June 2020"," Not scary or engrossing but it has its moments
","As a horror film, Drag Me to Hell is a failure. The film has very little tension and is not frightening. It has a couple of jump scares but a film like this needs a lot more to succeed. What was sorely missing was sustained tension and suspense. I was never invested in any of the characters or the story. And while there were isolated moments that worked and I would not go so far as call the movie boring, I will not call it an inspired effort either. What keeps it from being a total failure though, is the comedic aspects, its unpredictability and the ending, which almost made up for all of the mediocrity that came before it. Sam Raimi has had a mixed career and Drag Me to Hell is not one of his best."

"david_rudy_lee","7","1","2","21 July 2019"," Throwback to Old School Raimi
","This is a film that I periodically check out from time to time, as I do have to admit, it is fun. I actually saw it in the theater while in college the first time and then a few times on DVD. I did get the chance to check it out again on 35mm when it was part of the Horror 101 series at my theater. The synopsis for this film is a loan officer who evicts an old woman from her home finds herself the recipient of a supernatural curse. Desperate, she turns to a seer to try and save her soul, while evil forces work to push her to a breaking point.<br/><br/>We start back in 1969. A farm worker (Alexis Cruz) and his wife (Ruth Livier) bring their son (Shiloh Selassie) who has been cursed by a gypsy for stealing a necklace is brought to Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza). She tries to break the curse and do battle with the force that is after him, but to no avail. The boy is taken to hell before her eyes.<br/><br/>We jump to the present where we follow the loan officer from the synopsis. Her name is Christine Brown (Allison Lohman). She is trying to get a promotion to be the assistant manager at her branch. Her boss, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), is trying to decide between her or the new guy, Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee). At the moment, Mr. Jacks isn't sure that Christine can make the tough decision and that's holding her back.<br/><br/>A decision like this is placed before her, when an old gypsy woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), comes for another extension on her mortgage. She already has had two and she is still late on her payments. Chrstine asks if there is anything she can do, Mr. Jacks tells her that the bank can make money on the fees and that it is up to her. She denies the elderly woman and when she begs, Christine shames her in the elderly woman's eyes by calling security. Mr. Jacks reassures Christine that she made the right decision.<br/><br/>Later that day, Mr. Jacks talks to Christine about his loan she is working on. It is the biggest this branch has seen and he wants to show it to the regional manager. He asks her to finish it up that night, which would make her the leading candidate for the promotion. She is excited, but that takes a turn. She notices in the parking garage, Mrs. Ganush's car. Christine gets into her own vehicle and notices the old woman in her backseat. They two of them get into a tussle, which ends with a button being ripped off Christine's coat. A curse is placed on it and it is given back to Christine. Mrs. Ganush says the name, Lamia.<br/><br/>The police are called and then Christine is taken out by her boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long) for dinner. Ending the night, Christine hears something that Clay doesn't. She then notices a fortune teller and decides she wants to try it. Clay is a psychology professor, so he doesn't buy into it. He does allow her to try it out though. The fortune teller is Rham Jas (Dileep Rao). He seems like a con-artist and Clay is even more skeptical. Rham has to cut his reading short as he is spooked by something.<br/><br/>Christine starts to notice some odd things. She sees strange shadows and is attacked by something in the dark that night. She reaches back out to Rham who reveals that he does know more. He tells her that Mrs. Ganush might have cursed her with the darkest of entities. He tells her of a few ways to try to break it, but no matter what she seems to do, the Lamia is still after her. Can she break this curse before it drags her to hell?<br/><br/>During this viewing, my thoughts were it's your typical Sam Raimi horror movie. It is gross, there are a lot of things that make your stomach turn and he pushes the limits with it. What really hit me is with these things, it really is like Evil Dead II with CGI.<br/><br/>I do like this story though, as it isn't too complex. We have someone who did the right thing business-wise and trying to make the tough decision. What she did probably doesn't make her a good person, but I can connect with Christine that you have to follow the rules and guidelines that your job has for you. It sometimes can be sad, but your hands can be tied.<br/><br/>Going from that, I like the idea of a gypsy curse. I don't necessarily think that Mrs. Ganush is directing her anger to the right place, because Christine didn't really do anything. I do know when you're frustrated though, you can be somewhat misguided in your decisions.<br/><br/>The pacing of this story is pretty well done as well. I didn't have any issues there and we really don't waste any time. It is interesting that the film runs about 100 minutes, because it really drags for me. If anything, I do think they could have slowed down to help the build the tension a bit more. I do think that the curse does jump into it a little bit too fast to be honest. Some of the comedy does hurt the tension for me as well, as you know I'm the biggest horror/comedy fan. I do like how it ends, the curve there was good and I like that we didn't get the happy, clinched ending.<br/><br/>Acting for the film is pretty solid as well. I thought that Lohman was quite attractive, but there is a depth there as well. I could actually connect with her in that she doesn't have the highest confidence. She doesn't like to tell people know, even if it is the right thing to do. There are some aspects to her past that are shown subtly early on that really help there. Long I thought was solid in support of her. I also like the comedic aspects he brings to this film as well. I almost wish they would have used more of that than some of the slap-stick things we got. Raver is great as the villainous old woman and I also thought that Rao was solid. Much like Clay, he adds a bit of comedy at times. The rest of the cast rounded out the film for what was needed for me.<br/><br/>Now to what I had my biggest issues with, the effects of the movie. It is crazy that we have director Sam Raimi, who was the low budget master with Evil Dead. There were practical effects in that look much better than a lot of what we get here. I'll admit, not all of the CGI in this film was bad, but a good portion of it was. It really did take me out the film quite a bit. There were some practical effects, which were fine, but this is the biggest disappointment to it for me. It is shot well aside from that, I do have to commend Raimi on his eye for shots.<br/><br/>The last thing to cover would be the soundtrack. I would say that overall, it was pretty solid. There are some creepy things that happen in which only Christine notices it. I really like that aspect. We hear whispering that gets louder each day; there are heavy footsteps from the entity and things to this effect. It was used quite effectively I do have to say in building tension.<br/><br/>Now with that said, I do have my issues with this film, but overall I'd say that it is pretty solid still. I like the idea of this gypsy curse and someone trying to logically deal with it. Having Clay being a psychology professor is an example of that. I do think that for the most part the pacing is good. It does build tension, but I would have liked to see the comedy reigned back a bit. The effects for the most part were CGI and I wasn't a fan. The acting is good though and I'd say that the soundtrack was used effectively. I don't think this is a great film, but it did have potential. I'd still say that it was above average overall."

About fifteen minutes in, we looked at each other and said ""Wow, how wrong were we?!"" Guys and gals, let me tell you something; I do not often praise someone's onscreen performance, but David Payner was at his absolute best here. His performance made us forget we were watching a movie at times. Without including any spoilers, he had one scene that was bloody marvelous to say the least. He has great supporting actors and actresses as well! The main characters do a great job of telling the story of loss, tragedy and hardship. We've all had bad days. While watching this movie, you begin to realise your worst day probably wasnt as bad as Christine's worst day. This is one touch chick! I spent the entire night fact checking this movie after watching it seeing what awards it won in its day because I wanted to make sure it recieved the critical acclaim I knew it deserved! It didnt win any and it's an absolute travesty. To conclude, you're going to want to follow Christine on her journey.

"vcvetano","8","1","2","14 July 2014"," Slapped in a face..With a great movie!
","Hi! If you are another average horror liker, be wary because this isn't movie that plays purely on fear. It's a movie of its own kind. People mostly call this movie predictable or boring because they didn't catch the main point of it which makes it what it is. See, the greatest fear of today's horror maker is being ""cliche"" or ""obvious"", so we keep seeing attempts to create something new that will do as good as old tricks from old horror movies (most of these movies fail horribly at that). This movie simply transforms one scary and well written creepy , ""before a sleep"" story onto a screen. That's it. No ""special epic atmosphere try hard"" fails, no no no, just a story as it is. Now,that's exactly what separates this movie from other today's horrors. This is why this movie is so unique. The whole humor thing about it is that we clearly see how most urban legends or in general scary and supernatural stories of this kind would look like when we try to make them fit into reality. Its all one big joke on modern horrors. The problem is obviously a fact that humor is a subjective thing so as we can see, this movie is liked by some while extremely disliked by others. Watch it with an open mind and remember, the old lady puking on a girls face ISN'T supposed to be dead seriously scary. Same goes for eyes pooping scene. When you realize that, you are hopefully going to have a lot of fun as I did while I was watching it!"
"tiki7690","9","1","2","10 October 2012"," Almost brilliant.
","Let's start with what's good. The movie very strongly portrays Californian culture, Gypsy culture, and Indian culture. All of these things offer a unique and cool atmosphere that isn't similar to many other films, especially horror films.<br/><br/>The movie is funny, and it's also very terrifying. Most of it is serious and ominous, with a creepy presence seeming to stalk from behind the camera. On that note, the directing is excellent, too, with unsettling tilting and intimidating points of view.<br/><br/>Now, some bad things. I love funny horror films, and a lot of the humor in this was great and fitting, but the problems arose, for me, when Sam Raimi forced comedy into scenes that could have been much more sinister. Most of the big scares were intense and legitimate, but the car fight and the séance really could have dropped the humor; it simply made them good, rather than great.<br/><br/>Now, the Lamia's two attacks on Christine in her home, the cemetery scene, and the twist ending were brutally dark and exhilarating. Their suspense and theatricality pushed the entertainment value through the roof.<br/><br/>But here comes another problem. The twist ending was made obvious way before it happened, and that made it just slightly annoying. Viewers don't need to be spoon-fed. But still, it is executed in a way that lets the movie sink its teeth into your heart, that shock is just a little diluted with an eye-roll from the viewer.<br/><br/>The movie also tries to cram in too many gags and scares for its run- time, making the pacing seem a bit rushed and odd. <br/><br/>All these flaws hold Drag Me to Hell back from masterpiece status, but finally I can say that they don't hold it back too far. Not too far at all.<br/><br/>The atmosphere, the acting, and just the bizarre craziness of this film, mixed with its sinister, theatrical scares make it absolutely awesome. It's just a roller-coaster of fun, and it shouldn't be expected to be anything else. If you want a night of thrills, chills, and laughs, go ahead and pop it in."

"KineticSeoul","8","1","2","4 June 2012"," Perfect blend of horror and comedy
","What this movie is, is a perfect blend of horror and comedy. The horror parts really will give you chills and make you be on the edge of your seat. Some scenes can even get creepy to the point you just want it to be over with but enjoy the intensity at the same time. Sam Raimi who is the director did a great job with the ""Evil Dead"" series and he does it again with ""Drag Me to Hell"". I make a reference to ""Evil Dead"" because it has similar elements but different setting and plot. The story is about a girl that gets cursed by a very old gypsy woman and thus the girl gets tormented by the curse and lot of terrible and vulgar things starts to happen to her. And while this is going on she does whatever she can to beat the curse and she is a character you can't help but feel sympathetic for. And beat the old hag in this movie that cursed her. I first saw this movie when it came out in 2009 in theater and even seeing it today it still gave me chills throughout the whole movie. Even the comedic parts although funny made me chuckle in a uneasy manner. The instrument violin can be a pretty creepy instrument and it's used effectively to add to the chill factor. The really scary horror movie uses this tactic as well and the music really does add to the intensity. Although some parts of this movie doesn't make much sense sometimes, overall most of it is executed very well. Movies like this show you don't always need blood and gore to make a effective scary movie.<br/><br/>8.3/10"

","Wow!<br/><br/>I love Sam Raimai. He has created masterpieces. Evil Dead? The king of horror. It was badly misunderstood with it's campy effect, but now is known as one of the best. The Spiderman trilogy? This is probably the best trilogy next to the Dark Knight's. He knows how to direct a film without being serious, and taking a break from all seriousness can be great sometimes and we actually need it. But with Drag Me to Hell, I have big expectations. I read the critic's reviews stating that this IS Raimai's return to what we known and loved, and guess what? It surpassed all expectations.<br/><br/>Sam Raimai has this thing with this film, where he takes this forgettable, clichéd story and turns it inside-out. When I first read the plot summary, I really thought it wouldn't turn out to be what it was all cracked up to be. <br/><br/>Wrong.<br/><br/>He inserts his formula of horror slash comedy and wraps it up in his special entrée. And he did a fantastic job. What I liked best was how Sam got away with his PG-13 rating but still keeps all his formula there. We have the gross-out gags, which were hilarious to watch, while also managing to make us look away in disgust. But that's all we wanted, we got it. The movie was actually a bit scary, just like the original Evil Dead. He knows how to mix horror + comedy in a great fashion, where we don't know which one was present more of. And again, the movie was hilarious! If you're not too sure of black comedies, especially ones that mixture with horror, then this won't be that great to you. But every scene was excellently done, and this was the return of the horror/comedy king! <br/><br/>Now what saddens me is that people gave this bad reviews. It was understandable, but films much worse than this are rated higher, but are so much more clichéd. People didn't understand that the film wasn't meant to be taken seriously, was supposed to be a bit campy, and was expected to actually make you laugh. But the critics are the ones to listen to here, and recommend for all people ready to be disgusted, to laugh, to be horrified, to have fun! Drag Me to Hell was a treat, and one of the most entertaining movies of the best decade. And special kudos for the ending, which was one of the craziest twists ever. Now people saw they saw it coming, but I'm 75% sure they didn't, and they wanted to feel a bit better about themselves. Anyways.. Drag Me to Hell was a treat, and one of the most entertaining movies of the best decade.<br/><br/>9/10."
"generalmaz","10","1","2","27 March 2012"," Fantastic movie.
","Brilliant movie. I have no idea why people are so harsh on this film, and Sam Raimi in general. In my opinion, he is one of the most talented visual storytellers of our generation, even when he's working on less than fantastic films. Pair him with something as immensely enjoyable as this and his (immense) talents show themselves. This movie is the perfect combination of scares and laughs, made all the more effective by a surprising attention to character and human emotion (particularly the fears and insecurities of the central character), though only in a way that compliments the thrills and hysterics. I can't recommend this movie enough."
"myungjahigh","7","1","2","25 March 2012"," original, fun, and scary
","This movie is so rare, unique, it has its own style. I would say that Drag Me to Hell is pretty scary and horrifying enough to watch. There are many stuffs which you can easily find in other scary films, such as curse, screaming, a ghost popping out where you wouldn't expect it to be. The movie seems like it well follows the formulations and laws for its genre. However, it is different and special at the same time. It is very fun and even hilarious. I literally laughed a lot throughout the film, and that's what I liked most about Drag Me to Hell. It constructs the horror things, and it also destroys them repeatedly. I think it's so creative. I've never thought I could laugh while watching horror films before this film. Drag Me to Hell just wins both scary and fun.<br/><br/>new and different style, and you will get unexpected joy from it. this is actually one of my favorite horror films ever!"
"kols","10","1","2","29 October 2011"," Review the movie
","A brilliant example of being damned once you produce a cult classic. I'd suggest removing every review mentioning The Evil Dead so that people don't have to wade through ""this movie isn't the Evil Dead and I really liked the Evil Dead and why didn't Raimi remake the Evil Dead again so I think this movie is a bomb and I really wish he'd remade the Evil Dead"" over and over again.<br/><br/>I was lucky - caught the movie on USA without knowing, or caring, that it was made by Sam Raimi Who Made the Evil Dead. Instead, I got to see the movie as it is, without reference to Evil Dead, and what I saw was a well crafted, old fashioned, scary and thoroughly entertaining Horror Movie. Cast was great, pacing was great, all of the little ""predictable"" bits were great as predictable little Horror Movie bits: when you hear the music, you know something's coming.<br/><br/>It did meet a personal prejudice - I don't like Kill Stupid Teenagers/ Slasher movies; was dragged to Texas Chainsaw by a friend on first run long, long ago and was shocked by its emphasis on gore and total lack of a plot. Got over that and was able to appreciate Chainsaw for what it was but still not the kind of movie I'd pay money to see. Same with the first two Evil Dead; loved the third precisely because it had story and plot which is why I really enjoyed Drag Me to Hell: not only did it have story and plot, it had characters you could recognize as human beings, that you could identify with as human being and who were attractive, i.e., who you cared about.<br/><br/>So Raimi made an old fashioned Horror Movie and did it extremely well. I can see how those inured by two generations of Slasher Movies would be disappointed that a master of that genre didn't make another one but Get Over It, like I did with Chainsaw. If you don't like old fashioned Horror Movies, that's your right just like it's my right to dislike the Slasher genre, but keep it down to This Wasn't a Slasher Movie. Otherwise, review the Movie on The Screen, not the the movie that wasn't.<br/><br/>P.S. Drag Me does have a lot of references to recent (relatively) movies. Main character is straight out of Clueless and Buffy and that oh-so predictable séance scene was full of references to both ancient (30s and 40s) and modern movies, like every vampire movie made in the last 15 years. My only complaint, the compulsory Carrie ending. Even that was well done but I would have preferred Happily ever After and forget Carrie."

","I was a big fan of Director/Writer Sam Rami since Evil Dead Trilogy & Spiderman trilogy I was looking forward to this movie b/c of his involvement in both as a writer & as a director.<br/><br/>The movie was just written very poorly in both storyline & characters - the storyline was shallow and boring - it's like a Stephen king novel that was so boring you need violence & grotesque special effects. The theme is like gypsy woman get mad at the person working at a bank & cursed her it's sigh ... very immature. The movie is prematurely made - from script to production ... if they put in more serious thoughts into it, it could have been a good one.<br/><br/>Comparatively, a movie with less attention was much better than this one - Dead Silence (2007)"

"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","27 December 2010"," Nice old fashioned horror in a mostly good movie.
","Despite the fact that this movie is loaded with special effects, it's still one that is really a throwback to the early days of horror, when it was all about its atmosphere and setting up the right tones, without ever showing too much. In this movie there also is an invisible, faceless villain, so there is no hideous monster or a masked killer but just a bunch of shadows, scary sounds and things that suddenly start to movie, or fly around.<br/><br/>This movie sounds perfect for the lovers of pure horror, also not in the least because it had Sam Raimi, who obviously really understands- and has a love for the genre, in the director's seat. But yet I really wasn't as in love with this movie as most critics and moviegoers were when this movie got released. It's for most part still a good movie but it truly suffers from one main problem; There is too much happening.<br/><br/>You are never given one moment of rest in this movie. This perhaps sound like a good and positive thing but it's just not for an horror movie. There is always something happening in this movie and it's basically the one horror moment after the other. First there is a shadow attacking, the next scene people are being thrown around and the next there are a bunch of scary sounds, coming from the next room. It's good for this movie that all of these things are in it but just not so soon and rapidly after each other. The horror becomes more and more ineffective after a while because of this. Perhaps they threw all of this stuff in because they didn't had a really great script to work with to begin with.<br/><br/>The story really isn't much special and truly not something we all haven't seen or heard before somewhere, in one way or another. It's still being made the best out off, by throwing in a bunch of interesting and fun characters as well as some good humor.<br/><br/>You could say that this movie works better as entertainment than horror really. And perhaps this is also what Sam Raimi was also aiming more towards. It's a movie that appeals to a wide audience, also because it doesn't feature that much blood, or any gruesome and graphic killings, or anything of that sort. <br/><br/>The movie has a good look over it, despite the fact that it didn't had one of the highest budgets to spend. Most of the money obviously went into its special effects. Special effects normally really are out of place and overused in modern horror movies but Sam Raimi uses it in this movie to actually create a more old fashioned type of horror atmosphere, so it isn't as distracting or bad as you would perhaps expect from a modern horror movie. It's all thanks to Sam Raimi's directing approach and love for genre that makes this movie a good and also enjoyable watch.<br/><br/>A good in-between movie to watch, just like this was a good in-between movie to make for Sam Raimi, who went back to his directing-roots with this movie.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

That said, yesterday I saw the 2009 remake of Halloween II (a complete disgrace compared to the original 1981 version) and it's sad how poorly that remake was executed (I would have expected at least a minimal effort from Rob Zombie).<br/><br/>The creative forces behind Drag Me To Hell did a great job of intertwining a new(?) couple's lives with a spell cast on her, with her efforts to defeat the evilly conjured beast, with a meeting of the folks and more.

","Drag Me To Hell is written and directed by none other than the man behind Evil Dead, Sam Raimi but should this movie go to horror heaven or in the depths of Hell? The story is quite an entertaining one and has some good, solid parts however there were a couple of parts in the movie which let it down a little. The characters were written well as you followed the tormented Christine, hoping she'll find a way to avoid her nightmare from Hellliterally. Alison Lohman was brilliant as she gave out a great performance as Christine, Justin Long also did a great job as her boyfriend, Clay. The writing was very well done but there were a couple of plot holes that couldn't be ignored. The direction was great and the CGI was very well done and had made for some great viewing. The scary scenes were also well executed, there were a couple of scenes that made you jump out of your seat.<br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell is one of those movies that you must watch in the dark on your own. The movie itself has an eighties feel to it which I loved and the acting was very good, especially from Lorna Raver who plays the creepy gypsy Mrs. Ganush. I really enjoyed this movie because I liked how it didn't focus on gross-out gore to scare you but instead focused on jumping scenes and I thought that it made a nice change to what we normally see in horror movies today. There were one or two bugs that I had with the movie and I can't really put them in my review because I would be spoiling the movie but it doesn't really ruin the movie for you. Sam and Ivan Raimi have done a great job in making Drag Me To Hell and it really shows how much attention they had put in this movie. If you want to watch a horror movie that scares you the old-fashioned way with hardly any gore, then watch this. Also, Raimi fans will be pleased.<br/><br/>Read more reviews at: www.dudedazzmoviereviews.wordpress.com"

","Many of us have muttered the words ""Go to hell"" in anger, but none of us have done so with 1/1,000 the power and effectiveness of Sylvia Ganush, in Sam Riami's 2009 horror thriller ""Drag Me To Hell."" A slobbering, denture-wearing Hungarian gypsy, Sylvia, when we first meet her, has just been turned down for an extension on her mortgage by a pretty blonde loan officer, Christine Brown, and thus faces eviction from her L.A. home. After a remarkable brawl between the two in an underground garage, Sylvia puts the curse of the Lamia on Christine, and soon, this female goat demon begins to afflict Christine's life with three days of unimaginable torments, preparatory to pulling her soul down to you know where. And once these torments begin, virtually anything can--and DOES--happen, in this wildly entertaining shocker. Raimi, having taken a decade-plus break to do his Spider-Man trilogy and various other projects, here returns to his horror roots in a bravura manner, and fans of his ""Evil Dead"" series will rejoice to witness the return of the gross-out splatter FX that were a hallmark of those films. Wanna see an old crone vomit maggots into a young girl's mouth? A stapler delivered to the face? Geyser nosebleeds, bursting eyeballs? Well, then, here is the film for you! The picture has nary a dull moment, and practically stealing the show is Alison Lohman, giving a sweet, sexy and ingratiating performance as Christine. Lorna Raver, playing Sylvia, is truly frightening, and Justin Long, portraying Christine's incredulous yet faithful boyfriend, is also quite good. The picture seems to tip its hat in homage toward Jacques Tourneur's 1958 masterpiece ""Curse of the Demon"" toward the end, but even this homage doesn't prepare us for the film's shocking conclusion. Indeed, the final shot of Christine's face is one that few viewers will soon forget. No pun intended, but this really is one helluva movie. Welcome back, Sam! We missed you!"

","You can't take this film seriously, you just can't. It is so absurd and funny that it can only be a comedy. Does it feature scary old gypsy women and malevolent spirits and curses and such? Yes. Is that scary? No.<br/><br/>I was caught by surprise a few times by my own laughter and then, fully realizing it is a comedy, I started enjoying the movie. The bad acting was really a masterful director stroke to make the film funnier. The gross and gratuitous scenes of old women juices were there to provide extra laughs. The beautiful blonde ambitious bank employee that can drive, think on her feet in dangerous and surprising situations was there for balance, to bring contrast to other horror movies where people are usually annoying screaming victims begging to be killed. It was all part of the movie and now I can totally understand the true value of it.<br/><br/>On the other hand, since you just read thus far you also know it, so watching the film would be a waste of time."

","Sam Raimi returns from the multi-picture Spider-Man juggernaut to return to self-penned (with brother Ivan) horror/slapstick amalgamation Drag Me to Hell, in a style not seen from the director since 1993's Army of Darkness – the third in the Evil Dead trilogy.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell sees Christine Brown (Lohman), a loans officer of the proverbial mild-mannered variety, longing for a promotion to assistant manager at her branch - a position which co-worker Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee, whose middle name should be awesome) is also gunning for. To impress her boss and to prove that she can make the tough calls, she denies old gypsy woman Mrs. Ganush (Raver) a third extension of her mortgage and thus sealing her fate as the curse of the Lamia is placed on Christine by the scorned Ganush – a curse which will plague and torment Christine for three days until finally dragging her straight to Hell (It's not just a clever title). With her cynical boyfriend by her side (Long), Christine must seek the aid of psychics Rham Jas and Shaun San Dena - the latter which has encountered the Lamia before – to help abolish the evil spirit before it is too late.<br/><br/>With most films released under the banner of his production company Ghost House being underwhelming at best, ('Knock knock.' 'Who's there?' 'Boogeyman.' 'Oh really, Boogeyman? Nah go away now.'), back comes Sam Raimi to invigorate and revitalise a genre which, as a whole, has been stale for a while now. Bringing with him an originality sorely lacking in modern horror, Raimi blasts your senses with tension, scares, action, and comedy – a whole gamut of emotions which take the viewer on a non-stop ride which never fails to entertain.<br/><br/>The one element that sets this apart – and above – horror fare of late is the previously mentioned sense of comedy, a notion lacking in most recent releases. No qualms about it, this movie will scare you, but you will be scared with a smile on your face. Raimi is the master of taking something truly horrifying and adding that wee bit of slapstick and amping up the awesome. Normally a 30cm ruler into the eye would be pretty cringe-worthy normally, yeah? In this case it is cringe-worthy but with a Three Stooges twist. When viewed with an audience you will audibly hear emotions from beginning to end.<br/><br/>Stepping into the lead of a Raimi horror, one would expect to be given a right flogging, and Alison Lohman is no exception as she gets the sh*t beaten out of her. Lohman does a wonderful job of confusion at the beginning of the ordeal, which then leads to fear, desperation and in the third act angry determination – even spitting out a few one-liners to make Bruce Campbell proud. The rest of the cast does okay but Lorna Raver is excellent as Ganush going from disgusting old lady to psychotic old lady in the blink of an eye.<br/><br/>One thing you need to be aware of before seeing this is that it is loud - like really freakin' loud. And there are plenty of jump scares as well, and combine the two and you have one Hell (whammy) of a film-going experience on your hands. A special mention also needs to be made of the excellent soundtrack by Christopher Young, which is about as epic of a horror score as it gets.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is a future cult favourite film from a cult favourite director. If you were not a fan of this style to begin with then this is the flick to convert you. A crazy roller-coaster ride from 'go', you will leave feeling exhilarated after such a tremendous cinematic experience. Near perfect for what it is."

","Holy **** I have just watched this and i'm still pretty vamped up, so please excuse my language.<br/><br/>But this film was so awesome and very, very scary (and i'm someone who doesn't really get that basic emotion anymore...especially with horror films).<br/><br/>So first off, Sam Raimi, i'd like to congratulate you on a job well done. Not only did Drag me to Hell work on all levels, it sent me to the hospital in the process (almost quite literally...bouncing around like billyo I was...I think I lost a nut...god knows what it would have been like to see it at the cinemas.) Right the film, well, the plot wasn't the most original, but it had originality injected into as it went along. The first 30 minutes of the film showed the most of this originality, for example the opening scene where the boy is dragged to hell (not many horrors dare kill a kid character...very frowned upon...tut tut...but they get round this by not introducing the character, another example of this would be Assault of Precinct 13 (the ice cream van scene) and the car scene later on are probably the biggest examples of this.<br/><br/>The constant body excrement and the summoning scene were also a nice touch, it reminded me a lot of The Evil Dead films actually (as was probably the purpose). The film seemed to go at a very fast pace, even though it was over 98 minutes long. This helped to build the story and show the turmoil of the lead character.<br/><br/>All the cast did well and were well placed to their characters (even though i've never really been a fan of Justin Long).<br/><br/>To summarise the movie was great and a true homage to it's horror roots. The big budget probably wasn't needed, but did not affect the film (Can't say that for some of the other horror movies churned out these days can we?).<br/><br/>Well done Sam and I look forward to seeing what you create next."

Then, there are times when the film fails to be as great as you hoped it would be; such is the case with ""Drag Me to Hell"", the return to horror for acclaimed writer/director Sam Raimi. Though not a bad film by any stretch of the imagination, it is also not the masterpiece that many will have you to believe. Rather, it is a pleasantly average slice of cinema that, despite a nearly masterful blend of humor and horror, almost seems insignificant in the grand scheme of cinema and even Raimi's career. Its biggest flaw arrives in its final two minutes, in which the film takes an ironic twist that anyone could have seen coming from a mile away.

But that's not the whole truth, because you will only laugh when the fiendish Miss Ganush is off screen. When she is in sight, beware! You'll admire one of the best designed, weirdest creatures in supernatural cinema today. With her old age, one glass eye, rotten teeth and long, yellow nails (at just one hand, the right one), Eastern European hag Miss Ganush gives you the creeps by simply existing. This is how far our culture ventured in despising old age and demonizing older women in particular, true, but can't it be that every now and then one of them is really a witch? Black magic and witchcraft are, indeed, the source of DRAG ME TO HELL, with a touch of Le Fanuism in the idea that if you are accursed by a demon called Lamia - the vengeful spirit of all women ugly and abused - you'll be properly drawn to Hell to burn in peace.

The movie from start to finish was thrilling and kept me at the edge of my seat. However, it did have me jumping out of my seat and screaming a few times! Christine Brown is a wonderful and well-acted out character played by Allsion Lohman. Allison portrayed Christine as a character that was smart, witty, funny, and courageous. I really got into her character. Justin Long plays Clay, Christine's boyfriend. His acting was very good and he is the ""I can't believe it until I see it"" type of person. Lorna Raver plays the scary Mrs. Ganush. Lorna Raver's character was well-acted and VERY frightening! This movie had so much suspense, great acting, awesome writing, a GREAT plot, and awesome jump scenes! The jump scenes were a little much, but they weren't weak like in ""The Haunting in Connecticut"" these made me jump and scream! If I didn't see this so late in the theaters I would have seen it again, but they took it out the day after. I will so be buying the DVD."
"evilresident097","9","1","2","13 July 2009"," Mr. Raimi is back and better than ever!
","After the ultimate letdown that was Spider-Man 3, Sam Raimi decided to return to his directing roots, the horror genre, in Drag Me to Hell.<br/><br/>It follows Christine(Alison Lohman), a woman who has a pretty good job and an overall great life. She's also gunning for a promotion as assistant manager at her place of employment, a loan office. It's a close race, but her boss Mr. Jacks(David Paymer) will give the promotion to the person who can ""make the tough decisions"". Christine does this by declining elderly gypsy Mrs. Ganush(Lorna Raver) a third mortgage extension. Ganush later attacks Christine and gives the curse of the Larmia, in which Christine will be tormented by dark spirits for 3 days before being dragged to the fiery pits of hell. With help from her boyfriend Clay(Justin Long), fortune teller Rham Jas(Dileep Rao), and medium Shaun San Dena(Flor de Maria Chahua), who once and unsuccessfully tried to break the curse years ago, Christine must hurry if she ever wants to save her life. Otherwise, it's hell she'll go.<br/><br/>First, the positives. I enjoyed the dark humor seen throughout the film. I know most say this is a straightforward horror exercise, but I'd classify it as more of a Evil Dead-esquire horror/comedy. It uses splat-stick as its primary humor producer. There's even a scene involving an anvil that reminds me of Wile E. Coyote. Another great scene involving a séance that goes awry both make me laugh and scream. Speaking of screams, the movie also scared the living daylights out of me. I screamed three times and kept holding my hand over my eyes. It kind of uses that sick humor to lull you in a false sense of security and then WAM!, a creepy version of Ganush surrounded by flames pops up. It just plain works. I also liked the performances. Lohman's performance as Christine helps you feel sorry for the girl, even though she screwed up big time. The score by Christopher Young is great, composed mostly of violins. This music also helps out for the easily scared folk, as it hints when a scare is about to happen.<br/><br/>On the negatives, I felt the film was too short(99 minutes). That's been a problem for the Evil Dead series too, with an average clock in at about an hour and a half. I was kinda left wanting more. But other than that, this is pure gold.<br/><br/>Overall I give it a near perfect 9 out of 10. I'm praying for a trilogy. Or at least a sequel."
"Robert_duder","8","1","2","12 July 2009"," A solid return to Horror for Raimi, twisted, gory with a great story!
","Director Sam Raimi comes back to horror and makes a terrifically creepy and gory horror fest that truly captures the essence of the 70's horror exploitation films. The story is really solid and the performances of the cast make it a really worthwhile horror. The creepy story combines the best of cheap thrills, over the top gore, and eerie supernaturalism to create a terrific scare but also to solidly entertain. I expected the film to perhaps be a little bit campy in the same way as Evil Dead, Raimi's original horror camp masterpiece but in actuality Drag Me To Hell was far more real and grounded and actually a serious piece of horror. The whole concept of the movie is to make you squirm and there is plenty of that from old lady/zombie mucus to a demon possessed sheep which is downright hilarious in a sick and twisted way. Really strong characters and great chemistry make the film even better and above your average horror film and that genre has been lack luster as of late. I felt like the twist at the end was a little bit predictable and at the same time contradicted the strength of the lead character but nonetheless it still holds together.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman returns to the big screen after quite an absence. I always thought Lohman had a big career ahead of her although she hasn't had a break out role really. Still she has always looked very young but had some very mature roles. In this role she really shows off some chops for being a strong willed, really respectable female. She is a great lead!! Justin Long plays her devoted boyfriend. He kind of takes a back seat to her despite kind of being the bigger star but he does well in either spot and they have great chemistry together. They are very believable and he does great in a serious role. It took me back to his terrific break out role in Jeepers Creepers. Lorna Raver is downright disturbed and twisted as evil Gypsy Sylvia Ganush. Her and Lohman play off each other terrifically in their first scenes together. She makes a great horror bad gal. Dileep Rao plays a small but important and well played role as a small shop psychic who agrees to help Lohman's character. I think I would have really liked to have seen him have a bigger role more like a ""Dr. Loomis"" (Halloween reference) type character. If the film is serialized he should definitely return.<br/><br/>This is one of those instances where the cast just really works so well together and the story and all the other pieces that make a solid movie. Of course Drag Me To Hell isn't going to win any accolades with critics or likely win any awards at all and yet it is completely entertaining and worth seeing for anyone who is a fan of the genre or wants to be thrilled and scared all at once. It's the perfect camp fire story with a Stephen King twist to it. Everyone loves a good twisted Gypsy story. Definitely check this one out because you will love it for it's genre inducing fun! 8/10"
"doctorsmoothlove","6","1","2","25 June 2009"," Doomed to Purgatory
","So Sam Raimi has finally directed another horror movie. For really young people like me, this would be our first opportunity to see one of his genre films in theaters during its first run. Fangoria, Rue Morgue, and other horror magazines dedicated a large portion of their May 2009 issues to this movie's coverage. When the MPAA rating came out, people were in shock. Only PG-13? You can't defeat undead or spew bloody slapstick with teeneybobbers in attendance.<br/><br/>General fears of PG-13 lameness are unwarranted. Drag me to Hell isn't like other ""tame"" horror movies of recent years. Yes, the scares are scant and sudden, but the film feels fully crafted without self-censorship. Even The Uninvited, another PG-13 horror movie I enjoyed, felt muted. Gore would have enhanced its story. This film takes an ""Asian horror movie"" approach and presents little on screen viscera. Only one bloody scene occurs and it's comical in nature. Unlike many of those films, Raimi's new cult classic isn't serious or scary. He inserts vignettes of humor, either in dialog or action, to parody current trends in the sub-genre this film emulates.<br/><br/>The movie poster spoils the film for you as much as the next paragraph will. Christine Brown is a loan officer for some bank in LA. She refuses an elderly gypsy woman's request for an extension one day and encounters the lady at night. In a hilariously kitsch battle, Christine escapes from the lady who warns of her impending doom. Later that night, Christine asks her boyfriend to accompany her to a fortune teller to see what the old lady meant. The business-oriented owner, Rham Jas, says that a curse has been placed upon her. The demon lamia will take her to hell in one week. Rham Jas agrees to help for a fee. Several bizarre methods are proposed to end the curse. One of them is effective, yet there is a twist ending.<br/><br/>One of the most amusing scenes is when Christine kills her kitten to appease the lamia. She tells us that she is an animal shelter volunteer too. Note: this scene would not have occurred if her pet was canine. Animal activists' diligence and occasional cruelty to humanity (see Christine and the gypsy lady) needs to be comically presented more frequently in movies. The lamia rejects her offering (maybe it wanted a puppy).<br/><br/>Drag me to Hell has amounted an astonishing 93% on Rottentomatoes. I've read several reviews, and after seeing the movie myself, I agree with many of them. The film is barely recommended by many critics. The humor is one-dimensional and repetitive. As the film nears its ending time, more situational jokes are added. When Raimi does try to frighten us, he usually makes the lamia or the old gypsy woman appear out of nowhere for that one reason and disappear.<br/><br/>Should you see it? Yes, even people who don't enjoy horror movies will like some aspects of it. The film does what Army of Darkness did for us back in 1994. Neither that film nor this one is capable of lasting more than a few months on our minds. They aren't good horror movies or extremely funny comedies. Instead both movies are candybar experiences that are enjoyable when consumed but not part of a great movie diet."
"ste_shmoobert","9","1","2","24 June 2009"," Sam Raimi has a special talent for horror.
","The horror genre is slowly losing respect amongst people who take films seriously, I can confidently say it is because of the absolute nonsense they try to pass-off as cinema these days, with its cheap scares, smutty sex scenes and mind-numbing plots. But Sam Raimi might be the saving grace of this sinking ship as he has brought it back to basics. This film is perfectly crafted with a plot a child could understand but still entertain the most refined of movie goers. I enjoyed every character of this film, as they were all portrayed with skill. The scares are credited not to a loud slamming door or a sudden din of orchestral shrieks but to brilliant special effects and a mystery to the evil which lurks through this film. As someone who would not normally rate horror movies, I enjoyed this film and it left me with the appropriate unsettled feeling which this genre was born to do."

Even though it is rated PG13, that should not stop people from going to see this fun, scary, jump out of your seat movie. The acting is very good with kudos to Lorna Raver as Mrs. Ganush.

","""Drag Me"" is an excellent movie that reminded me of the old quote, I believe from Thalberg, that a movie should contain three great scenes and no bad scenes.<br/><br/>Both the scenes with the cats -- the ""hear, kitty-kitty"" and the parents' dinner party -- were great, the set-ups with the rival at the office -- the sandwich bit and the Lakers tickets -- were great, and the graveyard scene was truly great. Christine was under water so long that I began groping around mentally for a new protagonist, a la the near-drowning scene in ""Star Wars."" <br/><br/>The only problem I had was the plot twist involving the coin and button in Act III. I was confident to a degree of absolute certainty that Christine was not giving Mrs. Ganush her button. Did that ruin the movie for me? Not really, because the question becomes what will Clay do with the button. When Christine was sinking in the cemetery, I flashed forward to imagine Clay at the train station, dropping the button and somebody truly evil picking it up -- a movie critic for the L.A. Times, perhaps.<br/><br/>What was interesting was the way Mr. Raimi avoided resorting to a Higher Power to resolve the conflict at the séance scene, as often happens in a supernatural thriller. Of course that sealed Christine's fate -- a la ""Carrie."" Still, ""Drag Me"" is an outstanding achievement at all levels -- I recommend it and look forward to repeated viewings."

Then the movie just go on, letting the girl get scared, over and over again by the same ugly gypsy woman. And sometimes by a goat-man-demon, who only comes as a shadow.

"Elain-ee","4","2","7","1 June 2009"," Blah!
","I know that some Raimi fanatics are going to watch this film no matter what, but I can't see anything outstanding about it. While the dialogue is okay, the movie lacks any other hallmarks of great film work - the characters are unimaginative and the storyline seems like it's just an excuse to show a pretty blonde screaming and running from un-scary demons. I spent the whole film waiting for anything really funny to happen but was disappointed, and all the gratuitous screaming grated on my nerves. I found it took away from scenes that would probably have seemed more camp if they had been acted in a deadpan fashion. Oh, and the 'surprise' ending was so unsurprising, a toddler could have seen it coming. If you're undecided about this film while watching it, then I suggest you turn it off about 15 minutes before the end as you'll probably end up feeling insulted. <br/><br/>If you want to look on the bright side then yes, this is probably one of the better horror movies to come out in the past few years. However, that speaks more to the awful quality of modern horror movies than it does to the high quality of Drag Me To Hell. Personally, I've found foreign horror/comedy films like Snow Dead to be much more engaging and well-rounded than Drag me to Hell, which is interesting because Snow Dead is obviously a low-budget effort. I think that the difference is that Snow Dead's directors did not skimp on details, whereas Sam Raimi has. He appears to think that the 'satire' genre is an excuse for lazy storytelling. Well, there are other, more imaginative horror directors out there who have proved him wrong and will do so again. Too bad none of them are based in the United States!"

"Quinoa1984","8","2","8","31 May 2009"," ""Return""? Who's to say Raimi ever really ""left""?
","To get it out of the way, most people writing or talking about Drag Me to Hell are saying that ""Raimi's returned"" or ""he's come back finally!"" There is an underlying current here to say that he ""lost"" it somehow, in terms of being a talented director. Maybe it's jet-lag from being on a binge of several years of Spider-Man (and the, politely saying it, mixed reaction to Spider-Man 3) that maybe one wondered if he would return to his horror ""roots"" as he hadn't made one since The Gift and not one that really stuck out in the 15 years since Army of Darkness. But he's always had the goods, even through the Spider-Man movies (and yes, even through most of part 3 I would argue), and what Drag Me to Hell represents not so much a return but a revival, akin perhaps to the Coen brothers, Raimi's old buddies, going back to basics with No Country for Old Men. Suffice to say, this is more than comfortable territory for Raimi: Drag Me to Hell is a reminder of what he's good at, which is not simply horror, but scaring the s*** out of you while making you laugh your head off.<br/><br/>This wont be for all horror fans, perhaps, such as those who scamper off to the ""safe"" fare like Haunting in Connecticut or the super trash like My Bloody Valentine 3D. This is PG-13, but in a way that doesn't mean Raimi or his brother co-writer Ivan are playing it any safer than Evil Dead 2. Their story of Christine Brown (gorgeous and talented Alison Lohman) turning down an old gypsy for an extension on her mortgage and thus being branded with a three-day-ticket-till-hell curse, is the stuff of pulpy EC comic books, with a touch of satire (did anyone else think of the current mortgage crisis when watching this) in the stew of over-the-top gags in true horror set-ups. Sure, there may be a few ""JUMP"" scares, and sure a couple of story turns may not be logical (I had a problem with Justin Long, playing the psychology professor boyfriend of Christine's, doing something at about 2/3 of the way through the movie that didn't make much sense in terms of know-how), but it there's rarely a scene without some wallop of entertainment.<br/><br/>And like the Evil Dead films, when they were at their best, Drag Me to Hell confronts its protagonist with an onslaught of ""holy-crap-what-was-that"" things, such as an incredible (and I do mean incredible) nosebleed, the old gypsy popping up in a shed where an anvil is hanging conveniently overhead, the goat used for a sacrifice that suddenly turns possessed during a ritual, or just certain things like the recurring fly or (gulp) the bleeding eyeball in the middle of a piece of ""Harvest cake"" which Christine has prepared. And like a former bewildered but strong hero like Ash, Christine toughens up soon and fast enough to do some unthinkable but hilariously tasteless things (i.e. poor kitty - and the kitty's return, ho-ho). And, not the least, after her roller-coaster of a horror-comic endeavor has supposed to come to a close, nothing is really, truly over.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is a rollicking good horror movie, and for the certain moviegoer with as many laughs as another not-quite-comedy movie playing right now, Pixar's Up. For fans of the people involved, or just looking for a few jolt-out-of-your-seat scares and bat-s*** crazy sequences, this is your current if imperfect fix you're jonesing for."
"drownnnsoda","9","2","8","29 May 2009"," Raimi's Retro-Horror Ride Straight to Hell.
","""Drag Me to Hell"" focuses on a young loan officer, Christine (Alison Lohman), who is yearning for a new promotion as assistant manager in her office. One morning, an elderly gypsy woman named Sylvia Ganush arrives at the office and asks Christine for a third extension on her mortgage payment. Christine, in an attempt to impress her boss and increase her chance of promotion, turns the begging old woman down - bad mistake. That evening, the woman attacks Christine in her parking garage, and places a curse on her. After contacting a psychic, Christine discovers she has been placed under a dark-spirited curse that materializes in various forms, and after three days, will take her soul to hell. To the dismay of her psychology professor boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), she goes to extremes to rid herself of the curse before time runs out.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi, more often nowadays known for his ""Spider Man"" films, debuted back in the 1980s with his low-budget cult favorite ""The Evil Dead"" - a modest but gory zombie film that has gained a large following in the horror genre. Now, some twenty years later, he returns with ""Drag Me to Hell"", and I can say that he won't be disappointing most of his fans. ""Drag Me to Hell"" has all the makings of a classic 1970s supernatural horror movie - gypsies, curses, séances, and a handful of gooey and gross splatter scenes. While at times it is a bit over- the-top, the film manages to find a solid stance between flat out horror and outlandish ""ew"" moments which border on dark humor (take for instance the iron anvil scene in the tool shed). But this is Raimi's own style, which was established from his first ""Evil Dead"" film - chances are you will either like it or you won't.<br/><br/>Visually, the audience has a lot to chew on here. The Los Angeles sets and gypsy-esquire buildings are atmospheric, and Christine's demonic encounters pop up all over the place, many of them in broad daylight, which was a nice switch-up from the typical nighttime terror scenes. I also liked the throwback feel it had, which was evident from the vintage Universal logo displayed at the beginning of the film. While it may be a high-budget Hollywood horror show set in present day, Raimi retained a sort of retro-feel to the entire thing, which was a nice nod for fans of not just his films, but for the old school horror lovers out there as well.<br/><br/>As for the witch herself, Mrs. Ganush - wow - the filmmakers did quite the job with her. After the audience is first introduced to her, we can't help but be uncomfortable. And that discomfort turns to hiding our faces behind our hands as she terrorizes Christine during the remainder of the film. The first attack scene in the parking garage was my personal favorite; it was spooky, intense, and startling to boot. All of the scares were well-executed, and some of them were so drenched in outrageousness and body fluids that the audience can't help but scream and laugh at the same time. The film is able to take itself seriously while simultaneously not take itself seriously - which may sound like a bit of a paradox, but the formula works nonetheless.<br/><br/>Our performers are up-to-par as well, with the lovely Alison Lohman leading the cast as our cursed protagonist. She plays the role gracefully, but is also very stern when necessary. The quirky Justin Long plays her boyfriend, who is a product of a wealthy, ""old money, Yale""-type family, who we are introduced to in a grotesque and oddly funny dinner scene with the characters of Christine and Clay. And we can't forget Lorna Raver, who plays the haggish gypsy who is the centerpiece to it all - she's mean, scary, and relentless. As far as the conclusion goes, it works in terms of the film's style. It will have some audience members gasping with their hands over their mouths, and some cheering in honor of the film's old-fashioned kick, Sam Raimi style.<br/><br/>Overall, ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a jolting, spooky horror show peppered with humor and over-the-top thrills and spills. These things alone justify the film's throwback status, giving it the feel of a 1970s-1980s grindhouse horror flick with a glossy coat of modernism. If you enjoy anything along the lines of Raimi's ""Evil Dead"" to Lucio Fulci's ""The Beyond"", chances are you will enjoy this movie. I believe that some audience members may not mingle well with Raimi's tongue-in-cheek horror style, but if you're willing to sit down and enjoy it for pure entertainment's sake, this is a very well-made carnival ride straight to hell. 9/10."
"zsannak","1","2","9","14 June 2009"," Warning!
","I've seen some horrible horror movies before. But today this movie started a new category for me: ""how to waste one and a half hour from your life in the most terrible way"" would be the name for the mentioned category. Because this was the question I've asked myself all the way home from the cinema. And if you'll go and watch that ""something"" (I can't even say the word ""movie"" for it), I suppose this will be your opinion, too. Because we - normal people - think that for a movie you need a story, some actors, who can play (at least a little)and good photography and maybe some directing skills would be useful, too. You can not find any of these things on that( fine, let's call it that way) movie. Actually, I think that the most impressive act came from that little cat, who was sacrificed and later puked by a demon. I think this tells a lot about the play and about the story's complexity. There were no tricks, no scary parts, not even a funny one. Also everyone was laughing at the cinema... And another thing: I'm so bored with the fact that, - based on movies - everyone in this World, who is evil is Chinese, Japanese, or a Gypsy. And of course since Twilight we also know, that being a vampire is not evil, but cool and also sexy. It would be time to crash these stereotypes. But this is another topic...The important thing is, whatever it takes, do not watch this movie."

","Drag Me to Hell (2009) <br/><br/>*** (out of 4) <br/><br/>A loan officer (Alison Lohman) is wanting a promotion so her boss advises her to play it tough in her decisions on the job. In walks a gypsy (Lorna Raver) needing an extension on her house but the officer turns her down, which gets a curse put on her. Soon the officer finds her life turning upside down as she slowly becomes possessed by a demon. The horror community went nuts when they learned that Raimi was coming back to the genre but I had mixed feelings walking into the film because of the PG-13 rating. As I walked out I still had mixed feelings on the film because some of it was downright brilliant while some of it needed some work. One thing I will say is that the movie has a very similar plot to THINNER and in some ways the two films follow the same path including a couple twists in the story. What does work in the film are the performances by Lohman and Raver. Both women are very strong in their roles and they make us care about them. You can't help but feel bad for the gypsy woman when she's begging for her home but then you can't help but hate her with the evil she turns on. Lohman makes for a good victim and you can't help but feeling for her. The visual look of the film was quite impressive and you can tell you're watching a Raimi film. The director does a great job at building some suspense and that includes an early scene in the garage, which is perhaps one of the better moments in a horror film from recent memory. The early possession scenes are also extremely well done. What I had mixed emotions on are some over the top CGI effects with one coming in the form of two eyes, which you'll know when you see. Another issue is at times there seems to be too much comic approach. The film certainly doesn't go for laughs but it does like to play a childish gross out factor including slime, worms and various other things being thrown up. It looks fake and it takes away from the suspense that was otherwise trying to be built up. There are about three different endings in the film and I didn't get for the middle one. I'm not going to spoil anything but you'll know what I mean after watching the film. The twist at the end is something I saw coming but it's good to see Raimi stick to it and not try to cheapen it. All in all I was happy to see the movie but a second and perhaps third viewing will be needed. There's some slapstick thrown in via EVIL DEAD 2 style but then there are some dark and evil moments like something from THE EVIL DEAD. I don't think the film is a complete masterpiece but it's still very impressive and I'm sure Mr. Raimi will find himself starting up a new book for future genre films to follow."

","The first time I saw this I didn't get it, it seems this movie is like a bad joke that you need to do a research on the internet for someone to explain it to you.<br/><br/>I understand that this is supposed to be comedy horror but it seems this movie has a hard time deciding between horror and comedy and its not particularly scary or funny.<br/><br/>Lets get that straight this movie is absolutely not scary its full of cheesy jump scares and is just general horror cheesfest<br/><br/>thats 1 thing and I think that the main reason why this movie is bad because as a horror its a complete trash while at the same giving impression that its mainly intended to be a serious horror movie.<br/><br/>It just takes itself too serious at times and when it shows these ""comedy"" parts it leaves people wondering are they watching poorly written horror movie or comedy or something else and since those comedy parts are so poorly implemented, most of the time only barely good and relatively rare while still funny seems like out of place and part of this movie that looks like it tries to be serious but just fails, not something separate that is intended to be for laughs, sort of becomes like on of these ""so bad its good"" type of movies, like the wicker man 2006.<br/><br/>I would give 9 out of 10 chances that the wicker man '06 was intended to be serious but turned out to be a bad movie with drag me to hell I would give 8 out 10. There's a difference I give you that but still it just looks like its a bad movie not some intentional comedy-horror. You can like it but don't pretend its a good movie.<br/><br/>I even have a hard time imagining how such thing as a comedy-horror even possible it sounds like a toxic mix of a movie where either scary parts outshines the funny parts, the quality of a movie then depends how much horror there is compared to comedy and good it is or funny parts outshines scary parts destroying the main purpose of horror movie to scare someone, something like this happened with drag me to hell.<br/><br/>I would put this movie somewhere between The Amytiville Horror '05(simple, ineffective trash) and movies like birdemic or the wicker man '06.

","Sam Raimi is one of those directors that will forever be known for one thing. And that one thing just happens to be the first thing that he ever made. 'The Evil Dead' movies. So when you hear that he is back with another horror movie after so long, it's hard not to get excited about it. Unfortunately, I heard about it seven years late. Yes, this film has been out since 2009 and only now am I seeing it. Better late than never right? But I am exceedingly glad that I saw this film. Why? Because this is the best horror, comedy, parody movie that I have seen in quite a while. It has the campy visuals you'd expect from Raimi but never has he had more of a grasp on the genre.<br/><br/>That's because he knows the genre so well. Watching this movie with friends ascents exactly why. Through the whole film, all you're trying to do is call the next thing that is going to happen. When the next jump scare will be or what the plot twist is. And you may be able to call certain things, of course, but the film is constantly trying to make you think you know what is going to happen next.<br/><br/>It knows exactly when there ""should"" be a jumpscare and instead positions the scare right where you'd expect but it doesn't jump you. It may slowly lean forward into the light and then attacks. Which creates real tension. When you get jump scared what happens? You jump out of your seat and then laugh at yourself, right? When that happens all sense of tension is immediately gone. <br/><br/>While this movie certainly jumps you it actually does it with the monster. And when that happens you get startled but now you're even more scared of what could happen. This film does a great job of using real jump scares and not those silly false scares. Plus, the jumps actually occur in the films universe. It isn't trying to scare you, it's trying to scare the characters. And that plays so much better for a horror film.<br/><br/>But outside of being effectively frightening, what does it do? It's funny. Even though it's an effective horror it's also an effective gross-out comedy. Where a ladies head might head get hit and her eyeballs fly into a characters face. This is what Raimi does so well. He is a master of balancing tones. He effortlessly switches between humor and horror within seconds and it never feels out of place. ​ Which can be a nearly impossible task. But he knows what he's doing with this genre. He knows exactly how the camera should move, exactly what lighting to use, and how this story should play out. Which proceeds in a breathtakingly simple way. Within twenty minutes we have our characters motive established, the villain's role built, and the scares are already coming. <br/><br/>Raimi knows that less is more for horror films. And with a few lines and even fewer scenes, we know and care about what is happening. We know why choices are made, why things are happening, and it flows beautifully. Every scene, regardless of how it feels in the moment, pushes the story forward. It never stops and has a scary scene and then moves on. It has those in the moment.<br/><br/>It shows you that this girl is under constant turmoil everywhere she goes. At work, in her car, in her house, everywhere. There is hardly a moment when she isn't, and that helps sell why she is so incredibly nervous everywhere she goes. She is consistently looking over her shoulder, praying nothing happens to her. And that really helps you relate to her struggle. It's easy to get on board with her.<br/><br/>And when she starts to crumble under the pressure you want her to raise above it. But, unfortunately for us, the movie knows this too. And just when you think you know where the film is going, it pulls the rug out from under you and rolls the credits. For most this will be very frustrating. Because it refuses to play out the way it ""should"". It pretends that it will for a little bit but refuses to do what you'd expect.<br/><br/>It's really one of the greatest horror movies out there. Everything in front of and behind the camera comes together to make a nearly flawless film. It's tense, hilarious, beautiful to look at, intelligent, and most of all, a blast to watch. Nearly every element of the film, down to the soundtrack, just works. And yes, it can be hard on your first watch because of how different it is, but trust me when I say that it just keeps getting better the more you watch it."

BUT IN THREE DAYS, SHE'S GOING TO HELL. Hello Kiddies your pal the crypt-critic here and well he's going to try and keep this brief. This is one of the scariest films I have ever experienced. It's like sinister scary but to be quite honest I think this is scarier just because of the ending. I saw this film because I'm a big fan of Sam Raimi,he's given two of my favorite trilogies of all time. The film revolves around a woman named Christine Brown who has a lovely boyfriend,good job and has a bright future ahead of her,until one day after not giving an elderly woman the extension she needed to stay in her home she curses her and in three days Christine will go to hell. The plot while probably not realistic makes for a scary time. It's one of the most screwed up movies I've seen since paranormal activity 3 and sinister. I believe the theme of this film would be to enjoy life for as long as you have it. The acting is very good, I love the woman who played Christine and hope to see more of her in the future. The rest of the supporting cast is great in their roles. Sam Raimi knows how to direct actors who aren't too well known. All of the elements of a scary movie are present from beginning to end. I hear there might be a sequel,I think I heard that a long time ago,If so I'll see it because I highly recommend this scary flick. I give Drag me to HELL a four out of five stars."

","I am not the kind of guy that throws around *1's too easily, really. This is probably the only title I ever rated this low, although there are probably worse movies out there (some of which I've already seen but appreciated the irony or at least the will to create something worth watching)<br/><br/>This movie however was borderline the most boring excuse of a movie I have ever watched. Period.<br/><br/>But I try not to be too biased reviewing this movie. Let's think about it objectively.<br/><br/>Story: An old gypsy woman asks a loan officer for a 3rd extension on her house and the soulless bitch refused, so naturally the old hag curses the Blondie - a demon will haunt her until he finally ""drags her to hell"". Her boyfriend does the horror-cliché ""ghost don't exist"" routine but follows her to a guy with a fake foreign accent spiritual-whatever who fake looks at his watch, like ""oh, look at the time!"" and when he turns to leave he subtly tells her, like ""oh, by the way, you are f***ed"". Then nothing happened, a little haunting, a little spitting blood, a little haunting, at a dinner she looses her mind over it, little haunting until she arrives at the final showdown with the spiritual-whatever and another spiritual-whatever-women with her son or I don't know. As you can guess, at the first quarter of the movie I wasn't too interested into the movie anymore. It was probably after the scene where the old gypsy women spewed CGI-spit on the ""protagonist"" at her own funeral. In the end she has to dig up the grave of the gypsy women and fight against the powerful corpse in the hole to find out her boyfriend found the button. Oh yes, the button which the gypsy women took from the Blondie and cursed it. Well, all said and done the women falls on the rail-tracks in a station and gets ""dragged to hell"".<br/><br/>The effects: Bad bad bad CGI. It wasn't bad enough to be entertaining again, it was more like ""Anaconda""-style-CGI, back when they actually tried to make it look cool. It was ridiculous.<br/><br/>The characters and the acting: No likable characters, the protagonist keeps insisting she wasn't a bad person and kept blaming it on her manager when he said it was her decision to give the gypsy women an extension or not. The boyfriend is a bad sitcom-actor who really felt out of place. The spiritual-guy has never done a first-aid-curse in his life, which I thought was weird.<br/><br/>The conclusion: I get the irony, or at least I hope they tried to make it a comedy. Then I would at least honor the try. But I didn't laugh and I wasn't scared and the movie did NOT ""drag me into it"" like a movie is supposed to do. In fact I started writing on my phone and calling people what they are up to so I can do something to get my mind off of this garbage. Sometimes it seems it is harder to make a bad movie than a good one."

On top of that you've got a cursed, scary, smothering handkerchief, repeated vomiting, leading lady killing baby kitten, evil monster later vomiting the dead kitten (!) and the root of all evil is an old mad gypsy woman with very bad teeth.. which are fake.

","So, what would I say was this dismal horror film's most glaring and damaging moron-factor? <br/><br/>Well, it would have to be this - If the old, gypsy-hag, Mrs. Ganush, really had such fantastic, supernatural powers as she so clearly did (even in death), then, why the hell was she groveling like an absolute peasant to some nobody bank employee, pathetically begging for an extension on the loan for her home? Eh? Why? <br/><br/>I mean, c'mon, folks. Let's get serious and do a reality check here.<br/><br/>With the truly amazing powers that Sylvia Ganush demonstrated in her ruthless revenge-curse on pretty, little Christine Brown (for being such a meanie and shaming her), this woman could've easily used these abilities to conjure up enough money to cover all of her needs.<br/><br/>But, no, instead of doing things the easiest & most sensible way, Ganush stalked, harassed, and physically assaulted Brown in the most preposterous and, of course, the most horrific ways imaginable. Ways that defy rational, common-sense thinking.<br/><br/>In my opinion, this utterly demented, rubbishy, over-the-top horror film reached the absolute nadir of its stupidity in the scene where Christine takes her cute, little kitten and (that's right) uses this darling creature as a sacrifice in a feeble attempt to save her own skin. (And after the poor, little kitty-cat was finally knifed to death, this selfish approach of salvation of Christine's didn't prove to do any damn good, anyways) <br/><br/>This asinine movie certainly proved to me that as a writer/director, Sam Raimi hasn't improved one bit in his field since his film-debut with 1983's The Evil Dead. This jerk still can't develop interesting characters, or sustain horror (without globs of gore), nor can he put together an intriguing story-line that flows smoothly and coherently.<br/><br/>Raimi is nothing but a hack-director who really deserves to have his ass kicked, but good, for sadistically foisting this hunk of junk on us and expecting that we will all just love it to pieces and eagerly lap it right up.<br/><br/>It really killed me in the scene where Christine's mouth was bashed (and bleeding) up against a hard kitchen counter, and, yet, she still remained all kissing-fresh for her squeeze, Clay.<br/><br/>And, finally - Was this utter crap movie really supposed to be Raimi's dire warning, telling us all (especially bank loan officers) that we are never to refuse ugly, old, snaggle-toothed gypsy women extensions on their loans!? (And, if that's not it, then what else could this nonsense film's underlying message be?)"

"piratecannon","9","1","3","26 December 2012"," One of Raimi's Finest
","After taking a break from horror for 17 years, Sam Raimi finally decided to return to the genre that made him a household name for fans of cult horror classics. The latest from the director of the Evil Dead trilogy is a riot. It demonstrates masterly control of the too-often misused ""jump"" scare, and it's funny—really funny. Raimi's peculiar brand of camp likely won't appeal to everyone, but if you're looking for a fun horror movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, this is one tongue- in-cheek romp that shouldn't be missed.<br/><br/>Our protagonist is Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer at a Los Angeles bank who's trying to get promoted. After being encouraged to prove to her boss that she's able to make the tough decisions required of the assistant manager job she so badly desires, she decides not to grant a mortgage extension to an elderly woman who visits her office. This isn't just any old lady, though—she's a gypsy with knowledge of black magic. After being rejected and being ""shamed"" (as she puts it), she places a curse on Christine. After 3 days of continuous torment, a dark spirit will literally—as the title indicates— drag her to hell.<br/><br/>As ridiculous as the plot sounds, it's actually quite intense during certain scenes. Raimi, as previously mentioned, has mastered the art of the ""jump"" scare with this latest entry. Even though it's clear the over-the-top tone pervades every scene, you'll likely still find yourself anticipating the inevitable scare (only to have it appear when you least expect it). There are a plethora of ""gross-out"" scenes in this one, too, which includes green fluid pouring out of the mouth of an overturned corpse and onto Christine; nosebleeds that spray across rooms and soak coworkers; and, as with any movie dealing with the dark arts, ritual sacrifice that causes us to simultaneously cringe and chuckle.<br/><br/>Really, there's nothing particularly new about Drag Me to Hell—it's just that what's there is so well done that it feels like you're witnessing a hybrid classic/contemporary horror movie. In many ways it's a spoof, but it's also an effective little splatter flick—it knows exactly how to send up genre clichés while still demonstrating respect for their power. Among other things, this makes Drag Me to Hell the perfect date movie: it's not too serious, and everyone involved will have a killer (no pun intended) time.<br/><br/>There you have it. Raimi's back and has proved that after all this time he hasn't sold out to Hollywood convention. So what are you waiting for? Pop a bag of Orville Redenbacher's and prepare yourself for one of the most entertaining horror movies to come along in quite some time."

","It was a long time since I reviewed anything, cuz I am too lazy, but I just finished Drag me to Hell minutes ago, and I simple want to write about it. I never ever had such mixed feelings about a movie. It was a terrible horror. First of all, this gypsy curse thing is really outdated and lame. I happen to live in a country, where there are a LOT of gypsys (around 20% of the population) and they don't run around cursing people... And didn't Stephen King already do this? A whole lot better I might add.... This was rather disgusting (all the scenes with the old gypsy woman, especially after she died) or downright funny. And the demon, Lamia...right...more like LAMEia, the oh so evil spirit, who DANCES around in a fire, vomits a cat, laughs in a more over the top manner than a minor James Bond villain, speaks through a goat, acts like a high-school bully and not like a friggin demon. The scene with the obviously fake, CGI talking goat, and the possessed flying henchmen of the medium takes the cake.... i almost p1ss3d my pants laughing. On the other hand it was undeniably funny. As a comedy, this movie totally works. Somehow, at least for me, even those scenes, which were not meant to be funny, turned out to be just that. For example the scene where Christine met with the parents of her fiancé. The dialogue was so out of the character of the whole movie, so unrealistic, and the whole scene was so obviously only about somehow forcing a ""romance"" and some ""family drama"" moment in it for the ladies in the theater seats, that i laughed throughout its entirety. The ""fight"" in the grave with the dead woman was also hilarious. As a horror this is no doubt 1/10, but as a comedy it is at least 7/10, hence my vote: 4/10. I only recommend if you want to laugh and you don't have a weak stomach. If you want to be scared, look elsewhere."

I understand that some people don't like the effects of blood gushing, parts flying, etc. but if a director chooses to have that effect in their movie then they better make it look realistic. In Drag Me to Hell, there was no such thing; their blood looked completely fake. Just about everything looked fake. The only reason I watched this movie to the end was because it made me laugh my butt off AND I was waiting for the main character, Christine, to die. <br/><br/>So if you're looking for a movie to laugh at, watch this one.

On the other hand though, after all the glowing praise that has been thrown at Drag Me To Hell I expected something of T2 or Die Hard proportions, something that redefined a genre and set a high water mark for all other filmmakers to aspire to.<br/><br/>That clearly doesn't happen here, but in any case this is a very good (most importantly fun) horror flick which is definitely worth checking out and is at least better than 90 of the last 100 horror flicks that I've seen.<br/><br/>Still not quite enough to crack my all time top 10 horror movies though.<br/><br/>A good horror movie should aim to do at least one of the following: Scare / Amuse / Shock / Gross out / Build suspense / Provide some good gore / Kill 90 minutes in a more enjoyable way than watching 3 episodes of Will & Grace.<br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell does four, it primarily amuses, at times it scares, it aims to gross out and achieves this goal, and let's be honest almost anything is better than watching a 2000's version of ""Are you being Served?"" minus the laughs.<br/><br/>What you won't find here is suspense, Sam has no time for it and prefers a quick build up, then scare, scare, scare for 80 minutes. What does this mean? Well in reality this is pretty much what the Evil Dead movies would have looked like if he had a budget, and many scares and scenes rip freely from the trilogy.<br/><br/>First the plot in ten seconds: A young bank employee does a gypsy lady wrong and is in turn cursed by same. Unless she appeases the demon spirit within three days she will be Dragged to Hell.<br/><br/>I could give you the same info in another 27 paragraphs but instead I have decided to give you some random thoughts as I watched the movie:<br/><br/><ul><li>Justin Long was in Jeepers, Creepers. This is a definite step up. He is such a good and understanding boyfriend that it is obvious he reeeeeallly knew he wasn't ever going to do any better and decided to believe anything she said rather than dump her and find someone more sane. (C'mon I like Justin Long, but if he wasn't an actor would he be scoring with anything above a 7? Be real now.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The girl, Alison Lohman, is a pretty good actor, cute enough to be interesting, but not memorable enough for me to want to watch what she is in next.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why would someone put their Mum on speaker when you know she doesn't approve of his girlfriend and she is in the room?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Being a former bank Johnny, it is good to see that even movie characters assume all bank employees are tellers regardless. (It happened all the damn time!)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>There are tossers who will stab you in the back in every workplace.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Why would leaves blow through a deserted underground car park?</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The characters have a cat. I initially thought that ""Here we go, how many forced scares will we get from here?"" You know what? Zero. (Points: Raimi.)</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When you have three days to go before being dragged to hell, unless you make amends with the curser. Don't put it off until the last minute.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Between this, Thinner, and even Snatch, don't ever mess with a gypsy! Now some thoughts about Sam's pet likes:</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sam likes eyes, especially eye trauma. (If you think about it, his Ghost House Logo starts out as a skull eye looking through the keyhole.) In Evil Dead 2 we had the memorable ""eye down the throat"" gag, in Army of Darkness the initial ""eye in the shoulder"". Here he kicks it up a notch, or at least as far as a PG horror movie will allow, we have a cake-eye and an eye stapling to keep us warm until his next flick.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sam uses simple body fluids more effectively than almost anyone else outside of porn directors. The gross-outs in Drag Me To Hell come frequently, and even though you know it is only a film they just look gross. Notable examples include a high pressure nose-bleed, numerous mouth to mouth vomitings (!) and the aforementioned dinner scene.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>A single buzzing fly is sometimes more disturbing than 1,000 decapitations. I can watch someone get a pitchfork in the head and not blink, but when the fly goes up one nostril and out the other I nearly gagged.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>When you use the plot device of having the lead character susceptible to random visions, you can have an attack from ANYWHERE! This leads to so many unexpected shock scares that you can understand the lead character going nuts.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Sam still loves the ""possessed guy rising above the floor and speaking loudly in a disembodied voice"" thing.</li></ul><br/><br/>As a horror movie I don't think this is ready to be considered an all time classic. I personally enjoy Army of Darkness and Slither more than this. BUT: if you wanna spend 90 enjoyable minutes with a few scares and some great gross-out comedy, you likely won't do better.<br/><br/>Final Rating – 8 / 10. Thanks for coming back Sam. You've still got it, but go back to R and give us one more real crack at horror before ""Spidey 4: Tobey Needs One More Paycheck To Afford A Lamborghini Murcielago"".<br/><br/>If you liked this (or even if you didn't) try oneguyrambling.com"
"rabboyce","2","1","3","8 October 2010"," Very disappointed
","When my friend and I saw that the TV listings gave this 3 out of 4 stars, which is so rare in horror flicks, we were very excited to see the movie. Unfortunately, we were both sorely disappointed.<br/><br/>I've enjoyed horror movies before with comedic elements in them, but they had decent plots and such gore that you needed a little comedy to lighten them up.<br/><br/>Not so with this one. It wasn't a great plot, it wasn't gory or scary, and every move, even the ending, was so utterly predictable that we kept hoping they were just PRETENDING to be predictable, setting us up to surprise us . . but no. Since it wasn't scary, the comedy just came off as extremely lame.<br/><br/>We had more fun watching some made-for-TV cheesy sci-fi horror flick afterward, which is a very sad thing."
"Mahan18","3","1","3","7 October 2010"," Don't believe the hype
","I don't understand it. Why is the movie liked so much? Sure, it's okay, but this is just ridiculous. The special effects are tacky, the female lead Christine looks like she's in the middle of high school, the 'hallucination' scenes were bizarre and the overall plot was just average.<br/><br/>I stack this movie next to Stephen King's Thinner in terms of plot development: Cross a gypsy, and expect to die. Of course, in 'DMTH', the reasoning is just stupid. She's being evicted from her house because she's behind on her payments, and the lead won't extend her mortgage. Okay, Christine mentions that the gypsy has a grand-daughter she can stay with, it's not the end of the world. So she curses Christine, who just doing her job, to hell for all eternity. Overreacting, much! Okay, to be fair, she dies soon afterwards, but that's more likely to be caused by plot convenience than not having a home.<br/><br/>One of the aforementioned 'hallucination' scenes involves her getting a nosebleed... of tidal wave proportions. Okay, first off, no-one is concerned about her and more worried about the boss who gets sprayed on. Yeah, because that makes all sorts of sense (!) Secondly, she loses a LOT of blood in this scene, and she just runs out in embarrassment. I'm not a doctor, but I'm pretty sure she would have passed out, if not died, from that. And before anyone cries ""It's a camp horror/comedy like in Evil Dead"", this is not camp! It may be a comedy, but it isn't intentional.<br/><br/>That being said, the movie isn't horrible. It's mediocre, but it isn't horrible. The story's pretty solid, even if the reasoning behind it isn't, the acting is good, and I have to admit, I did get a few jumps from time to time. Although, given one of those jumps involved a friggin' handkerchief, some of them were pretty weak. Overall, the movie is given way too much credit. See it if you want, but don't go out of your way to do it."

","Firstly because most importantly whoever rated this movie PG13 needs to see a psychologist... I'm sure the children whose parents let them watch this movie will. I am twenty two but have enough intelligence to know that rating has officially knocked the limit down cold!!<br/><br/>Secondly this movie is an excellent throwback to the eighties horror genre in true tradition of The Evil Dead and simply do not understand how anyone could rate this movie with a score lower than a five but invite them to explain their idea of a horror movie.<br/><br/>Thirdly this movie literally scared me silly. This movie is a true horror movie because it drags the viewer straight to super natural hell! This movie is not based on a mad man driving his victims to saw off their legs, if thats what you want then rent a thriller.<br/><br/>The perfect combination of horror and yes at times humor. The director may have directed this movie but the special effects created it. Do not pass up the chance to view this movie based on others comments especially if you enjoyed The Evil Dead trilogy."

","I must confess that i'm not a Horror Movies' fan, but this one is really awful. I think i can say that this was the worst film i saw.. For all time!<br/><br/>Though the plot its kinda interesting, it goes really bad from the beginning 'till the end. The lead actress makes it look so fake all the time. She could be a really great poker player because she isn't able to show an emotion during the all movie. Alison 'PokerFace' Lohman. The other actors don't go very good as well, but they're not so bad.<br/><br/>I started by saying that i'm not a great fan of Horror Movies because most of them look all the same. Though the plots are different everything rolls out the same way. They're so predictable. So I have to give a little bit credit on this one, because it may surprise. Even for a guy like me. It was the first time ever that i found myself actually crying on a film of this kind. The only bad thing is that I was cry.. by laughing!!<br/><br/>It's a 'to see' movie, but only because you must know bad to enjoy good.. I really don't get the 7.1 score. Maybe i'm too picky"
"freakymidnightshow","10","1","3","14 September 2010"," Funny, terrifying. One of the masterpieces of the decade.
","DRAG ME TO HELL is a funny, grotesque moral tale of a young woman (Alison Lohman)who get stalked by a demon because of the curse of an old dead gypsy. She got to find a way to kill the demon ... or she is going to be dragged to hell, literally.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi comes back, and my childhood memories too (EVIL DEAD II was one of my favorite pre-teen treasures). The movie forgets all about the Marbel comic hero that Raimi has to lived with for almost a decade. And after 20 years since the no so good ARMY OF DARKNESS, Raimi remembers his college years, his friends and his love for The Three Stooges.<br/><br/>Of course DRAG ME TO HELL is not a re-make in style of THE EVIL DEAD MOVIES. But in spirit, it is that an even more. The moral tale is actually very good, thanks to the Raimi(s) script and the screaming girl, Alison Lohman. There's no boring part, it's disgusting, bloody and very funny.<br/><br/>You don't have to fall in the same gum of loving movies remembering movies. But DRAG ME TO HELL is really original, it's, at the end, auteur cinema and is one of the most convincing, serious/stupid horror films of the decade. <br/><br/>SPOILER --- BTW, is obviously that there going to be people who don't going to like the ending. But really, do you really think it could end in another way?"
"andrefbento","2","1","3","12 September 2010"," Complete Fail...
","This movie fails in basically every basic feature... Where should I start? The plot: is as shallow as a baby pool and does not have any original feature. It's a exorcism (evil spirits, etc) meets the ring (pass the curse to the next one and survive) which exploits to exhaustion all the clichés of these movies. The director seemed (?) to be interested in having some comedy moments, but I guess that most of them were totally unintentional, since in the theater where I went ppl were laughing in the scenes that were supposed to scare...<br/><br/>Originality: no. you'll be able to see doors and windows closing mysteriously, the usual progression of this type of strange stuff until the very intense ending when the devil is confronted by the hero (and two additinonal predictable twists. The only new feature could be the sort of moral story that I think the director was trying to embedd in all this mess: the girl is not so decent, since she can do whatever to succeed, has a very rude behavior with the old woman (including in the parking lot: ""I got you bitch!""), kills a sweet animal and disrespects a dead body"", which may cause the audience to have mixed feelings about whether she deserves or not what's happening. However, this really does not work, for various reasons... In the bank, there is a guy who is even worse than her, which kind of gives the impression to the audience that she had just a bad moment but in general is a nice person. And the other moments where the director tries to convey the message are so cheesy that the result is a massive laugh of the audience (was this planned in the car fighting scene? In the theater I went everyone was laughing their .... out of it! quite a bad start, isn't it?). I could tell much more: for example, why the introduction, if this medium-woman ends up not having any decisive role in fighting against the demon? So much weight was put on this personal revenge of the woman, and then she gets totally owned by the ""bad guy""... With whom should we have a connection in the movie, if the girl is killing a cat and doing other nasty stuff along the movie? With the medium-guy that shows up some the times? With the boyfriend that is totally clueless and useless in the crucial scenes? Characters: ridiculous. All of them, expect for the medium-guy and the manager of the bank. The rest o them were just clichés without any character development at all: the sceptical boyfriend, the unfair work colleague, the spiritual Spanish medium-woman, the angry gypsy woman... The main character has some more work in it, but in my opinion the director is not able to pull together the moral dilemmas that she should be feeling. She decides very easily to kill the cat, and the scene has no intensity at all; for example, it seemed she was worried in refusing to extend the credit to the old woman than to kill her innocent pet! The actors seem a little lost in this movie, in particular the main character, who sometimes seems undecided on whether to show tension or coolness, since the story swings unpredictably from horror to comedy.<br/><br/>Music: I could sense that something wrong was happening since the initial credits... The music would work for a superheros movie, but not for the so of movie I was going to watch! And this happened many, many times throughout the movie... The music was completely out placed, and was used too much, and when used was too much present for a horror movie.<br/><br/>Special effects: very intense and bad use of them. The director should try to watch Martys, a horror film that I liked very much. In this movie, the is almost no CGI and the evil characters are all human. There are no ghosts, no speaking goats, no flying handkerchief and other stuff that just makes you disconnect from the movie."
"ildimo1877","10","1","3","8 September 2010"," Superb, unpretentious horror
","Raimi goes guiltlessly berserk – or ""Argento"" in the urban cinephile lingo – presenting what has to be one of the finest tongue-in-cheek and deliberate horror surrealist jokes in history. In no more than the plot of a curse to be fulfilled in three days, Drag me to Hell blinks an eye to a burlesque version of the Exorcist, but finds its cinematic opposite in Tourneur's Curse of the Demon. ""Pity"" then that Raimi doesn't for a second believe his story. This is not to say, however, that he won't rely in his finely measured directorial prowess and make you believe. The old gypsy woman curse sequence ought to be anthologized in the years to come, scares, virtuosity and mise-en scene is near perfect, but what is actually audience needed here, is Raimi' s incredible contempt for thick headed seriousness and academic recognition."

"ShannonCharmedone","1","1","3","26 August 2010"," Not the best, but quite a ride...
","This movie for me, was just a bit too out of it's mind. I watched it at probably the worst time a teenager under the restriction age of this film could ever watch it, midnight.<br/><br/>And I have to say, I wasn't actually impressed. I thought it would be a gore fest, And a complete and utter scream-your-ass-off kind of film, the kind of film I hate! I know you're saying ""Why did you watch it?"" Truth is, I was bored, and unable to sleep, and I heard my friend say it was good, so I watched.<br/><br/>I did like the beginning of it, not dark, just normal. I thought this film would be like the film ""Obsessed"", which I loved to bits. But it wasn't, at all.<br/><br/>I thought it would be normal, but having an ematophobia (fear of puke) made me feel myself hyperventilating through most of it. The only frightening part of it was the puke for me, where she puked the bugs all over Chris and then puked her stomach acids into her mouth, which, as you may note with my phobia, made me rush to the bathroom to puke myself.<br/><br/>Worse still, the cat. Truth be told, I'm not too fond of cats. But her cat was adorable. When she killed it, I was disgusted! It just wasn't right. Especially since she had lived on a farm before, couldn't she go get a chicken instead of her own pet?<br/><br/>That and the goat, call me what you may, but yes I did cry when they mentioned making the goat evil, and killing it. I believe that everything has the right to live, therefore killing that animal, cute and harmless, made me want to kill the screenwriter. However when it turned evil, I knew they had to kill it, even though it was an adorable little goat.<br/><br/>Overall, considering I am writing a film myself to become a professional screenwriter, I will know what type of film to REALLY avoid."
"yesenia66","1","1","3","22 June 2010"," Awful!! It's trying too hard.
","My husband and I were looking for something to rent when he came across this movie. The high ratings cinched it for him and he didn't read any reviews because he didn't want to read any spoilers, that was the first mistake. The second was watching this tripe and the third was slogging through the whole thing because we refused to simply turn it off hoping beyond hope that it would improve as it went on. It didn't.<br/><br/>The premise of the movie, although predictable (gypsy puts a curse on a woman, woman tries to remove it) can still be done if it's don't well. It wasn't. The movie started out well but got increasingly sillier to the point that my husband and I were literally openly groaning during some scenes.<br/><br/>The two main actors give horrible performances. Justin Long phones his lines in and looks like a drowning man as the film progresses. If he didn't fire his agent, he should.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman as the lead is absolutely awful. It's obvious she tried to do her best with the material but nothing could save the tired script and ridiculous scenes. Incidentely, there was NO chemistry whatsoever between the two leads even though they are supposed to be in a long term relationship. He could have been her brother.<br/><br/>So, I think in the end what happened to this film was Sam Raimi himself. It's TRYING TOO HARD. The reason Evil Dead was such a fun franchise was because the first film wasn't trying to be a cult classic. This movie reeks of desperation. It wants so much to be a cult classic that it sacrifices all the things that make a cult classic, quotable lines, good acting, and an interesting story.<br/><br/>In the end this is a skip, you will thank me."

","I didn't think the plot to this film was anything great, plus it was just weird. This girl, Christine, works at a bank and she has to deny an extension to this old woman on her house. Well, the old woman is some kind of witch. She attacks the girl in her car and pulls a button off her jacket and curses it. The rest of the film Christine has scary visions mostly involving the old woman. The woman bites her, vomits on her, and is even in her piece of cake. The whole curse just didn't make a lot of sense to me.<br/><br/>This movie just had some moments in it to make you jump but it wasn't scary nor bloody. Gross if anything.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: If you want to check out a recent creepy movie, I would suggest Orphan. This isn't worth your time."

In terms of plot it's all pretty straight-forward stuff, but the film was spoilt for me by Alison Lohman's patchy performance. She's fine in non-horror sequences, and even does scared well sometimes, but often her reactions just don't seem convincing. If you were trapped under a dead body with embalming fluid being vomited down your throat, you might seem a bit more distraught when you finally escaped, But Christine's hair is more ruffled than she is.<br/><br/>The horror isn't bad, but is isn't until near the end that the movie starts to become a lot more fun."

","""Drag Me to Hell"" was, I think, the perfect horror film... With this film, Sam Raimi has demonstrated that he is a master. Not just ""a"" master, but ""THE"" Master of Horror.<br/><br/>Raimi kept me in the roller-coaster from beginning to end, he was scaring me even when I didn't need to be scared, he had me scared for the little Spanish kid, then scared for the safety of a kitten; then scared that the guy's parents wouldn't like the girl, then scared of the job hierarchy at the girl's workplace. Sheesh. It was FEAR, FEAR, FEAR, FEAR, FEAR, TREPIDATION, FEAR, FEAR, FEAR, FEAR, FEAR... Sam Raimi immersed me in FEAR from beginning to end.<br/><br/>It was masterful. Effective.

","The whole horror scene was waiting for the return of Sam Raimi to the genre. And after years he finally did. Drag Me To Hell is his return, but for me it was a bit of a let down. Okay, I didn't expect a new Evil Dead but what I was waiting for was a new gory flick to be added to his fame, well, it isn't. The storyline is okay and the acting is okay but by returning with his old pals Nicotero and company I really thought that the effects wouldn't be what they are now. My God, there is so much CGI in it, hold your horses. Indeed, with the handkerchief you have to do it CGI, no probs with that, but when the anvil drops down, no way I can accept that from Nicotero. And was it frightening, not really, not for me, yeah, the scene's were you jump out of your seat are in the movie but somehow, it didn't work for me. And no gore is available, the red stuff flows but for Raimi, no can do. It's a shame that this movie is a major project. The geeks will have to deal with the fact that Raimi never will make another Evil Dead."
"BaronBl00d","7","1","3","15 November 2009"," Old-Fashioned Horror Returns
","It was a pleasant surprise to see this film go back to some of the earlier methods of scaring an audience: the use of the power of suggestion, imagination over visualization, leads that have acting talent, and a story(though cliché-riddled) offered more than a one punch game plan. Drag Me to Hell is not great but highly enjoyable for those reasons plus it is stylish as well. The opening scene in the film grabs you initially and then we enter into the life of a female banker who makes a mistake with an old gypsy woman who is being thrown out of her house. Events turn far worse as a curse reeks its arsenal of evil on this girl. The acting in this film really is pretty good. Alison Lohman does a fine job as the protagonist. She is able to show a range of emotions believably. Justin Long is also pretty good as her boyfriend. The character actors are all solid with Dillep Rao as an Indian palm reader shining(and adding a subtle dose of humour), Adriana Barazza as a mystic, and in a stellar part of disgusting special effects and over-acting Lorna Raver as Sylvia Ganush the gypsy woman. The tension stays taut throughout. We see little but imagine lots. The film does have some obvious flaws. The end can be seen miles away. i knew how it was going to end and what the ""trick"" ending was going to be. I thought it might throw out a trickier trick ending - but it did not. The fight scene in the car was also way over-the-top - more so than anything els in the film. That notwithstanding, Drag Me to Hellw was a pleasant diversion and a throwback to a more intelligent type of horror made."

I am a big fan of horror movies and loved the Evil Dead Trilogy. Sam Raimi really nows how to make a good, crazy, funny, sarcastic horror movie. I thought it was great. You could definitely see the likeness to his Evil Dead movies. With the slapstick horror comedy. It was just a wonderful film. I was worried about how it would turn out with a large Hollywood budget this time around. But it did not disappoint. A must-watch for horror fans. You will enjoy!<br/><br/>*My only complaint is that Bruce Cambell didn't make any cameos. He usually appears in a small role on all of Raimi's movies.

","Those hoping that ""Drag Me to Hell"" represents a return to Sam Raimi's horror roots will be sorely disappointed. This is more ""Spiderman"" than ""Evil Dead."" <br/><br/>The likable young actress Alison Lohman plays a woman cursed by an old crone who must figure out how to break the spell if she doesn't want to be dragged you know where. Her efforts involve some time spent at a seance, the sacrificing of a pussy cat, and lots and lots of scenes of the creepy old lady jumping out at our heroine and uttering over-amplified sound effects. Indeed, the only nominal scares to be had in the film come from this over-used effect, and it's not scary so much as merely startling, and stops being even that after Raimi uses it for the umpteenth time.<br/><br/>I'm not criticizing Raimi for making a scary movie that's not scary. It's clear his tongue was planted firmly in cheek when making this film, and that he was more interested in kitsch than he was chills. But that doesn't mean I wasn't disappointed in the final product. It's hard not to be disappointed in teeny-bopper fare like this when you know what Raimi is capable of. It's like expecting ""The Texas Chainsaw Massacre"" and instead getting an episode of ""Charmed.""<br/><br/>Justin Long plays Lohman's boyfriend, and though the character he plays is a supportive good guy, there's something so smarmy and cocky about Long that I couldn't help but dislike him.<br/><br/>Grade: B-"

","I thought that Drag Me To Hell was one of the One of the scariest horror films i have seen in the last five years. The film starts in Pasadena, California in 1969, a young Mexican couple rush to the home of medium Shaun San Dena (Flor De Maria Chahua). Their son had stolen jewelry from some Gypsies three days before, and since then, has been complaining of seeing and hearing things that are not normal. San Dena tries to help the boy in a séance, but she and the boy's parents can watch in horror as the boy is thrown from the balcony by an unseen force before being pulled into Hell by a demonic force. a young woman Christine Brown is responsible for loans in a bank and expects to be promoted to the position of assistant manager after dealing a big contract. However, the new hire Stu Rubin is a coworker that is against Christine to be selected by the manager Mr. Jacks to the position. When Mrs. Ganush, an old gypsy with an appearance of a witch that has been evicted by the bank, requests a third extension of her mortgage, Christine denies the loan to prove her boss that she can take tough decisions. Mrs. Ganush begs for the loan by begging and kissing the hem of Christine's skirt. but Christine shames the woman by calling security. In the night, Christine is attacked by Mrs. Ganush in the parking lot and they struggle. Mrs, Ganush removes a button from Christine's coat, curses it, and she returns the button to her and vanishes. Later, while going home with her psychologist boy-friend Clay Dalton, they pass by the fortune teller Rham Jas, and Christine decides to speak to him. He tells her that Christine has the fiend Lamia, the Black Goat, upon her. <br/><br/>When Christine is haunted by the dark spirit during the night, Alone at home, which appears as the silhouette of a goat's head. The spirit breaks some windows, cuts the power, and throws Christine across the room, causing minor injuries Christine is attacked by the dark spirit, at work the next day, she has a violent nosebleed. Leaving work, she tries to track down Mrs. Ganush at her granddaughter's home. There Christine learns that Mrs. Ganush died the previous night, and her granddaughter is in. Christine causes a scene by accidentally knocking over Mrs. Ganush's dead body, and her granddaughter tells her that she deserves what is coming for her. I though that this was a great horror film from director Sam Raimi, with very good special effects, and sounds that made me jump several times during the film. 9/10"

Christine and Justin long are the only characters that act somewhat decent, but the rest are just awful. The ending is what turns this movie from a C- to a D- automatic fail for drag me to hell.

"brando647","8","1","3","24 October 2009"," Raimi's Triumphant Return to Horror
","After the disappointment that was SPIDER-MAN 3, I was glad to see Sam Raimi taking a break from the web-slinger saga to return to what helped make him famous: campy B-grade horror. Here, he has total creative control and as a result we're given one of the most fun horror movies I've seen in recent years. Without relying heavily on gore effects, the film manages to send a chill down your spine while at the same time making you laugh at some great camp moments. The premise is simple: Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer who refuses an extension to an old woman on the verge of losing her home. The old woman, Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver), just so happens to be a gypsy who doesn't take the news so well and places the curse of the Lamia on Christine, leaving her three days to find a way to rid herself of the curse or her soul will be dragged to Hell.<br/><br/>Keep in mind, I said the movies doesn't rely on gore but it does have it's share. Regrettably some of the gore is blatant CGI (the anvil moment) but it adds to the camp and doesn't hurt the movie. You can tell Raimi tried to rely on practical effects, only resorting to CGI when he had no other option. My absolute favorite moment in the movie is the goat in the séance (a bit of good old-fashioned animatronics) which always seems to get a laugh. Over the course of the movie, you'll see Raimi hasn't lost his EVIL DEAD touch.<br/><br/>As for the cast, Lohman was a perfect choice for the role of Christine. She plays the character as so innocent and pure, a victim of circumstance who would've helped Ganush if she weren't so worried about a possible promotion. She creates a soft-spoken country girl in extreme circumstances (receiving more than her fair share of stomach-churning punishment) who's easy to feel for. Just as talented is Raver as the Ganush; while her screen time isn't as much, she manages to leave an impression as one of the creepiest old women I've ever seen in horror. Rounding out the cast are Justin Long (mildly amusing though hard to accept in a role as a college professor) and relative newcomer Dileep Rao as Rham Jhas, Christine's spiritual adviser throughout her dilemma.<br/><br/>To sum it up, the movies comes off to me as equal parts creepy and funny and is a fun 90 minutes. For those who miss the over-the-top horror movies of the 80's, this'll be right up your alley."
"JOYofSeeing","5","1","3","17 October 2009"," Disappointing
","Based on the trailer, I was really looking forward to this movie. The night the DVD arrived I switched off the phone, turned on the lights, and braced myself for an entertaining and scary ride. Unfortunately I was neither entertained or scared. It started out with such a great premise (similar to Stephen King's ""Thinner."") But the overkill of gross out scenes, over-the-top horror, and slapstick humor made for an awkward mix. Oh, and speaking of awkward, the leading man, seems out of place in his role. That being said, I could see how this movie would strike some viewers as being striking. It has a comic book appeal. It's big! My own personal taste, however, leans to more subtle horror."

Dialogue as such can only be pulled off by one man... Bruce Campbell.<br/><br/>By the way, note to all loan officers, if you ever have the choice to evict a creepy old woman with false teeth, do the sensible thing and just give her a loan extension."
"juliankennedy23","4","1","3","16 October 2009"," Drag Me to Hell... I have been gypped
","Drag Me to Hell: 4 out of 10: Great another movie that achieved universal critical acclaim that I did not enjoy. Oh make matters worse it is a horror film (which almost never achieves universal acclaim and which I love) and is by director Sam Raimi whom I genuinely enjoy.<br/><br/>Drag me to Hell is all about gypsy curses. In the tradition of the superior Thinner and Buffy the Vampire Slayer our heroine Alison Lohman is a bank manager who turns down a third extension on an old gypsy’s house mortgage causing her to lose the home.. (Lohman is eyeing a promotion and her boss told her to be tough) The Gypsy in question attacks Lohman (in the films best scene) and then places a curse on her. She has three days to get rid of the curse or she will literally be dragged to hell.<br/><br/>In those three days, the demon in question will torment Lohman, so far so good. Then the movie falls of the rails. Lohman does something so horrific and unnecessary to get rid of the curse she becomes a Black Hat extraordinaire. Now a twist like that certainly can work if the film acknowledges it, but Raimi keeps his cards too close to the vest.<br/><br/>It quickly comes apparent that Lohman, despite acting as a younger, blonder, more innocent Kirsten Dunst, is the most evil thing in the film. The film simply does not really pull this switcheroo off or may not even realize it on some level.<br/><br/>The main fault lies with the lead performance of Alison Lohman who seems to skip through the movie with one confused expression, another confused expression and a decent scream. Raimi knows his buttons too well and fixates on violating the chaste Loman’s mouth with flies, maggots, blood, fists, entire arms, and in the most disgusting thing ever; an old ladies mouth without her dentures.<br/><br/>Loman cannot pull off a fun evil so instead she is more the brain-dead banal evil. This is a role that requires a Linda Ferrentino style touch. I simply do not think Loman had the chops for the role.<br/><br/>The films tone is strange as well. Many scenes are clearly tongue in cheek (a giant anvil held by a rope for instance) but others are so horrific (The aforementioned horrible act that shall not be named) that it takes one out of the story.<br/><br/>The rest of the cast is decent with Justin Long giving a particularly strong performance as the really nice guy with the evil girlfriend from hell. (Well going to hell... you know what I mean.) Long is best known as the Apple guy and the film keeps sticking him in front of Apple product placements handicapping his effectiveness.<br/><br/>There is also some strangely bad CGI in the mix. While Raimi really knows how to push the gross-out buttons and the jump scares, he would have been better off with some old school effects.<br/><br/>Overall I am beyond disappointed. Nevertheless, I guess once again I will be that guy who didn’t like the film everyone else loved. It is “Rushmore” all over again."
"milescorn","3","1","3","14 October 2009"," I expected more
","From someone like Sam Rami. I read a lot of reviews about this movie before I sat down to watch it. I read that a lot of people compared it to The Evil Dead. So going into it I thought I was in for a treat. I was wrong. It was more like Stephen King's Thinner, only it took three days to happen. I did not find all the ""black comedy"" to be funny at all, because it seemed to only involve ""throwing up"". Some parts were kind of creepy, like the encounter in the parking lot, but other than that, I did not find this movie scary. I believe it could have been better, the plot was good, but lacked in depth. Horror needs to take a step back and look at its roots to find what is scary and what is just fodder."
"Chris Knipp","8","1","3","20 June 2009"," Not so scary
","Sam Raimi, of the 'Evil Dead' movies, detoured into comic book heroism with Spider Man. Working with his older brother and sometime collaborator Ivan on the screenplay, in 'Drag Me to Hell' Raimi returns to the horror genre but branches out into the supernatural with a tale of possession, curses, and exorcism. The result is a movie that has the potential of satisfying the general audience repelled by contemporary horror films so bloody and disgusting lately only adolescent males or their grown-up equivalent can stand them. 'Drag Me' has more elaborate, faster, louder effects than were available in the Seventies, but it's intentionally old-fashioned. It even opens with a prologue set in 1969 and cast in a deliberately garish B-picture style. In what follows, the scares have more in common with William Friedkin's 1973 'The Exorcist' than with the 2000's 'Saw' franchise, 'Cabin Fever' or even 'Friday the Thirteenth.' This is a vivid exercise in self-conscious but enthusiastic genre that for all its noise and yuckiness is is more enjoyable than unsettling.<br/><br/>The first thing you notice is that the main characters aren't the attractive but despicable (and therefore disposable) youths Fred Krueger comes for, but people you can actually like. At the heart of this movie is a nice young couple, the plucky, winning and pretty Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) and her sweet, faithful boyfriend Clay Dalton (Justin Long). Lindsay is a loan officer at a small bank. Appropriately enough in this time of the burst real estate bubble, Christine brings down a curse upon herself by refusing to delay a mortgage foreclosure.<br/><br/>Raimi plays with the situation and our emotions here. The sick old lady who begs for a third extension, Mrs. Gannush (Lorna Raver), elicits Christine's (and perhaps our) pity at first, though Christine's need to impress her boss and win the vacant Assistant Manger post for herself makes her refuse to grant that extension. But the yellowish slimy drool from Mrs. Gannush's mouth, her hideous sharp discolored nails and her snaggly pointed teeth -- which, absurdly, are false, and which she removes to suck on some candy from Christine's desk while she's talking to the manager -- quickly tip us off that in fact she is -- ridiculously, over-the-top-- evil, doubtless a witch, put on this earth, or on Sam Raimi's set, to make Christine's life a nightmare and give us a lively, slightly scary, slightly gross ninety minutes in the theater. He avoids he whole issue of human sadism by focusing on an invading spirit, a ""Lamia,"" that aims to torment and terrify, not torture or maim. Not for the first time, Raimi's sequences revel in their sheer absurdity, while skirting the edge between seriousness and play.* Mrs. Gannush has a menacing hissy fit when Christine turns her down, and has to be removed by security officers. Then she is waiting in that classic scary place of movies, an underground parking lot, to confront Christine. and launch the curse, which hinges on a coat button. I felt a little embarrassed for Lora Raver. She's not so much an actress here as a most unflattering object upon which special effects are hung.<br/><br/>With all the whirring insects, dark winds, flying objects, and buckets of fake blood that follow, what anchors Raimi's movie and makes it watchable are the appealing human elements, which add a certain nuance uncommon in the genre. As Christine's boss Mr. Jacks, who controls her future, David Paymer isn't the bad guy we expect, but admirably fair. Her oily, devious competitor for the assistant manager position Stu (Reggie Lee) is greedy and devious, but also so pathetic you can't hate him. Similarly when former farm girl and nobody Christine goes to meet Clay's well-heeled parents (played by Chelcie Ross and Molly Cheek), their snobbism toward her surprises us by fading quickly, and they seem quite decent people -- till Christine's curse leads to behavior so appalling they're glad to see her to the door.<br/><br/>Something makes Christine want to have her fortune told. In stories like this you've got to have a spiritual adviser. The Raimis made an excellent decision in choosing that this should be a man from India, land of deep spiritual lore. As Rhan Jas, who helps Christine find ways of appeasing the evil Lamia that's after her, Dileep Rao is warm and appealing.<br/><br/>Finally Justin Long, whose online bio begins with the description, ""a likable, boyish-looking actor with thick eyebrows and a friendly smile,"" is hard not to love.<br/><br/>It's with these human touches that Raimi constructs an essentially grim, nightmarish, and by implication deeply pessimistic movie that feels surprisingly cozy. This is largely because it also feels old fashioned, evoking bygone movie-going experiences more than any scary realities. It's funny that so many teams of special effects guys were involved, given that none of it seems real for a minute. Raimi plays the game to the hilt, but he never stops letting us know he's in on the joke.<br/><br/>_____________________ <br/><br/>*Kevin Lee's YouTube video discussion of Raimi's 'Evil Dead II' sheds light on the director's outlook and methods. ""If the Evil Dead movies have contributed one thing to our appreciation of film aesthetics,"" Lee begins, ""it is to make us consider the boundary between what's funny and what's scary."" A pretty thin one, it appears."
"gaso-markanthony","9","1","3","19 June 2009"," A hell kind of movie..
","Reviewers of Drag me to Hell are in unison that the movie was amazingly good that's why when I had the chance to pass by the theaters, I rushed to the ticket booth and spend pennies for it. Glad that it didn't failed me. <br/><br/>For the 21st century, many horror/thriller movies were made that is lacking in substance and originality. Horror movies were made with explicitly bloody and gruesome scenes emphasis but always lacks in sound effects and creativity to thrill the audience like Friday the 13th, Saw series and Texas Chainsaw Massacre. American movies are exaggerated in their vivacious interest of making remakes to the oriental culture like Korea and Japanese where movies in line were Shutter, The Uninvited, The Grudge, One Missed Call, The Eye and many more remakes. These are movies made by Asian masters and failed remakes in Hollywood. <br/><br/>Horror genre seems to be dead within these years not until the Raimi brothers of Evil Dead trilogy go back to making horror film entitled Drag me to Hell that should drag audience at the edge of their seat. What was amazingly good is that it meets all the elements of a good film the sound, the timing, the picture and of course the acting not mentioning the space. And these elements are used in a very different manner. The sound was composed and amazingly design using the orchestra and used to keep the paced of the thrill and the atmosphere of a disturbing horror. The visual effects don't seem to be realistic, but it's obvious and acceptable. It's what makes the movie to be differently scarier and I like it. The timing to keep the terror alive over and over within the pace of the movie is unpredictable and once you are caught by it, screams out the hell as you can. The actors and actresses did their job. You could expect it from Allison Lohman {Christine Brown} and Lorna Rayver {Mrs. Ganush} which the relationship between the characters was in tension. Both nailed their part. Times that you may feel pity for the bad guys and feel harsher for the good guys. Mrs. Ganush I think, have done the greatest job so far in the movie to be mean, dirty, old, sometimes pitiful and a scary gypsy woman. She is an icon that could not be forgotten in horror film-making history. Other supporting actors and actresses were useful for keeping the twist. <br/><br/>Overall, you may feel mixed emotions in the movie. It's a sort kind of comedy, you may get scared, you may feel like running wherein you are just seated at your seats for the solution of the protagonist, and you may feel like yuck for its nasty and disgusting parts. Kudos for Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi for bringing a one hell kind of a movie. It's a classic horror movie I've seen in a long time since the American version of The Ring and The Descent. Drag me to Hell; you will love every minute of it. It is a masterpiece and best seen in theaters."

"MoronUnited","9","1","3","15 June 2009"," The Master of Horror is Back
","It's hard to defend that recent horror films are simply not nearly as good as they were in the past. Moviegoers have become so accustomed to the idea that torture porn like represented by the Saw and Hostel series is what horror is all about. Not to mention how the rest of the horror films are simply remakes of past movies, like the recent Friday the 13th remake. Thankfully, Sam Raimi decided to tackle the task of making a great horror film in the 21st century. The question is, however, is the film everything horror fans wished it to be? The answer is a resounding yes, considering Drag Me To Hell is quite possibly the best horror film to be released in decades.<br/><br/>The main idea behind Drag Me To Hell is a simple one, yet an idea that has been seemingly lost over the years: Making a horror film that embraces retro horror films, yet is still exciting and exhilarating enough to bring new ideas to the genre. As the years have passes, it truly seems that horror films lost all the charm that they once had. Horror movies are supposed to be enjoyable diversions from reality, that while still being scary and creepy, are fun to watch. Simple as that. But now, the genre is filled with grim, sickening, and twisted gorefests that are neither enjoyable or entertaining. Sam Raimi, however, saw exactly what was wrong with modern film-making, and corrected it. It's truly unbelievable at how amazing the result is.<br/><br/>As far as the story is concerned, the film is centered around one young woman whose life isn't going so well. Her bank promotion is about to be given to a newbie, and in an attempt to show her boss that she is the right one for the position, she denies an old woman an extension on her mortgage. Normally, this wouldn't be a huge deal, had the old woman not cursed the young bank clerk to a fate in hell! Yes, it's silly, but it's refreshing to see a silly horror film plot again, which haven't been seen in years. The shocking part of the film, for me, is just how hilarious it is, yet at the same time, being filled with creepy moments. I spent pretty much the entire film laughing, and some scenes had me laughing so hard that tears were running down my face. I had never laughed that hard during a comedy, let alone a horror film no less.<br/><br/>It is also highly recommended, above pretty much all films in recent memory for that matter, that viewers see this flick in a theater. Why? Well, there are movies that people go to see for the movie itself, and then there are movies, like Drag Me To Hell that are made in part due to the experience. Laughing and yelling at the screen with a bunch of random strangers is what the horror genre is all about, and that is exactly what this film provided. There were people screaming from fear, and then immediately rolling in the aisles laughing. There was even one part of the film where a person was walking into the theater as a screamer popped up on-screen, leading to her literally falling to the ground in fright. While watching it on DVD will still be great, definitely go to a theater if at all possible. It's worth every penny.<br/><br/>Many people refer to me as a cynical reviewer, and that may be true, but I am not kidding when I say that people owe it to themselves to see Drag Me To Hell. It's a celebration of classic horror, and strong enough to represent the past in a time where the genre isn't holding up very well. It's exhilarating, enjoyable, hilarious, and downright awesome in every regard. Sam Raimi deserves a round of applause."
"charlytully","9","1","3","13 June 2009"," Let's hope Sam Raimi teams up with Michael Moore in Michigan
","This film is a masterful exercise in wish fulfillment, as writer\director Sam Raimi makes sure a mercenary bank home mortgage loan officer gets exactly what the majority of Americans think such people collectively deserve. This movie could just as easily be titled THE ROAD TO HELL IS PAVED WITH GOOD INTENTIONS. Perhaps there are more kind-hearted mortgage loan functionaries than kind-hearted suicide bombers, but in America no one holds a gun to your head to force you to foreclose people's homes or turn down their cancer treatments on behalf of obscenely profitable health insurance companies. In DRAG ME TO HELL, bank employee Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) has made her bed, so the victimized gypsy woman's Lamia demon forces her to lie in it.<br/><br/>Documentarian Michael Moore (FAHRENHEIT 9-11), a Michigan native like Sam Raimi, is shooting a movie right now about how the U.S. government allowed a handful of credit default swappers to steal the nest eggs of both the WWII ""Greatest Generation"" and the Baby Boomers. The state of Michigan is twice as broke as California; Gov. Jennifer Granholm announced the inmates from 10 closed prisons will be released onto the streets shortly. Granholm also has imposed North America's biggest film-maker tax credits; several closed car assembly factories are being converted into sound stages; and I just read in Detroit METRO TIMES that workers are so desperate they're appearing in non-union productions FOR FREE. In Michigan, you never know what horrific, post-apocalyptic vision lies around the next corner. It's about time Raimi and Moore hook up to produce a thrilling docudrama within the cinematic paradise of their home state!"

","Sam Raimi's 'Evil Dead' trilogy will forever stand as among the most refreshing and original chapters in the horror film genre. Jumping the boat to create the enormously popular 'Spider-Man' trilogy he now returns 29 years after the first 'Evil Dead' and creates a wonderfully slick feature and rebirths the genre once again. As mentioned by others on the message boards and in the comment section, we're in a time where horror films are mostly Japanese remakes (that originally has got underlying scares that the American everyday film viewer don't actually sense) and franchises whose torture and gushing blood whose spirit almost leans toward the sadistic and pornographic. 'Drag Me to Hell' is Sam Raimi at his best, upping the pace from his earlier features to create an intense 96 minutes of sarcastic humor, nerve-snapping scares and an emotional core of greed, self-loathing and spirits of the dark. Alison Lohman takes on this solo-ride like Bruce Campbell did in the 'Evil Dead' films and faces Lorna Raver who brilliantly plays out the disgusting and frightening Mrs. Ganush and makes her one of the most memorable horror villains in quite a while. We've got a few minor characters worth mentioning, with Justin Long as the earnest boyfriend, and Dileep Rao as helpful (or?) fortune-teller that becomes surprisingly important elements in such, at first glans, straightforward horror film. Though some have criticized Raimi for using CGI to cover some happenings as if he's departed his low-budget, B-film spirit of the 80ties, I think the CGI-effects weren't overused and they felt like a fine addition to such a splendidly wild story. This is easily one of my strongest recommendations of 2009."

Some parts were very disturbing and I was so grossed out but still so interested I had to watch. The plot and story were both brilliant, acting was good but could have been better.

","There has been enough hype and publicity surrounding this film that to summarise the plot would be a complete waste of time, so i'm going to get right to it.<br/><br/>If your like myself and grew up in the eighties and appreciated the horror films that that decade had to offer, then Drag me to Hell is a 100% must see. After a long departure(too long) from the horror genre Sam Raimi has finally returned to doing what i can only say he was born to do and that is plain and simply, scare the hell out of you whilst making you laugh at the same time, and with drag me to hell he executes this with absolute perfection. Although some may be put off by the 15 certificate all i can say is don't be. Raimi doesn't disappoint, the movie has its fair share of gross out moments as well as some disturbing imagery and a darkly comic tone throughout and the movie moves at such pace and with such tension that one cannot be helped but drawn in to Raimi's twisted world, a place which i have to say i didn't want to leave.<br/><br/>The performances from all the actors were great with a special nod well deserved for the old gypsy hag. Great performances combined with great camera work and a fantastic musical score and the direction of a horror maestro make this film almost perfect. But to pick flaws in the film would be trivial and to be honest i would feel like a bit of a dick, because Raimi and co have truly crafted a movie that has not been done, well since Evil Dead.<br/><br/>Raimi has proved to his fans and the critics that he still has what it takes when it comes to horror. He can still write them, he can still direct them and more importantly he has shown he is one of few directors who has the you know whats to end a horror film how they should be ended (i slept too long) remember that?. He has brought back to life a genre which was slowly dying and has proved you don't need a lot of money or special effects to make a good horror movie. He has stuck to his roots and in doing so has done something other recent horror movies have failed to accomplish(be good).<br/><br/>Raimi has finally come home to where he belongs, lets just hope he doesn't move out again, well not before doing Evil Dead 4 anyway, Come on Sam bring back Ash one last time, you know you want to."

The subject matter is very scary, it's not just another cheap ghost or slasher story.<br/><br/>For those of you who don't enjoy (or don't know) The Evil Dead series, and that type of humor/horror, YOU WILL HATE THIS MOVIE. Why? Because it will fly over your head.<br/><br/>For those who love those type of movies you will find this one quite enjoyable. Not nearly as good as the old school horrors, but a decent attempt.<br/><br/>I gave it 6 out of 10 because I am very, very picky. I wouldn't even consider this an all-out horror. The overall plot of the movie starts with the old lady's curse (which is a dumb plot in the first place) but as the movie progresses they make it work. How? Well the movie starts with an old lady but the rest is filled with a crazy demon tormenting Christine.<br/><br/>Personally, I felt the movie seemed to drag on at parts. I understand everything has to come together at the end and make sense, but there were a lot of pointless add-ins. Also, the CGI could have been touched up here and there, would have been a lot more fun to dump actual fake blood on people. Don't expect a giant demon to come chasing everyone at the end. This is a more ""freak you out by what could be"" type of movie. However, the music and sounds were amazing, typical Raimi, enough to seem fun but still give you the chills.<br/><br/>There were plenty of evil dead-type moments throughout the movie, but it honestly felt like it could have been so much better, hopefully a unrated DVD release will make Raimi fans sleep better.<br/><br/>This movie is definitely worth seeing for Raimi fans, and if your open to a different type of horror movie, I would recommend this one. It was fun."

I cannot understand why actors such as Justin Long or Alison Lohman would even consider being in such a film. And the worst part of all this is that the film is not even scary.

Then an old woman Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes in for a loan extension and her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer) leaves it up to her. She refuses the extension despite the old woman begging. She feels shamed and places a curse on her with her button. It's a curse that will send her to hell.

Alison Lohman is the cute perfect victim and she screams well. The story isn't anything original but it's lots of fun. There is some CGI but I really love the real effects. It's a simple thing to fire junk at a girl's face. It goes up a notch when she's screaming with her mouth wide open. That's this movie. Raimi is using every trick in his book. The only scene I have a problem with is the old lady in the tool shed. It's a bit cartoonish for an anvil to be hanging from the ceiling. Dropping it on her head looked more like a Road Runner cartoon and using CGI really limits the horror fun. Otherwise, the movie is done with a nice sense of humor.

"CuriosityKilledShawn","4","1","4","16 January 2012"," It's a drag alright.
","Sam Raimi's career has been mainly downs, in terms of box office takings at least. His only highs have been the Spider-Man movies (which I hated) while some of his better work (Darkman, The Quick and the Dead) only managed to gain a cult following. He emerged in the 80s as a surrealist horror director but over the years he's lost whatever edge he had and Drag Me To Hell is proof of that.<br/><br/>The oh-so-cute Alison Lohman (who I would drag to bed) plays a timid bank clerk who offends a decrepit Gypsy woman (a pastiche of former Raimi monsters) and is promptly cursed. In three days the not-scary-sounding demon The Lamia will drag her to hell, but not before having fun frightening her first.<br/><br/>The majority of the scares in the film are, I am sorry to say, overly telegraphed Stingers. Is this what Raimi is reduced to? The PG-13 rating means that this obviously isn't going to be hardcore, but it feels like it was written by a 15-year-old boy and directed by someone referencing the Big Book of Horror Clichés whenever they got stuck. The young Sam Raimi would have been appalled. When limited by the narrow parameters of being a PG-13 Raimi resorts to gross-out moments, mainly involving puking corpses, fake CGI blood, old woman saliva, more unconvincing CGI, and more old woman saliva. This is bottom-of-the-barrel stuff. It's like Spielberg selling Bruce the Shark on having bad breath.<br/><br/>Justin Long provides some decent support, though this film really does belong to Lohman. Her large brown eyes, innocent expressions, and naive demeanor make for a sympathetic character. I just wish she used more logic and common sense. There is a nice twist-in-the-tale which turns it into a Tales From the Crypt-style morality play, but other than that this is pure pot-boiling, pedestrian, Hollywood twaddle with NONE of the grit, rawness or edge of Evil Dead or Within the Woods."

But the psychic told her later that the method was not guaranteed (and in fact didn't work), so he told her of a psychic lady who had been waiting for 40 years to redeem a boy lost for this demon by helping someone else, but wouldn't find anyone willing to pay $ 10,000 for the job.<br/><br/>The psychic lady finally succeeds in expelling the demon, but dies right after the ritual with Christine's money. But, wait, that also guaranteed nothing, because the demon would still come back for the button's owner. Oh, God, there's no way to get rid of him!<br/><br/>Unless...<br/><br/>Oh, the scatter-brained psychic she first talked to forgot to tell her that she could have just given the button to someone else in the first place! She lost her kitty and her money for nothing!<br/><br/>Well, she put the button into an envelope and tried to give it to the old lady's dead body, but the corpse was worse than Bernie, and seemed to want some more fluid exchange and maybe a closer relationship with Christine.<br/><br/>Everything would have been fine if her boyfriend didn't have another envelope that looked exactly like the same as the one Christine had - even with a small round flat object inside."

Though it is not word-for-word, the similarities are apparent to anyone familiar with the genre.<br/><br/>I'm not exactly sure where the comparison to The Evil Dead originates, but that person must be out of their mind. It takes more than Sam Raimi's slap-stick comedy and some campy horror to compare to The Evil Dead. Talent, for instance, is a major component. Talent is what this film lacked throughout. Of coarse The Evil Dead was funny, yet frightening, but where would it be without Bruce Campbell? Do you see where I'm going with this?

","Drag Me to Hell 12/12/2009<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi has directed such movies as Spider-Man 1, 2, & 3, A Simple Plan and Darkman returns to his horror roots in Drag Me to Hell. Raimi's Evil Dead and Evil Dead 2 are two of the biggest cult horror movies ever made. They were both shot on extremely small budgets and launched his career and that of Bruce Campbell. Sam has a specific kind of horror that is half slap stick comedy and half ultra gore. The ""dead"" movies were made in the glorious golden ages of 1980's horror films.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is a very fun movie to watch that has everything the horror fan looks for, Super-natural curses, blood offerings and gypsies. The movies main characters are Christine and Clay, played by Alison Lohman (White Oleander & Flicka) and Justin Long (the Apple Computer guy). The story revolves mainly on Christine and her job as a loan officer yearning for the available assistant manager position. It's between her and the new guy Stu Rubin. Enter the creepy looking Sylvia Ganush, an elderly woman who comes into the bank and begs Christine for another extension on her mortgage but Christine turns her down. That night in the parking lot Mrs. Ganush is waiting for her and they engage in an incredibly funny fight scene. Mrs. Ganush then puts a gypsy curse on Christine. She summons a demon known at the ""Lamia"". The Lamia is known as the black goat and the eater of souls. Christine has three days to fight off and get rid of the curse before she is ""dragged to hell""<br/><br/>Justin Long plays the boyfriend part well and adds his own brand of humor to the role. His parents are rich and don't approve of his choice of Christine, who grew up on a farm and was quite the pudgy tomboy as a child. As the curse progresses, it starts to make Christine see and hear things that aren't really there. They visit a fortune teller who feels the presence of the curse within Christine. He warns her of the danger and to be careful. Christine finally agrees to a fancy dinner at Clay parent's mansion. This doesn't end well as you might expect. The acting, directing, and such are all top rate. Everything you would expect from a Sam Raimi production. As mainstream Hollywood horror films go, it would be hard top. <br/><br/>Raimi plays around with classic ways of scaring the audience. Wind, shadows, and strange noises are played out well. Other than in a Looney Toons cartoon, where else would you see a good anvil gag? The several gross out scenes are purposely played for their comic effect rather than to outright scare you, which is a strong trademark of a Sam Raimi film. There is a twist ending that is pretty sweet and is set up in the first part of the movie. Raimi's next film is scheduled to be ""Warcraft"" an adaptation of the super popular online computer game."

","I really wanted to like this movie. I'm tired of the sick torture-fests of Hostel, was never excited by the rather silly plot twists of Saw no's 1-80. I was downright disgusted at the sacrilegious remake of The Fog, and bamboozled by the countless remakes of Japanese horrors that miss the point when they're translated to the world of Hollywood models.<br/><br/>I was, therefore, disappointed when I saw this movie. I expected the outrageous slapstick of Evil Dead 3, or at least the suspense of the original Evil Dead. Yet there seemed to be neither. The story contained virtually no plot twists to keep me interested (Night of the Demon anybody?) and seemed to consist solely of things being splashed in the unfortunate heroine's mouth! Yes, the special effects were wonderful (they always are). But it's no substitute for a good story. I mean, there just happens to be an anvil suspended from a frayed rope in a garage when our heroine needs it the most? How many of us even possess an anvil? And why would it be tied to the roof??? I desperately want to say good things about the movie. I love Sam Raimi's work so far, especially the underrated Crimewave. Much has been said about whether the heroine is too nice to justify such a fate - but that ignores the arbitrary nature of the plot. Story seems to have taken a back seat - but to our constantly jaded eyes this movie seems to be long talky sequences punctuated by special effects which we have all seen before. Not frightening, just kinetic."

Instead, it's an amalgam of stories that have been told before, mainly Ringu and Ghost (yeah, with Patrick Swayze).<br/><br/>Special effects? Raimi is almost at the same level that he was with Evil Dead, he's even quoting himself with the séance session. The ghosts in ""Ghost"" were the same shadowy figures... seen it all decades ago.<br/><br/>Gore factor? Raimi does a big nod to Peter Jackson's Braindead in showing all kinds of yucky body fluids but in Braindead it felt at least humorous whereas in the context of this movie it feels a bit forced.<br/><br/>To sum it up, I was thoroughly entertained, but not surprised or overwhelmed.

","You won't find a movie title that is more literal. At the prologue of a happening 40 years ago, we witness a medium's losing battle against a dark spirit that torn open a hole right in the middle of the grand hall in her mansion and drag her charge (a young boy), screaming and kicking, right down to the depth of the bowels of the earth. Now, 40 years later, she (Adriana Barraza) has a second chance to get even, with our protagonist Christine (Alison Lohman) as bait. The grand scheme is to trap the spirit in the body of a goat which will then be swiftly slaughtered. <br/><br/>Let's back up a little. Our protagonist is an ordinary young woman, with ordinary good looks, an ordinary ambition (tantalizing promotion prospects, from loan officer to assistant manager), an ordinary romance (boyfriend with a mother that wants his son to marry a more influential woman) - an ordinary life, in sum. The adventure starts with her refusal of a mortgage extension to a desperate old woman, an action driven by ambition overriding compassion. It turns out that the old woman is not only desperate, but also dangerous, cursing Christine's soul away to the dark spirit that will claim it after three days of harassing terrorizing. That's the general state of affairs. <br/><br/>What makes this horror one cut above the others in the genre is that it is not a horror at heart, but rather a satire and a fable. The thrills are decently delivered but far too mild for the general state of the genre today, and depends far too much on loud noises and sudden images - techniques that some critics jeer as the lowest form of horror. The significant thing is that they are intended to be funny rather than frightening. I even sense a subtle tribute paid to the Steven Spielberg (as producer) style of horror in the 80s such as ""Poltergeist"". Even more significant is the shaping and modeling and shaping of our heroine that leans more and more towards comical as the plot progresses. Director Raimi, taking a break from the Spiderman franchise, appearing to be enjoying a little bit of retro on himself, does not seem too keen to make her a damsel-in-distress that the audience would root for. With the final twist, you understand why: this is, as I said, a satire and a fable, with a moral lesson. <br/><br/>One smart, funny horror that will give you some delightful surprises."

The old woman, a gypsy, puts a horrible curse on the woman, where an evil spirit (a lamia) will drag her soul to hell in four days.<br/><br/>Many of us were waiting for Sam Raimi's return to horror (aside from his production work for Ghost House), and here it is. For me, personally, it was an experience that was both welcoming and disheartening. any of Raimi's old tricks are back, but some of his new tricks are present too, much to my chagrin.<br/><br/>A good friend informed me that the first fifteen minutes of the film are ""epic"", a word that is not to be used lightly. In this, I strongly disagree. While some of the later scenes were very intense and quite fun (the parking lot scene, for example), the first fifteen minutes were largely a waste of film. The introduction with the Mexican family serves only a minimal plot purpose, and we are treated to a bit too much bank employee exposition.<br/><br/>What are the old tricks and new tricks I refer to? Let me lay it out for you. The old tricks include: the return of the Delta 88, some great camera shots (again in the parking lot scene), a demonic dance, a possessed goat, and a very subtle cameo by Ted Raimi that you'll miss if you don't recognize Ted's voice. Sadly, Bruce Campbell was not available for the film to make a cameo. The new tricks? Computer generated animation. I have expressed my disapproval of CG in countless reviews, but it's even more sad from Raimi, who is known for his camera techniques and stop-motion work. Sure, this isn't low budget, but animated fire doesn't scare me.<br/><br/>Overall, while I didn't find the film to be groundbreaking, it is well worth a view. Raimi includes plenty of his splatter effects (blood, drool, and other bodily fluids) and generally gives us a good ghost story, particularly for working in the PG-13 framework (which is a mistake). The end is also satisfying. Compare this to Stuart Gordon's ""Stuck"" and it seems that Raimi has the more lasting impact on horror.<br/><br/>As of this writing, the film is in the cheap seats, so by the time you read this, it will likely be out on video. Be sure to rent this. The film likely didn't make as much in theaters as expected, especially with the overbearing media campaign (which was enough to turn me -- a Raimi fan -- off). Let's help them recoup their losses on the video sales. No doubt the special features will make this well worth it."

The fun isn't so much in the rather simple story, but in how Christine struggles to escape the curse and Raimi does a surprising job of throwing around a lot of zany Three Stooges/Looney Tunes inspired comedy and still somehow maintaining all the tension and suspense required in the horror movie.<br/><br/>Honestly, there were some points in the film that I laughed out loud at, which doesn't happen much. Some of the setups for physical comedy are rather hilarious, including an early one where a lack of dentures leads to grossness. Speaking of gross, the film does not hesitate to indulge in gross-out effects, almost all of which was done comically (think the ""wall of blood geyser"" from Evil Dead II). Despite the rather comic nature of the film, Raimi still reaches deep into the bag of horror tricks and manages to make the audience jump out of its seat with scares and chills.<br/><br/>The only issue I have with the film can be leveled at much of the genre it occupies and that's one of the consequence. When the curtains go down and the jitters of excitement have worn off, you're left wondering, ""so what""? But then again, I don't think that DMTH or many other horror films are all that concerned with that as well.<br/><br/>The cast does their job respectably, Lohman capably carrying the internally conflicted Christine well and managing the silly physical comedy well. Lorna Raver throws herself into the vengeful Sylvia Ganush well, also somehow managing to make the old woman rather frightful and comic at the same time. All the other players do decent jobs with their simple roles and keep us engaged. And technically, while the film might be a throwback to the Raimi of old, we're dealing with the budgets that the new Raimi can command and so all the special effects are very glossy and very likely done with a lot of CGI. Nothing looks low budget. Cinematography is subtle, but does a great job of creating lots of dark spaces for scares to happen and keeping things unsettling even when we're in the ""safe"" spaces in the film.<br/><br/>Ultimately, DMTH is a rather simple film, but one that takes its simple premise and takes it to the best degree it can, much like Evil Dead II. It's both laugh-out-loud funny and jump-out-of-your-seat frightening and the suspense is high enough to keep you at the edge of your seat. And while, Raimi might have left the small budgets of the Evil Dead trilogy behind, he seems to have ripped out its still beating heart and stuffed it into Drag Me To Hell, making a terribly fun popcorn movie that keeps its ambitions simple and meets every single of its entertainment goals. An often unbelievably entertaining film. Thank you, Sam Raimi. 8/10."

","The first thought that comes to mind upon seeing Drag Me to Hell is ""there's no place like home"". For Sam Raimi, ""home"" means the edgy, subversive horror movies that kick-started his career, a genre he returns to after a two-decade break (The Gift is actually a regular thriller with a few supernatural elements) for two reasons: a) he needed a pause for breathing after three consecutive Spider-Man movies (and a fourth one planned for 2011), the last of which received mixed reviews to say the least; b) who better than him to prove that his production company Ghost House Pictures is capable of making scary films and not just miscalculated efforts like The Grudge and Boogeyman?<br/><br/>The picture tells the story of Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), an ambitious girl who handles loans in a bank hoping she will soon get a richly deserved - in her opinion, that is - promotion. In order for that to happen, though, she needs to be able to deal with tough decisions, her boss (David Paymer) tells her. And so the young girl refuses to grant Mrs. Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) a third extension on her mortgage, since doing the opposite would be a career-damaging move. Unfortunately, the old lady - who happens to be a gypsy - isn't very forgiving, in fact she assaults Christine in a parking lot and subsequently lays a terrible curse upon her: after three days, the Lamia (a goat-demon) will take her to Hell for all eternity. With her boyfriend (Justin Long) suspecting she might be losing her mind and demon ""experts"" (Dileep Rao and Adriana Barraza) largely clueless as to what should be done, Christine only has 72 hours to come up with a way to save her soul.<br/><br/>Although it was completely unintentional (Raimi says he and his brother Ivan wrote the script in the early '90s), Drag Me to Hell stands out as a very relevant movie in these financially unstable times: whereas blockbusters like The International depict banks as the Big Bad with less than thrilling results, this film revives that satirical streak which defined several great horror flicks in the '60s and '70s (Romero's zombie cycle being the obvious quality example) and has been conspicuously missing lately (barring Joe Dante's Iraq-related episode of Masters of Horror, which, appropriately enough, featured zombies). From the get-go, Raimi has us all hooked on one point: at present, it's a lot of fun to watch a banker get in all kinds of trouble.<br/><br/>Then again, Raimi doesn't really care about politics or social subtext; what he wants to do is scare people as much as possible. That he manages to do so despite the obvious limitations of the PG-13 rating (The Evil Dead, his feature debut, was originally banned in several countries for its OTT violence) speaks volumes about his deep understanding of the genre, and also unveils a long lost truth: you don't need gallons of blood and torture - the current trend in horror productions - to make a good scary picture, as long as you have an intriguing premise, a spooky mood and the right jump-in-your-seat set-pieces. Naturally, this being a Sam Raimi film, the horror comes with a peculiar mix of absurd, revolting humor, and the director succeeds in eliciting shocks and laughs in equal measure from a random series of objects, including a handkerchief (!) and a piece of cake.<br/><br/>If one wants to complain, it could be pointed out that some minor characters - notably Reggie Lee's opportunistic bank employee - are blatantly two-dimensional, and the dialogue is occasionally corny even by B-movie standards (""And after the third day, the demon will come to take you."", says a psychic, to which Christine replies: ""Take me where?""). But hey, this is, at heart, a B-movie, so any narrative ""misstep"" (such as the deliberately stereotypical depiction of the gypsies) is easily forgiven. Besides, who watches this kind of movie for the story or the supporting characters? What matters here is Christine and her horrific conflict with an elderly nemesis. Lohman is terrific, suffering all forms of physical abuse while still retaining the necessary charisma to make us care for her fate, in pure Bruce Campbell fashion (Raimi's favorite collaborator was, unfortunately, unable to appear in the movie), and Raver is one of the best horror creations of the decade, doing her best with a role that essentially requires her to scream, spit, drool or vomit.<br/><br/>Long story short: Drag Me to Hell may be bloodless, but it's a visceral, relentless, inventive fright-fest, complete with a straightforward title (it does exactly what it says on the tin). If there has to be a message, make it the following: Spider-Sam's still got it."

","As a horror movie, it did not do its job very well. I spent most of the movie, either laughing, or thinking about the next time i was going to laugh. BUT the parts of the film that were actually scary, WERE SCARY! The anticipation of something popping out of nowhere scared me the most. BUT the possessed goat was what really got me, and the 3 people in the theater with me, laughing. This movie looked like it was SCARY, when i watched the trailer, but it turned out to only scare me slightly. If you are a person who loves to get really scared, don't watch this. Since i am a bit of a chicken this was just right for me. The acting of the main character was very poor. She was quite unconvincing for the most part. Justin Long did a fairly average job, nothing too spectacular, but his role wasn't spectacular either. Also, if you are an animal person, don't see this, because i got very upset at some parts. Overall I think it was a movie with a GREAT plot, but very bad animation."
"MOscarbradley","7","1","4","30 June 2009"," Good cheesy fun
","Extremely enjoyable if somewhat over-praised horror film from Sam Raimi, harking back to the ""Evil Dead"" movies that launched his career. They were genuinely cheap and cheerful but Raimi has gone on to bigger and better things. Consequently, this amalgam of high and low-tech only manages to push some of the right buttons. It aims for low-down good fun and for most of the time it manages it but it lacks the fright factor that would have made it something of a classic.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman, (very good), is the bank official who finds herself the victim of a gypsy curse when she refuses an old lady an extension on her mortgage. To put it simply, the curse is that after three days of torment she will, quite literally, be dragged to hell. Cue some good set pieces and some decent special effects and it's nice, for a change, to see a horror movie that is based on the supernatural and not on some stalk-and-slash psycho, (though the old gypsy woman proves to be a pretty nifty stalk-and-slash psycho as she helps put Alison through those three days of torment).<br/><br/>We get two big anti-climaxes, both well handled, before the inevitable final twist. (Anyone who has seen this kind of thing before will see it coming, though I admit I only half-guessed the outcome). This is the kind of old-fashioned nonsense William Castle might have made; just don't go expecting too much and please Sam, don't go making the apparently obligatory sequel."

","Drag Me To Hell is simply the most fun I have had in the movies in a very, very long time. It is a guilty-pleasure, but actually a very well made film at the same time. It gives us old-school scares and humor that had me laughing more than any other film in the last five years. The story is simple yet effective, the performances from Alison Lohman and Lorrna Raver are perfect for this, powerful but also very comedic when they are required to be. The same goes for the rest of the actors in the film, all played their parts gloriously over-the-top, which really worked. The scares the film provides were many, some were scary, some were shockingly gross, and then some were just plain hilarious. The film will surely provide a lot of future references and homages to the over-the-top scenes, like the grave scene, the talking goat, and the dancing ghost. Drag Me To hell is without a doubt the best horror film of the decade, but also probably one of the funniest films I have ever seen. That is a true achievement, Sam Raimi's best film to date. But I do tell you this, please go see it with a large audience, because that will only enhance the experience even more."

","Maybe I was expecting a lot from this movie. But then again the title was not a dead give away that it was a chick flick. I went to the movie house with high hopes of a good scare and I got Legally Blond dabbling on animal sacrifices. What's up with the kitten scene? Maybe it was just there to emphasize PETA's cause. I get that this was a scary time for Ms. Brown but can she try looking scary? She barely has a scared look. Then again she may be going for the ""strong-not-never-ever-going-to-be-a-damsel-in-distress"" act. And what's up with the effects? The séance scene with the goat and the guy who was supposed to hack the goat's head off got possessed was not really that convincing. It was too clear they were just effects.

"pyrocitor","7","1","4","12 June 2009"," Relentless, mean, chilling and uniquely humorous - a welcome rekindling of roots for Raimi
","Once upon a time, long before the days of web swinging blockbusters, Sam Raimi made horror movies. Ridiculous, demented, technologically inventive and grotesquely comical horror movies of a kind never quite seen before, to be exact. Of course, as with most independent voices forced to appease mainstream audiences, while he managed to smuggle in many trademark quirky touches into the Spider-Man franchise (the ludicrously out of place Saturday Night Fever dance in the third, for starters...) he is now renowned for, many fans of his earlier, nastier films felt that Raimi's madcap genius had been somewhat quenched with his melding to the mainstream. As such, it would be difficult to envision a more conscious return to his wacky horror roots than Drag Me to Hell. While it may contain a larger budget, slightly more familiar material and less stop motion than his cult classic credentials, Raimi's latest is the sort of kinetic, freewheeling, relentless bludgeoning of horror with just enough quirky laughs thrown in which previously made his name infamous and celebrated. <br/><br/>Avid enthusiasts of Raimi's previous gross-out fare may be either disappointed or elated to find his latest more along the lines of the first Evil Dead, a more straightforward, traditional horror film, then the inventive madness of the second. Yet this is not to say the film is not inventive or madness - far from it. In fact, like most contemporaries, in many cases the film appears structured primarily for the sake of stringing together memorably terrifying set pieces, and painfully amplifying the tension in between them, as well as satisfying Raimi's seemingly unquenchable desire for endlessly tormenting his protagonist, as much as progressing the narrative. But, at the risk of over-glorifying its director, moments which might have reeked of convention in the hands of another filmmaker become uniquely effective in the hands of Raimi, who utilises Christopher Young's vastly over the top musical score to add a demented yet supremely effective veneer to traditional ""what's behind the door?"" style frights. Of course, a Raimi film would hardly be recognisable without the quirky factor, and while Drag Me to Hell generally forgoes humour in favour of frights, certain moments punctuating the film remain hilariously hard to forget (unusual possessed objects, a devastatingly creative opening fight scene, several inventive gross-out bits and at least one ironic use of Christian iconography among others). <br/><br/>Nonetheless, as hard hitting, chilling and whimsical as the film is, it is unlikely to surpass Raimi's past work in the eyes of most fans, and those unfamiliar with his work are just as likely to be bemused as enthralled by such a brand of intentionally campy horror. Of course even considered within its genre, the film has clearly discernible flaws (an arguably oversimplified and generic script with an ending perhaps a shade too predictable and no characters quite as bizarrely memorable as Bruce Campbell's Ash), yet the crucial element to the film's success remains its dogged determination to terrify the audience as relentlessly and unpredictably as possible while simultaneously refusing to take itself seriously. Yes the fleeting attempts at moralising may appear trite, but such a daringly questionable moral stance (Christine is damned to incessant torment through a single moral lapse despite a lifetime otherwise spent attempting to better herself or others) demonstrates Raimi's gleeful refusal to confine himself with traditional emotional storyline arcs and instead have as much brutal fun in the meantime as possible. While the film may not be quite as fearlessly odd as his earlier fare, Drag Me to Hell is at least just as entertaining, which in the end is all it was likely intended to be. <br/><br/>Even with the absence of B-movie superstar Bruce Campbell, Raimi's film is firmly carried by its capable cast. Alison Lohman is a triumph as Christine, the normally well intentioned loans officer subjected to continuous torment. As well as proving admirably game for abiding every possible trauma from being thrown around, writhing in mud and expelling insects and blood, Lohman proves enormously charismatic and frighteningly believable, making her tortures feel all the more disconcertingly affecting despite their campy excesses. Justin Long also proves a surprisingly solid piece of casting as Christine's incessantly kind and loving boyfriend, toning down his usual humour in favour of a likable and credible piece of potentially cumbersome characterisation. Lorna Raver is memorably unsettling as the gypsy woman placing the curse on Christine, as well as also proving commendably willing to subject herself to numerous unusual forms of punishment, and Dileep Rao is a laudably even and credible presence as a good hearted fortune teller. <br/><br/>While it may prove more polarising for audiences than the average horror film, Drag Me to Hell marks a triumphant return to Raimi's formative genre, demonstrating that even after decades his ability to evoke superbly crafted scares and bizarre laughs remains intact. Audiences approaching the film with no real complexity in mind (though there are undertones to be delved up if desired) and prepared to laugh as much as scream may find the film several cuts above most modern fright-fests, and a positive omen, if any, for the creative direction of Raimi's subsequent return to the faltering Spider-Man franchise. <br/><br/>-7.5/10"
"sinncross","8","1","4","12 June 2009"," Horror returns in fine form ...
","With a promotion on the line for the role of Assistant Manager, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is hoping to fill the position; however she has some competition for the role and decides to prove to her boss that she is capable of handling any situation with falls her way. One such situation arrives when Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), an elderly woman, arrives to appeal for a third extension for a mortgage on her house. Christine ultimately decides to decline the woman's request resulting in the old woman cursing Christine to damnation.<br/><br/>It is a strange storyline it must be said, but it works regardless of how ridiculous it may become. For many years American horror has gone the route of a serial killer or psychopath tormenting victims, but few rely on the plot device of the supernatural. The film starts on a note of suspense and continues to its end in this manner, and the fact that Christine is cursed to go to hell in a few days ensures that horror does not remain sporadic, but the norm. Plot development flows allowing for Christine to shuffle her curse with her personal life: she is virtually in every scene so the audience becomes caught up in her life. That said there are no subplots to distract from the main story arc: Christine is going to hell and she needs to stop that happening. This is slightly disappointing in regards to narrative depth but the film has clear indications into commentating about society at large. Christine has to struggle with her choice and whether self-gain is more important than the well being of others. Additionally a discussion is created about whether putting on a certain image to impress certain people, changes who you fundamentally are, or exposes your true self. There are fascinating levels of depth to the linear storyline if viewers so wish to engage with the text, but if not the audience will still be greeted with a favourably pleasant experience.<br/><br/>The acting front is workable in the film's structure: it is never of a high level but it is commendable in giving the respective characters some life. No one actor cements their presence but it is Lohman's character that rightly gains the most depth. At first it is difficult not to dismiss Christine's predicament, but the story and Lohmans' acting ability allows a new angle to be considered. Relating to Christine is never easy: while she is not an entirely virtuous person, she comes across often as too stuck up for her own good. This runs well with the film's thematic factor which Raimi is able to explore, though it does lessen Christine's characterization somewhat.<br/><br/>Cinematography is a fairly interesting facet for the film with many scenes being presented in a 1980's horror manner. This could be easily frowned upon but Sam Raimi, who is clearly appealing to fans of his Evil Dead series, has a keen sense for direction making for sharp scene interaction and crazy imagery. This creates some great moments of horror and complementary sly humour: it is a unique blend but Raimi gets it spot on and the comedy does not go to dim the horror's effectiveness. If there is a problem it is that some techniques are a little overdone, but ironically the horror scenes only keep getting better.<br/><br/>Horror films usually have certain expectations on regards to content, but Drag Me to Hell seems to disobey such notions. There is no sex or nudity, and language is almost non-existent. Violence is triggered through some suspenseful showcases and while they do have a factor of being grotesque, they are hardly close in realization to the all out gore and sadism of modern titles.<br/><br/>Simply put, Drag Me to Hell is one of the most enjoyable horror films of recent times. It has an interesting, supernatural storyline with interesting characters; reasonably good acting, though it could have been stronger; and intriguing cinematographic design, even if a little overused. There is even well formulated social commentary which really adds wonders in allowing the film to appeal on an intellectual level. Raimi's grip on horror makes for a great deal of suspense and the added humour only makes the film all the more devious. All this is achieved with a minimal level of objectionable content, making the film less conformist to the horror genre as it stands and showcases Raimi at what he does best. Though the shining achievement of Drag Me to Hell is that it does what a horror should: not just simply gross out the audience but rather aim to scare and entertain them."

","The cast didn't really do anything for the movie. There is no ""Bruce Campbell"" in this. Alison Lohman (was Ellen Paige originally attached to this role?) was okay, if not somewhat miscast, Justin Long was just a supportive boyfriend, concerned seance/fortune teller guy, etc. Mrs. Ganush was GREAT though, one of the best horror characters I've seen in a while.<br/><br/>The plot had some weak points. I didn't think that Christine's southern roots really brought anything to the table, they probably could have cut that out. I'm also guessing that you have to formally give the button to someone, because I thought Justin Long's character was going to have the curse.<br/><br/>In the end, it was just another fairly neutered modern horror film that lacked that good old spark. I have no idea why the horror community has embraced that one so much. It represent for me, all that is wrong with most modern horror films. It's all about slick visuals and no guts (quite literally) so to speak and it became too predictable after the late middle-half of the movie (The anvil, handkerchief on the way to the grave, the obvious button swap, awkward kitty conversation at dinner event).<br/><br/>It tried to be Army Of Darkness and ended up being closer to Scary Movie.

","""Evil Dead"" trilogy director Sam Raimi returns to his roots with this relatively lightweight chiller ""Drag Me to Hell,"" but it generates nowhere as many chills as his ""Evil Dead"" epics with Bruce Campbell. Indeed, ""Drag Me to Hell"" ranks several rungs below Raimi's reputation.<br/><br/>A twentysomething bank loan officer Christine Brown (cute little Alison Lohman of ""Flicka"") struggles to convince her immediate superior Mr. Jacks(David Paymer of ""Mumford"") that she is the best candidate for the as yet filled assistant loan manager's position. Mr. Jacks reminds Christine that the individual that he selects for the job has to be able to make difficult decisions. Meanwhile, Christine faces stiff competition from an Asian-American, Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee of ""Tropic Thunder"")who will stoop to any low tactic to get the job himself. For example, Stu gives Mr. Jacks a couple of tickets to a Los Angeles Lakers' basketball game. <br/><br/>A ghastly-looking hag of Gypsy woman, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver of ""Freeway""),shows up to get a third extension on her mortgage since she has been sick. Ganush is so hopelessly repulsive that you almost find yourself laughing at her when she pulls out her Halloween-looking dentures. In an effort to impress Mr. Jacks, Christine displays her complete lack of compassion for this revolting looking crone and turns her down. The hideous old Gypsy woman curses our heroine and Christine's life becomes a living Hell. Flies climb her nose and the old woman haunts her.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi and Ivan Raimi penned the screenplay, but there isn't really anything new here. In fact, ""Drag Me to Hell"" reminded me of the Stephen King chiller ""Thinner"" (1996)where a guy hits an old Gypsy woman with his car and finds himself cursed. Poor Christine cannot sleep with experiencing nightmares and a horned goat-like phantom stalks her at his house. Meanwhile, Christine's sympathetic boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long of ""Live Free or Die Hard"") has trouble trying to figure what has turned his girlfriend into a delusional maniac. Desperate to rid herself of the Gypsy woman's curse, Christine visits a medium. No sooner has a storefront psychic, Rham Jas (newcome Dileep Rau), cradled our heroine's hands in his hands than he realizes that he is out of his element. <br/><br/>Ostensibly, ""Drag Me to Hell"" qualifies as your basic morality horror movie with a couple of surprises, but it remains flatly predictable right to its hellacious ending. Christine gets what she deserves in the last scene. Justin Long does a good job as Christine's long-suffering boyfriend, while Lorna Raver is terrific as the Gyspy woman. The first half of this chiller surpasses the last half. The key to everything in this occasionally frightening fare is a button from Christine's couat. Raimi relies on standard horror practices to turn your skin into goosebumps. People jump out of places that you never expected them to and the sound effects are ramped up loudly enough to make you jump. Interestingly, Raimi opens this minor league chiller with the old 1950's Universal Studios logo instead of the new one. ""Drag Me to Hell"" doesn't have enough hell and contains too much drag."

The twist at the end even though a bit predictable was better then most movies who try to make it a happy ending. There was many opportunities left out that could have added scares, or even something strange. The ""good girl"" turned desperate was I think acted well.

","I just saw this film today and wanted to set down my views while they are still fresh in my mind. This is the third horror film I have seen this year after The Last House On The Left and The Haunting In Conneticut and I think its the best. It has gotten some of the best user ratings on IMDb and some have said that it may go down as a cult classic. Sam Raimi has achieved fame in recent years by directing the very popular ""Spiderman"" franchise, however he started his career directing horror films and returns to his roots so to speak in this one. In fact, a little bit of nostalgia here, they use the old Universal logo from the 1980's before the film starts. Right away the title Drag Me To Hell slaps you in the face. I had never heard of Alison Lohman, but she is definitely a young actress with promise. She plays Christine Brown, a young bank loan officer bucking for a promotion from her boss, played by the noted actor David Paymer, an old Gypsy woman comes to her asking for an extension on her mortgage. To show her boss she has guts, she denies it and the old woman puts a Gypsy curse on her. She will be tormented by an evil spirit for three days and then dragged to hell to burn for all eternity. Boy and I thought I had a bad day at work! I have only seen two other horror movies that really scared me, The Night Of The Living Dead and Pet Semetary and I also add this one. I had genuine chills at various parts of the film. Lorna Raver is chilling as the old Gypsy woman who torments Christine. They really put on the gross makeup. She needed serious dental work! She has got to be the ugliest actress I have ever seen since Anne Ramsey in Throw Mama From the Train. She is one actress that you can say didn't make it because of her looks. The special effects are really awesome especially in the seance scene. I felt like I was on Disneyworld's Haunted Mansion Ride. Raimi uses humor in this film as well. I liked the scene where Christine has a nosebleed from hell all over her boss and the scene where the goat is talking in the seance! I only have two complaints with this film. Raimi goes overboard with gross special effects, like the scene where Christine has a vision of the old Gypsy woman vomiting blood and maggots on her face or where she sees an eye and fly eggs in her cake. Alfred Hitchcock rarely used gory special effects in his films. He was really the master of horror and suspense because he realized that grossness doesn't make a great film. Raimi should have taken note of this. This film could have been just as effective without being gross. Also, I have a problem with the ending SPOILER ALERT MAJOR SPOILER WATCH OUT. Lohman did a very fine job of making Christine seem so real to me. She was basically a decent person. She was a simple farm girl who was a vegetarian who loved animals. She even admitted in the end that it was selfish and wrong of her to deny that old woman. She admitted it was just so she would get a promotion. I sort of knew how this film would end about twenty minutes before the final credits. It all has to do with that envelope. The final scene where she falls off the platform and is dragged into hell forever made me feel like I'd swallowed an ice cream cone whole."

","The latest from Raimi mixes elements of his most notable works, The Evil Dead and Spider-Man trilogies. Luckily there's more Evil Dead here than the latter and Drag Me to Hell didn't disappoint. Although it loses steam about halfway through, the screen writing and fright scenes could already be considered some of the best in it's genre.<br/><br/>Christine (Alison Lohman) is a good-intentioned bank loan officer who we first meet listening to life coaching seminars in her car. ""There is no friction, with the proper diction."" the recording says, and Christine repeats. Tired of being taken advantage of and wanting to get ahead at work, Christine denies a loan extension to the wrong crazy lady who in turn curses her. Lohman (Matchstick Men) does a great job as Christine and even handles lines such as the Campbell -esque , ""I'm gonna get some!"". Justin Long (Live Free, Die Hard), Dileep Rao, and David Paymer (Get Shorty) all turn in admirable performances and round out a great cast.<br/><br/>There was a whole lot more toothless-face-mawing than I was expecting, but the cinematography and special effects are mostly excellent. Raimi sets up many great set-pieces and manages to have only a few odd ones. The horror genre can be tricky though, as there's a thin line between genuinely terrifying and over-the-top. But I guess the only important thing is that I'm slightly more terrified of gypsy curses now than ever before, and that means I just watched a fine horror film.<br/><br/>Final Score – ***1/2"
"Quebec_Dragon","8","1","4","4 June 2009"," Seriously fun horror-comedy or comedy of horrors?
","This is a rare hybrid that manages to be both scary and/or funny depending on the moment. At first I thought it might be a standard scare fest as it starts that way, with perhaps a few comedic moments thrown in throughout to release the tension, but as it went on the madcap antics and gross-out humor took over. It's not a bad thing in itself but viewers should be warned. It felt like a b-movie with a-movie production quality in a big budget ""Evil Dead"" vein. It's not at all in the ridiculous ""Scary movie"" category of horror comedy. The script is too smart for that and the actors play it mostly seriously. The director Sam Raimi basically toys with your emotions making you laugh or jump, sometimes one right after the other. Raimi is very good at exploiting shadows, camera work and sound effects to create frights. He manages to scare you with seemingly inoffensive objects. He makes funny things that shouldn't be funny. Those are not easy things to do and I applaud the clever ways he does so.<br/><br/>There's a lot of fun to be had watching ""Drag me to hell"" and it contains its share of joyous moments provided you have a somewhat dark twisted sense of humor. There are some gory or disgusting moments but nothing particularly extreme. I wish the balance between horror and comedy had stayed more even until the end but a fine line was walked nevertheless. My enjoyment was somewhat diminished by a neighboring girl in the theater spoiling a big twist long beforehand by shouting it to her friend but I shouldn't blame her too much since she seemed so enthusiastic. However, it means I don't really know if that twist is predictable or not but honestly I would think it is. <br/><br/>Rating: 7.5 out of 10"

"DonFishies","8","1","4","31 May 2009"," Not quite Evil Dead IV, but Sam Raimi's return to horror is as ridiculously scary as it is outrageously hilarious
","Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer, looking to score a big promotion. By chance, she ends up serving the clearly sick Mrs. Ganush (Lorna River), who has just been served papers by the bank to repossess her house. Despite promising to try and give the feeble old woman more time to pay the bank back, she tells her nothing can be done. So Mrs. Ganush curses Christine, and as unexplainable events begin to happen, Christine finds out she has three days to save herself before she is literally dragged to hell.<br/><br/>After how enjoyable a throwback the Friday the 13th remake was earlier this year, I had my doubts that I would enjoy another horror movie nearly as much. Of course, I am sure there were many doubts Sam Raimi would ever return to his roots. But Drag Me to Hell does return the legendary cult director back to the genre that first brought him fame, and the results are simply spectacular. I thought I would find some enjoyment from the film, but now wonder why Raimi ever left the genre in the first place.<br/><br/>The film is simply a riot from start to finish. Anyone who ever liked The Evil Dead is in for a real treat with Drag Me to Hell. This is 1980's horror brought back from the dead, and served as ice cold as it gets. The film is unrelenting in its terrifying moments, and gradually becomes more horrific as it goes along. There are some genuinely frightening moments at play here, but just as many hilarious moments at the same time. All of them are played exactly as anyone who knows Raimi's early work would expect – as ridiculous and ludicrous as you never would expect. The film practically one ups itself at every turn, offering one gruesome gag after the other, really pushing the PG-13 rating out much further than anyone could have imagined. But much like its Evil Dead trilogy brethren, the film never borders on being gratuitous. Anyone expecting to see another Saw clone will be greatly disappointed by the film's slapstick, cheap scare style.<br/><br/>Obvious homages aside, the film plays itself out with the many Raimi touches fans have come to appreciate, from the moving stationary objects to the whiplashing camera (although two Raimi mainstays are suspiciously missing). The frantic camera angles are consistent from the opening scene, right until the final frame. While there are no unique, budget-pushing Evil Dead angles, there are still enormities of unique angles staged throughout the film, giving it the lowered budget feel the film needs to work in the current film environment. It knows it is playing with bigger budgeted films, but it never attempts to feel like one of them. Instead, it feels tightly bound, and right on the directive of Raimi's earlier films. Coming off the Spider-Man trilogy, it would have been an easy mistake to make this film more in line with contemporary horror films. But Raimi wisely stuck to a tried and true formula, and its greatness shows in how absurdly entertaining the film quickly becomes.<br/><br/>The makeup (and puppet(!)) effects are all well done, harking back to a time when cheap effects like these were a lot more common in films. But the addition of CGI in certain scenes (especially during one particular ""eye-popping"" scare) just feels lazy on Raimi's part. Why make the film look and feel so low budget, but then add in really needless effects into other scenes? Yes, making these effects into effects similar to Evil Dead's would have looked even sillier than the special effects do here. But at the same time, they stick out noticeably, and look like they should not be anywhere near this film. They do go with the campy feel the film is obviously going for, but that does not give the excuse to make these effects look like they are any more needed than they obviously are not. Some of them are so laughably bad that you may not notice them, but others totally take you out of the movie and feel useless.<br/><br/>Lohman, while a much better choice for this character than the originally cast Ellen Page, delivers a fairly solid performance for someone who is given very little to do outside of scream, be tortured and be constantly looking to continue living her life. She has just the right amount of finesse and gravitas to make the role work without looking like she is deliberately attempting to be campy. She nails her most emotional scenes greatly, and never falters in the role. She just becomes zanier as the film goes on. She is not quite on par with the man himself, Bruce Campbell, but she does a more than adequate job filling his shoes. Justin Long, as her doctorate professor boyfriend, is given even less material to work with, but still manages to pull out some decent work. Wisely, he is given very few lines to be funny with, but the few he does have make for almost as much comedy as the film itself gives. Supporting turns from Dileep Rao, David Paymer, Adriana Barraza and especially Raver are all fairly well done, and work off Lohman quite well. They each get their moments to shine, and do wonderful jobs helping the movie to be as fun as it is.<br/><br/>In the end, if you go in expecting something on the lines of The Evil Dead, then you will love Drag Me to Hell. It is a twistedly awesome return to form from Raimi, with few faults. It is obviously not perfect, but then a movie like this could never have been expected to be. Loaded with plenty of cheap scares and lots of laughs, could you really have hoped for anything better? <br/><br/>8/10.<br/><br/>(An edited version of this review also appeared on http://www.geekspeakmagazine.com)."
"cblakeJoey","9","1","4","31 May 2009"," Sam Raimi, you've still got it!
","To start, Evil Dead 2 is one of my most favorite movie's of all time.<br/><br/>Still, I was very reserved about expecting anything great out of this one. Thinking that Sam and his brother had a little to much time on their hands and wanted to make some extra cash with this. Drag me to Hell was, bottom line, awesome! Again, I wasn't expecting to be impressed but this movie put me in a great mood when I left the theater. This movie isn't an extension of Evil Dead but the trademark Sam Raimi tactics are there: (1) Starts out with a simple scenario, this time with a woman refusing a house loan extension. (2) Shocking scare tactics. With Raimi, the scary stuff never comes with a warning. (3) Squirting blood, possessed animals and flying demon people. This was just fun and great.<br/><br/>Plus, you're never meant to like his main characters (aka, Ash from Evil Dead) but you can at least respect them for what they do to get out of they're predicament.<br/><br/>I'll respect the opinions of people who did not appreciate this film BUT this was a great piece of work to see! Thanks Raimi."
"nl1025","6","1","4","30 May 2009"," All Resident Evil, No Silent Hill
","Who here can say they honestly don't like Sam Raimi films? From the Evil Dead series to Spiderman, Sam has become one of those rare must-see directors in a business sickeningly full of frauds. When I heard he was returning to the horror business after an extended vacation in the mainstream, I was stoked. As it so happens, I was also stoned, just like I was when I finally saw the movie.<br/><br/>Before I go on, I'd like to be clear on this point: Evil Dead 2 was horror, Army of Darkness was most certainly not (though many consider it to be). I was hoping that Raimi would go back to being serious again in DMtH, but this was sadly not the case. It's nice that Sam didn't want this film to be taken seriously, but he literally stole a gag out of the first Naked Gun (Lt. Drebin fighting a hospital pillow off his face) and forced more bad puns into the dialogue than a noobie flamer. Even the nod-wink jokes the movie eventually resorted to fell flat on a silent audience.<br/><br/>Frankly, the Raimis don't write female characters well. Bruce Campbell delivered their notoriously dry, black humor like a champ; but Alison Lohman can't get the job done. They actually tried giving her a few of those Ash-like lines and she came off like Lindsey Lohan threatening her girlfriend in public. I chuckled at the delivery, not the material.<br/><br/>The plot is sub-Scifi dreck. Its not even worth punching holes through because the film never tries to keep a straight face, but it unnecessarily bogs itself down with office politics at her stupid job that nobody could possibly care about. It'd be like if Bill Lumbergh from Office Space constantly interrupted the action in Army of Darkness for absolutely no reason. She actually goes into work the next day after she's attacked and cursed by a disgruntled customer! Listen, if you only have three days before a demon goat swallows you into Hell for all eternity, you don't waste half of them by going into work to kiss your boss's ass for a promotion! The scares are cheap, and the formula old: silence>extremely loud>close-up of something ugly. Its all Resident Evil, no Silent Hill. All ""Boo!"", no ""hmmmmmmm"" (Blair Witch 1 ending holla!). Don't get me wrong, it works a few times; but halfway through the movie you can see 'em coming minutes before they do, which is actually convenient because it gives you time to cover your ears. The score gets obnoxiously loud when it decides you need help being scared because the images and plot can't accomplish it by themselves. I left with a headache, and that bright sun hitting my eyes on the way out while my skull was already pounding felt like sadistic punishment for paying to see this film"
"Neenee-b","8","1","4","30 May 2009"," Dragged to Hell and back
","Sam Raimi has returned to his horror movie roots with Drag me to Hell, a movie staring Alison Lohman as Christine Brown and Justin Long as her college professor boyfriend, annoyingly named Clay. <br/><br/>Christine finds herself playing the quiet, blonde, homely, formerly fat, farm girl now working in a bank role. As she is up for promotion Christine unwisely asserts her new found authority on an elderly woman who has fallen behind on her mortgage payments. Mrs Ganush, (a fantastic Lorna Raver) doesn't take to kindly to her eviction attacks Christine in the bank parking bay and puts a curse on her causing her to be literally dragged down to hell in three days time. <br/><br/>It all seems quite run of the mill but Drag me to Hell is a horror movie that is actually intentionally funny. The fight between Mrs Ganush and Christine in the car is one of the most original and hysterically entertaining fights between two females ever to be shot.<br/><br/>The plot moves on towards more conventional horror movie expectations and if you allow yourself to let go and enjoy the movie all the usual scares and jumps are there. What makes Drag me to Hell stand out is the fact that whilst the scares are happening and the tension is building the outcome is so purposefully full of black humour you cant help but laugh. All this is done without one drop of blood, with the exception of a scene in the bank which was more of a shout-out to past Raimi movies. <br/><br/>The general trend in Hollywood is ""the more gore - the less scares"" and Drag me to Hell used this formula in reverse so well.<br/><br/>The séance and graveyard scenes were so tense yet also so ridiculously bizarre (the talking goat to name but one!) you couldn't help but laugh through your fear.<br/><br/>As with most movies you have to suspend disbelief and as a movie lover I do judge each movie on its own merit and take it for what it is but even my imagination will never be able to believe Justin Long is a professor of psychology. If I had to pick a fault in the movie then that would be it.<br/><br/>I would thoroughly recommend Drag me to Hell. If the recent overindulgence of gorno doesn't do anything for you (it doesn't for me) then this is a solid return to supernatural horror. I would give it an 8/10."
"g-man318","7","1","4","29 May 2009"," Shock shock, horror horror...
","I saw this movie tonight on a spur-of-the-moment decision and thoroughly enjoyed it. <br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of horror films, and I'm not particularly familiar with Raimi's work , so I can't review this as a Raimi film, but I can review it as a film in general.<br/><br/>The concept is simple enough; everyday woman wants to get ahead in life, makes a harsh decision, gets cursed. You pretty much know what you're in for. The ordinary life scenes play out in a pleasant fashion, very reminiscent of the Spiderman series. The production value can really be seen in these scenes. <br/><br/>The best parts of the film, however, are the creepy suspenseful moments just before the obligatory shock. These are superbly set up, especially in the first 2 acts. Simply by employing a subtle camera move, Raimi scoots each and every audience member to the edge of their seats, gripping the closest thing to them. Then the shocking element comes. This, I feel, is where the film loses it. The first few shocks are genuinely terrifying (I won't spoil anything, but hold onto your hair when you see it ;)). After the first few though, it just gets silly. They use the same technique of a loud noise and shoving something very close to the camera. This technique is almost guaranteed to get a rise out of the audience, but could technically be executed using a rubber ducky and have the same effect.<br/><br/>Other reviewers have commented on the use of humour in this film, and how it's faithful to Raimi's comedy. I, however, found it cheap and that it ruined the atmosphere. There was one scene in which our heroine is battling the old woman. She looks up to see an anvil precariously suspended above her head. The anvil hits the woman and her eyes fly out of her skull towards the main character in a very Road Runner-esquire manner....no really!<br/><br/>The biggest downfall to this film was the long list of plot holes and 'Why didn't she just..' moments. I don't think this was aided by the acting, which in my honest opinion, was dreadful. Alison Lohman makes for an annoying, whiney lead character for which I had no sympathy. She seemed more involved with her work promotion than the demon ready to relieve her of her soul within the next couple of days. Dileep Rao, who plays the spiritual adviser, cannot be taken seriously after his first couple of lines. I thought that Lorna Raver actually pulled off the gypsy hag quite well. <br/><br/>I could go on about this film and some of its pitfalls all night, but seens as I've already bored my friends, I think I'll conclude;<br/><br/>I enjoyed it a lot, don't expect 'The Ring' style creepy horror, think jumpy shock horror. Oh, and sleep with the light on!<br/><br/>-Ben"
"McQualude","7","1","4","29 May 2009"," Not up to snuff with the Evil Dead series but a good film
","Just got back and I love Raimi's dark sense of humor, I laughed all the way through the film. Even when people around me were jumping or cringing I was giggling, except during some of the gross out stuff. The boo scares were too predictable to be scary and the sounds were very bright, painful at times like the sound of a dentist's drill, there was no bass to speak of in my viewing. Very well constructed, well shot. Lohman's acting was the film's weakness, she couldn't sell it. I kept thinking Rachel Miner would have been better, same face, same qualities, better actress. Justin Long (stereotypically) was underused. Lorna Raver was perfectly cast. Dileep Rao was interesting although the role wasn't stretching his abilities. Highly recommended to horror fans and especially Raimi fans."

"C-Younkin","5","3","25","27 May 2009"," I thought this was supposed to be scary
","For all the loan officers expecting another scare to go with their economy woes, rest assured, Sam Raimi's trip back to horror won't send you running for your mommies. Raimi likes to combine humor and gore and from what I understand, ""The Evil Dead"" trilogy is considered classic for it's great combination of the two. There are people who love the Raimi brand although after watching ""Drag Me to Hell"", I can honestly say that I'm not one of them. This is campy horror, with more of an emphasis on cornball than on actual scares.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman plays Christine Brown, a loan officer fighting for a promotion from her boss Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), but continuing to come up short in the male-dominated office. She is told that she needs to show she can make the tough calls so when an old gypsy woman named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) asks her for a third extention on her mortgage, Christine denies her, sending the old woman into hysterical begging. Christine just shrugs her off, insulting her. That night in the parking garage, Ganush gets her revenge, pulling the young girl out of her car and placing a hex on her. Thinking Ganush is just a crazy old bitch, Christine tries to forget all about it but it doesn't take long for her to realize that the curse is real. She starts to see strange, haunting things, even a deformed Ganush keeps appearing in her dreams. Her college professor boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) doesn't believe her and neither does her boss. Her only source of help comes from Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a psychic who explains to her that she has been cursed and is being tortured for three days by the demon Lamia before being dragged into hell for all eternity.<br/><br/>Raimi prefers going the over the top route. His scare tactics include letting the screen go very quiet before turning the soundtrack up to a deafening level. It's not so much scary as it is repetitive and irritating. Plus what were watching is all just ridiculous. Take the scene where Ganush attacks Christine. The two women staple and knock each other around in a moving car that bounces off other cars in a parking lot, the scene mirroring something out of a "" Three Stooges"" script more than anything ""Stephen King-ish."" There is also a séance scene with a lot of silly looking special effects (one a talking goat) and another scene where Christine is attacked by a haunted scarf. Things squeak, rattle, bang, and creak for dramatic effect. And Raimi doesn't stop there. Just cause the flick is PG-13 doesn't mean you can't be disgusting. Projectile vomit, spit-up, a gushing nose bleed, dentures, poor hygiene, flies, and various other mouth-related incidents are used to increase the gross-meter every couple minutes. Lohman is a trooper. Raimi throws all the torture he can at her and she takes it with equal parts dread and strength, easily being one of the best horror heroines to come around in a while. Long is always nice to see but believing him as a college professor? No way.<br/><br/>""Drag Me to Hell"" really fails in it's scares though. They're cartoonish, PG-13 rated, and more funny than they are scary. They fall in the genre of comedy-horror, one that I don't have much experience with and hope not to have more of in the future. This movie reminded me of Eddie Murphy's try at this type of genre in ""Vampire in Brooklyn"" and I consider that movie to be one of the worst I've ever seen. The story here is thankfully a bit better but it's still not really worth caring about, which only leaves the guilty pleasures. And those only come if you like your scares in the laughable variety."

","This review is done by someone who's watched MANY horror movies.<br/><br/>This movie overall had a good concept although the way it was delivered was funny more than anything else. The effects were so corny and bad and the main actress' acting was really poor as well as the psychic's. They both looked like they weren't taking anything seriously and were on the verge of smiling or laughing the entire time, which took away from the seriousness of the movie.<br/><br/>The overall atmosphere was comedic more than anything, which is disappointing when you're expecting a horror movie. I was honestly pretty bored throughout the movie and by halfway I really wanted it to be over. The movie's very predictable, especially the end. No clue what's up with people saying it was excellent blah blah I'm thinking they were paid or something to write a positive review.<br/><br/>Seriously this movie was kind of a waste of time which is disappointing.

I get that it may not be that kind of horror film, and that's fine, but it's too campy and dumb for me. The acting is mediocre for the most part and the script is more or less predictable. The ending is foreshadowed a bit with a twist that's the 'surprise' ending, but it simply feels like a cheap trick on par with the Final Destination movies which are utter garbage. The primary spoiler in this is, the lead kills her kitten which ends up being in vain. Humans are one thing to mess with, but I draw the line at animals, especially cute little furry ones. Not my cup of tea, but if Raimi, or campy, stupid horror, is your thing then give it a shot."

Somehow, there were remakes of older films and extremely hard, partly unnecessary violence in ""Horror""-movies has been performed that marked the film course anyway or even made any sense. With ""Drag Me To Hell"" Sam Raimi succeeded again to create a film that shows a very strong cult potential. Beside the ingenious SFX, which really fit to the ""hell ride"" the film also presents a lot funny stuff! Along the actual happening there are many funny scenes which put a smile on the viewer's face at one moment and abruptly scare again at the other moment.

I went into this expecting a fun, funny, somewhat scary ride, but what i got was an intense, terrifying, disturbing, and somewhat depressing spectacle that i found lingered with me. This is beyond edge of you're seat viewing, it's sit as far back in you're seat as possible for fear that something's going to get you. Not only was this scary but it was nerve-racking, because you never knew what was going to happen exactly until the very end of the movie. There were definitely a lot of moments that i get were funny and outlandish, but to me the film had such a scary, menacing, anticipating tone that all that humor just didn't sink in. All i could think about was how scary this film is. From the very first scene you get strapped into a roller coaster you want to jump out of but at the same time you have to see the end. I thought about walking out a ton of different times but i didn't because i had to see the end. Bottom line, if you see Drag Me to Hell, get ready to see a high quality production, but also be ready to experience feelings of depression and paranoia days after you see it.<br/><br/>And if you ever find a green button just lying on the sidewalk, run away as fast as you can."

","Drag Me To Hell was a truly unique horror movie met all expectations and exceeded them. The trailers really just made the movie look bad, but the movie itself has so much humor that really needs to be seen to be believed. At any point during the movie, I never felt that this was a watered down film. It's not the type of movie where people are dying every few minutes and doesn't need the gore or the R-rating. The movie was actually truly scary and I can't even say that about some of the slashers that came out this year. Any movie that makes you jump just when they show the title and begin the opening credits is just amazing. Also, the movie ended at the best place to end it and never went on for too long. I had a better time with Drag Me To Hell then I did with Up, but Up was still great. It's just a special treat to have two great movies in one weekend because there's definitely been a post-trek drought."

"thesar-2","5","1","5","31 May 2009"," Dragged to Hell
","Though it was nice to see Raimi return to his true roots after all-but selling out to 'Spider-Man' with 'Drag Me to Hell,' unfortunately, this really appeared to be an overlong 'Tales from the Crypt' episode. Sure, that's not necessary a bad thing; it's always nice to get that feeling again when we were kids/young adults growing up on such horror classics such as 'Crypt' or Raimi's 'Evil Dead' series. (And before I move on, I would like to clarify, I really did like Spidey 1/2, but comparatively speaking, most of Raimi's best work is with horror/suspense, such as: 'A Simple Plan.') In 'Hell' we have bank employee yearning for a promotion over an eager new employee. She has other life problems, but none as great as the curse an old gypsy woman bestows upon her after she denies a third extension on her foreclosing home, in order to lock in the promotion. For three days, legend states, she will be tormented and then, literally dragged to hell. Unless, of course, she can find one of many loopholes. What I liked about 'Hell' is the head-on obvious horror movie clichés, not attempting to hide, but embracing them, never taking itself too seriously. And sure most of the film was for shock/scare value, vomit and other liquids poured into her mouth, etc.<br/><br/>But, as always there's holes: woman waits 40 years for another chance at defeating the main demon, however charges the main character $10,000 she doesn't have for the séance. That's like getting hired for the job you really wanted and asking the interviewer, ""Are you sure you made the right choice?"" Also, if she truly is the vegetarian she claimed to be, how come she made that cake with eggs? Isn't that considered murder? I'm not sure, since I'm a meat eater, but isn't even cracking eggs, or worse, beating them, kind of harsh on what could've been a life? And the closing climax was obvious 20 minutes prior, so it takes awhile to see what we already know what's coming. Still, recommended for the demon-horror movie fans.<br/><br/>Side note: My job at work is to help people save homes. I was laughing out loud prior to this movie, as it very well could've been a five minute movie (including opening and closing credits) as if just that bank employee simply referred the gypsy over to my agency or a similar HUD certified housing counseling company. The lady would avoid the curse, the gypsy would've continued her black magic alone at home, the bank would've profited. Everyone wins. Well, except the audience that spent 10+ dollars on a five-minute film. This is probably the reason I've never been invited to Hollywood studio board meetings. Well, probably."

","25yr Male from Detroit, MI --- Based on pure scares, lead performances and overall movie experience, Drag Me To Hell is by far the best PG-13 horror movie I've ever seen. Wasn't sure what to expect out of this film but love Raimi's Army of Darkness and this movie far exceeded all of my expectations. There were so many tense scenes, random scares that made me jump, and hilarious over the top campy gore scenes. This movie is an absolute thrill-ride from beginning to end. Don't be swayed by the comedic aspect of this movie everyone keeps talking about. Yes, there are some laughs but this is a horror picture and I thought the comedy was very skillfully placed. I absolutely loved Alison Lohman in the lead role she seemed to really give this performance her all. The witch villain is disgusting and terrifying and awesome. The only PG-13 horror movie I could even begin to compare with this is the Ring which is an entirely different type of horror movie and really can't be compared. I had a great time seeing this movie it is faced paced, highly entertaining, very scary, visually stimulating, and certainly one of the best horror movies to come out in quite some time."

","First, let me start by saying that I'm a huge fan of Evil Dead, I must have watch this movie, too many times. I know the genre, horror/comedy with gore and cheese. Now, Drag Me To Hell is using the same formula, but in a real PG-13 movie, meaning that it's toned down a little.<br/><br/>I did not find the movie to be too loud, like others have said here. The sounds used is supposed to be loud because it's the ""horrific"" factor, it's supposed to scare you. You have gore and goo, but not as much as you would think, not at the level of Evil Dead. Judging by the people in the theater I was, their was 3-4 good laugh moment during the movie and NO, you don't jump on your seat every 30 seconds unless you're THAT easy to scare.<br/><br/>The killer for this movie is the ending. If you have $.02 cent of a brain, you'll know 10 minutes before the end what's going to happen. Yeah, wrong envelope. And even if those last 10 minutes are quite fun to watch, you can't keep from being bummed to know that all those efforts are in vain.<br/><br/>I was expecting more of this movie and well, sometime it did Drag a little, and it's going to be rated 6/10. It's good, but could have been much better. I'm going to hope for a better Evil Dead 4."

","Sam Raimi, for those who've never heard of him, is a cult director. To general audiences, his Spider-Man movies are probably the most recognizable, but to his hard-core fans, the ultra-gory ""Evil Dead"" flicks (in which a sarcastic everyman battles malevolent spirits) are the best.<br/><br/>With ""Drag Me to Hell"", Raimi returns to what he does best. This movie is certainly a lot more refined even than ""Army of Darkness"", but no less cool. True, it follows typical horror flick formula - bad thing happened several years ago and a remnant of the horrific event is terrorizing people today - but I just love the sorts of things that Raimi is willing to show here (I would hate to have to be Alison Lohman's character in some of those scenes). ""DMTH"" is destined to become a horror classic! Also starring Justin Long, David Paymer and Adriana Barraza (Brad Pitt and Cate Blanchett's maid in ""Babel"")."

Here we saw from this movie that hell (heaven?) is just like this world on earth that good guys are punished, bad guys with dirty mind live long.<br/><br/>Since the plot of the movie is quite straightforward, that is to scare prepared audiences, it did well in that sense.

There are many jumpy scenes. It is also quite schlocky however, with puke scenes and one scene where Chritine has a bloody nose and sprays it all over her boss. The movie goes for comic thrills. Mixing horror with comedy, much like The Evil Dead movies. Is this a return to form for Raimi? Not quite. It does not have the adult humour of the Evil Dead films. It does try however but the Raimi brothers opting for a more universal audience with, perhaps his new found Spider Man clientèle following his moves, makes for less in the way of genuine horror.

Paranormal forces are of great interest to the audience and many of the general public believe them; this film just made the concept of paranormal look tacky.

","Drag Me to Hell . . . From the Director of ""The Evil Dead Trilogy,"" is EXACTLY what the movie you're interested in seeing or have seen already is. The Evil Dead movies weren't very scary; not scary to the point of having to check under your bed or putting a chair up to the closet door or sleeping with the lights on at least. The Evil Dead movies are movies that are unlike ANY HORROR MOVIES ""out there"" because of the incredibly inventive genius at work behind and in front of the camera. Inventiveness seems to come from young, fresh malleable minds where neurons are still differentiating and areas of the cerebral landscape haven't yet been discovered. With age, the brain like, the body begins to calcify; it becomes MUCH HARDER to come-up with WACKY new things to put up on the screen. Drag Me to Hell is The Evil Dead without the (literally) GALLONS OF BLOOD and the grim, suffocating NIGHT OF THE LIVING DEAD feel. Drag Me to Hell feels like Sam Raimi loved The Grudge, The Grudge 2, The Ring, and The Ring 2 and thought (with his maturing and more world wary mind) it would be great to have another short-cute blonde-haired girl caught-up in the middle of ""scary"" ""chaotic"" ""spiritually traumatic"" pretense. Even though the ""short-cute, blond-haired girl"" in The Ring and The Ring 2 actually had black hair (actually Jennifer Connelly made-up to look slightly Asian in ethnicity for sake of argument), the ""short-cute blonde-haired –girl"" characters and their dark-haired boyfriends are ALL COMPLETELY Interchangeable. Despite the classic ""Sam Raimi Moments"" (Wacky Editing, Dancing Evil Dead Monsters, and classic JUMP moments), Drag Me to Hell can also be integrated with The Ring and The Grudge movies . . . possibly the Best Title for: Drag Me To Hell would be: ""The Grudge 3--a Ring Sequel: The Button."" I feel very bad about getting ripped-off by Drag Me to Hell. At least Joe Lo Duca's deeply visceral musical style can still be heard amid Christopher Young's credited score and KNB's special effects are always awesome. Even though there are only N and B and no K here. And there's a face that I missed; and the whole movie seems so empty without the face. Sam Raimi movies could not be the best Sam Raimi movies without the face and the chin present. The Face and The Chin are dear old friends to Sam Raimi movies and I am sad that I missed The Face with The Chin. SAM RAIMI better do The Evil Dead: Redux and include The Face with The Chin as the main character."

","Evidently, many people liked this film. I think I know why. But before I talk about that, let me talk about why I didn't like it. Lorna Raver plays an old woman who is evicted from her house by a loan officer played by Alison Lohman. In an act of revenge, the old woman places a curse on the hapless loan officer that not only ensures a string of bad luck in the following days, but eventually promises to ""drag her to hell."" She tries to convince her boyfriend (played by Justin Long)--a college professor of psychology who seems to have a really crass undergraduate understanding of Freud--that something supernatural is afoot. Of course, the man of science rejects her suspicions, so she turns to an ""eastern seer"" (*groan*) played by Dileep Rao to try and lift the curse before it's too late.<br/><br/>From the moment that the old woman appeared in the film, I could tell the film would be bad. Lorna Raver's performance reproduces and combines the worst possible stereotypes about Gypsy/Romani people in North American culture. I didn't find it ""offensive"" (which at least would have been something...), I just found it stupid. This kind of ""aiming for....but completely missed..."" was characteristic of the entire film. Moments in the film meant to be funny or scary were neither—-they usually just ended up being dumb and blatantly obvious or predictable. Thus, the film should be properly categorized not as ""fright comedy"" but as ""epic fail trash."" Now, some people will scream ""OMFG! But it's written and directed by Sam Raimi!"" Yes, and? Isn't that the same guy who butchered The Grudge and The Grudge II? To them I say: If you like something that promises to be really formulaic, replete with well recycled cinema devices aimed to produce cheap thrills, believes the function of film is to perpetuate offensive racial stereotypes, and enjoy being told to laugh on cue like the studio audience on some 80's sitcom, then this might be the film for you."

Upon learning this, Christine asks the fortune teller to assist in ridding her of this curse, but will they be able to do this in time?<br/><br/>In many ways Drag Me To Hell is a good film and I can see why it has proven popular with a lot of people; Raimi generally ensures that the film is a pacey affair and it's very rare that we see moments where something isn't happening to set the pulse racing or to keep your eyes glued to the screen. This is particularly evident at the start and end of the film, but there are also moments dotted throughout the middle section of the film showing Christine's increasingly erratic behaviour that ensure the film does not sit still long enough to ever become boring. However...<br/><br/>The problem I had with Drag Me To Hell is that I felt that not enough was really done with the concept; if you compare this film to a film like Thinner (another film where someone is cursed by a gypsy) there is considerably more narrative progression in Thinner in that you can physically see the effects of the curse on the individual and due to the alarming way that the protagonist lost weight I found Thinner to be satisfying from a narrative perspective. In Drag Me To Hell however, it just doesn't have the same feel to it; Christine's behaviour is affected and she starts to have strange visions, but shouldn't a curse have some physical repercussions on its victim? It just doesn't happen here and it's disappointing that the overall narrative is so threadbare; Raimi has clearly gone for shock and entertainment over a decent story which I'm sure will work for a lot of folks. For me though because I found the story to be a little weak it did mean that the film dragged at times; thankfully Raimi doesn't allow this to happen too often which is why the film isn't getting a lower score.<br/><br/>Although Drag Me To Hell is quite entertaining, the film is guilty of overdoing things at times with some scenes coming across as more silly than scary (the scene where they conjure up the Lamia being one such example). There is one scene where Clay invites Christine to meet his stuck-up parents which felt unnecessary and added nothing to the film.<br/><br/>Clearly Raimi has gone for entertainment and some OTT special effects over a well-crafted and intriguing story so if you're happy with the former elements then go right ahead as you will certainly enjoy this film. However, if you're expecting to see a terrifying film with a strong and compelling story then you may find yourself a little disappointed."

","I watched this movie years ago and it was so disappointing. I saw it again this week just to see if my opinion was still the same. It is. Really Sam Raimi? It's like he just ditched all of his creativity from Evil Dead II and Army of Darkness and decided to be OK with being mediocre. Anyone who finds this movie scary would be scared at low budget made-for-TV ""SyFy"" movies. Pathetic."

","In the 1980s, a different, low-budget film full of dark humor and innovation emerged, resulting in a rapture of a legion of fans from around the world. EVIL DEAD - DEMON DEATH is one of the great horror classics, respected by everyone, whether it's professional critics or loyal fans of terror. Its director, Samuel Marshall Raimi, better known as Sam Raimi, can be considered a master of horror, along with other well-known names like Wes Craven and John Carpenter, for making one of the most fantastic trilogies in history - that's right, The film EVIL DEAD had two sequels entitled AN EXCELLENT NIGHT 2 and 3, both as good as those responsible for their origins. Unfortunately, Sam Raimi after the EVIL DEAD series was no longer successful before, until in 2000, more than 7 years later, he was directed to direct one of the most lucrative comic book series: Spider-Man was a box office hit. all over the world, making Raimi lift one of Hollywood's most enviable fortunes !!! After so much success, the director decided to honor the genre that opened its doors: horror. Sam Raimi goes back to ancient times and provides fans with a splendid and fun production: DRAG ME TO HELL.<br/><br/>Christine works for a bank in the credit industry and is about to be promoted as an assistant manager. One day an old gypsy appears, about to be knocked out of the house, as her mortgage is about to expire. The poor lady then asks for a deadline to finance her home, but Christine denies the request to impress her boss and win the long-awaited job. But in the midst of it all the old gypsy throws a terrible curse on Christine: the mighty demon Lamia, responsible for bringing the souls of her victims to the depths of hell within 3 days. And it is in this short span of days that Christine runs out of time to escape such a curse as she is terrified by the damn demon.<br/><br/>Without ever losing his talent, it is with this simple and seemingly unremarkable story that Raimi terrifies the viewer with sometimes disgusting, sometimes fun, sometimes scary scenes. The apparitions of the demon Lamia, even if only made in shadows, can scare yes, especially the child audience (as censorship put him at the age of 13, I doubt that children who came to check on him were free of nightmares at bedtime ). From apparitions we go to the big and best time of all: the attack on Christine's gypsy parking lot. Poor Christine is surprised by the old woman in the backseat of her car. The old woman attacks her in a horrendous way, entitled to 'jerks' of hair and vomiting, spat and even stapled in the face. And so it does not stop !!! During the projection of the film we still have an exaggerated nosebleed and flies and worms over Christine everywhere!<br/><br/>But all this would not work if Raimi had not chosen a cast with talent and charisma to give. Alison Lohman, who plays Christine, is quite a heroine, winning all the sympathy one can get. Already Lorna Raver, the witch Sylvia Ganush, surprises in a first-rate performance when facing a not so easy character (I forgot to say that the old gypsy looks disgusting: she is blind in one eye, her teeth and nails are rotten and her skin it's an amazing wrinkle). A plus point is also the terrifying soundtrack !!!<br/><br/>Raimi finally breaks free from the geeky cobwebs of Peter Parker, and returns to his roots making a movie as entertaining as his first son EVIL DEAD."

","I remember being so excited to see the latest Sam Raimi film, expecting something along the lines of Evil Dead, in terms of mixing horror and comedy. But what those films had that this film really misses - is a good lead actor/actress. Could they have found a more wooden actress with Alison Lohman? She was so unsympathetic, that I didn't care what was happening to her.
And speaking to what was happening to her, it was like watching Thinner, but with a haunting angle. And the jump scares were too repetitive. In fact, much of this movie felt cliched.
But I still go back to the main reason why this film doesn't work - Alison Lohman. She didn't have the charisma or sense of comic timing the way Bruce Campbell had. I'm not sure why Raimi picked her to be the lead.
Anyway, Drag Me To Hell is a movie that really should have a lower IMDB rating, I think people feel sorry for it, hence some of the higher scores. It's a dull, unscary, unfunny movie."

","Firstly, allow me to say I thought the role of Christine Brown was way too big and demanding for Alison Lohman and she simply couldn't pull it off convincingly. Apart from this total miscast, the film was indeed very enjoyable. The visual effects are excellent, to say the least! Very eerie at times. As the film progresses, it becomes more humorous than scary, especially the sacrifice ritual with medium Shaun San Dena, which is a bit silly actually. Having said this, though, this is typical of a Sam Raimi film. The film then returns to scary for the final, and I must say I loved the movie's final moment! I did find Christine's curse a bit harsh, though, considering her only crime was refusing a loan agreement (again). If she caused the death of a loved one, I could understand the curse, or if she caused severe bodily harm or trauma to Mrs Ganush. But she didn't. The whole competing for the assistant manager position was also done very amateurishly and quite childish. In closing, I must admit I enjoyed the film in general."

","'Drag Me to Hell' is far and above one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen (and I've seen a lot). I first saw it in the cinema as a teenager but didn't remember much about it so decided to re-watch it. Upon my second viewing I realised why I didn't remember anything about it - there's nothing worth remembering! <br/><br/>This movie is hideous from start to finish. The attempts to shock are funny rather than scary (although there are some sites that categorise this as a comedy-horror, so perhaps that's its intention?) and the plot is so over-done and cliche that it's barely worth watching.<br/><br/>The lead, Christine, is annoying and impossible to sympathise with. Before it's even half way through I found myself wishing she would die already just to save myself from the pain. This is concerning, since she's actually not a bad person and the curse that's placed upon her is done for a rather stupid reason, in my opinion. <br/><br/>I was so bored that I stopped paying attention during parts, but the ending scene really was the cherry on top. The awful CGI really was laughable and just re-affirmed to me how stupid this whole movie was. I have no idea how this has got above a 3 star rating, because even that's generous."

","Christine Brown is an aspiring banker who refuses to grant credit to an old gypsy woman who can't make her house payments. Big mistake - the nasty old woman places a curse on Christine, and in three days a demon will come to drag her to hell ...<br/><br/>This gleefully nutty and highly enjoyable little horror movie is a groovy return to their roots for Evil Dead auteur Raimi and producer Robert Tapert. It's wonderful to see that a filmmaker can swap a two-hundred-and-fifty million dollar budget back down to a mere thirty million and still have a lot of fun. If the movie has one weakness it's that the story is a little slight, but it has plenty of amusing twists and both the pacing and the character / loony-toon situations are balanced just right. Lohman suffers horrific indignities (usually involving unpleasant things administered orally) but keeps plugging away so we root for her, whilst Raver has a whale of a time as the ever-increasingly horrific Mrs Ganush (her teeth exploits alone are worth seeing). The realisation of the Lamia demon is wonderful as a shadowy goat-like monster who seems to twist reality and enjoy tormenting victims more than capturing them. All its scenes are memorable, especially a hair-curling seance and a hilarious Wile E Coyote setup in Christine's garage. There's also a fabulous score by Christopher Young to accompany these scenes, which is real Old School Orchestral Horror - all Romany violins, choral harmonies, discordant sound and driving rhythms. A good scary movie uses all of cinema's techniques - photography, editing, sound, music - and when done well, as is the case here, is a deliciously exciting and visceral experience. Written by Raimi and his sensible older brother Ivan (who also wrote Darkman and Army Of Darkness) - fans of the director can also spot his trusty 1973 Oldsmobile Delta 88 in a prominent role as Mrs Ganush's car. A great little demonic horror flick, this would make an excellent double-bill with Jacques Tourneur's similarly themed but fifty years older cult classic Night Of The Demon."

","From director Sam Raimi (The Evil Dead, Spider-Man), I was told by someone that this was rubbish, but the critics praised it with four stars out of five, and I was up for a possibly over the top scary movie. Basically, the film opens in 1969 Pasadena, California with a boy being attacked by unseen forces. Medium Shaun San Dena (Flor De Maria Chahua) attempts to stop the evil spirits from dragging him to hell, but she is unsuccessful, the ground opens up with a fiery blaze and the boy is taken, the medium knows she will encounter these forces again. In present day, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) is bank loan officer hoping for a promotion to assistant manager instead of co-worker Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee), and Jim Jacks (David Paymer), her boss, advises she demonstrates making tough decisions to get it. One day, she encounters elderly woman Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) who wants an extension on her mortgage payment, despite failing to pay it a couple of times. Christine is first empathetic, but decides to deny her request to prove herself to her boss. The woman gets on her knees and begs, but is still denied, and then she attempts to attack Christine and is taken out. In the parking lot, Mrs. Ganush returns and again tries to attack Christine, and during the struggle she tears off a button from Christine's coat, she places a curse on the owner of the coat, i.e. Christine, as revenge, and then she disappears. Christine is concerned for her safety, and despite some criticism from her boyfriend, Clay Dalton (Justin Long), the two of them visit fortune teller Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), and he has a terrifying vision and confirms she has been cursed. Following a horrific attack by an invisible evil force, Christine is shaken up, but returns to work. There, she gets frustrated with Stu and suddenly has a nose bleed, but this turns projectile and soaks her boss in blood, and while she runs away Stu takes an important file that would be likely to get her the promotion. Christine decides to confront Mrs. Ganush at the house to be taken, and have the curse lifted from her, but she finds the old woman has died and a wake is being held. She turns to Rham Jas, he explains that being the owner of the button, powerful demon Lamia will haunt her for the next three days before she will taken to hell. He suggests she could sacrifice an animal to appease the demon. Following another savage attack, and desperate to stop them, she kills her pet kitten, which breaks her heart. Christine has dinner with Clay's parents, father Leonard (Chelcie Ross) and mother Trudy (American Pie's Molly Cheek). There, the spirit still torments her, and frightens the Daltons. Christine again goes to Rham Jas, and he says Shaun San Dena (Adriana Barraza), now elderly, is willing to risk her life and exorcise the demon, but at the price of $10,000. Following more attacks, and knowing she believes strongly in what is happening, Clay pays the fee. The séance goes ahead, the woman manages to pull the demon from Christine's body into her own, the spirit speaking vows it will never stop until Christine dies. The spirit is then transported into a goat, but San Dena's assistant Milos (Kevin Foster) fails to kill it, becoming possessed himself. The séance ends, and San Dena dies in the process, Rham Jas explains the spirit was only banished until the next day. He seals the cursed button in an envelope and says that she could give it to someone else to become their possession, the curse will then pass to that person. Christine thinks of giving it to Stu as revenge for stealing her job, but meeting him being tearful and pathetic she changes her mind. But the fortune teller says it may be possible to eliminate the curse giving the button to a dead body, so she goes to the grave Mrs. Ganush, as ""the soul never dies"". Despite a torrential downpour, and the dug up grave flooding, she is successful in shoving the envelope in the corpse's mouth before the dawn. The film ends with Christine happy to have been promoted, following Stu explaining that an important file was stolen and Stu has been fired. She buys herself a new coat in celebration, and Clay is waiting at Los Angeles Union Station ready to propose to her. Surprised by her new coat, Stu reveals finding the envelope and cursed button in the car. Christine is horrified and walks backwards, falling onto the tracks, the ground opens up and she is dragged screaming to the fiery depths of hell. Also starring Bojana Novakovic as Ilenka Ganush. Lohman is a good choice to play the lead victim being tortured mentally and psychologically until the truly savage ending, Long is likeable as the non-believer, and Raver as the disgusting old crone attacking and haunting is a character you love to hate. The story is good and traditional with many elements reminding you of a 1950s scary movie, with great stylish music, inventive camera-work, great moments to disgust, especially the old villain and a fly in the girl's stomach, and a fantastic feeling of unending doom and terror, it a great fun supernatural horror thriller. Very good!"

","I'm a huge fan of the Evil Dead movies so I was looking forward to seeing this, albeit some time after release. I sat through the first 50 minutes and then gave up. This movie was slow and boring. It starts off with a fairly clichéd opening scene/back story but I don't mind a bit of cliché with my popcorn, not all movies are original after all. As the halfway mark of the movie came and went I began to wonder why I was still watching it - even if this movie had the greatest ending of all time, I was going to be too comatose to see it. I don't mind flashbacks, and I don't mind cheesy plots, or faux scares but I DO mind a movie that seems to say 'wait just wait, this is going to be really good' and then never delivers."

","I really wanted to like this movie, but it is just horrible. I like Justin Long a lot (Accepted is my favourite movie by a long shot), but this movie just has nothing going for it. Sure, the characters are likable, but the premise fails miserably. If there are going to be curses, there needs to be an explanation. I really doubt an old lady is going to curse someone just because of reposession. I would think there would be a lot bigger worries than that.<br/><br/>Scares are predictable at best. The problem is the story just doesn't meld well. There's no plot except for Christine trying to ward off a curse. If there was more explanation about how the curse works, much earlier, the plot may have been mildy enticing; without a scientific explanation, I feel lost watching this movie. The intro feels cheesy. Why is a woman being dragged to Hell? Why not somewhere else? Why don't they just disappear? If there's going to be supernatural causes, they need explanations. That's how I feel anyway.<br/><br/>I suppose the whole story could be much more interesting if the director had taken a ""beautiful mind"" approach. The entire movie, we could be aware of the illusions Christine is having.<br/><br/>I really didn't understand this movie. I don't get a kick out of watching excorcisms, demons, people being dragged to hell, and this most certainly isn't scary; at best, Drag me to Hell is laughable. There is nothing scary here.<br/><br/>1 out of 10 for a bad movie."

"Leofwine_draca","5","0","1","15 December 2012"," Raimi's return to his Evil Dead roots
","DRAG ME TO HELL sees Sam Raimi attempting to update his EVIL DEAD formula to the modern era, reinventing it as a teen-friendly comic horror about an unsuspecting bank worker who becomes a victim of a witch's curse. It sounds entertaining, and you'd think it would be easy for a man who once made it his job to bring fresh, energetic horror to our cinema screens.<br/><br/>Sadly, time has passed, and nowadays the formula seems a little stale. Raimi relies far too much on CGI in this movie, so that most of the (frequent) scare scenes are fake-looking and cartoonish; sometimes making this look like a Looney Tunes cartoon done via live action. I'd much have preferred practical effects, because then the film wouldn't have been so cheesy and laughable.<br/><br/>The mood is all over the place, too. The witch's curse storyline has real potential to be interesting, but none of the scare scenes work, mainly because Raimi goes for the gross-out over the genuinely spooky. There's a kind of infantile relish in watching a toothless old crone slobbering over her victim that makes me wonder what exactly he was thinking of. Playing it straight would have worked far better, I think.<br/><br/>The cast is nothing to write home about, with performances ranging from the pantomime (Dileep Rao) to the decent (David Paymer). As the heroine, Alison Lohman tries very hard to convince, although she does fail to elicit much sympathy. The pacing's good, though, and there are plenty of set-pieces and jump-in-your-seat moments, so undemanding horror fans might find themselves entertained regardless. Sometimes, though, Raimi goes too far; take the goat scene: just what on earth was he thinking?"

","I'm not a huge fan of Sam Raimi, with the exception of the Spider-Man trilogy, I tend to stay away from his movies, but something ""dragged"" me to this movie.

The premise was interesting - young woman refuses to help an old gypsy woman and gets cursed by said old woman. However, I got none of the scares or the laughs, what I got was a predictable and frustrating load of tosh that had every horror flick cliché ever devised; the windows suddenly bursting open, the spectre behind the curtain, the cursed objects, the rituals etc, etc, the list goes on and on, even the ending is clichéd and predictable.

","I may have seen just one too many horror films, or one to few.<br/><br/>OK, the old lady started off as being real creepy, a very good feature that could have been played as the ace in the hole. Instead? She spent the entire film vomiting gore out of her mouth into others' mouths. How lovely, thanks for that! Now I'm not a gore fan, not one bit. And even if I were - this was the toilet humor level of gore. Plain filth with no art what so ever.<br/><br/>OK, story is nice, in its own predictable non original juvenile way. There have been enough films that dealt with curses and evil spirits, this has to be the worst I've seen. Even the so-called ""moral"" of the story is self righteous and condescending... cheap. Very cheap. Not karma, but self indulgence. <br/><br/>The only times you might find yourself frightened is when the oldest cheap shot cheat in the book is played - something happens quickly and suddenly and loud audio forces you to twitch. Like a 13 year old bringing a wild card to a Texas Hold'em table.<br/><br/>Now, the grand finale - the """"""twist"""""". So obvious, so predictable, so insultingly blunt... next time try putting a little more work to the story writing, Raimi bros, instead of blowing through 30 million dollars on corny Michael Bay effects. This wasn't supposed to be an action film with explosions and fire, it was supposed to be horror, as in scary, as in good.<br/><br/>I apologize, this review didn't come out objective. That's only because I will never get 99 minutes back, and am both frustrated and disappointed. I wouldn't mind a low level twist, I'd even prefer no twist at all than such a lame one. Maybe a 12 year old watching the first Horror film in their lives could have somehow missed that... And the ending doesn't even follow up on the twist! I mean COME ON!<br/><br/>I'm going to be as objective as I can and rate this film 3.

","Unrated Director's Cut. Christine Brown(Lohman, trying her darndest to imbue the role with some measure of personality... to no avail, both leads are dull and forgettable) has a nice life. Her boyfriend is... uh, well, a Mac, I think(or at least, she has one... and he has a Smartphone. And the producers think you should, too). Actually, no, he is introduced unable to fix a printer, so I guess he's a doctor(...I love Justin Long, although I think he should stay away from this kind of work(he never seems to fare well in them...), but not sure I buy him as that). She's a loan officer, and she may get a promotion! Ah, but to beat out the just-hired(get it? It's a... joke... and no, they're pretty much all that uninspired) Stu(who I think is the Joxer of modern times... no, I don't know why they didn't just give the role to Ted) for the job, she may have to make a tough decision. Or she'll have to choose whether to grant a third extension on a mortgage payment. Of course the answer is no. Bounds of reason! Whazzat? We're supposed to think that's awful? Oh, we're reinforcing the old stereotype about bankers cheating people out of their money. I guess we should just be grateful she's not a hook-nosed Jew. Anyway, this means an elderly female Gypsy will be evicted, and she choose to curse our protagonist - no, with a demon, not with colorful language... after all, this is a PG-13 film. This is a pretty polarizing one... critics love it(it would appear that they anticipated Mr. Evil Dead's return to horror so much, they'll take anything), a lot of viewers hate it. Sam Raimi is clearly more invested in the copious amounts of bodily fluids(blood is only one of them...) than the characters(who are evidently mainly there so he has someone to throw into walls(though our hero shrugs that off surprisingly well...), get bile on and get embarrassed... and that's the comedy(hey, if you like it in his other efforts, I suppose you may, here, too)), and that's of course his call(as long as he accepts that if he gives us nothing substantial to chew on, we'll forget this soon after watching it... and that's precisely what happens). However, he tries to have his cake and eat it too by trying to capitalize on our sympathy for the them that could have been there. The ending is admittedly grim... and as a public service, they warn you ahead of time, by telegraphing it. FX are a genuine positive, the CGI looks real and is so well-integrated, you can't tell where one ends and the other begins. The major problem here is that the shocks are nearly all, with hardly any exceptions, jumpscares. Yes, an obvious ones, too. The sound gets really low, then, BAM! Something gets in your face, the volume gets cranked, and that is supposed to be terrifying, rather than merely obnoxious. This is 94 minutes long without credits. There is a lot of violence and disturbing content as well as a little moderate to strong language in this. I recommend this to fans of the recent string of unwanted remakes that have plagued this genre. 6/10"

The disappointing thing for me was that it was handled with a little comedy. The film is for casual viewers and serious film lovers might not like it.<br/><br/>PROS: The only thing that was worth watching was the couple. The girl whenever with the boy was looking too cute. They might have made a hit Romantic film if I may suggest. <br/><br/>CONS: The most irritating thing that I find in a horror film is the frequent usage of sudden bursts of sound and too much showing of blood and nasty liquids. And this film is a mix of all that. To add more to this is the comic handling of the concept. I didn't even find the acting of the lead character to be impressive.

Producers use the same bit three times during the movie, a bit that was not scary the first time, just gross to be gross.<br/><br/>Nothing integral to the plot or that heightens the tension or shocks and horrifies, just things that show up like fake vomit to disgust rather than as the result of the character's pursuit of of her objective: to get the curse thrown off.<br/><br/>Lots of little, cheap stunts like that, moments the viewer just knows someone sat up during a production meeting and said "" How cool would this be if we did XXXXX ? Real gross out man. Those kids will be talking about it for years !"" <br/><br/>Another element that works against the movie is that it is filmed and lit like a TV sitcom: too bright, too colorful, too sunny. There seems to be no attempt to create a mood of foreboding, an atmosphere of tension and fear.<br/><br/>Gross out scenes can never take the place of something creepy, and disturbing happening as if all around the viewer.<br/><br/>Cheap shocks can't take the place of a movie experience where the viewer can actually imagine themselves in the same situation.That is the province of actual film making and is created via lighting, music, plot line, pacing and camera angles.<br/><br/>For instance the medium Alison Lohman and Justin long visit,Dileep Rao looks,sounds and acts like a salesmen from the Men's Wearhouse suit chain rather than a charismatic envoy of the supernatural world.<br/><br/>Nice cast, potentially interesting plot,some nice moments, acting is believable in most cases and a genuinely worthwhile plot twist along the way make the movie passably entertaining, but certainly no classic.<br/><br/>Filmed in too bright and brittle a manner to be a truly scary horror film.The lighting alone destroys the possibility of ever making the viewer a participant in the heroine's terror or even to win sympathy for her.<br/><br/>The rest of it is just silly filler posing as scary movie elements. Disappointing. Would be a ""horror classic"" if one saw it at age 8."

The reason was i do not like horror films. But this film did not make me fear.Contrarily, i laughed at some scenes. Still, the choice of the cast were really successful. The woman who cursed the young woman was the exact person that should be in this film for example. Although some effects of the film were really successful, the goat icon,the handkerchief and even the wizard's beards, the film generally contained bad scenes that could make you feel queasy. While watching i was about to vomit in some parts. During the film i was the girl's side but i liked the end of the film mostly. Generally i like the bad-ending films and other things.

","While I was watching this film I was in class. Because of some comments of my friends and because of some scenes in the film I laughed very much. I think some scenes are nonsense and I think the film is not only horror film, also it is comedy and some scenes are disgusting. I could not look some scenes because my gorge rose for example when the old woman disgorged in the girl's mouth. The film also contains romantic scenes. From the beginning of the film I and one of my friends thought that the girl's boyfriend does not love girl really. But, end of the film when the boy took off the ring from his pocket to offer of marriage, all girls in our class said ""Vow! How romantic boy!"". And I think this scene the best part of the film. If only the boy took off a ring from his pocket. When he took off the cursed envelop that was given to the girl by the old woman to take revenge. And when we watching this scene we were angry also we feel unhappy because the girl did everything that she can do but she could not be successful, she died. However, after all these events if the film ended with happiness this could be absurd. How I felt sad I love only end of the film."

","first of all, the movie is great. Justin Long plays his role lively.in the movie, he is funny and cute and loves his girlfriend sincerely. On the other hand, Alison Lohman's bleeding nose part is awesome. In the film there are a few scary parts loved by almost everyone who watched the movie. for instance; while Cristine is in her car, in the seat back Slvia Ganush's ugly,disturbing,annoying face comes directly to the rearview mirror or Sylvia Ganush's teethless mouth comes directly to Christien's chin. But i have to admit that , there is just one little tiny part that exaggrates the movie. It's Lamia's dancing part. when i said the movie was going great, then this part broke down all the magic. but anyway, like i already said, this is a good scary movie and one of my favourite scary movie of all time.

","I watched this movie at the listening and pronunciation lesson. When I watched the beginning of the film I disappointed .There is not any interesting things . The story is about the mythology. It is just a mention with an obvious wink and grin following. It is about Christine Brown is a loans officer at a bank. She is worried about a lot of in life. She is in competition for an assistant manager position .She is worried that her boss will think less of her if she shows weakness, she refuses a time extension on a loan to an old woman, Mrs. Ganush, she now faces foreclosure and the loss of her house. Christine Brown is attacked by Mrs. Ganush after she doesn't accept to offer a loan. When she starts to hallucinate; confides in boyfriend, Clay. He is a Professional Psychologist. The steps she has to undertake to protect herself. Even though it'd be an interesting turn to make, and a slightly strange one at that, all of this is just rumor. Now I understand the ending, I just find myself still disappointed that this lovely innocent girl is punished by this horrible woman , if one asks me about this movie, I don't strongly advise it"

","I thought Christine Brown was great. She fought back and really wrestled with her options. I would love to see a sequel, but I am not sure how they would do it. Hell is not really Hell if there is possibility of escape, so a Justin Long tries to get her back sequel would be pretty grim. If she was really good, she would not have fallen victim in the first place. I thought the Hume was a little much. I prefer scary to funny or disgusting, but when it comes to horror movies where there is more to fear than just death, this is the only decent one I can think of. Raimi is in to sequels so that might be possible. Howsoever, he tends more towards the Lovecraft viewpoint than the biblical (while using his own mythologies) . I.e. there are gods and demons but none of them are nice. In Lovecraft, the only reason nice places like we know can even exist is because the universe is in a temporary state where the bad things are dead — but they will eventually revive. Meanwhile their servants are bad enough. Course, maybe Justin Long can get Tim Allen and the crew of the USS Protector to come help. They owe him one. Since Sigourney Weaver is in that lineup, the Lima would be in deep serious trouble."

","I watched this movie in ELT department for to exercise about pronunciation. He chose Drug Me To Hell which is one of 2009 American horror films. It was scary but just because it was really jumpy. It was a very predictable movie and the talking goat just made it. I have never laughed so hard at any horror film in my life. It was combined comedy film and horror film. There is a woman who she's a young, eager loan officer working in a Los Angeles bank and she wants to be an Assistant Manager. Her boss though seems to prefer another colleague less talented than her. Then she denies an old gypsy woman who gives an extension on her mortgage causing her to lose her house. And the old woman puts a curse on the officer. She will be tortured by evil spirit by three days and then dragged into hell. The young woman tries to get out of the curse. There are also unexpected moments that I was shocked. I should say the end of movie was great. I think that this movie should give 8.0 points. Because this is difference movie which combines two different kind of movie."

First in the bakery store, then at work she is always drinking only coffee, then with the picture she watches in the kitchen of her when she was an over-weighted child it could be more clear!

"ctomvelu1","Null","0","1","1 November 2011"," No ""Evil Dead""
","The first time I saw this, I thought I was watching a Wes Craven film, and that's not meant as a compliment. Craven hasn't made a decent film in 20 years. Imagine my shock and horror when I finally discovered this is a Sam Raimi film. Obviously, Raimi is off his game by a wide margin here. A loan officer played by Alison Lohman ends up under a curse placed on her by an old crone, and the rest of the film details the spirit of the now-deceased crone haunting the young banker. Most of the scares come from loud noises, musical cues and scary faces. If such things are enough to scare you, you will probably enjoy this. Personally, I think Raimi intended it to be a comedy, as witnessed by the incredibly loopy seance, which by the way is right out of Raimi's ""Evil Dead."" I like Alison Lohman; she's sort of the clean-cut version of Lindsay Lohan. And I like Justin Long, if for no other reason than he is from my home state and grew up near me. Also, he did a bang-up job years ago in ""Jeepers Creepers"" (he was sadly missed in the sequel) and ""Galaxy Quest."" The two actors play well together, but they can't save this uneven mess. Watch it at your peril."

Well I can only say that he has failed this time. The movie had a good story line with pleasant scenery and a good music score, the actors where good and played their parts in a convincing manner. The scary bits where ""in-your-face"" good and did indeed scare me a bit, if I was in my teens again watching this film I would have been really scared. The special effects on the other hand were awful and unbelievable, really I don't know how Raimi could even think that they would scare a majority of the Adult movie viewers, no wonder it got a PG-13 rating as I feel that is who this movie is really targeted for.

"sme_no_densetsu","8","0","1","28 May 2011"," A well crafted horror flick from Sam Raimi
","""Drag Me to Hell"" was Sam Raimi's long-awaited return to the genre that gave him his earliest successes with the ""Evil Dead"" movies. However, this time, with the blockbuster status of the Spider-Man films behind him, he wasn't constricted by a low budget.<br/><br/>That's not to say that ""Drag Me to Hell"" is a glossy horror picture lacking in visceral impact. The film looks nice (thanks in no small part to Raimi's talents behind the camera) but it also delivers thrills to spare.<br/><br/>The script has a touch of hokey dialogue but overall it presents a compelling story that doesn't just recycle the usual horror tropes. There are a number of gross-out moments but the PG-13 rating attests to Raimi's decision not to rely on gore for the film's impact. Instead, Raimi masterfully manipulates the audience's emotions with suspenseful storytelling techniques.<br/><br/>All of this being said, I feel that the acting isn't up to the same standard as the rest of the movie. The star, Alison Lohman, just isn't very interesting in my eyes. Justin Long fares a little better while Dileep Rao contributes what is easily the film's most memorable performance. The supporting players are all satisfactory but there's little here that stands out in terms of acting.<br/><br/>Ultimately, ""Drag Me to Hell"" delivers the goods as far as a horror movie is concerned. I'd even say that it's well worth the time for those who normally don't care much for horror movies. In my opinion, the flick's visual panache and genuine chills place it a few notches above typical modern horror fare."
"Mac-Miller93","4","0","1","19 May 2011"," Disappointing!
","I haven't exactly seen many horror films and I was pleased when I got the chance to watch one. However this film left me unexpectedly laughing throughout rather than jumping out of my skin. I'm not too sure if Sam Raimi was trying to make a horror film or he was actually mocking the genre. As a slight newcomer to this genre I wasn't sure if an attacking handkerchief, a cartoon like talking goat and a dancing demon was meant to be thrilling? The film's plot was rather simple and the basis of it could have possibly made for a good horror film. A loan officer, Christine Brown, (Alison Lohman) has a curse placed on her coat button, after she refuses to extend a loan to an evil old gypsy lady. Subsequently she is frequently tormented by evil spirit demons from hell. She seeks help from an Indian fortune teller to rid her of the curse, but fails. After believing she has finally got rid of the button and curse she and the audience are 'shocked' to find out she hasn't. It was all very predictable and the writing was very lazy as there were many flaws in the storyline, the grave digging scene was particularly hard to believe.<br/><br/>Although the film did scrape out some good qualities, as there were some scenes that did make me jump, this was due to the way the director used the technique of suspense building. Throughout the film I noticed that whenever the sound/music stopped, there was going to be something that would jump out at you. Also there were times that made you believe there was a scary moment about to happen and something harmless would pop out, giving the audience a false sense of security. All in all I was rather disappointed with 'Drag Me to Hell' and I look forward to watching another horror film that hopefully doesn't make me laugh as much."
"kylewi-52-851108","1","0","1","12 May 2011"," A Morality Tale?
","My understanding is that the writers, Sam and Ivan Raimi, wanted to write a morality tale about how a good person makes a bad choice based upon greed and is punished for it. A good premise to make a movie on, but that was not in this movie. The bad decision was how the protagonist, Christine Brown, denied an old woman, Sylvia Ganush, a third extension on a mortgage payment so that Christine could get a promotion. Now I'm not familiar with all of the workings with a bank, but not giving a third extension doesn't sound like a bad move even if she did do it with the hopes of a promotion. So Ganush curses Christine and damns her to hell. When Christine goes to confront Ganush, it is revealed that Ganush died. This makes Christine's decision moot because Ganush did not die as a result of the decision. This is more of an immorality tale; if someone doesn't give you what you want, inflict immense pain and suffering upon them."

","The trailers for this film did a good job in building it up to be a legitimate entry amongst the best horror efforts of the 00's. Even the DVD sleeve alone raised my expectations, and I almost found myself believing the perhaps over-zealous tag-line courtesy of Zoo; ""the scariest movie of the decade"". Unfortunately though, the writer of the aforementioned magazine's review, Charlie Parrish, apparently was either trying to pull a fast one on us, or has a critically low fear threshold.<br/><br/>I'm not going to say that it was terrible; it wasn't. There were plenty of well-executed shocks and I was kept watching until the end. It had the ingredients for a good horror film. Perhaps they just weren't mixed together in the right amounts.<br/><br/>My main problem was the attempt at genre definition. The trailers, the adverts, all the publicity, built it up to be purely horror; scares and jumps galore. However, the comedic aspects when watching the film itself led me to believe that perhaps it should have been described as a comedy-horror, or even just made its mind up from the two. In fact, it's so laden with clichés that, if it had been intended as such, it would have gained a higher rating from me. I simply didn't know whether or not to take it seriously.<br/><br/>Some of the shocks took me by surprise; good horror in that respect. Some of the gruesome bodily-fluid-related surprises made me laugh; good comedy in that respect. The balance just wasn't right, though. I don't agree with the one-star reviews that label the film as boring, dry, terrible... there are definitely traces of good film in there. I certainly don't agree with the ten-star reviews however, labelling it as a return to ""classic horror"", unless your idea of ""classic horror"" is mediocre acting and downright daft portrayals of possession (i.e. a man experiencing catatonia during a séance, which looks more like some sort of bizarre dad-at-a-wedding type of dance).<br/><br/>If you begin to watch this expecting a frightening watching experience, you'll be disappointed, probably.

I felt a 3/10 was generous, for several reasons.<br/><br/>The use of old and cheap cues to elicit startled responses from the viewer is completely overdone in this movie. Loud and obnoxious sounds, flashing of scary single-frames in your face, etc.. all really begin to grate after a while and numb the viewer to the rest of the movie.<br/><br/>Additionally, while certain films (the Evil Dead series) either really ARE scary, or treat themselves with a good dose of humor while still being so.. this one can't seem to make its mind up. It never really commits to being truly scary, or truly funny, or even a combo of both. It is in a sort of limbo and really leaves you more confused and feeling like someone tried to pull a cheap scare off on you, again and again.<br/><br/>I'm not going to spoil the plot in any way - I personally didn't even finish watching my first viewing of the movie, it was that bad. I was rolling my eyes ten minutes in, and sighing loudly at twenty. Too many horribly predictable plot twists, scare mechanisms, and just bad writing really ruin the experience.<br/><br/>If you have nothing but time to waste, then perhaps you can burn it on a single seating with Drag Me to Hell.

Had Drag Me To Hell been marketed as a classic horror comedy maybe moments throughout could be laughed at, rather than cringed...Although the first thirty minutes are entertaining, the only vague noticeable influence from director Sam Raimi despite the cheesy gore reminiscent of the Evil Dead trilogy.

"Theothervip","Null","0","1","18 February 2011"," Drag me to horror movie-heaven.
","Rating: ***1/2 out of 4.<br/><br/>Critics, audiences, and horror movie buffs are already torn between the consensus of Sam Raimi's return-to-horror-roots effort DRAG ME TO HELL; some critics declared it an instant cult classic while others, some horror movie buffs included, were skeptical. Me, I just thought DRAG ME TO HELL was the most fun I ever had in a horror movie in a long time. Is it a new classic? Only time will tell, but saying DRAG ME TO HELL is more fun than a bucket-load (or maybe even a shipload) of PG-13 horror remakes would be a dead give-away.<br/><br/>At first, I too was very skeptical as to what makes Raimi's latest horror offering worth of high-praise. This not the first time since his EVIL DEAD trilogy that he touched a horror movie since he served as a producer to some crappy PG-13 horror remakes like THE MESSENGERS and THE GRUDGE 2; that's not really a good sign. But this is his first since in the genre both as a director and writer (along with brother Ivan), and finally mys distinctions of Raimi as a bit rusty has been proved wrong. In fact, seeing DRAG ME TO HELL kind of improved my affection for Raimi himself. I liked his earlier SPIDER-MAN pictures, but didn't hold any particularly high affection to them. Now that I've seen DRAG ME TO HELL (after missing out on it in the big-screen), I may have a higher appreciation for Raimi's style in his preferred genre and the manic energy in his earlier films. The EVIL DEAD series were gory, violent, but at the same time twisted funny and maniacally entertaining. DMTH throws us back to that era where Raimi's infant terrible sensibilities are at a high point.<br/><br/>Alison Lohmann plays Christine Brown, a loan officer who longs for the position of an assistant manager position. She gives it her all, but her play-nice sensibilities puts him behind his scheming, butt-kissing competition Stu Rubin (Reggie Lee). It doesn't help when her unlikely position doesn't make an impression on the parents of her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long). Christine gets her chance to prove herself a tough decision maker when a old lady named Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) begs for an extension to her loan. Christine makes the decision to decline, making a good impression to her boss Jim Jacks (David Paymer, in an amusing straight-faced performance). But something's not right with the old Ganush crone, and after assaulting her in her car, Christine is cursed by the old woman to be sent to hell by demons within a few days.<br/><br/>Like his earlier works, DRAG ME TO HELL pushes every jump scare and gross-out horror to over-the-top heights, serving it up with shock and equal amounts of sadistic humor, but playing it all with a straight-face (Don't worry about laughing during the scenes meant to be scary or solemn, Raimi and co. are laughing along with you). Like The Looney Tunes before him and Peter Jackson and Robert Rodriguez after, Raimi orchestrates his slapstick horror mayhem like a shameless prankster that he is, and there's also I kind of randomness to them; even at its most solemn, Raimi playfully throws in a scare or to unexpectedly. The special effects themselves look relatively low-tech but insanely playful, like the crazy Deadites of his earlier projects. Christopher Young's Elfman-esque score is loud and over-caffeinated, clearly playing those infamous jump-scare tactics of horror movies for laughs. The film may be PG-13, but pushes the envelope to the extremes with it; this is definitely the most fun PG-13 horror movie to date! Think Tourneur's NIGHT OF THE DEMON and THE EXORCIST played out as a Three-Stooges comedy and you got a clear picture of DRAG ME TO HELL.<br/><br/>Lohmann is fun to watch (especially when she goes all tough when the spirits pushed her around too far), and a great sport considering the amount of disgusting, twisted hijinks she had to endure. Justin Long is hilarious playing what seems to be a needless role as the boyfriend, always standing around and ""believing in her"", but doing very little to actually save her. Dileep Rao is even funnier in a straight-faced performance as the psychic determined to help Christine, but is either useless at providing procedures or conveniently giving them when it's almost too late. Adriana Barraza pops up near the end as the medium hell-bent (pardon the pun) to bring down the demon which she faced before many years ago. And then there's the goat...<br/><br/>Not everyone will succumb to Raimi's stomach-turning craziness and the film is already getting some heavy backlash. but go ahead and just go see DRAG ME TO HELL for yourself. If you, like me, thought the movie is just the usual serving of perfunctory PG-13 horror, you might be surprised after a second look on DVD, and maybe bring a few friends over to have someone jump off your seats and laugh along with you."

","I am not, as a general rule, a horror movie person, and I decided to watch this one only because I'm a big fan of Raimi's Army of Darkness. But of course, that was a comedy in a horror-movie context, which is something quite different.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell falls somewhere between Army of Darkness and The Evil Dead, a movie I did not like at all (I can't remember what I thought of Evil Dead 2, but my vague recollection would be DMTH is closer to that).<br/><br/>The movie is a fairly standard horror movie story with some solid scares and some of the comical yet still creepy horror scenes Raimi is known for. It's not my type of movie, as I say, but it is entertaining.<br/><br/>However, the ending is incredibly lame. You know, if you've ever seen a horror movie before in your life, that the ending is coming near a half hour before it arrives, and because it's a stupid, predictable, unoriginal ending, it is extra frustrating to not only have to sit through it but to also have to sit through so much time expecting it. I realize this movie wasn't aiming for an original story, and was content to just deliver cheap scares and comedic horror, but I still just dislike it.<br/><br/>But then, I'm not a horror movie person."

This horror film creates a very eerie atmosphere, with mysterious forces in action in the dark. However, it's more comical than scary and that may be by design. It seems Raimi is having fun with this and not taking any of it too seriously. Some scenes involving slimy critters and bodily fluids go too far however. Lohman does fine as the loan officer who picks the wrong customer to tick off. Long plays her boyfriend and it's hard to see him as anyone other than the Mac guy.

","If there was an Academy Award for ""Worst movie with a plot that could be resolved in thirty minutes or less"", Drag Me to Hell would take the cake and eat it all. Sam Raimi returns after his successful ""Spider Man"" franchise and returns to the ""Evil Dead"" nostalgia he left us off with in 1987 bring us ""Drag Me to Hell"".<br/><br/>Let me first note this is not a Horror movie, hardly a suspense movie. Lets just call it a ""Wanna be movie"".<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Christine Brown (Allison Lohman) lives a normal life in present day Los Angeles working as a bank loan officer. After losing a promotion to her co-worker Stu (Reggie Lee), her boss tells her to become more strict of a loan officer and try to be more assertive and in control.<br/><br/>One day, an elderly gypsy woman by the name of Sylvia Ganush (Lorna Raver) walks up to Christine and asks her for a third extension on her overdue mortgage payment. Christine denies her the mortgage to seem more assertive and to prove to Mr. Jacks she has what it takes for the promotion, apologizing to her and saying there is nothing she can do. Ganush becomes angry at her and attacks Christine. She is taken out by guards a few moments later.<br/><br/>Fretting the issue, Christine gets into her car at the end of the day and is attacked by Ganush (which is very similar to the attack sequence in P2) who then puts a curse on her that she will be sentenced to Hell in three days.<br/><br/>After confronting her boyfriend (Justin Long), she then seeks help Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a fortune teller who tells Christine she will be going to Hell in a matter of three days. He convinces her to make an animal sacrifice, to which then she kills her cat.<br/><br/>I shall admit this is the first movie I have walked out on in seven years (The Master of Disguise in 2002). It was not scary, a waste of my time, and after she killed the cat, I knew I was done.<br/><br/>I have never been a fan of Raimi's films, I will have to admit I never liked them. After seeing this, I'm guessing Raimi's ""Spider Man 4"" will be a little darker with satire seeing as in this film it's one of the darkest things he has done.<br/><br/>I should also mention this movie experiments a lot with effects. It uses including green screen, puppets, prosthetics and computer-generated imagery throughout. That's probably the only highlight since this movie wasn't at all scary.<br/><br/>The scene were she kills her cat was completely unnecessary, I found it saddening and just a ruin to what could have been a ""decent"" (and I use that term lightly) movie. Especially seeing as the Horror in this movie is very limited. The awkward silence scenes are screaming JUMP SCENE at you hoping you will jump. This movie tries to be something it will never be, scary.<br/><br/>Starring: Allison Lohman, Justin Long, Lorna Raver, and Dileep Rao. Directed by Sam Raimi."

My real question is how could the Producers make a dime off this movie from hell, when the rating is PG13? I just can not imagine anyone over the age of 13 spending a dime to see this pile of sheep's dip,so how could anyone ever want to finance a movie that could (and this is probably being unfair to the children) only appeal to children under the age of 13 and not make back half of the production costs. I apologize to all the kids with a true taste of the good Cinema... not just the popcorn.<br/><br/>I have to say in closing the only reason I saw this pile was because I fell a sleep on a Saturday afternoon and woke up with this thing playing. It was like a car wreck is some people and I guess for me this day...It was so, so very ugly and bad, I couldn't turn away.

","I thoroughly enjoyed this movie; great acting, high gory factor, story (although premise had been done to death) great, up until the end; which I'm sorry but how could everyone involved in this film not realize one major thing in their attempt to make a surprising twist ending: the evil goat thing was supposed to get her BEFORE DAWN. Seriously that fact is mentioned I don't know how many times leading up to the ending yet it comes the next day. I mean I hate when endings don't add up with the rest of the movie. This really was going to be one of my favorite horror films, funny moments are always appreciated, but I prefer to laugh at comedy not a ridiculous ending. Not that I don't enjoy horror with evil endings, usually those are the best for me lol. It would just have made much more sense if it came for her the night it was supposed to. Other than that major flaw, I did enjoy it up until it stopped making sense. Lohman is great in everything she does so no surprise there. I really appreciated how her sexiness wasn't exploited at all in the film, no overexposure of cleavage or ditsiness; basically not a campy film. It was also refreshing to see Justin Long in another horror film, much more mature now and he was great too. Scary, shocking, funny, a film that had such great potential but ruined by the ending. Still worth checking out though if you enjoy gore."

","""Drag Me To Hell"" finds director Sam Raimi coming back to his own roots. The movie is reminiscent of his cult Evil Dead series. Although it is not as amazing as ""Evil Dead II"", it still delivers a well-balanced combination of horror and comedy Raimi is famous for. After her unwillingness to help an old gypsy woman, Christine Brown (Alison Lohman) experiences the unusual attack from the angry witch casting a spell on her. The movie oscillates between a supernatural horror and a farce making for an inventive, yet totally amusing thrill ride.

Of course, that's just my fairly humble opinion. Even funnier, several times he ridicules the 'shockproofness' of certain strong (moral) convictions. Not too worry, at times DMtH is scary as well.

Sadly on the negative side, the film is formulaic and anyone with a modicum of film watching experience could see the twists and turns before they came, including the final one. Furthermore, it relies more on grossing you out (there is a lot of puking, ugly hags and dirty fingernails) rather than frightening you.

","Raimi does it once again by brilliantly mixing his ingredients of comedy, suspense and horror in the form of 'Drag Me To Hell'. What I liked about this is that even though the film is 'primarily' a horror film, the humour does not interfere with the story and the comic timing is just excellent. 'Drag Me To Hell' is quite well made. The editing, the cinematography, the sound effects and the visual effects are solid. The writing too is top notch as the characters are well defined and the story and dialogues are coherent. There are plenty of effective twists and jumps which make for more entertaining viewing. Lorna Raver is great as the hideous and horrifying Mrs. Ganush. Justin Long is good as Christine's loving boyfriend. Adriana Barraza leaves a mark with a small role. 'Drag Me To Hell' is carried by Alison Lohman who does quite a fantastic job. She may be an actress who's maintained a low profile as a result of which she remains underrated but at the same time, compared to most of her contemporaries, she's made some of the most interesting and diverse choices of films. She easily makes the viewer sympathize for Christina and we do vouch for Christina's salvation. Raimi has made a clever piece of entertaining cinema that has been a lot of fun to watch."

Allison suffers from horrible visions & nightmares as Lamia torments her in preparation for the third day when Allison will be dragged to hell. Can psychic Rham Jas (Dileep Rao) help to rid Allison of the ancient curse or will Lamia claim yet another victim...<br/><br/>Co-written, produced & directed by Sam Raimi this was supposed to be his big return to the horror genre after his mega hit Spider-Man films he wrote the script after he made Army of Darkness (1992) but didn't get to make it until some sixteen years later, a return to his roots where he began with The Evil Dead trilogy & while I did like Drag Me to Hell I was somewhat disappointed with it as well. The script tries to mimic & mix the crazy anything goes horror & outrageousness of The Evil Dead with the toned down respectability of a Hollywood teen friendly PG effort that feels a little neutered. There's some crazy set-pieces that have a certain bizarreness about them, in particular the fight between the old woman & Allison where the old woman's false teeth get knocked out & her eye is stapled shut which I assume is meant to be funny but just isn't. There's some good horror moments too like a nice jump scare moment when the old lady is in bed next to Allison & vomits a load of maggots & bugs over her face & then there's scenes which try to mix comedy & horror like when Allison drops an anvil on the old ladies head & her eyeballs shoot out in a surreal moment (why is an anvil hanging up bu a length of rope in your shed?). The curse aspect of the story is quite thin & there's not much to it, we never really see Lamia in it's true form & there's very little background given to the curse itself. The character's are OK with Allison a likable lead & the film does entertain although I just think it lacks a little cohesion & there aren't enough 'moments' in it plus it's too tame.<br/><br/>I could definitely see how Drag Me to Hell could split an audience, it may not appeal to all but I think most would enjoy it on some level. There's some light comedic stuff, some proper horror & one or two jumpy moments & a little outlandishness thrown in there too, I mean there's even a talking goat here at one point. The gore level is very disappointing here, I saw the 'Extended Edition' on Blu-ray & there's really not much to speak of besides a bloody nose bleed, a little blood splatter, some flying eyeballs & a few dead bodies. The film has a good pace but it really kicks in when the curse is laid & Lamia haunts & torments Allison for a few days before running out of steam a bit at the end. There's one very silly moment in which a possessed handkerchief attacks Allison & she fights with it, to say it looks ridiculous is not needed & handkerchief's are not scary or threatening either.<br/><br/>With a supposed budget of about $30,000,000 this wasn't mega budget but it wasn't exactly low budget either, it got a lukewarm reception at the box-office although I am sure it did make a small profit. Filmed in Los Angeles in California. The acting is alright with likable leads although no big stars.<br/><br/>Drag Me to Hell is a fun enough return to the horror genre for Raimi but I was expecting a little bit more, a bit more gore & a bit more genuine black humour. I liked it but I didn't love it, having said that it's still one of the better recent Hollywood horror flicks."
"SebaZava","7","0","2","30 November 2009"," A very enjoyable B-level horror movie.
","Although the first two Spider-man movies were really good - particularly the second one -, with the third one Sam Raimi was showing he was staring to get tired of the franchise. (Although it seems he wants to redeem himself - Spider-man 4 will reportedly be simpler, tighter and more exciting.) In fact, the film was such a creative - but definitely not financial - failure that Raimi decided to return to his roots... and craft a horror film in the vein of his Evil Dead trilogy. Drag me to Hell is the result of that. And although it isn't as effective as the aforementioned trilogy, it's every bit as creepy and darkly funny as Raimi would've wanted it to be. Not a perfect film by any means, but definitely superior (in every way) to his third Spider-man movie.<br/><br/>The film tells the story of loan officer Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), who wants to become an assistant manager at the bank in which she works. She wants this promotion not only because she needs the money and because she wants to secure her future, but also because she's wants to impress her boyfriend, Clay (Justin Long), and his parents. The bank manager, Mr. Jacks (David Paymer), has to decide between her and Stu, her rival, for the manager's position. One day, an old woman called Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) comes to the bank asking for relief from a mortgage she can't pay, otherwise, she'll lose her house. Mr. Jacks leaves the resolution of the matter to Christine and she decides to be rough in order to impress her boss and secure her promotion. Predictably, Mr.s Ganush doesn't react very well and begs to Christine. She is taken away. But later, the both of them get involved in a physical confrontation which results in the old woman putting a curse into the girl's jacket botton. Soon enough, Christine is stalked by a demon from hell, so she ends up going to a mystic (Dileep Rao) who tells her the demon won't rest until he takes her to hell to burn for all eternity.<br/><br/>If the previous plot summary doesn't sounds like something out of a cheap, B-level horror movie, then I don't know what it does. Raimi has produced Drag me to Hell like an old-fashioned horror movie, making use of over-the-top (but suitably creepy) music, super-loud sound effects, odd camera angles and a very amusing mixture of horror and comedy. When the movie works, it can be both darkly funny and shocking, but when it doesn't... well, let's just say it doesn't seem like a very good motion picture at all. The main problem with Drag me to Hell (and hopefully this won't seem like regurgitating something out of my review for Jennifer's Body) is that it doesn't know whether to be a cheesy horror comedy or a straight-forward scary story. It definitely is a million times more successful than the aforementioned Megan Fox starer, but nevertheless, there were times in which I didn't know if the funny stuff I was watching on screen was supposed to be funny, or if Raimi had failed at scaring me.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman has been very good in previous motion pictures - her performance in Matchstick Men is almost impossible to forget - but in Drag me to Hell she's simply... forgettable. It doesn't help either that it's very hard to sympathize with Christine - granted, what she did doesn't really deserve her being dragged into hell for all eternity, but that doesn't mean she is a very likable protagonist either. Additionally, I didn't think she was particularly bright not that she had much of a personality - Christine seemed to me like a very unfinished character, someone very hard to root for in a film of this ilk. Justin Long is OK as her boyfriend, Clay (although did he really have to be surrounded by Apple products all the time?) and Dileep Rao, as the mystic, adds some gravitas to the proceedings.<br/><br/>Without spoiling too much of the film, I can say that I definitely didn't like the ending. In a very M. Night Shyamalan-ish sort of way, the movie features a last-act twist that a.) doesn't make any sense, b.) doesn't make the movie any more interesting and c.) is very easy to see coming. The film ends on a downer that made me think everything I had experienced before was for nothing, and that made me feel disappointed towards Raimi. I know most horror movies don't happy happy endings, but I definitely wasn't expecting such an abysmal, depressing kind of twist.<br/><br/>So why is Drag me to Hell recommendable, then? Alyson Lohman gives a lackluster performance, the movie doesn't know whether to be scary or funny, and the last-act twist is laughable. Well, these are all aspects that definitely don't work, but when the film does work - that is, when it provides with a shocks, gore, slime, dark humour or interesting plot points - it's a very enjoyable B-level horror movie. Don't get me wrong - it is a very flawed movie, but overall I enjoyed almost every minute of it until the horrible twist spoiled everything. It might not be the scariest or the funniest movie out there, but for what it's worth, it's almost an hour and a half of solid - yet unremarkable - entertainment."

","My 5 is a generous 5. This movie had some base ideas and concepts that could have made a very good film. But they came out as poorly executed.<br/><br/>They movies plot is decent enough, except for the lack of explanation for the second envelope that just happened to have a circular object in it (you can see its indentation in one of the shots). And even despite this i enjoyed the ending. It was the middle that killed it for me.<br/><br/>I know Raimi's style, it's just that it didn't work out in this movie. The gross out scenes took away from the movie and left me thinking ""this is not scary it's just gross"". Most of the tricks he pulls in this movie have been done as well. And tied to that, almost every one of the scares follows this pattern; Quiet, Hallucinate, Screech, Demon shadow.<br/><br/>If you enjoy scary movies for the scares, this movie is not for you. If you take your horror with a side of gross out, near comedy gimmicks, then go for it."

"moonpig82","4","0","3","21 November 2009"," Scariest movie of the decade - yeah right.
","I really can't understand why this movie is getting so much praise when it is average at best. Yes it's nice to see Sam Raimi returning to the horror genre but watching this just reminded me of how brilliant the Evil Dead is. First of all Drag Me To Hell is not scary. Whoever is calling it the scariest movie of the decade obviously doesn't watch a lot of horror films. There is not one moment that made me jump or had me on the edge of my seat and I can't imagine anyone being scared of it unless you are frightened by lots of CGI effects. I'm not a big fan of CGI but when used in the right way it can look great. Unfortunately in this movie it is very overdone. To be honest the emotion I felt throughout most of the film was boredom. A lot of stuff does happen in a short space of time but none of it is really that interesting and a lot of it involves the heroine having hallucinations or dreaming. There is no blood or gore. Of course you don't need gore to make a good horror film but sometimes a decent gore effect or death scene can elevate a movie and grab your interest but we don't get that here. We get a few moments which some people would probably find gross but it takes a bit more than someone's eyeballs flying out of their head using bad CGI to get me feeling sick I'm afraid. So are there any good points? Well the acting is OK although the characters are unsympathetic and I liked the ending. The movie gets an extra point for the part where they are trying to summon the Lamia and it possesses a goat. The goat's face then turns evil (using CGI of course) and it starts talking. I nearly fell off my seat with laughter and it made sitting through the rest of the film worth it. In fact I liked that part so much I went back and watched it a couple more times! But sadly for me that was the only decent part in the entire film. I realise I am going to sound like a horror movie snob now and I apologise for that but Drag Me To Hell is a horror film for people who don't really like horror. It's not scary, it's not gruesome, it's not suspenseful and aside from the goat has no memorable moments. But hey I seem to be in the minority so by all means give it a watch but I wouldn't waste my time seeing it again."
"jfitzgerald-6","Null","0","2","18 November 2009"," A rare treat!
","What a treat. It's a fair question to ask: Who had more fun with this film, the audiences or the cast and crew? The only thing missing in this rare blend of chuckles and scares is the sweet female lead turning to the camera once in a while and giving us a wink. Hardly anyone knows how to make a good horror flick any more, so this masterful piece by Sam Raimi is especially welcome. There are enough shock scenes to satisfy even those who feel that is the sole criteria for a horror flick. More importantly, once in a blue moon, a director and writers make a horror film that caters to our intelligence, rather than our base instincts. In this one, Raimi is telling us: ""Hey, come on in and check out this cool movie we made. Don't take it too seriously, but just sit back and enjoy the fun."""

","Between the ""Mac"" guy and the campy special effects, I had a good laugh. If you go into it with the ""Evil Dead"" mindset, this might be a good movie but if you want to actually see horror, I'd pass.<br/><br/>It started out on the right foot but once the fluids started spewing and the goat started talking, that was it for me. <br/><br/>There seemed to be some attempt to develop the characters but that all went away in the second half. <br/><br/>I really thought this movie was garbage.<br/><br/>To be fair, it could have been the marketing of this film. If it would have been presented as campy then I would probably be more forgiving."
"RickHarvey","8","0","2","14 November 2009"," A much needed horror
","Before I start, I totally thought that this was an serious horror film. I'll probably blame the misleading marketing for that. Despite being filled with clichés , drag me to hell was still an good film worth watching.<br/><br/>Instead of an serious horror, it was more of an comedy filled with cartoon violence. This is not an film that takes it self to seriously. The gore and violence is fun to watch , often making you laugh. For instant , when the gypsy eyes pop out . There are many scenes like these. Now, when the film obviously doesn't take itself to seriously , you can't rate it by it plot but instead by it entertainment values. The plot is simple and has been done before many a times. A girl gets cursed, seeks for help, finds solution , twist ending, the end. Now if the film took itself seriously, then you would have the right to complain about the unimaginative plot . But despite the concept being simple, the direction id delivered well. Not once does Raimi lets you settle, the film is filled with pop up scares. But many of these scares aren't just the simple draw-back-curtain-and-boo-scares, instead there well created, for example, the car park scene when the gypsy reveals here self inside the car, very spooky.<br/><br/>The film is often humorous , but at times frightening . Raimi builds up suspense and then out of nowhere , delivers the frights. But the best thing about the film is that it was much needed. This decade hasn't been the best for horror films , with only SAW ( first one ) being the only exceptional film so far. Drag me to hell only concentrates on frightening the audience , reminding us why we watch horrors. I watched this on DVD but I can imagine how more suspenseful and frightening the film would be at the cinema. If your getting your mates round yours for the night and thinking of watching an horror, I highly recommend drag me to hell"
"egeddes","3","0","3","8 November 2009"," Pointless and silly
","This is a silly and not very frightening movie. Horror films have one single and simple function and that is to scare or at least disturb you. If they fail at that, they are pointless. This movie is pointless and silly. It starts from the beginning with our heroine who is simply unbelievable as an up and coming would-be assistant bank manager. I see her as a contender for head cheerleader at best. Throughout the movie, she does not engage our sympathy at all. Frankly, I couldn't give a damn what happened to her. Certainly after the kitten scene I was actively on the side of the lamia. I agreed with his mother that Mac Man could do soooo much better. Multiple silly things have been noted by other reviewers, my favourites being the anvil in the garage, the spectacular nosebleed, and the heroine's remarkable ability to dig out a 8' x 3' x 6' grave with a small shovel in the pouring rain in a few short hours. And she really needed a different spiritual adviser. He takes $10,000 from her for a ridiculous and futile exorcism and, only after that fails, he remembers to tell her a rather simple trick he could have told her the first night they met. The major fault here is the script which really did not do justice to the underlying idea in the movie. These days, dragging unsympathetic loan officers to hell has a very attractive ring to it. But the writers blew the promising story idea. Overall, not a movie for which I would demand my $5 rental fee back. But equally, I wish I had waited until it turned up on free TV."

","From the beginning I had low expectations for this film, but I saw it at Wal-Mart for $13 so I figured, hey, just another for the collection.<br/><br/>Te beginning was a bit odd and was not played very well at all. A kid spinning in circles trying to act like the floor is breaking up just doesn't seem to work... As hes attempting this he seems very confused. The acting in this movie could use some serious work.<br/><br/>The comedy aspect of the film was so-so. There were only two parts I let out a genuine laugh because of the comedic scenes, and those were as follows; The part where the hag is in the car, loses her teeth and tries to gnaw on Christines face like a toothless zombie... I thought this was funny because I have a running inside joke about toothless zombies, so this may not count. The second part I found pretty humorous was the scene with the possessed goat keeper dancing a jig while floating in the air... Pretty funny. The rest of the humor was either dry, elementary or disgusting. Christines run-ins with Stu? I could let those slide... Christine vomiting blood, then holding her mouth shut only to have it jet out her nose? Sounds a bit like a 3rd graders comic strip, albeit a bit questionable in that case. The anvil that fell on the hags head and made her face explode onto Christine and inside her mouth? Disgusting, just like everything else that goes into her mouth in this movie. This includes, but isn't limited to, flies, living vomit, dead vomit, blood, eyeballs and mud. I wont comment on it, but there are two scenes where the hag and Christine suck faces... its kind of gross.<br/><br/>The horror side of the movie is nearly devoid... I was never frightened or on edge through the entire film. I was bored. I will not accept that it is because its PG-13 because I have seen some very good PG-13 horror films.<br/><br/>One thing I never realized is how Christine lived to be dragged to hell... When she was shoving the coin in the dead hags mouth and it filled with water, it was clearly night or early morning. She was knocked unconscious by a fallen tombstone and she goes under... When she comes from beneath the surface the sky is clearly lit with light. Its fairly obvious at LEAST one hour has passed.<br/><br/>This is nothing like Evil Dead... Its an attempt, but a failed one."
"darkbloo","4","0","3","31 October 2009"," Poor effects, not scary - disappointing
","There was some hype around this film being 'scariest of the decade', and I expected much from this director. However, the opening scenes ultimately set the tone for the rest of the film - the only thing shocking were the CGI effects. I admit there were a few jumpy moments, but they were too deliberate, obvious, and predictable. The scenes with the gypsy woman were pretty creepy and could have offered more, but the rest of the film was more supernatural than scary. Even the gross vomiting in the mouth scenes were a let-down; the character just got up and acted like nothing had happened - missed opportunity to maximise the impact there. As is usual with so many CGI movies, the effect loses impact, and it is particularly ineffective for a horror movie - because it does not look real, it is not scary."

","Childish and not very scary, I'm not sure why this was so lovingly received in the press... <br/><br/>The basic premise borrows from the M R James story 'Casting the Runes', which in turn was the inspiration for the classic 1957 British horror movie 'Night of the Demon'. (The only ropey bit about that film is the rather lame demon special effect that's glimpsed at the start of the movie - an unnecessary addition the studio forced on the director.)<br/><br/>Do yourself a favour and try and see that film, or even better, read some M R James.

","I don't usually watch horror movies and, when I do, they seldom are actually surprising or scary to me. But ""Drag Me To hELL"" is the real deal, it gave me shivers a number of times, and while I thought I had the wrap-up figured out 30 minutes before it ended, it kept surprising me all the way to the end. Neat movie.<br/><br/>However, as cute as she is, and as good as she was in ""Matchstick Men"", I don't believe Alison Lohman is a very good actress. Or maybe this wasn't a good part for her. She is Christine Brown, working as a Loan Officer in a L.A. area bank, and aspiring to promotion to the vacancy that exists at the branch, Assistant VP. She is good-hearted, but she really wants that promotion and makes a decision that haunts her through the whole movie.<br/><br/>Justin Long is perfect as Clay Dalton, her boyfriend, soon to become fiancée, and working as a Professor of Psychology. He mostly represents the sense of reason in this story, often commenting the way one of us audience members might comment about what is going on. But he loves Christine and supports her in her efforts to escape what appears to be a curse.<br/><br/>Lorna Raver is really good, in very effective makeup, as Mrs. Ganush, the lady who comes to the bank to see if she can get an extension on her loan repayment, and not face eviction. Christine has the power to either grant her an extension or not. But taking a tough stance might look better to her boss, and get her a promotion.<br/><br/>The movie actually opens with a scene, in a house, where a boy is taken by the evil character. In this scene we see the floor open up and the boy is dragged down, in flames, to hELL, then the floor heals. The main reason for this short scene is to establish that everything else we see is not some sort of hoax or scheme directed at Christine, but a genuine threat, that she might get dragged to hELL also.<br/><br/>SPOILERS FOLLOW: (For my recollection only) In a scary encounter in the parking garage with Ganush, Christine's coat button is ripped off. Ganush puts a spell on it and gives it back to Christine, and following that she experiences all kinds of disturbing things. After consultation with spiritualists and trying to figure out how to escape the curse, they realize that Christine must give the button to someone else, to transfer the curse. Ganush had died, Christine went to her gravesite, dug up the casket, ripped it open, in a very good scene (the DVD extras show how they shot it). She stuffs the envelope containing the button into Ganush's mouth, so it was now a gift to her, and she would be dragged to hELL. But the next day at the train station meeting Clay for a short vacation, one where he was going to give her the engagement ring, he gives Christine the button, it had gotten mixed up in the car, she actually put an envelope containing an old coin in Ganush's mouth. Then, right there on the train tracks, as a train approached at speed, the train bed opened up and Christine was dragged down into the flames."

I fully see where Raimi was going but ultimately he doesn't get there. First off the tone of the movie is all over the place. The tension is all there but the Evil Dead 2/ Army of Darkness bits don't blend in very well for me. I'm a big fan of Raimi, heck I even like his Quick and the Dead, but for me he didn't go all out. If he wanted a shocker he should of went for it. If he wanted an Army of Darkness clone, go for it, but the blending of the two just pulled me away from the experience. One big scene being where the gypsy lady attacks the leading lady in a tool shed and forces her fist down her throat. The sequence up to that point was well done, then hilarity ensues. Sure I giggled and laughed but really was that the point? The first 20 minutes of setup are top-notch but frankly it's dead serious stuff, and then when the gypsy lady attacks our hero in her car all you can do is laugh, which I'm fine with, but keep that tone going throughout just not in the scare scenes. Evil Dead 2 did this just fine but the material here doesn't warrant this. The camera angles, acting and pacing are dead on though. I sat back and enjoyed it nothing less, it just wasn't as good as it could have been. If your a fanboy of Raimi then you'll want to see this. If you don't like your horror w/comedy then steer clear."

","Like 2007's Disturbia, this slick production also borrows heavily from a genre classic. 1957's Curse of the Demon is an obvious inspiration and Raimi takes care to ensure that his modern-day version holds onto at least some the original's charm. <br/><br/>Drag Me To Hell is a straightforward supernatural tale, only now there are a couple of sub-plots to help to keep today's (easily distracted) audience focused on the vulnerability of the main character while at the same time giving plenty of opportunity for Raimi to revisit his trademark slapstick gore circa Evil Dead II.<br/><br/>This is without doubt a film which doesn't take itself too seriously, characters are thin and comic relief abounds, but the central theme is so dark that it manages to anchor the story to a bedrock of dread. <br/><br/>It's good to see the Hollywood success story that is Sam Raimi revisiting his roots and just hopefully (given it's decent box-office) this movie will give horror a nudge in a different direction.

","Sam, you are so mean. Poor Christine(Alison Lohman, who is such a sweetheart, a poor girl with a run of bad luck) is run through the spiritual ringer for about 100 minutes attempting to fight off the gypsy curse summoning a goat demon, Lamia, to take her to hell. Lorna Raver is certain to be remembered by horror fans for many years to come for her creepy gypsy, Mrs. Ganush, sure is made up as ghoulish and ugly as possible, the perfect kind of grotesque creation only to be found in a Sam Raimi horror outing. Christine decides that if she is to get a vacant assistant manager position in her bank, she'll need to be tougher, and Ganush, of all people, is the one that turns up at her desk, pleading for a third extension, and to deny her could be the break she needs. It's unfortunate that the example to be made of would be a powerful gypsy with the ability to unleash an evil curse on you, but that is the kind of Sam Raimi foil Christine is. <br/><br/>An accursed object, a button removed from Christine's coat, must be passed to another as a gift in order to relinquish the goat demon spell. She attempts, through help of a ""seer"", Rham Jas(Dileep Rao), to get rid of the demon through a sacrifice(..her cat!)and séance with Shaun San Dena(Adriana Barraza), a reputed spiritualist who once faced the demon, as it possessed a boy who stole from a gypsy, and lost. The circumstances continue to pile up. Christine attempts to broker a deal with Ganush, but discovers she's dead. The coveted position she so desired is potentially going to her rival, Stu(Reggie Lee), who stole her account attempting to sell it to another bank. And, her first meeting with the wealthy parents of psych professor boyfriend Clay(Justin Long)doesn't go well thanks to the bothersome antics of the curse. A pesky fly, blood gushing from her nose and mouth, a powerful wind that continues to dishevel rooms in her house, and the goat demon smacking her across the chops and lifting her off the floor hurling her in the air like a rag doll, not to mention high frequency noise that pierces her ears(..and the constant presence of shadowy spooks which show up to wreak havoc), poor Christine is having quite a rough three days. And, the horrifying knowledge that the Lamia will come to take her to hell to spend eternity in torment isn't exactly a comforting thought either.<br/><br/>Boy, does Sam Raimi make a vocal return to the genre that made him a star. Using CGI and some ghastly make-up effects, Raimi pulls out all the stops and puts his heroine through one nightmarish scenario after another. And, even when you believe the poor girl might finally be rid of the terrors that plague her, he gets all mean-spirited again, unleashing more on her. Plenty of gross-out gags, including the scene where Christine bleeds all over her boss, a fly goes up her nose, and the corpse of Ganush falls on top of her, spilling embalming fluid all over her! Lohman is very much the female equivalent of Bruce Campbell, except the evil isn't confined to one general area, like the cabin and it's surrounding wilderness, but instead follows the girl wherever she goes. Welcome back, Sam, we missed you..and don't stay gone for 16 years next time! The ending, I must admit, left me quite disturbed. PG-13 rating is pushed to the brink, that's for sure."

","I'll make this short and sweet. I got this movie because i was pretty much bored. when i was done with this movie, i went out and bought it immediately. Yes, it is that good. i don't want to tell you too much about it, but if you enjoy horror movies that have often but not too often comic relief, pure terror, and an ending that you don't see coming throughout the movie, this is your movie. In a nutshell, this movie blew me away, and that my friends, is hard to do. Bravo.<br/><br/>superior acting, story that never let's up, scenes that make you jump out of your seat, and humor that ultimately surpasses most normal comedies, this all packed together with a HUGE (emphasis on huge) twist at the end, this movie literally rocks in my top five favorite horror movies of all time (In between jeepers creepers 1 and 2).<br/><br/>Hope this helps!"
"MatthewLong23","9","0","1","17 October 2009"," Awesome Movie
","Watched this movie last night on DVD and thought it was a very entertaining film. It tells the story of a bank teller who seems to have a good life with a newly hired university professor. A gypsy woman begs her for an extension in paying off her mortgage on her house as she will be evicted. She decides to not let her have it, as she thinks her boss will be pleased with her, and the woman curses her in retaliation. She then has 3 days before the Lamia, an evil demon, will take her to hell. The rest of the movie is her having visions of this woman taunting her with very gross results such as bugs flying up her nose, a very bad nose bleed and visions of her attacking her. This is a very fun movie to watch as long as you take it for what it is. It's a funny movie and it knows it. The best part is probably when they try to summon the demon and people start to inhabit the spirit of the demon to anyone who touches it. The ending is killer but wasn't that surprised by it."

If you do decide to watch Drag Me To Hell, try to get it at the Redbox, that way you are only out one dollar...but you can NEVER get the time back. The special effects are decent, but nothing we haven't seen before. Much of it was borrowed from Evil Dead II. They tried to have some humor in Drag me to Hell, but it seemed as if it didn't belong.

","I read good comments about this movie and thought I'd give it a try. I've heard of Sam Raimi and thought he was an esteemed director. But after watching this movie, I was so disappointed. I kept watching, hoping it'd get better...it does not.<br/><br/>This movie has several points where they use loud music to scare you; you know, the type where they pan quickly to a scary face and play a one second chime really loud to get you to jump, similar to those screensaver pranks where you navigate through a maze and then the scary picture pops up on the screen with a loud ""boo"" type chime. Yes it scares you but, at least to me, it's the low-blow of scare effects in a horror movie. So cheap...<br/><br/>Another cheap shot scare tactic over-used in this movie is the gross out slime effect. How many times is the old hag going to throw up or spit goo into Lohman's character's mouth? Boring...<br/><br/>The writers and directors of this movie really should go back to school and learn how to make good horror. These are really kindergarten scare tactics and special effects. I can't believe they allow this kind of garbage to get made in Hollywood and this just adds more proof that Hollywood cannot produce quality horror.<br/><br/>I will say that the acting in this movie, for the most part, is good (except the graveyard scene toward the end; Lohman just is not convincing as a now-enraged and empowered heroine). Another good thing is Lohman herself...she's at least semi-cute."

","This movie doesn't deserve 7.5 rating on IMDb. It has it's moments - kinda scary at the beginning and some parts were pretty funny, but it failed in too many departments to be called actually good. f.e. that scene in the funeral, where corpse drops on her, it was so over the top stupid, or that part with demon starting to dance - they are trying to represent him like that unstoppable scary force, but when it actually shows itself it's totally lame. Or that medium dieing after replenishing the spirit - it's like ""I did, I did it...ugh, I dead"", I mean - so anticlimactic, and it's the main problem I have with this movie - I can't understand what it's trying to be - scary, funny, ""heavy"" - what? It's like a weird mix. It can't be a black comedy, but it can't be a truth horror movie also. The next main problem I have would be predictability - if you have some brain in your head you could totally call almost every event in this movie. f.e. you could tell what she'll kill her kitty first time the sacrifice was mentioned. Or that giving the envelop with a coin in it to her boyfriend thing - I almost could here the plot-point dropping there, so when it came to that part of her losing it in the car I could tell how everything gonna end, so all that drag of her going to the graveyard was totally anticlimactic - like ""oh I know it's the wrong one, just show the ending - it's getting boring.""

","I thought the opening scene of the kid swallowed by the floor was very poor and ridiculous and the movie remained boring for me until the old lady comes to the bank. Starting from here, I guess the movie began attracting me. I liked the very idea of casting this old lady (she was a perfect cast for the role). The car scene between the old lady and the loan officer was also a classic and pretty much was the master scene of the whole movie. Then comes the scenes where she kills her cat (that was really funny) and the scene when she visits her boyfriend's parents at the table, that felt more of meet the parents than any horror movie.<br/><br/>I easily guessed that the coin was mistaken for the button. Actually from the very beginning of the movie when she gives him the coin as a gift, I told myself that the coin will have a lot to do with the plot.<br/><br/>Not a very good movie but a good and should see one as the movie comes with a new idea : an old lady cursing a loan-officer for taking her house away from her.

Don't get me wrong- this is watchable but it's a dumb girls version of a horror movie- not any real contribution to occult or horror genre in any way shape or form. PLOT: Our heroine is a loan seller at a bank and doesn't give a particular person a renewal on their loan so they seek revenge in the form of something evil that will drag her to hell. The scenes are light on gore and blood and tend towards shock via editing instead of content. This is why I call this a girl's horror movie- there's nothing really horrific or scary to report- just about 10 gotchya scenes using editing.. which.. is lame in many ways. I would have liked to seen a hotter actress with more penchant for brutal gore, and a demon worth seeing. The special effect on this movie are about on par with Stephen King's Poltergeist.. they are a bit behind the curve on script writing and special effects, with casting that could be improved- but then... it would be a real horror film and not just one for girls.

","Let me preface this by saying that I'm not entirely a horror buff. By any stretch of the imagination. I've really liked some of the J-horror I've seen, the American remake of ""The Ring"", plus Spanish horror like REC and the excellent ""The Orphanage"". ""The Descent"" was also thoroughly enjoyable. I do know a good horror film when I see one, I just don't actively seek them out. I've never seen any of the Evil Dead series and am therefore unfamiliar with Mr Raimi's works.<br/><br/>I went into this film knowing nothing. I've recently moved from one country to another so I haven't been keeping up-to-date on new films in cinemas. I've seen no trailer, promotional materials or anything for this film, so I went in knowing absolutely nothing except that my friends wanted to see it. I was not expecting what I saw.<br/><br/>I have a confession to make: I thought it was a comedy. Hand on heart, honest to God, after some of the first shock moments, the deadpan delivery of lines by the heroine, the gratuitous goo and chin-sucking (mentioned in other reviews) and some of the witty dialogue in the bank and the dinner party scenes, I thought this whole thing was more like ""Severed"". Some sort of elaborate parody of every cliché in the horror genre. From the first frame to the end credits and the car ride home, I thought this was something akin to ""Not Another Stupid Horror Movie"". However, whereas ""Severed"" had some genuinely gruesome and shocking moments, only a few scenes in this film actually gave me a jump. After a while, I thought that this lacklustre dark comedy wasn't quite as funny as I initially expected. After one too many uses of the deafeningly loud creaking gate, wind and house creaks, I thought Sam Raimi and co. were really milking some of their jokes. During the car fight, I chuckled. The séance? I chuckled. The goat? That was just ridiculous. Even for a parody of the genre, that seemed a step way too far.<br/><br/>Imagine, then, my complete surprise when I come to IMDb to see that this is genuinely meant to be a horror film! Folks, there are only two bits in this film which are actually scary in any way SPOILERS: a quick flash of tortured images and fire when the fortune teller takes the heroine's hand, and a dream sequence involving an open window and an unexpected bedfellow. That's it. END SPOILERS. The rest of the film is just plain silly. As a comedy, it's not great. As a horror film? The fact that I didn't even recognise it as such may be the biggest indication I can give.<br/><br/>I left the cinema thinking that it was one of the strangest attempts at black humour I'd seen. After reading some of the reviews on this site, I don't even know what to think any more. This film has stumped me. At least I now know: never let my friends choose films that I don't know of."

Compares poorly with the claustrophobia of 'The Orphanage' or reality -shock -horror of 'Eden Lake', or the black comedy of 'The Chidren', for me the three great scary films of the past year...

","After up and coming bank employee Christine Brown (Lohman) rejects Mrs Ganush's (Raver) requests for a mortgage extension, Brown is subjected to a hellish curse.<br/><br/>Drag me to Hell has been a hugely anticipated film owing to the fact almost 30 years ago Sam Raimi started a series known as The Evil Dead which generated a fan base so huge it rivals his current Spider-man series and taking a break from the web-slinger, Raimi has returned to the horror genre, and what a return.<br/><br/>It has been over 20 years since Evil Dead II was first screened and the genre has changed somewhat since then. Advances in the CGI department have generated more scares and the sharp change of filming digitally in The Blair Witch Project has altered perceptions of the type of horror we fans expect to see.<br/><br/>Where Drag me to Hell uses these sharp advantages to generate sharp thrills and scares, it doesn't deflect any imagination and enjoyment away from the story which is pulsating and exciting in every connotation. Sharp jumpy montages, quick flashes of the frightening Lorna Raver, inhumane punishment and shocking sickening violent sequences make the film a true horror that scares on numerous bases.<br/><br/>Having seen The Exorcist a few nights before viewing this Raimi picture, I was looking forward to another revitalised debate over the significance of hell vs heaven and possible science vs religion. No such ideology was particularly evident but there is no question that this 2009 release picks up the concept of hell in a sharp flaming representation that is stunningly directed and written by Raimi.<br/><br/>Shaun of the Dead, released a few years before this, brought a wonderful sense of comedy to the concept of horror to supernatural beings and where the intention here is to scare, there are a few laughs brought around here. One is the use of the goat at the séance, Justin Long's oblivious nature towards supernatural concepts and the on job rivalry of Brown and Stu Ribbin (Reggie Lee) is bitter but well intentioned.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman brings a sharp significance to the relevance of Brown in how she deals with the eventual curse. Justin Long brings some comedy to the plot where Raver is so convincing and scary you may just have to look away every time she appears.<br/><br/>The character development in the story plays a pivotal relevance to the running of everyday life. There is a strong use of karma in this film, played with the nature of good versus evil. Brown's rejection of the old lady's pleas was made without much consideration for Ganush and the repercussions are astounding. As well as the character writing, Raimi is establishing the balance of everyday against the supernatural well.<br/><br/>Drag me to hell therefore is a shocking and scary revamp for the director who brings a sense of realism to fantasy that should delight any Evil Dead fan."

","I have been waiting for this movie for 12 years. 12 years ago, I met Bruce Campbell and discovered Army Of Darkness. That led me to Evil Dead. Evil Dead changed me. I had never seen anything like it before. It was the most terrifying, gory film I had ever seen. It led me to become a rabid Bruce Campbell and Sam Raimi fan. Being a big fan of Raimi, I have seen and enjoyed most all of his films and I think this may his best ever. The beginning of the film hearkens back to The Evil Dead and really sets the tone for what is to follow. This is the most intense film I have seen in a long time. At the end of the film, I remember sort of exhaling, relaxing, and realizing that I had been on one edge of my seat or the other for the past 99 minutes. See this movie!!!"

"bburns","6","0","2","8 June 2009"," Where's Bruce Campbell when you need him?
","I suspected as much when I saw ""Spider-Man 3"", and it's been confirmed with ""Drag Me to Hell"": Sam Raimi has forgotten how to make fun movies. This is not an easy thing for me to admit, as I have been a Raimi fan ever since I first saw ""Darkman"" in college at the Texas Union theater.<br/><br/>When I heard from numerous critics and fans that ""Drag Me to Hell"" was Raimi's return to his early style, I bought my ticket enthusiastically. Unfortunately, that enthusiasm was misplaced. The unabashed silliness that made the ""Evil Dead"" trilogy and ""Darkman"" such fun to watch was seriously muted. Instead of the over-the-top, tongue-in-cheek acting styles of Bruce Campbell or Frances McDormand, we get Alison Lohman and Justin Long in the lead roles, both playing it straight. This wouldn't be so bad if they weren't such mediocre actors.<br/><br/>And instead of the comic-book-style dialog that I have come to expect from Raimi's films (especially now that he is best known for the ""Spider-Man"" trilogy), the movie treats us to stifling discussions about mortgages and bank policies, and a serious debate between a psychology professor (Long) and a fortune teller (Dileep Rao) about the respective merits of Freud vs. Jung.<br/><br/>But the real disappointment is that there was no splatter! When I see a Sam Raimi horror flick, I expect various body parts to be severed and lots and lots of blood. Instead, this movie settles for an off-screen animal sacrifice. The only truly funny part was at the wake for the evil old crone (Lorna Raver as Mrs. Ganush was the only actor to get into the spirit of things). And the only truly scary part was the séance near the end. The rest of the film's horror set-pieces rehash what was done before (and better) in ""Poltergeist"".<br/><br/>Judging from ""A Simple Plan"", ""The Gift"", and the non-FX parts of ""Spider-Man 2"", I know that Sam Raimi can do serious drama as well as anyone else. But when I see his name attached to a horror flick, I expect ultra-violent, unapologetically goofy fun. And Bruce Campbell! 6 out of 10."

","Seeing the trailer (which in my opinion, didn't make the film look all that interesting) and hearing some mixed opinions from schoolmates about the film, I wasn't too enthusiastic about this movie.<br/><br/>But, after the premier, I noticed it's impressive 95% ""Fresh"" rating on Rottentomatoes.com, and this being one of the only horror movies in what, 2 years(?), that has been rated fresh on Rotten Tomatoes, I thought I would give it a shot.<br/><br/>And I'm glad I did! Drag Me to Hell had me on the edge of my seat practically the entire time. Also, the black comedy in it made it all the more enjoyable.<br/><br/>I was a little skeptical about Justin Long; mind you, he plays his role well, I just couldn't help but think someone a little more...mature looking should have had his part.<br/><br/>That small gripe aside, Drag Me to Hell was one of the most enjoyable movie experiences I've had in a while, and I would recommend it to any horror fan out there."

","In 1981 I was fortunate enough to take a chance on a first time director's movie at The Edinburgh Film Festival. The subtlety of the movie's title - The Evil Dead - caught my eye and I was transfixed with terror as Sam Raimi treated us to a low budget classic. Of course time has passed and Raimi has climbed the Hollywood ladder and now directs Spiderman. So I was delighted to find that he was back in the horror genre, this time with a big budget, but an unknown cast. and a great title...Drag me to Hell.<br/><br/>I took my 14 year old daughter Ria along to see it, on her request, having warned her that it was no ordinary scary movie. That it was the real deal.<br/><br/>""Jesus Christ."" she shrieked about 15 times as jump after jump assailed us.<br/><br/>The publicity says this; ""Christine Brown has a good job, a great boyfriend, and a bright future. But in three days, she's going to hell."" It's a comment on our times. The first Credit Crunch horror movie and a lesson that if you mess with gypsy women over their mortgages you'll get what you deserve in return.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi makes sublime horror movies. He's taken on board Hitchcock's theory that 20 minutes of suspense are worth 20 seconds of horror but he condenses this. You get many, many more shocks per square yard with Raimi than you ever did with Hitchcock and yet he never overdoes them. But they come at you in wave after wave. And the humour is brilliant. He really likes a bit of sicko stuff along the way and makes the most of this.<br/><br/>Blood, snot, vomit, embalming fluid, they all get a run for their money. We see popped eyeballs, stapled eyeballs, flies entering orifices you wouldn't want flies in if it was you, limbs eaten whole, animals killed and mutilated. We get fleeting shadows, whispers, banging doors, flashbacks, mysterious winds and subliminal framing.<br/><br/>We get NOISE. This film is so loud that even my mother could hear it.<br/><br/>Every single trick in the horror (and comedy horror) book is used. Is it clichéd? Not a bit of it.<br/><br/>An instant classic that climaxes perfectly. (Maybe it could even win Oscars?) 10 out of 10. Perfection."

The audiences so far have been lapping up the on screen horrors in abundance and in all honesty so have I! As I sidestepped the adverts prior to the main feature, I took to my seat and waiting in anticipation.<br/><br/>Luckily and thankfully I wasn't disappointed in the slightest! From Christopher Young haunting score, through to director of photography Peter Deming dizzying camera work, this was a joy to behold from the get go.<br/><br/>It must be said, that despite director co-writer Sam Raimi's diverse change in filmography down through the years, it was always go to be the horror scene that his name would be most associated with, sure enough with the assistance of Peter Deming and a script co-written with his brother Ivan, this movie, although somewhat reminiscent of Evil Dead 2 hits every mark, in terms of style and content.<br/><br/>Another plus is the excellent cast, although Justin Long plays a pivotal role in the movie as the boyfriend, this movie truly is the Alison Lohman Show.<br/><br/>Just like Bruce Campbell's character in the Evil Dead trilogy, Raimi puts his female lead through the cinematic emotional ringer from the get go.<br/><br/>Not only is Alison Lohman one sexy young lady but she can really deliver the goods on screen, at certain points in the movie my jaw near dropped at the sight of her on screen dilemmas as they unfolded, just when you think you've discovered which way the story is going to go, you find yourself having to think again.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi has returned to the horror fold, perhaps for but a short time, but for ninety plus minutes he has crafted one excellent chiller! As with most horror movies, we the audience more often than not expect the obligatory twist.<br/><br/>As previously mentioned, such was the delirium on screen, that ending truly delivered the goods.....as I have said to many a customer, watch out for that ending! Phew what a scorcher! My one and only hope, no matter what Drag Me To Hell makes at the box office, be it here in the U.K. or overseas, I sincerely hope that Ghost House Pictures don't feel the need to carry on the story with a sequel...<br/><br/>The notion of Drag Me To Hell Too doesn't sound quite so inviting.<br/><br/>My rating for this movie, without hesitation, is 10/10"

"dfranzen70","7","0","3","7 June 2009"," Raimi's latest is frightening - except when Justin Long shows up
","A put-upon loan officer (Alison Lohman) denies a mortgage extension to an old woman, who subsequently puts a horrific curse on her that damns the soul to, well, hell. Sam Raimi’s horror tale is very stylish, as expected, although it lags during the quieter moments, particularly when Justin Long (as Lohman’s boyfriend) is around.<br/><br/>Christine Brown (Lohman) is trying to get promoted to assistant bank manager by her officious boss (played by David Paymer), who favors Christine’s brown-nosing coworker Stu. One fine day, a woman (Lorna Raver) pleads with Christine for help with her mortgage; knowing her boss wouldn’t want her to grant another extension, Christine denies the woman, thus incurring her wrath. Said wrath includes a brutal attack in an underground parking garage (nothing good ever happens there in movies, you know), as well as at Christine’s house.<br/><br/>Watching this movie demands a certain amount of disbelief suspension, more so even for your typical horror movie. At one point, the old woman puts her fist through Christine’s mouth, with no repercussions. Another time, Christine actually hurls an office supply into the woman’s eyeball. Again, no real damage. In fact, after that first physical encounter in the parking garage, both women probably should have died three or four times.<br/><br/>As I mentioned, the movie lags whenever there’s no true horror going on, as if Raimi wasn’t quite sure what to do with all of his secondary characters. Lohman has good chemistry with Long, but that’s about the only positive: Long himself is wooden, a lightweight even by horror-movie standards, so although the two actors seem to connect, their scenes together seem flat, almost forced. And that’s not all of it, either. There’s an (understandably) awkward dinner with Long’s parents, a high-minded, upper-crust family, that doesn’t resonate as much as if ought to. You pay more attention to Long’s jerkish parents (particularly his snotty mother) than to Lohman’s curse-related issues.<br/><br/>It’s important to note, though, that the horror scenes are unbelievably scary. The film opens with an electric scene in which a young boy is literally dragged to the bowels of hell before his parents’ eyes, all because he swiped a gypsy woman’s necklace. And every action scene thereafter is powerful, gross, stylish stuff. (In fact, for a PG-13 movie, the scenes are very intense - I think standards have changed just a tad over the past couple of decades.) Bottom line: It’s a good-looking horror movie with many genuinely terrifying moments that are offset only slightly by Justin Long’s annoying performance and character interactions that lag and seem out of place."

","Pure Awesomeness! Are the words I use to describe Sam Raimi's new horror movie. Alright, so I seen this movie just the other night so it's good to write this up now while everything is still partially fresh in my mind. I went in with expectations of the first two Evil Dead movies (Good thing to do if you've seen those movies and liked them). So if you've seen the trailer and read the synopsis above you know that the character of Christine Brown is cursed by a gypsy woman after denying another extension on her mortgage payments.<br/><br/>PROS: -Good use of humor with scares (There's a scene that was brilliant that involves a mild scare and then when you think it's over something else happens that would seem stupid to scream about but if you're a girl and easily scared you will anyway. Trust me there were like five girls in the rows behind me that did.)<br/><br/>-Almost makes up for all of the Japanese horror remakes that have plagued our movie screens(Don't reuse art by taking the art out and calling it gold!).<br/><br/>-Sam Raimi's Back!(Please make a new Evil Dead movie!)<br/><br/>CONS: -The actress in the lead role was the least talented of the cast, sometimes she showed no emotion. <br/><br/>-Some people might find this movie too goofy and too disgusting.<br/><br/>Finally: Go see it or you'll be cursed (Plus it's cool to go in the theater and say to the person working at the ticket counter ""Drag me to hell"")<br/><br/>SPOILER One more thing, that possessed goat was great. I was hoping for a crazy puppet like creature and that's what I get. But it wasn't in too long."

","Drag Me To Hell is a truly refreshing horror movie that makes you tingle with anticipation, just waiting for what you know is going to be a horrific ending! The movie starts out with a Hispanic family frantically rushing to a womens house. The little boy has been cursed by the Lamia and it is his third day, also known as his last. Suddenly, the windows shatter and creepy shadows dance on the walls, somehow slapping all of the adults to the ground. The boy tries to run, and falls off a balcony. He lifts himself up and is okay, but then the floor starts to break. He is then dragged to hell.<br/><br/>This scene really sets up the anticipation in the movie. It makes you think ""Woah! This movie is going to rock!"" And yes, I suppose you could say that.<br/><br/>During the opening credits there are all of these deranged and disturbing pictures of what happens when someone is cursed by the Lamia, including a picture off someone being dragged to hell. I am picky about a movie's opening credits, and I think this one delivers! It sets up the mood for the movie, and gives you goosebumps! The movie then skips to Alison Lohman's character, Christine. You see her eyes peering at the Assistant Manager's spot that is still empty. She also glances at Stu, the one man that stands in her way of getting that promotion.<br/><br/>Suddenly, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver) is tapping Christine's desk. She asks for an extension on her home, and Christine goes to ask her boss. He's says if she wants the promotion she'll have to make tough decisions, and because of this Christine doesn't give Mrs. Ganush the extension.<br/><br/>This angers Mrs. Ganush, most definitely, and she puts up quite a fight until security eventually drags her out, leaving Alison puzzled. Mr. Jacks comes out and tells her that she handled the situation perfectly, which makes her beam with joy. Yet, a hint of worry twinkles in her eyes.<br/><br/>This is when the horror unravels. As each scene progresses, Christine grows more and more restless, which is exactly what the Lamia wants. Her boyfriend doesn't believe her, and she believes all hope is lost. The Lamia enjoy scaring the living hell out of people, and Christine is no exception. Whether its shoving her fist in Christine's mouth, or puking on her four times, the Lamia don't offer mercy.<br/><br/>The story line of this movie is quite good, and I'm proud of Raimi for it. His last good film was The Grudge, which didn't get as much credit as it deserved. Anyway, every scene in the movie matters, and it doesn't drag on like some movies. For instance, The Haunting in Connecticut. Every scene had scares, but eventually it just became tiresome. In Drag Me To Hell, there are scares in most of the scenes, but each and every scene actually matter in the story line.<br/><br/>I must say that Raimi also did an excellent job of putting comedy right where it was needed. If a scene was a little awkward because Christine saw the Lamia doing something, her boyfriend (Justin Long) would smile wearily, causing the audience to bust a gut. It was a very good blend of horror and comedy. But don't think of it as a horror/comedy like Hatchet, because the horror really is in here! All in all, Drag Me To Hell is an intense roller Coaster of scares, thrills, and nail-biting scenes! The Lamia fails to disappoint in every grueling scene, and the audience can't stop screaming! So, in the end, Drag Me To Hell is a very refreshing horror movie which leaves the whole audience cheering as the credits start to roll!"

"DICK STEEL","7","0","3","6 June 2009"," A Nutshell Review: Drag Me To Hell
","This film sucks a lot. As if the mouth tends to get in the way and having stuff shoved deep into it, be it the chin or even an entire arm socked right into it. Or at least that's one of the images that got is now permanently scarred in my head. With its copious amounts of drool salivating out from mouths, extremely wet slobbering and dribbling from lips, Drag Me to Hell is erm, deliciously frightening yet funny at the same time, thanks to Sam Raimi going back to his horror roots and delivering one thrilling ride with an old school flavour to it.<br/><br/>Raimi has shown that he has that flair of combining shock-horror techniques, and I mean really shock-horror with the usual bag of tricks of noises building up to beating crescendos, light and shadow play, and a multitude of boo-worthy moments with in-your-face nightmarish imagery, he also has this touch of humour thrown into it all, many times causing you to scream and yet laugh at the same time at the silliness of it. <br/><br/>In between the scary episodes which were very well designed, there's this theme of self- preservation running strongly throughout. I guess anyone in the right mind, if they have to go to the underworld, would do so only if dragged there, because there's this innate need within us that automatically kicks in for self-preservation or during the advancement of self- interest.<br/><br/>What I enjoyed about Drag's protagonist Christine Brown, is how a tough-as-nails cookie she is. I had wondered how it would have played out if Ellen Page had not left the project, but Alison Lohman, for all her daintiness, proved to be no pushover either as she really exhibited plenty of spunk and found some inner strength to sock it to her opponents when it mattered. You'll find yourself rooting for her as she sometimes turn the table around and emerge victorious, but soon enough you'll understand that the evil forces that lurks in dark corners may prove to be a little challenging for a mere mortal, especially since it comes in the form of a real battering ram.<br/><br/>One of the better things here is how the trailer didn't spoil everything for you, leaving some room for a lot more surprises up the filmmakers' sleeves, such as the car park scene so prominently featured in the trailer, having a lot more to do in the film with the set up of the hex, that made you root a lot more for Christine. Then the special visual effects in this film didn't disappoint. Without going over the top or overly reliant on computer generated imagery, it's a visual extravaganza beautifully crafted for this roller-coaster of a ride. However on the whole, the story got pretty predictable fairly quickly, and the ending was somewhat akin to waiting for that one big practical joke to deliver its expected punchline before calling it quits. Still fun though, watching it play out as intended.<br/><br/>Hollywood horror churned out more misses than hits with all its lacklustre remakes, more often than not of the Asian horror films, but Sam Raimi has shown the way that there's still some glimmer of hope in the genre by Hollywood if they'd stopped their reliance of adapting from others, and rely a little on their own ingenuity to thrill and entertain. OK Sam, could you get back to work on Spidey 4 now?"

Drag Me To Hell shows that Sam Raimi has not lost his horror mojo, despite it having been 17 years since Army of Darkness.

","The following is a review of the latest Sam Raimi masterpiece, Drag Me To Hell.<br/><br/>'Drag Me To Hell' is pretty self-explanatory, and the plot is very basic, something that Raimi has done in the past. The plot, like Evil Dead, seems so far-fetched and corny that you would very much try to avoid watching it. However, the amount of entertainment that 'Drag Me To Hell' possesses is almost overwhelming. It was quite a shocker, and one hell of a cinematic experience. It's the 'Evil Dead' of the 21st century, and can't possibly let you down in any way. With this film, Raimi has brought back his signature pulpy, stylish directing style with a bang. I thought I would just be sitting through your usual, clichéd melodramatic horror flick. What I got was a series of unflinching non-clichés that come so unexpectedly, like for instance the scene leading up the ""curse"" sequence near the beginning in the parking garage. Now I'm not going to give anything away, but get ready for one hell of a thrill. And don't be afraid to laugh, the situations in this film are hugely amusing and darkly comical.<br/><br/>And now onto the acting. It's not that bad, and it's not the best. But, trust me, you won't be worried about the acting while watching this movie. However, Lohman does give quite a good performance in this film, much better than one might think. Simply enough, if you're a fan of even the Spider-Man movies you'll enjoy this. Raimi incorporates the same directorial techniques all the way around. However, in order to get a grip on the kind of direction/writing and acting that this film will possess, I suggest you watch the original Evil Dead movies, most preferably 'Evil Dead 2.' That's a good film to compare this to.<br/><br/>I've read many comments on this board that talk about Raimi's use of CGI, as being a bit ""over-used."" Now, if your a fan of his original 80s trilogy, this doesn't use those same kinds of visual ""techniques."" But I wouldn't be too worried if I were you, it definitely adds to the scare effect.<br/><br/>Finally, I would just like to note how refreshing it is to see an original and audacious as this. The ending will leave you quite satisfied, with a very nice touch of hugely dark comedy, reminiscent of the infamous ending to ""Dr. Strangelove or: How I Learned To Stop Worrying And Love The Bomb."" Enjoy."
"IrockGswift","Null","0","2","5 June 2009"," A living nightmare
","Sam Raimi knows how to make the main character become a tormented victim in his movies like Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead,Tobey Maguire in Spider-man and Alison Lohman who plays Christine. This movie focus mainly on a woman named (Christine) who is cursed by ill old lady who want an extension on her mortgage. Christine who's only doing her job cannot grant her an extension because the old lady maxed out her extension requirements on her mortgage. I felt sorry for Christine because she felt she had to prove herself to her boss by during what is required to move up a position. Thus living day to day with hellish visions of the old lady and being attack by unseen forces and menacing looking shadows. I think that old lady Ms.Ganish sold her soul to the devil to make a young lady suffer and anticipate a terrible fate. Just like that this old lady come out of the blue and make a innocent young lady's life a living hell is every evil. Ain't like this young lady portrayed to be a spoiled rich heir,she was only trying to make a living and court her boyfriend. This movie wasn't as scary as the previews portrayed it but most of the scenes were hilarious like the old lady biting Christine's face with no teeth in her mouth,and while going to the cemetery and a handkerchief comes to life and attacks Christine. If I was a kid I probably would have been scared. For its terrifying scenes I'm surprise it's only rated PG-13. This movie in my opinion is more of a psychological thriller than a straight horror movie because its suspense and empathy for victim(Christine). I not going to give the movie away but just imagine your life could end a few days later in a horrible way. Drag me to hell makes you wonder,that is why it wasn't a bad movie. This is the type of movie that keeps you thinking wondering what she's going to do next."
"TdSmth5","9","0","3","5 June 2009"," The Evil Dead rises again
","After having made millions directing CGI movies, Sam Reimi returns to horror. And it's a success. Drag Me to Hell is a return to 80s style horror, from the title screen to the Universal pictures logo.<br/><br/>Things start off with an intro decades ago. Mexican parents bring a child to an old church to be treated by a healer. Things go very wrong.<br/><br/>In the present, Christine is a bank employee with self-esteem issues competing for a promotion to assistant manager. One day an old gypsy woman arrives and asks her bank not to kick her out of her home for lack of payment. Christine trying to exercise some assertiveness and to ingratiate herself with her boss refuses. The woman puts a curse on her in a hilarious fight sequence in an underground garage. There she rips a button off Christine's jacket, uses it for the curse and returns it to her.<br/><br/>Christine boyfriend, the guy from the Mac ads, who unless he learns how to act will always be that guy, tries to play a psychologist who just got tenure at a university. Christine now starts seeing and hearing things. She decides to see a palm reader. He sees the evil that haunts her but tries to avoid giving her more info.<br/><br/>As things get worse and worse for Christine the palm reader tells her about the spirit that haunts her and that in 3 days she'll go to hell unless she appeases the spirit. That appeasement involves animal sacrifices, something she as a vegetarian and animal activist opposes. But when the demon thrashes her around her own house, she's forced to act.<br/><br/>The animal sacrifice doesn't exactly appease the demon and the next step is to try to exorcise the demon and place it in a goat, which in turn has to be slaughtered. The palm reader arranges for this to take place in the old Christian orthodox church and invites some help from the healer who was in the intro scene, a guy with a machete, and a goat. I won't reveal how it all turns out, but there are some twists and turns, including Christine wrestling the old gypsy woman, who by now is well dead and buried.<br/><br/>This movie is very much in the style of The Evil Dead and would have been a more fitting third sequel than Army of Darkness. Many sights are reminiscent of the original: creepy trees that look like they're moving, Christine raising her arm out of a grave- that is the cover art image of The Evil Dead. Alison Lohman who plays Christine gets lot kudos for putting up with a lot of abuse, real and digital.<br/><br/>As I mentioned above, this movie has a feel of an 80s film, there are bits of silence, the music is not as loud and intrusive as in most film today. While not very gory it has lots of scares and gross out moments. This is a nice and honest ghost story that will have you jumping out of your seats often, that'll make you laugh at the astonishing things that happen to our character. It could have used some more gore perhaps, but it does the job and is very entertaining."
"spinnock_durav","9","0","2","5 June 2009"," A simple plot that is thoroughly covered with plenty of psychological scares
","Overall, in my opinion, it was a highly entertaining movie with the right amount of scares and with a good touch of gore. This movie doesn't give you the over-the-top gore scenes like it does in movies like 'Frontiers' and the 'SAW' series. This movie focused more on the psychological scares rather than the gore aspect. Even though this movie ran for only about an hour and a half or so, the plot of the story was simple enough that it could be thoroughly covered in that frame of time.<br/><br/>The movie not only provided scares but there was possibly also a comical aspect to it. One instance is in a scene where the already deceased Ganush gypsy woman throws up brown colored bile on Christine's face. Another instance is in a scene in the office when Christine, who seemed to have a minor nose bleed, sprays blood from her nose on her overly concerned boss.<br/><br/>Another refreshing aspect to the movie is that the movie doesn't have your usual happy ending.<br/><br/>On a final note, I felt that the ending was a good lesson for us to double check before committing to a particular course of action.(the button)"
"jaylex_ffxi","10","0","4","5 June 2009"," A brilliant film with both humour and horror aspects
","Right of the bat you are going to be half expecting another unborn film, but to be completely honest, this film wipes the floor with that film. It was not what I expected at all.<br/><br/>What I find with most of the new horror films is that the ""scare"" scenes are always predictable and you know EXACTLY what is going to happen, when and where, with this film those scares are almost always unpredictable, and just when you think something is about to come it never does, leaving you on that ever longing sense of anticipation waiting for something to happen. This is a definite bonus for the film.<br/><br/>The second thing that I found to be a real winner with this film was that it had a lot of comic value in it and moments that make you laugh out of your chair, when I went to see it with friends a few days ago the whole cinema was laughing and we were in hysterics at some of the films cheesier scenes.<br/><br/>The story isn't something that some of us haven't sketched in the back of a school book, but its not a bad story, and the way the film was written and filmed fully makes up for that so it really doesn't matter that it isn't something wonderful and unique, showing that a film doesn't need a completely new idea to be successful.<br/><br/>On a scale of 10 this film deserves the 10/10 marker as it really goes that extra mile, after watching this you can tell a lot of effort, laughs and giggles were put into this film to make it what it is. If you haven't seen it, stop stalling on here and get out there and watch it, go with friends and have a laugh, it's well worth the money."

","I loved this film, Raimi went back to his roots for this one, including his Delta 88 once again. I have to admit I was skeptical, but after seeing this, it made me even more excited for the new Evil Dead! As disappointing as it was not seeing Bruce Campbell in a cameo, this film thrived off of the Raimi cam, humorous moments, shocks, over the top acting and Raimi's usual gruesome yet hilarious effects (false teeth). I loved the fact that it was so like Evil Dead, I loved the fact that it was original in the sense that it incorperated humor along with horror and most of all I loved that Raimi came back to the genre in general.

"aeginadevas-1","9","0","2","4 June 2009"," One hell of a movie!
","When a movie trailer excites me, half of the time I am disappointed when I go to see the film. Drag me to hell certainly did not disappoint! This is a fantastic horror film that owes its success to the ""folk-tale"" simplicity of its plot. I find that most of today's horror films are reminiscent of S & M porn which is so awfully banal. In the West, we live in a bubble of atheism and technology where we seem to have forgotten that Hansel & Gretel was a f****** scary bedtime story - this is what the film has gotten right. <br/><br/>Christine Brown is like any other ambitious country bumpkin who will find success in the city and marry out of the ""farm"". The idea of a sinister old gypsy placing such a terrible curse on her - well that's out of the question, it just couldn't happen in a life so normal, so Apple Mac. She's a girl with a good heart but, alas, society has brainwashed her and she is plagued by human weaknesses such as vanity and greed which momentarily stunts her compassion towards Mrs Ganush. Unfortunately, she pays for it dearly and no promotion, generous boyfriend or new coat can gloss over her mistake. <br/><br/>This is a great story that makes us ponder on whether we should drop a coin in the hat of a passing beggar even if he is a nuisance or give up our seat for an invalid on the subway. We toil hard to remain groomed and smelling good to escape the stink and grittiness that lies so close to home. This is the power in the film. However commercial the script is, you can't say it isn't clever about hitting that point. This is highlighted throughout the film in the constant presence of a fly and especially in the scene of Mrs Ganush's wake, when Christine suddenly finds herself in the heart of Eastern Europe's filthy beer drinking gypsies. <br/><br/>Lorna Raver delivers a fantastic performance as Mrs Ganush, she is able to extract empathy from the audience as well as utter disgust and loathing. Alison Lohman is also perfectly cast as Christine Brown, average looking and timid but through mental torture she develops some backbone. Yes there are some moments of comedy where you can picture Raimi getting a little over excited with the CGI crew but on the whole, it keeps you on the edge of your seat. <br/><br/>This is not a movie I expect to see in an OAP nursing home's DVD collection, so hurry up and watch it!"

The tag line for the movie gives you the basic premise. It kinda says what you get on the tin so to speak. Throughout the film there are scenes of intense horror. *What a freaky gypsy witch, my God!* and, to lighten it up, there are scenes of surreal weird comedy, almost to the point it was like some sadistic Looney Tunes cartoon *One word, anvil* as well as possibly the funniest dinner table/meet the parents scene I've seen in a while. The parents' reaction is very amusing.<br/><br/>In short, a light-hearted fun film that should scare and amuse in equal measure. Not to be taken seriously but just one large slice of fun!"

","Overall, I really enjoyed myself. I felt the advertising was a bit misleading on this one though, as it was more Evil Dead 2 than Evil Dead (meaning, more of a comic horror movie as opposed to a straight up horror film). I won't hold the adverts against the movie though, start to finish is was pretty enjoyable with plenty of a laugh out loud or OMG moments. We even had one stupid girl walk out on the movie (she saw a goat, and she couldn't handle what was or wasn't about to happen to it!). I see TONS of horror movies every year, and this was a nice refreshing change of pace back to Sam's older movies, or Peter Jackson's. As a straight up horror movie, this one has its fair share of scares, but I think it works better as a kind of tongue in cheek horror movie.<br/><br/>You want fun/GROSS/horror, go see Drag Me To Hell!"
"3xHCCH","8","0","3","4 June 2009"," Perfect Blend of Horror and Comedy
","""Drag Me To Hell"" is the latest opus of Spiderman director Sam Raimi. He also wrote this screenplay. I know that Sam Raimi is a skilled horror director by reputation, but I admit that I have not yet seen his Evil Dead series. We get glimpses of this talent particularly in Spiderman 2 where there is an overextended scene in the operating room with chainsaws. I made sure that I saw this film on the big screen.<br/><br/>The story is about a mousy loan officer of a small town bank named Christine Brown. In her desperate effort to impress her boss to gain a promotion, she decided to stand firm and reject an extension to the loan of an old Gypsy woman named Mrs. Ganush. Of course, you know she made a big mistake in crossing and shaming this woman in public. From that day on, we witness her world turn into a veritable living hell. Furthermore, the curse inflicted on her also included the threat that her soul will be dragged into the fires of actual Hell within three days.<br/><br/>This whole film was a very wild ride. It was done with tongue fully in cheek. It is preposterous and over-the-top, but you know it was done on purpose. The first fight encounter between Christine and Mrs. Ganush in the car sets the incredulous pace for the scares to come. Just sit back and enjoy the relentless tension, the jump-out-of-your-seat scares, the loud yet effectively scary cacophony of the musical score and sound effects, the disgusting overflow of bodily fluids, etc...<br/><br/>The main reason for the success of this film lies on the antagonist, rather than the protagonist. Mrs. Ganush is certainly one of the most memorable cinematic ghouls since Sadako! Her decayed teeth (actually dentures), her sharp fingernails, her damaged eyes and her wizened face will surely haunt many a viewer's nightmares. Lorna Raver should be commended for her gruesome performance! My main beef was I do not really like Alison Lohman who played Christine Brown. I did not think she was a very good actress. In fact, her small-girl voice in those lame radio ads almost dissuaded me to watch this. I felt she actually dragged my rating down a bit due to her dismal acting in the lead role, no less.<br/><br/>Overall, I will recommend this film to lovers of horror flicks. This is a notch above the run of the mill screamfests. You will get jumpy. You will cover your eyes. You will cringe. You will cower. You will laugh nervously. Don't take this film experience too seriously because this movie isn't really supposed to be that way. You will be captivated up to (literally) the very last scene."

"neil-476","8","0","2","4 June 2009"," Decent horror with some humour
","Anyone who has ever watched horror movies should know that it's not a good idea to annoy gypsies. Unfortunately for her, this little life lesson appears to have passed Christine Brown by because, in pursuit of a hotly contested promotion at the bank where she is a loan officer, she royally p*sses off an old gypsy woman with the worst upper and lower plates in the history of dentistry. This unpleasant old woman lays a curse on poor Christine (in addition to assaulting her in fairly robust fashion) via a button. This curse is to be applied by a demon called the Lamia, whose modus operandi is to torment the victim for three days before ripping the soul out of them and taking it off to Hell for an eternity of torment. As you do. The rest of the movie is devoted to the aforementioned tormenting, alternating with Christine's increasingly desperate attempts to avoid this fate.<br/><br/>Sam Raimi cut his directorial teeth on the Evil Dead movies. Full of energy, not to mention grossness and humour, these movies were made on tiny budgets which was inevitably reflected in production values (for all of which they worked marvels with the limited budgets they had). Since then he has enjoyed both critical and financial success (not always with the same film!), and Drag Me To Hell sees him returning to horror with a much bigger budget.<br/><br/>With rare exceptions, it is unfair to judge horror films other than as horror films, and this movie is no exception: it is a straightforward horror, following all the conventions. But it's not a bad one. The story, though familiar, is well told and has some small but pleasing wrinkles (Christine's boyfriend, Justin Long as an intellectual mother's boy) is the standard sceptic, but offers Christine unqualified support despite believing that she's suffering from a kind of post traumatic stress syndrome. There is, as you would expect, an adequate supply of moments to make you jump, The effects are fine, and of a quality which reflects the fact that Raimi is no longer on such a meagre budget as he was 20 years ago. Various subplots maybe aren't made full use of, but this doesn't really matter too much. There is a fair sprinkling of characteristic Raimi (mostly gross-out) humour. The ending won't please everybody, but I thought it was fine. In short, it all works, and perfectly well.<br/><br/>Alison Lohman makes a sympathetic protagonist, but the film is stolen by Lorna Raver - as Mrs Ganush she delivers one of the vilest, most malevolent characters seen on screen for ages. I loved her!"

The film was fast-paced and relatively straight-forward, but you barely notice how quick the story moved because of all the fun, ""gory"", and at many times humorous scare scenes it provided. And yes... the humor and the horror aspect of the film mixed beautifully. So, if you want to see a movie that actually TRIES to be scary, but ends up failing miserably and turns out hilarious for all the WRONG reasons, then see nine out of ten American horror films released in recent years.

Same effects, same gore, same slapstick horror, same thrills, same music, and so on. Do not let the trailer trick you into thinking this movie is anywhere near the last 8 years of awful horror films that made you feel stupid for watching because the trailer made it look terrifying (the unborn). This movie is classic Raimi with a bunch of laughs and fantastic ending, the kind you always want and never get. IT IS NOT SCARY, ITS JUST AWESOME! Its what horror movies should be like, nothing more; some scares that are mostly due to an excellent score and editing, lots of laughs, and a plot not really worth mentioning.<br/><br/>The only thing that this movie was missing and the reason it is not as good a the originals is that it is missing it's Bruce.

"Michael Fargo","7","0","2","3 June 2009"," The goat and the machete
","I won't pretend to score critical points by suggesting this is pretty silly material. But is it scary? I'll sleep well tonight.<br/><br/>It does have style. Taking some of the elements (stylistically and thematically) from Brian De Palma's ""Carrie"" (that's a compliment), we're amused to see an ugly duckling already transforming into a swan. It's more amusing still that she's a loan officer and is faced with a dilemma: Should she deny an extension on a mortgage payment and earn points with her boss or should she give in and extend it to basically do the right thing? <br/><br/>She makes the wrong choice and really pays for it. Alison Lohman serves the material well because she's someone we see as both vulnerable and growing into her own.<br/><br/>The honey-colored cinematography, the almost camp skewering of quite a few California ""types,"" and a pretty good group of actors is wrecked—for me—by the intrusion of incessant loud noises that startle in the first 60 seconds, then become very unwelcome because they fill in for what could be/should be deeper development of character and plot.<br/><br/>And for the record, in horror movies you can't just make up rules on how to break a spell. Okay, a stake through the heart of a vampire is something you can rely that the audience doesn't need schooling on, but anything else needs to be either presented at the beginning and the characters need to accomplish (or not) that very thing. It's lazy (and it's cheating) to just make stuff up as we go along. We lose interest and any investment in what happens if the rules keep changing as the movie proceeds.<br/><br/>The kitten thing was actually funny, but I worried about the goat. I wasn't scaredjust worried."

Yet I was a fan of the Spider Man movies, namely 2, and was interested to see if Raimi could bounce back from the lackluster Spider Man 3. I'm happy to report that he does.<br/><br/>The barometer for a good horror film, in my opinion, is how uncomfortable one feels while watching it. I felt extremely uncomfortable during nearly all of this film. From start to finish, Raimi continually rattles the viewer with jarring, unsettling imagery. And amazingly so, this is all done without the use of blood or gore, which is refreshing considering how over saturated the horror genre has become with over the top bloodshed and gore (Saw and Hostel, I'm looking directly at you). You're not given a second to catch your breath here. Relentless is the word I can use to best describe this movie.<br/><br/>And hey, I'm a happy to report that for once in seemingly forever a horror movie exists that actually contains competent actors. While the movie is intentionally campy at times the performances themselves were actually good. And the film at times was very funny, often times with the laughs and scares arriving at the very same time. This should be good for the film's re-playability because even when the viewer knows where the scare is coming from they'll at least have something laugh at.<br/><br/>Very scary, funny, delightfully campy, and containing performances that don't suck; Drag Me To Hell is a film I'm happy to say I paid to see.

","Sam Raimi comes back to what he does best, and he's picked up a lot of skills on the way. The precision of the camera work, editing and action scenes are pretty much perfection. The fight that takes place at the underground car park is formidable. When the old woman tries to bite her without her teeth in, and she is basically sucking her chin that is so funny. This film, like Evil Dead, is a comedy horror. Sam Raimi is trying to raise a laugh, for sure. So this film shouldn't be taken seriously; Sam Raimi's tongue is firmly in his cheek. That said, there is a fear factor to this film. There were many scares in the film, maybe even too many, but that's why I love Sam Raimi films, because he's not scared of showing you the monsters in full view. There's no blurred figures quickly crossing the camera here. There are clichés however, but they're funny, and they don't bog down the film. Also, there are certain things here that I've seen in Evil Dead, but they are obvious and not a complete copy, but more of a homage. This is a film with a relentless approaching doom that runs from start to finish. Like Evil Dead, this film just gets on with the scares; There's no boring long periods where the director tries to get you to like and sympathies with the main characters. Most horrors these days, will run for 30 minutes before a scary scene pops up. There's none of this here; It's a ride on the roller-coaster from hell from scene one to the final scene. All in all, it's not perfect. Maybe the end was a bit predictable, but I really enjoyed this movie. 90/100. My favorite horror this year, by one of my favorite directors of all time.

"chrisward46","8","0","2","2 June 2009"," The Return of the King!
","It's always a joy when iconic filmmakers rediscover their mojo and make the kind of movies that fans want to see. George A.Romero went back to basics with 'Diary of the Dead', admittedly with mixed results but at least there was an honesty to its execution, whilst Wes Craven and David Cronenberg have both contributed to movies that bear the trademarks of their talents. Sam Raimi has been a favourite with genre fans since 'The Evil Dead' first terrified and amused audiences at the dawn of the video nasty boom of the early eighties, and even though he has gone on to bigger blockbuster action with the 'Spiderman' franchise, he has frequently returned to more spooky fare with production credits on 'The Grudge', 'The Grudge 2', '30 Days of Night' and 'The Messengers'. With 'Drag Me to Hell', though, the inventive director has come full circle and made a movie that easily stands up against his original 'Evil Dead' trilogy.<br/><br/>The story centres around Christine Brown (Alison Lohman), a loan officer in a bank who is a potential candidate for a promotion, if only she could convince her boss (David Paymer) that she can make tough decisions. She is visited at work by an elderly Hungarian gypsy, Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Raver), who is requesting a third extension on her mortgage. After trying to convince her boss to grant the extension, he leaves the decision in Christine's hands, as a way of testing her credentials. After telling Mrs. Ganush that the bank cannot extend her mortgage, the upset pensioner then gets on her knees and begs. Christine calls security to remove her from the building, but Mrs.Ganush takes this as an insult and tries to attack Christine, insisting that Christine has shamed her. When Christine leaves work that evening, she is attacked by Mrs. Ganush (in one of the best scenes of the movie), who takes a button from Christine's coat, places a curse on it and gives it back. Still traumatized, Christine and her boyfriend Clay (Justin Long) pay a visit to Rham Jas (Dileep Rao), a local spiritualist, who tells Christine she has been cursed by a demon called The Lamia, who will torment her for three days before coming to claim her soul and take her to Hell.<br/><br/>So there's your plot. The first thing to say about this movie is how refreshing it is to see this sort of shocker made by somebody who really knows their stuff. The gore is kept to a minimum, but that's because there's no need for it. Raimi has always been able to shock audiences without resorting to gratuitous tactics - 'The Evil Dead' may have had bucketloads of goo, but as those movies went on there was less and less of it, forcing the viewer to invest more in the story. Although the comparisons to the 'Evil Dead' movies are obvious, as well as the shocks and the 'Three Stooges'-esquire slapstick, it is the overall style that Raimi has developed over the years that shines through here, and other earlier works such as 'Darkman' and 'The Quick and the Dead' would prove to be useful reference points - the quick editing, the camera angles, narrative flow and cinematic scope that are present in both of those movies is here, as is Raimi's 'shaky-cam' style of filming. It's also a very loud movie with loads of bangs crashes and subliminal noises that add to the overall atmosphere.<br/><br/>As with almost all of Raimi's movies, the characters are strong and likable - even Mrs. Ganush to start with - and this familiarity with type adds to the action. Lorna Raver's depiction of the scorned gypsy is the very definition of creepy and if there was ever a category for Best Villain at the Oscars then Mrs. Ganush should win hands down. Without trying to give anything away, even in the later scenes when her physical being isn't doing much, she still exudes an air of ghoulish menace. Alison Lohman is a pretty strong lead, and seems to have a good chemistry with Justin Long, even if he comes across as a bit wet. Christine's rival for the promotion at the bank, Stu (ReggieLee), is also a great character who was used well and came across as pretty detestable.<br/><br/>As a whole, 'DMTH' is an absolute triumph of a movie. There are a few slight issues - some dodgy CGI effects, one or two lapses in the script - but no movie is perfect, and as far as this movie is concerned, it's about as close as you're going to get from one of the genres most consistently inventive talents. The only thing that was missing was an appearance from a certain Mr. Campbell, maybe in the role of Milos, the medium's assistant. Considering how the scene involving him plays out, it would have been a great cameo. Overall, though, this is an excercise from a master in how to shock and have fun in equal measure, and although Raimi made the fatal error of making his first movie a classic against which everything he does is measured, this is certainly the best movie he has made since 1982."

","Trammed by ""Spider-Man 3""'s excessive heft, Sam Raimi returns to basics in ""Drag Me to Hell"", placing him back into the slapstick horror department that defined his early film-making career. Unsurprisingly, his latest horror-comedy, as it turns out, functions pretty much in the same vein as his ""The Evil Dead"" series, employing a straightforward supernatural tale to peddle in as much ridiculously over-the-top pulp and madcap cattiness as its R-13 (the local rating) would allow. Devoid of the ungainly qualities of his last superhero project, Raimi pulls no punches this time around in dealing out cartoonish nastiness and the verve he brings forth proves to be amusingly contagious.<br/><br/>Christine (Alison Lohman) is a loan officer whose amiable nature proves to be one of the greatest hindrances in finally bagging that much-coveted assistant manager position, a position that requires decisiveness according to her boss (David Paymer). So when Mrs. Ganush (Lorna Rayver), a scraggly woman with grayish fingernails and sharp crooked teeth, comes at her desk asking for an extension for her home loan, she denies the request despite the old woman's subsequent begging, in an attempt to impress her boss. Poor Christine, as Mrs. Ganush turns out to be a gypsy, unleashing a curse on Christine that torments her for three days before a goat-demon, well, drags her to hell.<br/><br/>The craziness that stems from this, taking off from a hilariously drawn-out altercation between Christine and Mrs. Ganush in a parking lot, comes at such a breakneck pace yet the frenetic onslaught from one comic-horror scheme to another is handled wonderfully by Raimi, who consistently keeps this camp spookfest's tension high. ""Drag Me to Hell"" piles on the ""Gotcha!"" scares like it's going out of fashion, yet the cranked-up effectiveness that Raimi composes makes those delightful jump-out-of-your-seat experience -- punctuated by Lohman's face being the ground zero of icky filth and body orifice projectile -- amusingly deserved."

","I confess to not being a Sam Raimi(sp) fan. I don't dislike the guy, I'm just not familiar with his work. But I do enjoy a good film, and am a fan of Alison Lohman (hard to be believe she once used to be a recurring actress on the WB of all places...see Safe Harbor). So I went and saw this film.<br/><br/>I like a good frightening horror movie as much as anyone else does. More so because this movie didn't rely on an over convoluted plot, buckets of blood and is likely not to spin off five or six follow up films. Drag Me to Hell horrifies and scares the old fashion way, through a simple story and plays with light, shadows and the surroundings of the characters like films did before the writers/directors all worked to out do each other with every succeeding film.<br/><br/>I also have to give special props to Alison Lohman as the films lead. Would have normally expected someone more ""beefier,"" but enjoyed her because of her smaller stature and more innocent vibe. She came across willing to fight/do what it took to survive, while never coming across as a one woman army. Exuded being average like most of us, not extraordinary.<br/><br/>Shame there likely won't ever be a sequel. I know, I know what I said above about horror sequels. But I think Alison could pull off the girl returned from hell... Just a thought.<br/><br/>KB"

","I had a really good time seeing this in the theatre. Anyone contemplating whether or not to wait until it comes out on DVD would really miss out on a great theatrical experience. I don't go to the theatre much anymore for a number of reasons but I'm glad I made it to this.<br/><br/>Raimi still has it. After the less than spectacular Spiderman films...okay, I liked the first one, I thought my Evil Dead director was ""leaving us"" so to speak but the trailers for 'Drag Me to Hell' looked promising so I took a chance and was honestly more than pleased.<br/><br/>My only complaint, like many others, was the use of CGI. This is where<br/><br/>the the spoils of Hollywood really hurt the film but over the past 5 years I've been forgiving genuinely good movies on account of the use of CGI. It's just that Raimi has shown us he can really make stop motion animation work for his films so in a way I felt a little cheated.<br/><br/>Aside from the CGI 'Drag Me to Hell' has got it all and more importantly it was fun to watch. I guess the one last thing I can say is that I was really, really, really hoping it would end a certain way and as flawed as it was to make it happen, it eventually did end the way I thought it should.<br/><br/>Thanks Sam."

","Very few true horror films hold my interest. In fact, MOST horror films I see are only seen by me because of the people I'm with at the time. And at first, I expected this to be fairly standard, your average horror make-up and special effects, some pop-out moments with tremendous music, blah blah blah.<br/><br/>But what I got was a virtual modern-day version of Army of Darkness, another film by Sam Raimi (Which I found hysterical). I consider Drag Me to Hell a comedy with horror elements. And while that may come off as completely idiotic and pointless, there is a level of entertainment emanating from the film that isn't found in any other film. Its over the top, gross-but-not-gory effects make you laugh harder than any comedy you'll see, and as you laugh, you'll only wonder why you're laughing as you couldn't imagine anything worse.<br/><br/>The plot is fairly standard, with no major exceptions or faults, and, surprisingly, the acting is fairly top-notch. Justin Long plays the caring, nerdy boyfriend considerably well, and the co-workers of the main character are quite believable. CGI is fairly standard, as well as make-up, and cinematography.<br/><br/>I rate movies by how well they affect me or how well they entertained me. And while Drag Me to Hell hasn't particularly affected me physically or emotionally, it did fulfill my need for some pointless, over-the-top adult humor."

","Saw a late showing of Sam Raimi's ""Drag me to Hell"", and what can I tell you; mediocre.<br/><br/>I honestly can tell you, I don't think I can trust IMDb ratings anymore after seeing this! as of to date (June 01/2009) it has a rating of 8.3! How?? I can see this having a 6.5. My local theater rated this at 6.9, and I shunned them on having such a low rating...now I can maybe see why.<br/><br/>okay so...the main thing that bugged me the most on this movie was the cheap CGI effects. Mr. Raimi should have either spent a lot more time/money on the effects or had non at all.. I don't know..maybe thats not how it works anymore.<br/><br/>The other thing that bugged me was Alison Lohman's performance....oh god, did she ever do an awful job. Yeah shes cute, yeah her character looked like a perfect fit for her role, I just could not stand her in this movie...can't be to specific.<br/><br/>I'm guessing Mr. Raimi had seen the scare maze video on you-tube a bit too many times. Don't get me wrong, the scares in this are good, but they regulate on loudness. I'm talking about, coming out of nowhere and being VERY loud. If someone were to watch this with lower or moderate volumes, you would not get the same effect as in theaters.<br/><br/>So we will see when this comes out on DVD, and the rating drops, perhaps I am way off though and generally did not think it deserves over a 7 rating. <br/><br/>I will say that it was a very nice change from all the gore-fest remakes that have been spewing out of Hollywood lately."

","I read in Empire that Sam Raimi was making another horror film. I recently back then watched Evil Dead 1 and 2 and I thought ""I've got to see this"".<br/><br/>I just went to see it. Wow he is definitely back. The story is good classic horror dealing with evil. The acting was good and connection with characters was very easy to follow.<br/><br/>The filming and direction were really good, some really good slanted angles in a few scenes.<br/><br/>The suspense and the scare scenes were excellent. They were really in your face and my insides were clutching and jumping. The sound was one of the best things, which makes you feel like you are there.<br/><br/>If you are a hardcore horror fan, this is right up your street. I would recommend seeing The Evil Dead films first, so you can see how Raimi started with horror at the beginning.<br/><br/>I am definitely going to the movies to see it again. I have a feeling you won't be disappointed"

","Christine Brown is an ambitious L.A. loan officer with a charming boyfriend, professor Clay Dalton. Life is good until the mysterious Mrs. Ganush arrives at the bank to beg for an extension on her home loan. Should Christine follow her instincts and give the old woman a break or should she deny the extension to impress her boss, Mr. Jacks, and get a leg-up on a promotion? Christine fatefully chooses the latter, shaming Mrs. Ganush and dispossessing her of her home. In retaliation, the old woman places the powerful curse of the Lamia on Christine, transforming her life into a living hell.<br/><br/>Director Sam Raimi returns to the horror genre in which he was known famous for. Like the previous ""Evil Dead"" films, DMTH is not a serious horror film. One can tell from Universal's very old logo during the first few seconds of the film that it's going to be a B-movie. While it does have its scary scenes, there is a nice balance of horror and comedy here. This is a breath of fresh air, considering many horror movies these days take themselves too seriously that they get laughed for the wrong reasons or that they try to be funny but fail miserably and get laughed for the wrong reasons. Either way, they both get laughed at for the wrong reasons.<br/><br/>If you're jumping out of your skins in the first five minutes of the film, you'll know you're in for a ride. What makes the suspense, scares, and tension in here so effective, as opposed to other horror film, is the use of noise and sound effects. Raimi uses everyday household sound effects to scare us, and they actually work! And yes, this film is scary. The make-up for Mrs. Ganush is very creepy. The score by Christopher Young is also really refreshing, because it's quite original.<br/><br/>For the humorous side of the film, it's really a horror-comedy. The gross-out visuals are disgusting, but you laugh at them anyway because of how outrageous and exaggerated they are. Actually, the whole flick is kind of outrageous, isn't it? This is what makes the film very fun to watch. You jump out of your seat but you laugh it off. This film really does bring the audience in for the ride. For example, there is one scene in which a fly flies to the camera screen, breaking the fourth wall.<br/><br/>The performance by Alison Lohman is really fun to watch. You see her character change from someone innocent to...well, you'll see. Justin Long does decently for what he's given, although it's not that much. Lorna Raver steals the show playing the devilish Mrs. Ganush. However, saying all of this, I can't help but say that I was a bit disappointed in the film overall. Some of the jokes in here are really random and bland. Some of the pop up scenes do get tiring after awhile. Overall, it's a pretty good horror-comedy. The film promises scares and laughs and that's what it gives."
"mm-39","6","0","2","30 May 2009"," not bad
","OK horror movie but redundant. I did not mind the story, but I like the movie Thinner way better. The story goes with a Curse, and a women tries to get it undone. The story is scary in parts, but other parts are just stupid. Way more scarier watching he promo than from actually watching the movie. Strong ending with a twist. The grave scene was over the top. I give the movie a six or seven out of ten. Drag me to hell is a rental or a cheap night movie. Maybe, a date movie too. If you want to watch a better movie which is similar to this one rent Thinner. You will find Thinner a thousand times better. This year has very few horror movie and not many good ones. Usually fall is better for horror movies."
"reeves2002","6","0","5","29 May 2009"," Not as good as 30 days of night but OK!
","I agree with another persons comment on here asking was this supposed to be a comedy? I thought Sam Raimi did an amazing job with 30 days of night.It was dark and scary.This new one was comical and way over the top.It was entertaining though. It had it's jump out of your seat moments but I did not find anything about it scary. It started out with a typical unexplained set of events just to open the movie then goes to present day. I liked how the characters were introduced and found the scene at the bank quite amusing.I hated the scene where the poor little kitten got sacrificed,this was unnecessary.And then the dumb ass remark later on about how one of the characters hated cats yet had one as a pet.Whoever put that crap in this script obviously hates cats! This stupidity is why I gave it a 6 out of 10. Alison Lohman who plays Christine was good in the beginning but then after the cat was killed she got on my nerves.She started lying to her boyfriend about everything and acting really stupid like a complete nutcase offering no explanation to all the weird sh*t that was happening to her and all around her.I don't think she was a good choice for this movie in a leading role.Her acting was horrible and I found myself feeling no sympathy at all for her character.I think the movie would have worked way better if Justin Long was in the lead role as the one that worked at the bank and had been cursed instead,and Alison playing the smaller role as his girlfriend.Even though Justin's role was smaller,he was 10 times better and could have easily pulled it off. As for the plot i've seen this all before so it's nothing new,but it was not the worst movie i've seen!"
