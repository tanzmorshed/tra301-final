","I'll be honest, I don't think any of the reviewers that have given this movie 10 stars have seen any episodes of the show pre-2000.<br/><br/>I went into the movie thinking it would probably be decent. I figured it would probably be in the style of the newer episodes but with better overall material. That's pretty much how it turned out. Anyone who says it was a return to the older *better* Simpsons is kidding themselves.<br/><br/>The Simpsons greatness was based, in my opinion, on two things: characters that we imagine existing in our society (think the comic book guy, Moe, Flanders) and simply hilarious and very quotable lines. This formula has since been replaced by humor that is situationally based, and quite frankly, just not very funny.<br/><br/>I saw this movie yesterday afternoon, and I can hardly think of one line that had me cracking up. There were some funny moments, yes, but nothing comparable to the brilliant one-liners from the show's glory years."
"jdwhite79","7","193","279","27 July 2007"," ""That's good..but not great""
","My thoughts on the movie can be summed up by that Homer Simpson quote above (and if you are the type of person who recognizes that quote and remembers what scene it is from then you probably share my sentiments). <br/><br/>The movie was decent, better than anything produced in the last 5-6 years, but still far short of the glory days (Seasons 5 - 9). <br/><br/>Here is basically what kept this movie from being really great: <br/><br/>1) very minimal focus on supporting characters...some characters (Sideshow Bob, Skinner, Supernintendo Chalmers, Skinner's mother, Apu, Gil, Groundskeeper Willie, Milhouse's parents, Sideshow Mel) were completely nonexistent. Oh, and Flanders (the secondary character who was featured the most) had 1 funny line at most. (the one about Buddha).<br/><br/>2) I understand that a movie needs a much deeper plot since it is much longer than an episode but this was just focused too much on the plot and not enough on creating worthwhile funny gags. Also, episodes usually have 2-3 different ideas going on at the same time but this didn't really (at least outside the Simpson family). There was the whole Simpsons running away which turned into saving Springfield thing. The only other plot ideas were the Homer & Marge (which has been done at least, what 5 times already) and Homer & Bart (which has also been done several times). <br/><br/>3) Most of the humor in the film was shallow, slapstick humor, not the good deep sarcastic, witty humor we've come to know and appreciate (And you call them steamed hams despite the fact that they are obviously grilled..Well, I,..Um, One thing I should....). It seems to me that this movie was clearly made with the masses in mind (as compared to hardcore fans) and the type of humor/jokes reflected this. <br/><br/>An example: I thought the following line was one of the funniest in the movie: Cletus: You know how I'm able to that trick with my thumb Cargill: 4 generations (or 40 years I can't remember which he says) of successful inbreeding? <br/><br/>In the theater like 3 people laughed (and I was one of them). Yet at the start of the movie when Homer was trying to hammer the nail and he jammed the hammer in his eye, the whole crowd (except for me) was going nuts. <br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, I liked the movie..I just didn't love it..I don't remember any lines/gags/scenes which are so memorable as to repeat over and over again (i.e. Pray for Mojo, Steamed Hams, Homer buying the matter transporter--""2 dollars..um, well, I don't know.... I'll give you 35 cents""...)<br/><br/>Oh and one other thing. If you see a review from a person who says that this was the funniest movie ever and non-stop laughs, etc..they probably weren't born before 1990 and haven't seen any Simpsons episodes pre-2000 because there's no way any hardcore tried and true Simpsons fan would have come to that conclusion after seeing this."
"rayato","9","445","696","25 July 2007"," I'm so glad it didn't suck!!!
","Let me just say I had my doubts. The last couple of seasons of 'The Simpsons' have been lackluster at best and I genuinely thought that their chance to make a great Simpsons film passed roughly 10 years ago. BOY WAS I WRONG!!! I am a huge Simpsons nerd and it is my privilege to say that ""The Simpsons Movie"" belongs in the very small group of classic Simpsons episodes (""Bart the Daredevil"", ""Mr. Plow"", etc.) Very funny and very timely. Great animation and some nice cameos.<br/><br/>Really don't want to give any spoilers so I'll just say if you're a Simpsons fan: you will love this movie. And if you agree that the Simpsons lost their edge, you will be pleasantly surprised as was I. 8.5/10"
"ultimecia_omega","6","56","79","30 July 2007"," Not very original or funny
","This post contains some mild spoilers.<br/><br/>The long awaited Simpsons Movie has arrived and at first glance it seems to be doing really well. It's had some good reviews in the media and it's doing well on IMDb. Im not particularly sure why though.<br/><br/>I found The Simpsons Movie to be an overly long episode of the later seasons quality. The ""funny"" gags were few and far between (Spider Pig just was not funny), there wasn't nearly enough screen time for some of the fan favourite characters (skinner, moe, barney...for example) but i can understand its hard to please everyone in such a limited amount of time. The overall plot of the story felt no different to what you might see in your average episode and used the same old routines we have grown tired of (Marge leaving homer, the town of springfield VS simpsons, nelsons laughing are some examples).<br/><br/>The animation was top notch as you would expect and i particularly enjoyed the music which didn't quite feel like your average Simpsons music but i thought it matched the movie quite well.<br/><br/>After such a long wait and much hype i can honestly say i was disappointed with The Simpsons Movie. Perhaps i was expecting too much though. Nevertheless i would still recommend seeing this movie, it was still entertaining and it did have some stellar laugh out loud moments (moe's bar scene was hilarious), just nowhere near enough for a Simpsons Movie. 6/10"

","'The Simpsons' TV show is best in the business for plot twists, outrageous reversals, whiplash satire and one-liners, making the best episodes as satisfying as many great films. Topping that - or even matching it - with the long awaited movie was always going to be a challenge.<br/><br/>I was entertained but, truthfully, no more than a middling episode of the series. The richness of the Springfield lore and background characters is sidelined to focus on the family itself, with too much Homer in particular - yes, I never thought I'd say that, but it's true.<br/><br/>We love 'The Simpsons' for its frenetic pace; it's clear here the writers struggled with the structure for a longer format. Possibly a Robert Altman / 'Nashville' approach would have worked better, or maybe something like ""It's A Mad, Mad, Mad, Mad World"", allowing us to see the great range of characters and supporting a stronger, over-arching story. <br/><br/>The decision to focus almost exclusively on the family itself brought out the TV show's occasional tendency towards sentimentality - Colin & Lisa? Went nowhere. Flanders & Bart? Didn't buy it for a second. Oval Office scenes? Rainer Wolfcastle would have been funnier, or GWB passing the buck that bit edgier. This isn't meant to be The Waltons!<br/><br/>More playfulness with the film format itself would have been welcome too - the opening 'Itchy & Scratchy' sequence and Homer's response were great but, as it turned out, too little too early for the film seldom ventured from the straight & narrow thereafter. Maybe Terry Gilliam to direct Simpsons II?<br/><br/>Early rumours (some time ago, I know) suggested the Simpsons Movie would be the final word on the show, but the commitment to another couple of seasons meant the film lost that seat-of-the-pants, anything-could-happen edge. I really believe the team should have one last hurrah with a final movie. Just don't try to jump the shark - blast it out of the water! <br/><br/>Get radical, guys - that's when you're at your best!"
"zuriel","1","147","241","26 July 2007"," Maybe I just expected too much...
","Maybe I just expected too much. For the last two years I've been excited about The Simpsons Movie, I could hardly wait for it to come out. I grew up with the Simpsons and, as many others, have watched about every episode at least 10 times. Since I was so eager to see it, I went to the first screening on the day of release. I was so sure this movie couldn't be bad, since South Park and Family Guy made great feature versions of their TV-shows. I was wrong. <br/><br/>Right on from the beginning, I had to realize that the film would not come up to my expectations at all. It began with the Itchy and Scratchy scene, right in the beginning. The typical absurd brutality and violence of the Itchy and Scratchy Cartoons have been softened down, so that after getting stabbed the cat doesn't even bleed. It seems the makers of the film passed on the violence to get a lower rating. An understandable step on one hand but after 18 years of staying true to the Simpsons-Style, very disappointing on the other. However, next to this little detail that bothered me, the whole plot is constructed relatively poor. All the time, not knowing that the film is only 85 minutes long, I thought ""Okay, now the film must start and come to it's point"". This thought would stay in my head until the end. The story is everything but sweeping. <br/><br/>Also I didn't like that The Simpsons Family are about the only characters that play a part in the plot. There is just a little bit of Flanders but almost no Mr. Burns, no Moe, no Major Quimby, no Sideshow Bob, no Krusty and so on. They all have about a line and that's it. Instead of the already existing beloved characters, a pig is introduced, which disappears as inconspicuously as it was introduced. But, the most disappointing fact was the jokes. They couldn't be cheaper and more harmless . Missing the ambiguousness and depth of the the jokes in the TV-version, it seems as they have only been designed for a very young audience. The humor reminded me a lot of the one from movies like Ice Age (which would be okay if I weren't talking about the Simpsons). <br/><br/>Also, I missed a political level, as seen in the TV-series or the South Park movie. <br/><br/>All in all, since the plot and jokes are sloppy and faceless, I wouldn't recommend the film to anyone who likes the Simpsons TV-series."
"fishbeef","2","47","72","5 August 2007"," ""SpiderPig"" does not a great movie make
","""The Simpsons Movie"" is remarkable only in that it manages to encapsulate in 90 painful minutes EVERYTHING that has been wrong with the show for the last ten years: ridiculous plot lines that are abandoned without resolution; a superhuman, idiot Homer who has no brain whatsoever and cannot be killed no matter what physical harm is inflicted on him (apparently the only person in the Simpsons universe with such an ability); jokes that lack subtlety; pointless cameo appearances; and an overall show of disdain towards its audience.<br/><br/>The Simpsons should really have ended a decade ago when they ran out of ideas. Since then, every plot line on the show has followed the exact same themes with more and more absurd actions thrown in to reach the same conclusion. Every single paper-thin plot line in The Simpsons Movie is one that has been done before in the series, and better: Homer gets redemption for his stupidity and saves his marriage with Marge. Lisa spearheads an environmental movement with unexpected consequences. The town of Springfield is threatened (and nearly destroyed) by an outside force. Bart shows his rebel side while secretly pining for proper guidance. The Simpson family goes on another CRAAAZY trip to an exotic location. Homer adopts a silly animal. Maggie says yet ANOTHER ""first"" word.<br/><br/>Spare me it all.<br/><br/>It took eleven screenwriters to make this dreck. Eleven!!! And this is the best they could come up with?! It doesn't advance the show at all, it only keeps it at the same downward pace it's been at for at least ten years. The only people who will truthfully enjoy this movie (without simply fooling themselves) are children who are too young to remember the ""glory years"" of The Simpsons. They're the only ones who will be accustomed to the low-quality version of the show we've been peddled for so long. As I write this review the film is somehow in the Top 250 on IMDb. If there's any justice in this world, The Simpsons Movie will drop to its proper location - the void of the Forgettable - as soon as possible."
"ThePlatteRiverKid","3","25","36","13 August 2007"," Disappointing and without laughs
","As a longtime fan of the Simpsons, I myself eagerly waited for the movie to come out (as early as the mid-90's when the Itchy and Scratchy Movie episode came out {whose ideals I felt would make their way into an eventual Simpsons movie}). Over the years, it had seemed unfortunate that the quality of the show had been declining. Jokes that lacked luster and a feeling that the show was attempting to compete with a bit lower brow show, Family Guy, at a level that it didn't seem to ever belong. I waited with anticipation hoping that the movie would rise out of the past few seasons and be a laugh riot.<br/><br/>It started out well enough with an Ichy and Scratchy short but failed to even bring out a laugh during the entire movie, few others in the theater were laughing either. A few moments brought about smiles but for a Simpsons movie it seemed promised that a tour de force of the different characters and perhaps a few more guest stars would be involved in the plot. Maybe I was expecting too much but after more than a decade it seemed that the movie was a big letdown. Weak humor, a mediocre plot and a ""Spider Pig"" that overall brought little to the comedy of the movie (it seemed like it could have been better written into a 30 minute show) made this movie almost a waste of already huge theater prices. It wasn't plotted well enough to provide many inside jokes for the long-time fans (although Springfield Gorge comes up) but it was also difficult to newcomers to really understand the outside characters and their personalities. Wait for the DVD I'd say.<br/><br/>A fan of most more mature-themed animation comedies (Simpsons, Family Guy, South Park, The Venture Brothers and Aqua Teen Hunger Force {Whose movie I haven't seen yet}); The Simpsons had been an all and out favorite for many years but after seeing the movie, it clinches a thought that perhaps the end of the series wouldn't be as horrible as it may have seemed a few years ago. As a South Park episode once mentioned ""The Simpsons have done everything"" and that seems to be the case.<br/><br/>It was a good attempt that was reflective of the past few seasons if you're into that sort of thing but for us fans of the 90's Simpsons it was just a disappointment. Thanks for many years of laughs Simpsons, but you're just too worn out."
"Naburba","1","140","236","4 August 2007"," It made me vomit with rage.
","After a tremendous buildup of advertising and reviews purchased by NewsCorp, The Simpsons Movie turns out to be nothing more than an 85 minute episode of late season Simpsons.<br/><br/>Just like these last few seasons, the movie is heartless and devoid of intelligent humor. It contains no thoughtful parody and only very trite satire. Many of the gags are childish even by Saturday morning cartoon standards. Slapstick and toilet humor cannot carry a prime time television show, much less a full length feature film. It contains no complex subtext, no (intelligent) obscure references, no hilarious musical numbers and no intricate visual humor. Many jokes are recycled from older episodes yet are very crudely put together (the similar looking family that is arrested, the Snow White spoof which is oddly similar to the much more well done Little Mermaid spoof years back, etc).<br/><br/>The characters are, at this point, gross caricatures of themselves 10 years ago. Homer, originally a dimwitted yet very caring father and husband, is now a brainless raging lunatic. Lisa, usually the voice of reason and compassion, has been reduced to an intellectual who never steps off her liberal soapbox. Bart, formerly the clever bad boy bad student with a hidden, kind heart has turned into mini-Homer, drinking problem included. Marge, a complex woman with a passion for maternity, has turned into a pitiful shell of a character, only raising her voice to nag. Other characters have either lost all complexity or just simply are not used. Even when these characters appear, they get less screen time than ""Boob lady"" or ""Crazy cat lady"" or ""Spider pig"" or ""Irish musician kid"" or ""EPA Guy"" (voiced by Albert Brooks, the same person who voiced a much more intriguing villain, Hank Scorpio). Some characters were even sacrificed in the name of cheap political humor (Reiner Wolfcastle).<br/><br/>The plot is a disgusting, twisted mess. The pig, an awful idea from the start, is quickly discarded. The tension between Homer and Bart and Homer and Marge is uninspired and forced (Marge taping over the wedding video was clearly a failed attempt to recapture the mood and emotional depth of a real Simpsons episode). The main plot, not to mention being unbelievably preachy, is recycled season 12-17 plots pieced together. I want to say that I could have written a better film but this is only partially correct; anyone could have written a better film. I'm sorry but I cannot remember many more details as I have mentally blocked out most of the movie to reduce the chances of permanent brain damage."
"BA_Harrison","6","7","8","26 January 2008"," I laughed... but I should've laughed harder and more frequently.
","In this big-screen adventure featuring the lovable folk of Springfield, trouble brews for the Simpson family after Homer irresponsibly pollutes the local water supply with tons of pig manure. As a result of this thoughtless action, the town is encased in a huge dome by the Environment Protection Agency and, after angry Springfield citizens form a lynch mob, Homer and his family are forced to become fugitives.<br/><br/>How much you enjoy The Simpsons Movie will depend entirely on your opinion of the current Simpsons TV show: if you have loved the past few seasons, then you'll have a great timethe movie is as funny, if not slightly better, than your average episode of recent years. Those of us, however, who recognise that the show has long since passed its prime will feel underwhelmed: the movie is often amusing, but very rarely hilarious.<br/><br/>And that's just not good enough! When a series as successful as The Simpsons takes 20 years to make the leap from the small screen to the big screen, it had better be damn goodnay, it had better be exceptional!! Instead, this rather uninspired product just doesn't make the wait worthwhile.<br/><br/>5 out of 10, bumped up to 6 out of a misguided sense of loyalty to a show that has given me so much fun in the past."
"funrocket","1","247","430","30 July 2007"," Horrible, Don't Watch!
","The Simpsons in its prime was perhaps the best show on TV with incisive satire on American life and humor that didn't rely solely on slapstick and stupidity. Around season 9, the show went precipitously downhill and never recovered. The show, although always a cartoon, is now as infantile and ridiculous as cartoons are perceived to be.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is like an 18th season episode stretched out 3x as long. There are a few funny jokes, but it becomes painful and tiresome to sit thru dozens of missed jokes to get to a funny one. The plot is inane, concerning a giant dome put on Springfield to hold in the pollution and the government wants to blow up the city to get rid of it. What made the Simpsons great was its more subtle satire and it at least tried to stay grounded within reality. The show is like a parody of itself, the same kind of stupid sitcom it once made fun of. Replacing Alf Clausen's usual score with Hans Zimmer is also a terrible misfire. The straightforward orchestral treatment for the show is very distracting.<br/><br/>It's a shame this movie and this show continue to make a fortune, no one ever went broke catering to the lowest common denominator. This movie will appeal to the same demographic that loves Ace Ventura and the Ernest movies and will undoubtedly spawn a sequel. It just angers me that Troy McClure wasn't joking in an old episode when he said the Simpsons will continue to be around until they are unprofitable."
"Merklin","8","248","435","25 July 2007"," The long overdue simpsons movie is a hilarious and witty piece of entertainment
","The simpsons movie is witty,fast paced, touching, hugely entertaining and most importantly: laugh out loud funny.And if your a simpsons fan who's loved every episode , thats all you'll need from it.<br/><br/>However if , like me , your an obsessive fan who's noticed a drop in quality on the show from the late nineties onwards you'll see some problems. You'll see that structure wise the movie is basically an extended episode.You'll notice that the villain is a Hank Scorpio rip off. You'll feel that a lot of the plot points and character drama seem all too familiar.But in spite of all this , in spite of being a film based on a show that exhausted its best gags long ago, the simpsons movie is still absolutely hilarious and i take my hat off to the creators for managing to make it so.<br/><br/>A simpsons movie in the early nineties (when the show was in its prime) would have been better, but the very , very , very funny one we have here in '07 works just fine. Funny stuff."
"shiftage","1","63","102","2 August 2007"," Total crap.
","Cheesy, boring, full of random unnecessary references to the show- this movie sucked ass. <br/><br/>I guess I was spoiled by the simpsons: seasons 3-8. This movie lacked the characters we liked: Barney for his alcoholism, Moe for his lack of dignity, Principal Skinner for his strictness, Burns for his evil. It seems the writers used the characters at completely random moments to remind us this was the simpsons we were watching, and not some corny family movie. <br/><br/>Failed, lame, sophomoric humor is the opposite of what made the simpsons classic in it's golden years: witty, fast-paced, and intelligent. <br/><br/>The retarded writing-troop that comprised the movie introduced boring, low-brow characters like the head of the EPA (my brain pushed his name out, thank you brain!), that native American (the boob thing was lame), and re-invented an old favorite- McBain, or more commonly known as- Arnold Schwarzenegger. Don't count on Arnold spouting any good lines such as ""we had script problems from day one"" or ""the goggles..."", just sit back, relax, and prepare to be bored.<br/><br/>I can handle a minute or two of corny resolution in the show with marge and homer. Not this. This is over the top, borderline romantic-comedy-starring-jennifer-aniston-cheese. I mean george-clooney-smiling-and-sandra-bullock-falling-over-cheesy. Prepare, brave movie goer, for many moments of homer missing marge, marge admitting she doesn't love homer, homer redeeming himself, things we have seen in the show that we don't miss. <br/><br/>Side plots like Lisa falling in love with an irish douche are not funny or interesting. I just wonder why they threw that in. Any ideas?<br/><br/>Maggie is being developed as the silent magnificent force, much like a Silent-Bob-type character. She gives a saves-the-day-salute at the end. Shoot me.<br/><br/>I'm spent. I could ramble all day and night how bad this is, but until you have seen it, you won't know. You shouldn't know. Call me traitor, call me convert, just go to the store and rent the Family Guy movie. God help me, there's better writing in it. God help us all."
"a-bark","10","383","693","25 July 2007"," fear not folks, it is very funny
","what more can I say. the movie is a return to the glory days of the show, those ever yellow times when Homer jumped the gorge, when alien ants threatened the earth and the mono rail came to town. If any of that made sense to you then this is the film to go for this weekend. It is a laugh a minute, unlike most comedy films which seem to think funny is a dirty word. I have to say it is NOT really a kids film (although a child sitting near me was crying with laughter) as some of the lines are very naughty and near the bone. I am keen to see it again to catch all the gags I missed. And thank God Ricky Gervais was not allowed anywhere near it (his TV episode stunk!). So if you're up to you knees in flood water or suffering from some other global disaster right now and fancy a good time your local multiplex is the place to go. Lets face it we all need a laugh right now."

","I don't feel like the movie lived up to the hype. I'm really stoked to hear that many thought it was good, I want nothing more than to see one of my favorite shows of all time be successful. If you are a true Simpsons fan, this movie left a lot to be desired. There were a few moments that were pretty awesome. Spiderpig = genius! But what the hell happened to him???? He just disappeared! The key secondary characters that have rounded the show out over the years were nearly non-existent. Hardly any Skinner, Moe, Barney, Ralph, Milhouse, etc. Why weren't they more involved? The plot and storyline was pretty random, didn't make sense, and for lack of a better word was ""eh"". The President should have been McBain. Could have fit with the show a little better. One of the main characters in the movie (the dude that had Hank Scorpios voice, Secretary of State maybe?) was NEVER featured in the show. I just feel like they should have stuck to the plot lines that brought them to the success of seasons 2-9ish. Maybe bring back Conan?"

Just seeing Springfield and all the characters on the big screen is enough to make this movie worth going to. But I was rather let down in terms of the comedy. It seemed like it was dumbed down to give it more mass appeal and that's disappointing. I also had annoying little kids sitting around me and their father refused to shut them up...which somewhat ruined the experience. The first 45 min are good, then it dips in humor.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while the South Park movie took advantage of the new medium by pushing the envelope and producing hilarious, brilliant satire...The Simpsons Movie seems to do the opposite, getting watered down in the process."

"Superunknovvn","6","211","386","29 July 2007"," Just okay
","There was a time when ""The Simpsons"" stood for the funniest, most original comedy on the planet. Somewhere around season 8 the show passed its prime, though, and since then it varies from good to okay and sometimes even insipid. I was hoping that for the movie the writers would really push themselves and come up with some really clever and new ideas one more time, but for all the years of developing that supposedly went into this, the movie seems like nothing more than an extended TV episode of latter day ""Simpsons"".<br/><br/>I have to admit that I'm not really convinced of the concept of putting an animated TV series on the big screen in the first place. Even the ""South Park"" movie that tried to incorporate theatrical elements such as the musical numbers didn't really justify the need for a cinematic adventure. Most animated comedy shows have a very fast paced humor with quick editing. This works for an episode of 25-30 minutes, but in a movie with 90 minutes running time it would become too exhausting for the audience. Therefore the whole thing has to be slowed down, which in return takes away a lot of the show's comedic appeal. It's a lose-lose situation as they say.<br/><br/>As a consequence ""The Simpsons Movie"" is unusually slow at times. At the same time the storyline is not really stretched to cinematic proportions. Epic as it may be, similar topics have already been dealt with in the TV show (and better). It's been said before and it's true: nothing here tries to push any boundaries and except for the length of the whole thing (and maybe some annoying people in the theater who watch the movie with you) you would never realize that this is a ""Simpsons""-motion picture.<br/><br/>Other flaws include the fact that some inhabitants of Springfield have only very brief cameos (Mr. Burns!) and that some ideas have been used in a fairly similar way before. As entertaining as the movie still may be, it is also pretty predictable at times. This kind of ""underachieving"", as some critic called it, may have its own charm, but in the end one would have hoped for this to be a bit more special. The movie is by no means a catastrophe, but by ""Simpsons""-standards it's just not good enough.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons"" have become a brand. People know what to expect and therefore applaud even a relatively average movie like this one. To rely on that is a bit lazy, however, and one wishes that producers put an end to Homer's adventures as long as we can still remember him and the other beloved inhabitants of Springfield as characters that completely revolutionized comedy at one point and not as money making merchandising props."

Any of the good jokes were given in the first twenty minutes the remaining were to few and far between for the remaining hour(not to mention crass).The plot just did not make sense as if the writers didn't even try to bother writing one at all.Being from Ireland I am a lot more critical of the Simpson's despite the last few series being OK - good.Like many of the people in the cinema i felt like leaving half way through.One line that best describes how I and many others felt is homers ironic critique of the preceding itchy and scratchy cartoon: Why pay to see this in a cinema when we could watch it at home for free. You would be better off watching the family guy TV movie or your old favorite episodes of Simpson's than this tripe that doesn't even deserve to be in the top 250."
"lochlan-1","4","36","58","10 August 2007"," Clearly highlights everything that's wrong with The Simpsons
","Don't get me wrong. I was the biggest Simpsons fan back in the day. I still love to watch the older episodes and quote lines among friends, but in the last few years The Simpsons has really gone down hill. Relying more on visual humour (generally involving Homer) than clever dialogue or a well written story.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie emphasises everything that's wrong with the television show nowadays. Sure, you'll laugh, but it'll probably be a forced laugh. I noticed when I saw the movie, a lot of young children were in the cinema, having a great time. I guess The Simpsons has become just that. A children's show. It's no longer the edgy teen-to-adult animation it once was."
"FrankSalazar","6","36","58","30 July 2007"," Most Disappointing Movie Ever.
","As a die-hard Simpsons fan, I felt very disappointed with the feature film debut from the greatest sitcom ever. The Simpsons movie never reaches the heights of its TV counterpart. The first 22 Minutes or so are right up there with there with above average to good episodes of the greatest sitcom ever. The jokes in first 22 minutes are abundant and intelligent. The laughs really begin to dry up when the hideous story takes shape and we are left with environmentalist crap where Homer's small silo of pig poop and his own poop contaminated the already massively polluted Lake Springfield to the point where the Schwarzenegger led government puts a massive dome over the town of Springfield. For a good twenty minutes the film is largely laugh less. The theater was also. The movie does not really recover and rarely musters more than few chuckles. The denouement is less than impressive by Simpsons standards. The extensive cast characters are relegated to background and bit players at best. Many favorites are absent or left little to say and do. The writers take more easy outs than we see in the worst episodes and the movie itself plays it safe a little too often. The movie is seems to be a more dumbed down version of the show. Yet there is still much to recommend about the show we all love so much and for so long. The characters retain their depth and truth. The tone is consistent with the current episodes, which may be part of the problem for some. The story and the lack of big laughs are the movies greatest faults. The Simpsons Movie, which runs longer than 3 episodes is not even as funny 3 bad episodes, but it is funnier my 3 least favorite episodes. It is great that (Albert) A. Brooks puts is another funny appearance. Though Russ Cargill is not nearly as funny as Hank Scorpio or even Jacques the bowling alley gigolo. The movie a disappoint on many levels is a must see for any longtime Simpson fan. Not the funniest movie ever nor the worst movie ever. Not even close. But as one of the biggest Simpsons fans in the world for me it is the Most Disappointing Movie Ever."

","The Simpsons Movie, Summer 2007. Watching the trailer i was excited, the thought of homer causing Springfield trouble and having to fix it would be great, lots of interesting characters like Moe, Grounds Kepper Willy, and Mr Burns, looked to be involved and a wild homer scheming film would follow.<br/><br/>The opening with Bart and Homer was excellent, the angered mob was funny which included Abe,,, However, the concept was poor and the Simpsons family escaping from Springfield was Dire the film quality Plummeted and reached it's true low when homer was in Alaska! The short film meant a short and boring story. it went strange and took a risky turn when homer was with the 'inuit' woman... the ending was very weak and unimpressive.<br/><br/>Now here's how a successful Simpson's movie should go,,,Same beginning...But rather than escape Springfield Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie should unite and attempt to bring the town round to their side and scheme together to break out of the bubble, for instance, Moes Bar could play part as headquarters, Burns could fund it and provide power, Apu would become supplies...Etc...Etc<br/><br/>These are ideas and just my thoughts. i think it would be much better than the escaping, as it meant main and interesting characters were cut out, Sideshow bob should be involved. The secondary running story of Bart, homer, and Ned Flanders could still be included but would be better and more interesting if they stayed In Springield Great animation and drawing (some scenes weak however) and the comedy was average. The usually varied comedy including Subtle Clever Adult humour, and obvious children's gags, was weak, dull and monotone.<br/><br/>I was very disappointed and was almost tempted to walk out of the cinema...<br/><br/>i was pleased about the usual beginning and unorthodox credits including pictures of the characters... I was pleased to here the usual theme tune and opening scenes.<br/><br/>it should of lasted much longer, and include all the ideas i've given. this would create a film worthy of the Simpson's title. i believe the writers were below par and Poor. It was an embarrassment to the Simpson's series.<br/><br/>Sam Carr"

","I know there's a hardcore fan base out there for The Simpons, but I couldn't help but feel that maybe this would've been better as a made for TV movie. The gags were nothing special and I only found myself laughing twice throughout the whole picture with an odd chuckle here and there. This was mediocre at best bordering on being tedious in some places (spider pig! Need I say more?). I'm a huge fan of the earlier episodes, which had some really excellent stories that dealt with real problems in a unique and entertaining way. However, watching this only reminded me of the more recent Simpson's episodes which tend to use shock value and tried and tested gags to achieve laughs that can now only be found in the earlier episodes. Deserves 5/10 watch Order of the Phoenix for a really entertaining cinema experience!"
"sallyfifth","Null","137","249","27 July 2007"," A Homer with Bases Loaded.
","Just about everything I could have hoped for from a Simpsons movie including the heart the show has been lacking for several seasons now. If you like the easy breathing pace of the early years of The Simpsons you'll find a lot to like in the movie. The gags are leisurely and natural and even when they fail (Comic Book Guy comes to mind), another drops in to pick up the laugh. What's most surprising, in addition to a much needed return to consistent characters, is that the movie manages to balance the plot and the gags with near perfection. Regardless what you may think going in, it does feel like a ""real"" movie from beginning to end and not just an extended show. Albert Brooks once again steals the show as the Director of the EPA, though Tom Hanks does the best celebrity cameo the show has seen in ages. ""tousle my hair Mr. Hanks!"""
"porkchopsjar-1","4","20","30","9 August 2007"," I've seen better episodes...
","Okay. I consider myself a die-hard Simpsons junkie, ever since I got cheesed off that they interrupted an episode (the one where Mr Burns hits Bart with his car, as I recall) with the news that the first Persian Gulf war had started. I'm also apparently one of the few people who doesn't think that the show sucks now, though I do agree it's not as consistent since about season 8 or so. Really, there are only maybe a dozen episodes or so that I truly detest. Unfortunately, if ""The Simpsons Movie"" was an episode of the TV show, it would probably make #13 on my list. The plot -evil EPA puts Springfield under a dome because of the toxicity of its lake- was just ridiculous. Homer and Marge having marital difficulties...sorry, that's been done just about to death. Ah, yes, Homer. In ""TSM"" Homer is at his quintessential moronic worst pretty much for the duration (his antics of adopting a pig -against the family's wishes- and dumping the piggy poop in the lake causing the pollution and aforementioned EPA reaction)to the point where you just want to shoot him...and I love Homer; can forgive him almost anything! But in the movie his stunts are just annoying, and that is my biggest complaint. Sure, there's a good amount of typical Simpsons political tweaking (such as Lisa's ""An Irritating Truth"" seminar, an obvious parody of Al Gore) but been as the whole premise of the plot is so over the top I found myself merely smirking rather than LMAO, which is my usual response to the subversive humour found on the show. I understand the producers brought together the best of the show's writers to write the movie- could have fooled me. And, considering that they probably had a big enough budget I noticed more then a few lapses in the animation, especially in the scenes where the whole town of Springfield has formed (yet another) lynch mob to go after Homer: for a few brief seconds you can tell that it is CGI 3D rather than normal animation. I found myself going ""Tsk, tsk"" at this shabby production. All told, I was very disappointed. Granted, I was not expecting ""Last Exit To Springfield"" caliber greatness with the Simpsons movie (I think we all knew better than that) but I was expecting it to be better than it was, and ultimately I'd be tempted to put the final product in the ballpark of ""The Principal And The Pauper"", which even the show's writers and voice actors consider one of the worst episodes. In the end, I'd say ""The Simpsons Movie"" is worth seeing once, but I can only hope that they do better with the inevitable ""Simpsons Movie II""."
"buddypatrick","1","35","57","11 November 2007"," That's not my Simpsons! That's not my Simpsons!!!
","I never thought the television series would have strayed so far away from itself, but The Simpsons Movie goes to prove it has. I have a feeling that deep down inside the producers of this film somewhat knew they were going to make a terrible film that would sweep the box offices pronto, and it did. 74 million on the opening weekend in the USA. Of course people are going to see it, it's the Simpson's Movie! The Simpson's, the classic television series that defines a portion of our modern generation. When one quotes the Simpson's, everyone knows where it is from, at least, in our age group. This movie however has strayed so far away from the real Simpson's that it's as thought it doesn't know its own self anymore. You compare this film to the original early 90's episodes and there is a lot of stupidity, character change, dumb humor and so on.<br/><br/>Remember when you came home and watched the Simpson's in the afternoon like everyone else in the 90s? You'd be fed amazing subject matter, themes, and messages week after week, time after time, and this subject matter was made into witty intelligent humor that striked out a message to your average modern day dysfunctional family. The Simpson's was so relatable to almost everyone who watched it. For an example: when Bart enters the golf putty tournament and Homer pressures him into it, it was so relatable to so many people but in the end it would clean up with Homer and Flanders wearing their wives dresses mowing their lawns. Something serious with a punch of humor, which was what the Simpson's, was all about. The episode where Bart and Lisa fight over Bart destroying Lisa's thanks giving ornament and Bart runs away from home yet only to return to his family who loves him dearly despite all the fighting and such. This was it! This was the Simpson's that everyone loved! <br/><br/>Week after week people would never get upset over their loved television show involving Homer strangling Bart, Homer falling down the stairs, Lisa giving out some intelligent remark only to be ignored by her family, Marge groaning or Maggie falling over her dress. If you pay attention, this is all disappearing in the new episodesas sad as it is, but our lovable characters are being disfigured into something and someone else. Look at Bart in the film for an example, Bart is upset because his dad isn't enough of a father figure, therefore he turns to the Flanders family?!?! Bart, the boy struggling at school and the boy who has the sling shot in his back pocket, is a trouble maker! He doesn't want a father figure! Not only the enormous change of characters has been happening, but far fetched, random, Family Guy-esquire humor has been occurring in the Simpson's, when shouldn't the Simpson's stay as the Simpson's and not turn into something its not, Family Guy?<br/><br/>There's some really terrible jokes in this film too. Homer pours a silo of pig excrement into a lake so it mutates animals? Yeahokaythat's realistic and funnyand the spider pig joke, people, it isn't funny!! This movie just goes to prove that the producers shove the Simpson's on our plates and we gobble it up laughing our heads off because it's the Simpson's in the 21st century, now they can do anything they want because they were defined enough in the 90's! No! I'm sick to death of the Simpson's going to foreign countries and encountering some danger or misfortune along the way that winds them up in some absolute ridiculous situation – ending up on a game show, discovering a diamond mine topped with monkey slaves. Its stuff like this that the producer's are clearly saying ""We have run out of ideasyou're on your own!""<br/><br/>Its sad when you look at the classic Simpson's and then look at the modern times of the Simpson's, and you'll see that its all going down the drain, that the ""dumb"" shows are being shown over and over and the classic ones which I have mentioned are being pushed into oblivion aka Sunday afternoons. Another thing, Futurama's film is being released direct to video? Futurama should be the new Simpson's in all honesty, its loaded, and I mean loaded, with tonnes of emotional episodes, characters and its actually pure genius! Shame what they've done to the Simpson's, it truly is"

","My wife and I have been Simpson fans since they were first introduced on the Ullman show. We've been looking forward to the movie for months now, saw it this afternoon and BOTH of us were pretty disappointed. I don't think we laughed out loud more than four or five times throughout the entire feature and neither did anyone else in the theatre. The absence of some of the supporting characters who make the series hilarious was really apparent, and the ones who DID appear didn't add much to the ""fun quotient"" of the film.

Yes the Simpson's was big, but times have changed and like the series it went out of fashion.<br/><br/>The humour in this movie was bland. Any humorous parts were simply jokes regurgitated from the likes of Family guy and much better cartoon comedies. For example when Bart draws moustaches on the family's wanted poster and the employee looks toward another family who resemble that on the edited poster. (yawn) Oh wait I've not seen that one before.<br/><br/>Matt groening needs to let go.

"davidee88","6","91","164","28 July 2007"," Funny, just not 'Simpsons' funny
","I began watching this film (as I'm sure everyone who owns a television set did) with optimistically high expectations. The end product being what all fans' pessimistic side feared. This was a watered down version of the Simpsons, reliant on the steadfast fan base it has rightfully built up over the years. This film was a disappointment. Perhaps though, no more of a disappointment than the last couple of seasons of the television show, with a few notable exceptions.<br/><br/>What made The Simpsons great was the charade of face value humour, perfectly complimenting the blissfully bloated underbelly of well developed, meaningful and satirical jokes. This film was sorely lacking anything but the most basic of jokes. Non-stop visual and slapstick gags... although great, in moderation, after eighty-seven minutes of them - I was left wondering if the film's script would have had to have been modified in any way whatsoever if the characters were substituted for that of, say, 'Spongebob Squarepants'. The obvious exception of course being the underwater setting.<br/><br/>This film lacked all of the Simpsons' distinction that we have all come to love over the years. The Simpsons movie is not even worthy of a 'Krusty Brand Seal of Approval' for authenticity.<br/><br/>The Simpsons have left many fans conflicted over the past couple of years. Feeling a sense of loyalty and reliance to the show, yet always expecting it to sink further and further as far as well thought out story lines and dialogue go.<br/><br/>This movie is a further indication that with the Simpsons, from here until their cancellation or retirement, there will always be a sense of frustratingly oxymoronic anticipated disappointment."
"ntsci","Null","18","27","4 January 2008"," The Simpson's have truly lost their edge
","To tell the truth I had low expectations about this movie. Movies made to cash in on the popularity of a TV show are almost always terrible.<br/><br/>The best joke comes just after the opening sequence where Homer complains about paying to watch a show that he could see at home for free... I always appreciate a show that makes fun of its own audience. After that.... downhill all the way.<br/><br/>The story is that the lake is polluted and Lisa runs a campaign to clean it up. Homer, steals a pig from Crusty thereby saving it from death (something one would think that Lisa would congratulate him for). He appears to be a loving pet owner, which is rather out of character because loving pet owners tend to also be loving parents.<br/><br/>Anyway, he saves the waste in a silo which Marg tells him to get rid of properly. Instead he dumps it in the lake. The pig waste tips the balance of nature and a mutated squirrel grows new eyes. The EPA comes in, gives President Swartzenegar 5 options, a dome is placed over the city, the Simpson's escape and go to Alaska, blah, blah, blah.<br/><br/>OK, Simpson writers. I have news for you. Pig waste is natural. Pig waste is less disgusting than typical dog waste. If used properly is GOOD for the environment (fertilizer); placed in a lake is certainly not an ideal solution, but it would not create a mutant squirrel. Get your environmental problems straight. Industrial waste, or nuclear waste (doesn't Homer work at a nuclear energy plant! Duh!) or even careless disposal of household clearer or batteries would have made a more realistic story that would of made a point about pollution. But pig waste is natural! Anyway, why wouldn't Homer, just dispose of the pig waste like any dog owner gets rid of dog waste (e.g., flush it down the toilet, or put it in the garbage, or let it sit on the lawn, or let the pig poop in the park; yuck); why would he collect it in a silo? After that stupid story, the movie does not get better, it goes downhill.<br/><br/>The Simpson's used to be a marvelously cynical satire on modern life. I find the show has really gone downhill in recent years; the jokes are getting rather old and lame and repetitious; and much of the slapstick is getting rather juvenile. But the show is still much much better than this movie.<br/><br/>There are funny jokes in the movie -- especially centered around how politicians make decisions (so I give it a 2 for that, rather than a 1), also the spider pig theme is rather catchy, but is also very pointless. Overall there are few jokes worth listening too.<br/><br/>On the whole this is a really bad movie; if you love the Simpson's, watch the show. Don't waste your money on this movie."

","No doubt, this movie is as good as the TV show. There is an excellent story, which is entertaining in every single moment. The film focuses on the family Simpson, so you might miss some of you favorite characters like Sideshow Bob, Apu or Mr. Burns. But this really doesn't matter, because you can see these characters in the show and it is not necessary, that they appear a lot in the movie. Instead there are some new characters, for example the president Arnold Schwarzenegger, who is very funny. There is also a nice cameo of a very big star, which is very surprising. <br/><br/>Every joke makes you laugh. There are excellent quotes and great moments. Dan Castellanata does a very good job again. Homer is as funny as in the show. <br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie might be the funniest animation movie ever made. You can laugh the whole film through.

","I am one of the many fans who have seen every Simpsons’ episodes (with the exception of a few new ones) and believe the old episodes (up until ~2002) are significantly better than the new ones. Rumours of a Simpsons movie had been around since the mid 90s, and ever since then I could not wait to see it. Now that I have seen it, I regret doing so. I believe the movie is a disgrace and should have never been made. Instead of being created with the production value of the classics, what was delivered was a lengthened, stupefied version of a new episode.<br/><br/>The movie contains none of the classic approaches to comedy, such as when Homer is sent under water to find the Lock Ness Monster and turns out to be playing an arcade game (episode: Monty Can't Buy Me Love); or when Homer tackles Mr. Bont (please research 'Mr Bont' before you post you’re foreseeable predictable ignoramus remarks) resulting in his death (episode: You Only Move Twice). Both of these episodes contain random comedy scenes that are within the flow and storyline of the episode. It is almost like there is nothing random actually going on.<br/><br/>The movie uses an approach to random comedy that is more reminiscent of a bad rip off of ‘Family Guy’. There are some references to past episodes, and a couple of classic Simpsons comedy scenes, but nowhere near enough to redeem the rather lacking story line. I’m still unsure if I like the animation used (i.e. the shadows and closer to 3D shading). For these reasons I have rated the Simpsons Movie low and don’t ever want to see it again."

Well it seems they have saved quite a few for this comic masterpiece. The Simpsons movie manages to pack in a gag rate that is comparable to ""Airplane"" but also manages to tell an entertaining story that goes beyond the confines of the usual 22 minutes we are used to. I will not reveal the plot as future generations will enjoy this movie but I have read a comment that compares it to the Family Guy movie. What are you on? The style of this piece is subtly different to the T.V. show and when it goes into a Big movie moment you really notice and appreciate it. Compared to other small screen animated of recent years e.g. ""South Park"" or ""Beavis and Butthead do America"" it does not feel like an extended episode. Also manages to thrill the most mixed audience I have sat in for years. The audience applauded which is always a good sign."
"buffsin2003","10","169","324","27 July 2007"," An unbiased and fair review from a long time simpsons fan
","It seemed inevitable that one day, a simpsons movie would wind up on the silver screen. It was surprising that it took 18 years or so after the families conception for it to happen, but it did, and it couldn't have come at a better time.<br/><br/>Most Simpsons fans have realized that the quality of the TV show dropped tremendously around five years ago. While in the glory days of the show (seasons 4-8 in my opinion) almost every episode was an unforgettable and instant classic, and the show was widely regarded as the funniest, and perhaps the best thing on television. However, something happened along the way. Perhaps it was just the writers running out of ideas, or trying too hard to be funny, or a combination of both, but the simpsons lost its appeal to many fans. Once, watching The simpsons was once a joyous, weekly thing, now, it has become the kind of thing that happens every now and then, when your bored and don't have anything else to do after a watching a football game. Many feared that the movie would resemble the newer seasons, and with good reason. However, I kept optimistic and held my hopes for a great movie firm, and i got what I wanted. The Simpsons movie is clever, memorable, and truly funny with gags bombarding the audience seemingly several times a second. That being said, it is not without its faults.<br/><br/>The movie, as many of you have probably heard, is only around 90 minutes long- nowhere near long enough to fit the seemingly thousands of memorable characters fans have become attached to over the years. The creators definitely tried their best, though. While there may not have been enough Apu, or Burns or Skinner, they all make appearances and have their memorable lines. And, perhaps my favorite simpsons character, Ralf Wiggum, has what is likely his funniest line ever. Overall, the use of characters was satisfactory and I don't have many complaints, although some die hards may.<br/><br/>The plot of the movie is also damaged by the time constraints, and more severely than the use of characters. The plot definitely feels rushed- there's so many things that will leave you wondering, ""Well, who started this whole thing? Why did this all just happen so suddenly with only a small bit of explanation?"" This is where I just learned to accept it. I filled in the holes on my own, and allowed myself to be entertained by my favorite characters and the funny political satire flowing throughout the film. It's all as dead on and witty as it was in the golden days, and maybe thats enough for me.<br/><br/>So in conclusion, I must ask myself this question- Simpsons of the Glory Days, or the Simpsons of today? The answer comes quite easily: This movie is Old School Simpsons, for the most part. Yes, the movie does have some unfunny random humor, Yes, it does have a few too many ""homer falls down"" jokes, and yes, it tries too hard at some times. But, between all that, perhaps in spite of it, there are shining moments of greatness that allows the simpsons to stand amongst the funniest movies of the year- and thats saying a lot, considering we had Knocked Up back in June. And The Simpsons Movie delivers all of this hilarity with a plot line with messages about protecting the environment and corruption in our government, and sends those messages without too much in your face preaching. The whole movie left me wanting more, hoping for a sequel. Not because the movie was unfullfilling, but because i know that after this movie, the creators will have the skill and wisdom to create the perfect simpsons movie- they set themselves on the right track with this movie."

Betrayed and taken for a ride.<br/><br/>It was nothing special. Nothing special at all. I equate this movie to the episode where homer burns down the house  only it lasts forever and is not even close to as funny.<br/><br/>The writers of this movie just used the same boring formula that they have for the last few years. The TV show has gone flat and downhill for sometime now. So I guess why shouldn't the movie be any different. Did they put any thought into this? Even this plot has been done on the TV show although not exactly the same way. Anyone recall when they moved the town when homer was sanitation commissioner?

What does that tell you? People have too much emotional attachment to the show to admit that this film is awful. They mindrape themselves into thinking anything and everything with the Simpsons' faces plastered on it is good, much like female fans of Johnny Depp do. If the film was 90 minutes of the Simpsons sitting on the couch and blinking their eyes, they would say ""oMg BeSt MoViE eVeR!"". How pathetic! Yes, it's been said already many times, but I'm thinking it so I'm saying it; it is straight up a 90 minute episode of the godawful past 11 seasons. Cheap and forced jokes, bowel movement references, lots of obnoxious loud noises, and just plain lame, unfunny nonsense. Topical humor that will be outdated in a few short years, pointless celebrity cameos and references, and anything else catering to the modern pulse. Too bad the generation after us won't relate to any of the humor so that damns the film into not being timeless at all! Hmm, how many borrowed clichés from the show did we see? Marge threatening to leave Homer, Springfield on the brink of disaster, an angry mob, the Simpsons on the run, Homer falling in love with something not human, discord between Bart and Homer, Lisa falling for a boy... I doubt that's all! Desperation has replaced, dignity, guys. Force yourself to like this all you want, you're just embarrassing yourselves! Another poster referred to the type of people who put everything else on hold (like cutting their plans short) on Sundays to watch the horrible new episodes of the show as ""Simpsons zombies"". I'll take it a step further and say ""Simpsons martyrs"", as the word martyr is more jarring to Western culture with this so-called ""war on terror"". Seriously, why not martyr yourselves for a cause more worthwhile, like say stopping the clubbing of baby seals or the shoddiness of Jaguar since Ford took over?<br/><br/>All you die-hard fans who force yourselves to continue liking this misery should go and form Simpsonsbollah!"

I was not impressed with this movie one bit, the sight gags were barely humorous to me (they have done better skits on the show). This movie would have been worth it if it was done on FOX TV as an hour and a half Simpsons TV special, that way I wouldn't have paid nine bucks to sit through it.

"Vultural","4","29","49","30 July 2007"," Disappointment
","It's been quite noticeable that the Simpson's has been on a downward spiral since around the tenth season, first of all it's clear that every single possible scenario has been played out and overdone, the animation has become computerised and boring and their is a clear desperation as every celebrity with ant interest in the Simpson's are pulled in to boost ratings. Now imagine all of this and stretch one of those stories over three episodes and you get The Simpsons Movie.<br/><br/>The first difference between the original Simpson's and the 'Movie' Simpsons is that the original was set firmly on taking realistic observations and exaggerating them (for example take Itchy and Scratchy), this is what made it such a classic because it was unlike any other cartoon. However The Simpsons Movie is based on very little and overly exaggerated. This makes the movie seem like a bad copy of itself.<br/><br/>The second criticism of The Simpsons Movie is that The Simpsons were always the big characters and the contributors to the comedy, but it was the small characters that gave The Simpsons that variation. Therefore giving these characters minimal screen time limits the film to only one story line, when the film would have been much more interesting if the events were presented from the point of view of some of the minor characters.<br/><br/>However the Simpsons Movie as a separate piece of work to anything else is actually moderately funny.In fact in bursts it shows some of the creative flare of the original 10 series. However as a complete film it is just a disappointment and should have been so much better."

","I came into the cinema with a lot of expectations. After 90 unfunny minutes I came out saying that this was just as unfunny as all the recent episodes, although many people in the cinema laughed to whole time. There was only unfunny slapstick and predictable jokes. A few scenes made me laugh a bit, but the really good jokes were missing. Where are the good jokes from the old seasons? The trailer says, the film has been made in 20 years, but the jokes were probably invented in recent times. Anyway, anyone who loved the old seasons(say 1-9 maybe 10) will be disappointed; anyone who finds the recent seasons also funny will have a great time with this movie. I didn't."

"gl177","2","15","23","5 August 2007"," Don't add to the box office for this lazy and insipid effort.
","This is the first review I've been inspired to write on IMDb for probably five years now. I just can't read one more user review inexplicably giving this film 8 or 10 stars.<br/><br/>I'm not going to go for the easy hit and say that this movie is pretty much in conjunction with the fading quality of the last decade or so; in fact I don't even believe that is necessarily the case with the TV show. There have been some great episodes, even in the last few seasons, just as there have been many mediocre ones and downright stupid episodes (jockeys in a trash bag, anyone?).<br/><br/>I've never been a ""worst episode ever"" kind of crank, or a ""season 3 and season 4 were the best"" snob, or even cared that much about dumb Homer vs. smart Homer. The Simpsons' ability to layer irony, storyline, and conceptual rigor with a razor-sharp attention to current events means that every new episode is an opportunity for brilliance and relevance. So I come to every new offering with a tingle of hope.<br/><br/>I thought I had done a good job of reading qualified reviewers from resources I trusted. I listened to a few interviews of Matt Groening and got the impression that the producers and writers were all really proud and excited about this movie. Was everyone just lying, or ingratiating themselves with pop culture royalty? This movie is pig crap.<br/><br/>The story is bizarre and surreal, but not in a good ""Treehouse of Horror"" way. TV's greatest cast of supporting characters is wasted with one-liners and scan & pan crowd shots. New characters are introduced for no good reason. Certain jokes are pounded repeatedly, each time getting less funny. (Why does Matt Groening hate the government so much? Is he in tax trouble?) Plot developments are either (mostly) utterly predictable or (twice) utterly inexplicable. Any relevance to current events is stale and wit is hard to come by. Nothing about Iraq, terror, or politics; all subjects the TV show visits frequently with varying degrees of success. Here they didn't even try, unless you count litter in our lakes as a divisive political matter. ""Commander cuckoo-bananas"", the president himself, has here turned into a safe, alternate-universe version of reality.<br/><br/>The Simpsons has always been strongest when it tacks closest to reality by slightly twisting it and thereby revealing its strangeness. This movie does the opposite by creating strangeness and discarding reality altogether.<br/><br/>I'm awarding one star more than the minimum just for all the animators' hard work, utterly wasted by these writers. (I can see the Koreans muttering to themselves ""what is the deal with the pig?"" and ""EPA Ospreys? huh?"").<br/><br/>Two stars subtracted for plot. Just one simplistic story, no trademark interweaving of stories, not even a series of stories growing out of each other. Recyled, ham-handed, too outlandish, not outlandish enough.<br/><br/>Two more stars gone for characters; where are they? Sure, they are all there, milling about in the background, but the true pillar of strength of the Simpsons has been that its not just been about the Simpsons family! I don't want to see Maggie or Homer for the whole movie! Two more stars subtracted for setting. Alaska? domes? What? And the last two stars for hypocrisy, for the Simpsons creative team producing what they at their best once despised; easy, obvious, lowest common denominator humor. Most of the (perhaps three or four) funny moments blown in the previews. Not the slightest risk taken. Even the ""environmental theme"" is played about as safe as can be in the Inhofe era.<br/><br/>Not funny, not Simpsons quality (of any season's standard), not worth it."
"Jonny_Numb","7","15","23","3 August 2007"," An incendiary, hilarious, and ultimately anticlimactic ride
","For all the creativity crammed into one half-hour episode of ""The Simpsons,"" I am probably not alone in saying that the show's creative apex bottomed out when it stopped being a ""funny sitcom"" and became a ""cultural phenomenon""--it's been years since I've sat in front of the TV on a Sunday night with the primary interest of being wowed by Matt Groening's brainchild. When the show first began in 1989, the Bart-friendly T-shirts and pins seemed borne out of uncertainty over the show's staying power; these days, with the show's position in the TV canon firmly established, your Xbox games are designed for little more than feeding the ""Simpsons"" cash cow. That being said, I revisit the show every once in a while (via taped weekday-afternoon reruns of earlier seasons), and very much appreciate it--the sense of satire is sly, incendiary, and often very funny. Some critics cite horror films as being able to express social concerns that would be difficult to convey in other genres; ""The Simpsons"" would be another arena (and easily the more critically acclaimed).<br/><br/>So, after years of hype, this cultural phenomenon has spawned a film (aptly titled ""The Simpsons Movie"") that most fans will no doubt consider 'belated.' As a laid-back viewer with an appreciation of the show, the end result is frequently ""LOL"" hilarious, but not very endearing (honestly, I had forgotten most of the gags by the time I was out of the theater and walking to my car). The best I can say is, ""it's like a really good episode of the TV show"" rather than ""a great film,"" though I guess that's complimentary enough. I will pick up the DVD once it's released, and be reminded all over of why the film succeeded in its primary goal of clever laughs.<br/><br/>It begins with an excellent jab at the film's own existence, courtesy of Homer (""Why pay for something we can watch on TV for free?"" indeed!), then delves into a plot that is as incendiary as anything the yellow-tinged family has tackled: an environmental crisis strikes Springfield when Homer dumps a silo a pig feces in a lake that's been recently de-contaminated, inspiring outrage from the citizens and the government (headed by President Schwarzenegger, though I kept thinking ""President McBain""), whose EPA liaison (voiced by Albert Brooks, who also guest-voiced the similar ""Hal Scorpio"" years ago) covers the contaminated city in a huge Plexiglas dome. Before you can say ""Al Gore eats yellow snow,"" the Simpsons escape through a literal sinkhole and make tracks for Alaska as renegades from the law, only to find themselves returning to rescue their idyllic American home.<br/><br/>Which ultimately isn't much different than what you would find in an average episode of ""The Simpsons."" This is a film that knows its audience, but also successfully provides an initiation for those who (for some strange reason) have never seen the show. The animation is fluid, colorful, and uber-glossy, and the writing is on par with the better episodes (the mantra remains ""anything goes"" in ""Simpson""-world); some intriguing character twists aside, the film overall neither exceeds nor diminishes the expectations of those who expect everything and those who expect nothing. It's a fun summer film, but not an outstanding blockbuster of endearing quality...you'll laugh heartily and maybe feel moved, but the relatively short running time is both a blessing and a curse--while you will be sufficiently guffawed-out by the end credits, ""The Simpsons Movie"" leaves a viewer yearning for more. I suppose that's as good an indication as any to go back to the tapes."
"vitaleralphlouis","1","67","125","29 July 2007"," Homer As the All-Time Movie Star -- I Think Not!
","THE SIMPSONS MOVIE, like the long running SIMPSONS TV show, is a theme that was good a long time ago, but has been worn out till it's flat. Sure there are a handful of laughs here, but not enough to make it a classic --- or anything close to a classic. Most likely it'll be gone from the multiplexes within 4 weeks to resurface at Christmas in DVD.<br/><br/>Now look at the input on the IMDb website. If you can believe that over 60% of the audience rated this movie a 10, and that its #46 in the list of ALL TIME classics, then you'd have to believe this: That it's better than Wizard of Oz. That it's better than Snow White or any of the Walt Disney classics that endured for 60 to 70 years. That it's better than Gone With The Wind. That it's better than To Kill a Mockingbird. That it's better than Bridge on the River Kwai. That it's almost as good as any of the 3 great Star Wars movies --- et cetera.<br/><br/>Since the Simpsons is mostly adult humor that kids enjoy rather than children's humor that adults enjoy; one can't suppose the high score is a bunch of kids gone wild. I think this is another example of studio generated corruption of the IMDb website. Studios have falsified good reviews for decades (they can be bought for cash) so it follows they'd stoop to the same thing here.<br/><br/>A rating of 46th best movie of all time for The Simpsons Movie is pure nonsense. I wish the studios would keep hands off and let real movie fans input their opinions. As a security person, I don't know any way IMDb can stop this and still let you and I input our opinions."

"tom0385","4","52","95","3 August 2007"," A disgrace to one of the best loved TV pieces of all time
","The Simpsons. A show, no, a TV revolution, loved by so many. I, like many other Simpsons fans have watched the shows demise over the past few years. The Simpons was never just a TV show for me, it was a representation of society, it was clever, it was witty, it was sarcastic, it was satirical, it was layered, it was 'real' - at least as real as an animated TV show can get.<br/><br/>I was hoping so dearly that the movie would capture some of what The Simpsons used to do for us.<br/><br/>My God. I don't even know where to start when describing this movie. I grew up with The Simpsons, it almost seems wrong to admit how awful this movie was. NO, I can't keep quiet, this movie was HORRIBLE.<br/><br/>It pains me to see reviews stating that ""any real Simpsons fan will love this movie."" What a load of tripe. Any REAL Simpsons fan will see this movie as the final nail in the coffin of a masterpiece that should have gone out on top, a disgrace to one of the best loved TV comedy pieces of all time.<br/><br/>This movie was targeted at morons who have no idea what humour is. The kind of idiots who'll find terrible slapstick, forced 1 liners and bumbling fools falling over 'hilarious'. Dumbed down would be an understatement. Even the potentially humorous moments in the movie were ruined by overly long build-ups and predictable executions. Any intelligence and satire that the Simpsons used to portray is nowhere to be found in this pile of cheap hogwash.<br/><br/>This movie is NOT The Simpsons, in the same way recent TV seasons aren't either. At least the TV series will occasionally pay homage to its former self. It may have the same yellow characters on screen, but this may as well have been a completely new animated family (and the family is the only thing you'll see on screen throughout the movie) - oh wait, that wouldn't sell.<br/><br/>The entire movie follows the family around, most of which pointlessly takes place outside of Springfield. There is ONE 'story' going on throughout the 90 minutes, rather than two or more intertwining with each other like on the show (and I firmly believe this was one of the shows most valuable characteristics). The story itself is atrocious. It contains no solid or believable plot, utterly forced jokes and things we've seen done in the show a dozen times, void of any of the shows charm.<br/><br/>The sub-plots in the movie fail to even materialise. ""Lisa and Colin"", ""Bart and Flanders""? These were impossibly frustrating to watch and went nowhere.<br/><br/>It seems the movie has tried to copy Family Guy and failed miserably. Instead of seeing Homer as a cute, unlucky, lovable character, he's been turned into a vulgar, loud-mouthed yob. Bart's no longer a brat  he's been turned into some kind of emotional, frustrated kid who isn't happy with his father. What on Earth? Family Guy on the other hand knows what it is  it IS crude and vulgar, but it does it well. The Simpsons, though, seems to be lost and has no idea of its own identity.<br/><br/>It's a real shame that The Simpsons has had to end up where it is. As far as I, a real Simpsons fan, am concerned, this movie isn't part of the Simpsons I love, and I'll always remember the show for what it was and represented to me."
"segamon","1","23","38","4 September 2007"," Horrendous
","I can remember so many episodes of The Simpsons that made me laugh. Just as many episodes were also thought-provoking. Others were just plain fun to watch. Still more episodes had a good moral to the story. I consider myself a Simpsons fan from seasons 1 through approximately 10 (1989-1999). After these seasons, I slowly stopped watching the series due to it not being funny anymore. The laughing, thought-provoking, fun to watch, good morals of The Simpsons I knew were all gone. What came in it's place was slap-stick, sexual and political humor, direct personal attacks upon celebrities and politicians (aka ad hominem) and a complete lack of morality.<br/><br/>Come The Simpsons movie. When I first saw the movie poster at a theater, I was against seeing the movie. Then, when the movie did come out, my fiancé' convinced me to see it and I actually became a little excited about it hoping that some of the old Simpsons would be in the movie (at least a little bit of it, please!). Even with my low expectations, the movie was even lower. The humor mirrored the current style in the episodes, there were no hand-drawn animations, jokes from the seasons I enjoyed were redone but completely disgraced and I certainly wasn't having a good time. I tolerated it and I still enjoyed the air conditioning of the theater, but that's about it. There were a few parts of the movie that were... eh, OK, I guess...<br/><br/>So, if you are a Simpson fan similar to me, then I would suggest that you not watch the movie. If you enjoy the current Simpsons, then this would be for you. I still don't understand why so many people enjoy this movie, all of the humor is so shallow. Oh well."

","This film was so far below average the English language has no words I can utilise to describe it. As a comedy, it lacks almost little to no comedic value. The excessive inclusion of all characters is something you would expect from an action movie loaded with A-List actors who under-perform. I can see why it was 20 years in the making and I am a huge The Simpsons fan. Short of a few mediocre jokes, I found this film to be almost a sell-out by Groening and Simon. I appreciate the fact they were creating the season at the same time, but I myself could've written a far better screenplay for this film based soley on my addiction and favorable desire to aspire to achieve anything near to Groening and the staff writers. All in all I think the film is about a 2-3/10. The animation was worthy of credit, but I associate my thinking with computer gaming and animation. A computer game can have the best graphics, the best voice-overs and the most popular production and marketing team behind it.... yet without a decent script and game play, games tend to flop. Which is what I have inevitably deduced The Simpsons Movie to be.... a flop. I am glad however that Groening and Simon have made a decent amount from this, Fox pay them nothing and 20 years of great hard work makes them deserve ALL of the royalties and publicity they are due.

","I've Been a Simpsons fan for longer than I can remember. With the exception of the most recent seasons, I have seen most of the episodes. But in my opinion Simpsons jumped the shark years ago, and after seeing this movie my feelings were vindicated. The jokes are outdated and the characters not as funny as they used to be. I think the moment that the South Park movie came out its been all down hill for that show. The Simpsons used to be so funny because it was the most controversial show on TV, they went places other shows wouldn't and couldn't. I was in a packed theater and I did not hear one person really laugh. I heard a couple of chuckles but nothing significant. I know it would be sad to see it go but every show has its time. I mean All in the Family just wouldn't work today. Could they just not dig under the bubble, I mean come on! I know it's a movie and a cartoon and were supposed to just believe but thats just an insult on my intelligence."
"jrclar","4","11","16","13 August 2007"," A really disappointing let down
","Unfortunately the Simpsons movie fails in its attempt to translate to the big screen. This is both surprising and disappointing as whereas shows like south park have more and more pulled in ratings by pushing the boundaries of bad taste, the Simpsons even though has included more adult humour as of late has always primarily relied on excellent set pieces and a fantastic and varied supporting cast.<br/><br/>The last of these points illustrates one of the main failings of this movie, the cast of supporting characters are given less screen time than in a normal Simpsons episode which makes the movie feel like there is something lacking. The story is also wildly implausible even by the Simpsons standards and also feels void of any real substance, most Simpsons episodes involve a small scale situation which sometimes but not always progresses to a larger scale with the humour revolving around the Simpsons handling of the situation, not giving too much away but the progression of events feels rushed and with the talent of the writers you feel they could have thought of something better .<br/><br/>Unfortunately as with many movies that I have personally seen lately most of the best bits of the film are in the trailer. Everyone in the cinema was obviously looking forward to the arrival of spider pig but apart from what you see of him in the trailer he is discarded very quickly which left many people confused. The jokes are also hit and miss some of them actually made people in the cinema groan, this was again a disappointment as the Simpsons is known for laugh out loud moments. The movie also rehashes at least one story line which has been covered several times in the various seasons of the Simpsons, this either feels like laziness on the part of the writers or an attempt to include a storyline which they know has kept viewers attentions for several years and will help as the producers of the movie said to introduce the movie to those people who had not watched the Simpsons before. This being said it still feels that the writers could have thought up a fresh idea for both fans and newcomers alike. As some people who have watched the film will know there is one moment of nudity that while drawn was none the less more shocking than funny and from the reactions in the cinema it was ill advised, parents were tutting, some children were laughing heartily but some stared at the screen not really sure what reaction they should have, this moment was in total contrast to events at the beginning of the movie where an itchy and scratchy cartoon has been toned down, this made the film feel a bit of a mess.<br/><br/>In conclusion the Simpsons movie suffers from a lack of what the show is all about, a superb support cast, simple yet effective comedy and a story that while not totally unbelievable doesn't leave you scratching your head as to what the hell is going on. This movie is the most disappointing film I have seen in a while which is a great shame."
"MidnightWarrior","1","28","48","30 July 2007"," Terrible
","Yes, that's right. This film is terrible. When I first saw the trailers, I was very reluctant to go see this film.<br/><br/>In my opinion, the best episodes of the Simpsons were the ones either written or produced by Conan O'Brien. These episodes were the earliest and were some of the first Simpsons episodes after the Tracey Ulman show. The ones that followed were funny, smart and still good.<br/><br/>I stopped watching The Simpsons television show after 2001 because, again in my opinion, they'd run out of new ideas and were making these newer episodes for the sake of making episodes. The humor was very dry and bland.<br/><br/>What made me decide to watch this film was all the raving on IMDb on how great and how funny this new movie is. Boy was I wrong to listen to the fellow IMDb posters and watch this.<br/><br/>***SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT SPOILER ALERT*** <br/><br/>I agree with Homer when, not even five minutes into the film, he looks at the screen and points straight to the audience and says something to the tune of, ""All you people are suckers. You PAID to watch this film"".<br/><br/>***END SPOILER*** <br/><br/>Yeah. It's THAT bad. The racist black joke wasn't taken very well in the theater I was in. The audience (myself included) actually GROANED.<br/><br/>There were a few instances within this film that were somewhat funny, but it seemed to take an enormous amount of set up to execute the joke. What's left is the audience feeling that the script writers are trying excessively way too hard to force a laugh and make this funny.<br/><br/>The makers had gobs of potential to make this film SO good, but they bombed it completely. The feel of this film is nothing more than an over extended episode with meaningless, pointless direction.<br/><br/>It's like we keep seeing Homer on the big screen and then it's like, ""oh okay.

"eddyx77","2","17","27","3 August 2007"," A Major Disappointment
","After reading some other reviews here on IMDb that likened ""The Simpsons Movie"" to the glory years of seasons 3-8, I decided to see it myself in theaters yesterday. Unfortunately, I was seriously disappointed with the film on just about every level. Despite the claims made by some of the more overzealous fanboys on IMDb, this is NOT a return to form for the Simpsons. This movie, in fact, is not even as good as the BEST episodes from the new seasons.<br/><br/>If you are expecting this film to expand upon (or simply make decent use of) the Simpsons universe that the die-hard fans know and love, as I was, you will be very upset when the final credits roll. This is really the Homer show, and as other critics have noted, even normally major players like Moe, Chief Wiggum, and Mr. Burns have very little time on screen. The premise is no more grandiose or complex than any Simpsons episode and the development of story is significant less than that of the really good episodes, let alone the true greats. Most of the details of the film feel superfluous and erratic. In other words, the film lacks any real cohesion. It also feels like certain aspects are simply rehashed in an almost parody-like manner from far superior episodes of the series during its prime. I don't want to give away anything, but those of you who watched the show religiously for the past 17 years will find that a lot of the film is highly derivative.<br/><br/>The bottom line is this: The movie doesn't feel like a movie, but rather like an expanded version of one of the newer episodes, and a not particularly funny or coherent episode at that. It doesn't offer anything new or interesting to the die-hard fans and it simply isn't very funny. I went into the theater with a very open mind and was actually quite excited to see the film. I laughed out loud only once during the entire movie and by about the 45 minute mark I was waiting for it to end.<br/><br/>The only positive thing to be said about the film is that the animation was nice, but it was really not much above that of the TV series as it is now. In fact, the computer enhancement reminded me of the episodes of ""Futurama"" that I had seen.<br/><br/>The only conclusion that I can reach based on the very high scores this film has received on IMDb so far is that for many fans, it is hard to let go of something that was once so great. Unfortunately, this film was just plain awful and it only serves to reinforce every true fan's greatest fear; that the Simpsons has become a shallow parody of a once brilliant work of art."

","For those of you who have hated the last several seasons of The Simpsons but were hoping that this film would be great due to the pedigree of talent that is found in its credits, I am sad to inform you that this film will disappoint you. To be fair, compared to the rubbish they have fed us in the last 8 seasons, the film was somewhat watchable. A few jokes in the beginning are very funny, and overall the opening to the film is solid. However, at the point of Homer meeting his beloved Spider Pig (which everyone in the theater loved except for me), the film transitions into a poorly crafted, overwrought melodrama that is mildly painful to sit through. You get a mixture of pathetic melancholy material and lackluster gags - it is awful, and I don't mean awful entertaining. The biggest problem with the film is that its creators forgot that The Simpsons is a comedy, not an animated soap opera.<br/><br/>I've been watching the show since I was born. Simpsons Roasting on an Open Fire was aired on December 17, 1989, when I was nearly a month old. So this show basically grew up with me, and I consider Seasons 3-9 of the Simpsons to be the greatest works the television industry has ever created. Even though I can't stand watching the new episodes, I was still somewhat excited and mildly optimistic about this film. It could have been worse, but that's faint praise. If you're a long-time fan disillusioned with the show as I am, I recommend just watching the first 30 minutes of the movie and then hopping to something better. You won't be missing much. As Moleman said, ""you cost me (86) minutes of my life and I want them back!"""

","Spider Pig. I thought to myself as I watched the trailer: ""That seems funny"". By the time I'd even reached the theatre I had seen that damn pig ad nauseum. So when it came to actually viewing this movie, I couldn't bring myself to laugh. Spider Pig also disappears halfway through with no explanation. I suppose it's better than some characters which got no screen time / lines at all. Sideshow Bob? Patty and Selma? I miss their hilarious asides of seasons long, long gone. This movie seemed like a contest between all the characters to see which one was the most stupid. The underlying theme of 'saving planet earth' is so typical of this era. Pity it will seem dated no matter what the outcome of climate change is. Don't get me wrong, people were laughing. I wasn't, and the people I was with weren't either. Where was the subtlety? The joke of ""Between a Rock and a Hard Place"" was embarrassing because it wasted too much time for such a cheap, easy joke.<br/><br/>To tell the truth, I was half-expecting this outcome. Critics and audiences lap it up not because they couldn't help laughing. No. Rather, because they either wanted to. Or even felt they had to."

"damions72","1","25","43","16 August 2007"," this movie sucked!!!!!!
","This movie was so unbelievably bad I couldn't even watch it without thinking how much respect I had lost for the writers who I loved. That is until they wrote this garbage. Sure, there were some funny parts and I'm all about taking shots at religion, but the first ten minutes do not represent what this movie actually is. What this movie actually is is a desperate attempt at a fifth season show that turned out to be just another crappy new episode. this movie disappointed me for a reason that i am sure other fans are equally as disappointed. It didn't have the Simpson charm. This movie was made for any teenager who wants to go to the movies to get crappy humor you get from family guy(possibly the worst show of the generation)and to leave feeling satisfied. As a die hard fan of the show(which I can assure you i am) this movie did not hold a candle to the first ten years of the series. I'll go down the list of things that make the series great but for some unknown reason the writers kept out of the movie. 1.Principal Skinner. 2.dangerous Krusty merchandise. 3.gay jokes about smithers. 4.stories that actually came from the hearts of the writers. 5.homer getting drunk. 6.patty and Selma, and if homer screws up like he does in this movie, they are the two people who absolutely need to be there. 7.i am not 100% sure about this but i'm don't think homer even says mmmmm... followed by a food. The political commentary was so bad. i don't even know what point they were trying to get across. choosing the EPA as the villain was a huge srike-out for the writers. especially when the obvious choice to use sideshow bob was(for lack of a better word)OBVIOUS. it would have been so much more simpsonsy. the shots they took at the government were just directed at kids who hate the government but don't know why they hate the government. is it just me or was president schwartzegger just stupid? the shots at the government could have been way smarter if they just put George W. in the movie. or, to be loyal to the show, made it Rainer wolf castle. by putting in green day, Hillary Clinton, and an inconvenient truth parody, the timeless quality of the movie is destroyed. you can look at it and tell exactly when it was made, whereas the earlier episodes can be showed at any time and they would be as funny as they were at air-date. by putting in new characters that SUCKED like Lisa's boyfriend, and cargill, they needed to make room by taking out characters who make the show awesome. raunchy aspects like Bart's penis, homer's middle fingers and Otto smoking pot made the characters just not seem like themselves. by the way, Bart's subplot with Flanders was bull plop. it was just so NOT Bart. Marge's tape was so predictable. her and homer have been on this merry-go-round of lies so many times before, you know how its going to end, so why go through the charade over and over. ALSO, i'll have a hard time saying it but there was one word that made me so mad i wanted to rip my theater seat out of the ground and throw it at the wall.....sequel?"

It was exactly like the crappy new episodes. I got a mild forced chuckle out of a few lines or scenes.. but it wasn't well-written, it wasn't clever, homer was a soulless oaf, it wasn't funny. It hurt. It was a kick in the face to everyone who loved the series back in it's prime. The show that used to be more or less about a typical family that happens to be yellow and animated is gone forever I suppose, and has been replaced by a show (and now a movie) about a completely unbelievable family of outrageous unlovable unlikeable monsters."

But then, as the story progressed, I realized that I was indeed duped by the easy outs the writers on this show have taken as of late. Rehashed episodes (Cape Feare, Bart's Comet) and rehashed scenes (the Carpenters from The Way We Were) Will make any die-hard fan want to puke in their mouth.<br/><br/>Shame on all of you who have been giving this film great marks. Over the past decade, Matt Groening has taken one of the funniest shows ever and turned it into a corporate cash cow. Were people's expectations for this film really this low that it could receive an 8.8 after 9000 votes!? I can go on about the film's shortcomings. The lack of allusive humor (a foundation for the Simpsons) was abominable.

"lloyd-constable-1","3","13","20","17 August 2007"," Disappointing, why did they have to make it?
","Not much to say really, weak story line, all the funny bits had been repeatedly advertised on television, therefore when you saw them in the film it was just 'luke warm funny'. It is such a shame, as I am a massive fan of the TV series, why did they feel they had to make this film? I didn't like how the characters personalities seemed to be different too. Basically I found this film to be a really big disappointment. It is such a shame as The Simpsons is such an amazing sitcom! Ooh, actually the best bit of the film was Ralph in the 20th Century Fox opening credits, which now makes me thing they should make a film based on him being the central character/hero of the film. That would be ""some good tooting boy"" - what do you think?"
"camelot2302","5","28","49","29 July 2007"," Extremely disappointing. Not up to the usual Simpsons standard
","When you watch the Simpsons, you know not to expect a life-changing earth-shattering event so I went into the cinema with my box of doughnuts, saying ""doh!"" to the cinema employees and settled back to watch what I thought would be a barrel of laughs. Now that it's over, my initial thought was ""what the hell was that?"" <br/><br/>Now before you say ""ah, he's in Germany. They have no humour there"", let me set the record straight by saying that I am British and the British sense of humour is the best in the world. We even ""get"" the Simpsons. But this was struggling for laughs from the get-go. When you have to introduce a pig as ""Spider-Pig"" then you know the movie is in trouble.<br/><br/>I think the problem is that the Simpsons is only really designed to be a 20 minute television episode. To stretch it to 90 minutes is really pushing it. The movie tries to be all things to all people by pushing in as many characters as possible and as many plots as possible. The sub-plots (such as Spider-Pig) are just plain stupid (even by Simpsons standards) and the producers couldn't even resist making a political statement by including Itchy (or was it Scratchy?) as President Hillary Clinton's Vice-President or making a dig at Alaska's dependency on the oil companies. They even had Lisa lampooning Al Gore by making an environmental speech called ""An Irritating Truth"".<br/><br/>The one moment that got the biggest laugh was US President Arnold Schwarzenegger who said to his aide ""I was elected to lead, not to read!"".<br/><br/>During the closing credits, Maggie utters her first word : ""Sequel?"". I certainly hope not."

And all I saw in that time were watered down parts (no blood in Itchy and Scratchy?!) so that it could be a PG, and jokes that have been recycled from episodes.<br/><br/>For example:<br/><br/>*When Homer goes to church in the beginning he states that he wants to worship God in his own way, like praying like hell on his death bed. He's said this before in the episode ""Homer the Heretic"", except he used the word ""recant"" as opposed to ""praying like hell"" - obviously changed in the movie so kids could understand it.<br/><br/>*When Grandpa has the vision in the church, he rolls around on the floor in a circle... something Homer did in the ""Last Exit To Springfield"" episode where he is appointed head of the union, and negotiates with Mr Burns in an attempt to get the Dental Plan back.<br/><br/>*Near the end, when Homer and Bart try to make the jump and fail initially... that's been seen before.<br/><br/>*As has the part where Apu changes the sell-by date because the product had gone out of date.<br/><br/>I'm not going to watch the rest of it because I'm sure that, based on the few minutes of this I have seen, there will be more recycled jokes which made me laugh at the time, but not now.<br/><br/>The beauty of The Simpsons, in my opinion, is that the episodes are clever and are there to appeal to an older audience (or certainly were, before they started getting boring and unfunny).<br/><br/>However, the film is just for kids, or for adults to take their kids to the cinema.<br/><br/>It may make new fans this, but I don't think it will please the old ones.

The movie seemed more inclined to focus on the conflict rather that the characters to me. It was as funny as I think it could have been, and was somewhat of a disappointment for me.

"shermanlazzar","1","15","24","6 October 2008"," I officially withdraw my support from this show
","At its best (circa early 90's) The Simpsons was a show possibly unmatched in its brilliance, not just for an animated show but for any comedy. 15 years or so later, and regrettably it has become one of the worst shows on television, culminating in one of the worst films I have ever seen.<br/><br/>The film has so little redeeming value I don't know where to start. I can remember only one scene which I almost laughed and there were SEVERAL where I cringed, one comment bordering on racist. As I watched this I felt many things; mainly bored and completely patronised. The plot s utterly stupid, its not even worth analysing needless to say it was so bad that I actually stopped paying attention.<br/><br/>The degeneration of this show couldn't have been captured more perfectly in this film. The main problem is that the characters have become so unlikeable, particularly Homer. Homer used to be lovable moron - but at the same time witty, he has become slapstick - in your face stupid, to the point of being extremely annoying - ditto Bart. The show has made the mistake of re-hashing jokes from the wrong types of characters. As many have mentioned, the token slapstick characters seem to have been given predominantly more airtime resulted further in the deterioration of the show - eg. Comic Book Guy, Cletus, cat lady and other one-card wonder characters. And is it just me or is Nelson and Ralph the too most unfunny characters - possibly in cartoon history. Can someone please write a threatening letter to Nancy Cartwright so we can just end them? Then write something scary to the writers of this film, though I'm they'll scare easy, having masterminded this abomination. Its perplexing that the show has fallen THIS far. I've lost all respect for Matt Greoning and those associated with the show since inception. How could they treat their fans with so much disdain.<br/><br/>I actually walked out on this film, its impossible for me to express how disappointed I was or how many levels it was awful, I'd suggest you see it for yourself, if nothing other than to finally withdraw your support from this brand. Switch over to Family Guy, at least that show doesn't take itself seriously, and remembers how to write adult humour."

","Ever since the first movie trailer leaked out on to the airwaves, everyone thought the Simpson's movie was going to be the biggest thing to hit us this summer. Unfortunately, this movie fails on so many levels that it's sad. It's the Hank Scorpio episode remixed and stretched out into a movie. The characters in this movie take such a dramatic turn from their old selves that all we're left with is exploited and annoying failures. Homer was turned from the classic oaf with a big heart for his children into a brainless jerk who relies heavily on slapstick comedy. Bart was turned from bad boy into a emotional drunk and Lisa went from the smart voice of reason into the nagging voice of self righteousness. <br/><br/>It's garbage, and it's 85 minutes of it using the same jokes we saw years ago. <br/><br/>Though, it's not as bad as the last couple of seasons that you may have seen on television, but at least you weren't charged for that. The film, in my honest opinion would have been pretty good if it was a ""Made for T.V. Movie"" and aired on T.V., but the fact that I had to pay nine dollars for it, makes it pure garbage. Like so many disappointed fans have wrote before me, I want a refund, and if you pay for it, you'll want one to."
"zetes","6","35","64","29 July 2007"," Meant more for casual fans than for diehards. Plus, the format just doesn't really work as a movie, I think.
","I'm an absolute fanatic of The Simpsons and have been watching it since it was on Tracey Ullman. I grew up with it. I was the exact same age as Bart when the very first episode premiered. Unlike a lot of fans, I've never turned my back on the show. I am not one who thinks each new episode is worse than the last. I do acknowledge that it's long past its peak, but I think almost every new episode is funny enough to be worth seeing. Once in a while, they'll produce an episode that's genuinely fantastic. But, really, I don't demand fantastic. I'll settle for a few good laughs and be at least moderately happy. Now comes The Simpsons Movie, which had been talked about for the last 15 years, at least. Much like when I watch new episodes, I wasn't expecting the movie to be that great. Unfortunately, it fell below even those expectations. It has a few good jokes and moments (the only time I laughed really loud was the Tom Hanks bit), but it doesn't do much right. Those who've long turned their backs on the show like to complain about recycled plot lines. It's true, of course, for pretty much every new episode, but the show has grown more manic and self-referential over time. Many don't like that, either, but I personally do like those kind of jokes. The movie just plods along with a predictable plot that's made up of some of the most basic of all Simpsons plots: Homer and Marge relationship problems, Lisa's environmental concerns, and Bart's loss of faith in his father. None of it here is done with the irony of the newer episodes. It's like it's part of the really early Simpsons, when we hadn't seen these plots a billion times. Except it completely lacks the perfect comic timing of the early seasons. In the end, the movie is only an occasionally amusing affair. Certainly it's worth seeing if you're a fan, but, unless you're the kind of nut I am, you can wait for the DVD."

With a bit of fancy camera-work, slightly souped up animation and as many one liners and gags the wirters can think of! No matter how hard the writers try don't they realise it's likely they will never reach the comedy gold of the first 8 seasons? Those seasons didn't rely on slapstick as much, and crappy and unimaginative one liners, just what this film relys on.<br/><br/>It's obvious this film will do very well at the box office, and thats fine with me, the simpsons is a worldwide phenomenon, it's just the quality of the seasons has steadily got worse and now this.

I knew it was going to be bad ever since i heard about its release, it was over-hyped and under written which is a really bad combination.<br/><br/>The most built up comedy scene was ""spiderpig"" or at least thats what everyone was talking about, i know Homer for his dry and sarcastic humour, which was rarely (if at all) seen in The Simpsons Movie. The Simpsons has always been seen as a series in which both adults and children alike can appreciate, which the movie didn't portray. Have you noticed how fast it has died?, it is barley even talked about now and i don't even have to question why. All i know is i'm going to forget it existed and stick with the episodes instead."
"eraserhanks","2","9","13","5 August 2007"," The Downward Spiral.
","I went to see a midnight showing of the movie after I got off work. My good friend and long time Simpsons fan who also works with me came along. As the movie started, I noticed the goosebumps on my arms, the hairs on my body standing on end, and the anticipation in the air. I loved the opening; not what I expected, but pleasing. Sadly, the first scene and maybe the first ten or twenty minutes delivered to me and the rest just left me asking ""Wait... The early season writers wrote this?"" Yeah, I admit it, I am on of The Simpson ""fans"" that regularly says to my friends.. ""Yeah man, I like the early episodes, but after awhile, they just lost the heart, you know? Episodes like 'Secrets of a Successful Marriage' and 'One fish, Two fish, Blow fish, Blue fish' actually made me relate and feel like I wasn't just watching a cartoon series."" <br/><br/>As common as it is today to hear that or similar statements from fans, it couldn't be further from the truth.<br/><br/>The movie was...bad; easy, cheap laughs for the most part. Hardly any of the witty, smart aspects were there at all. There were a few gags here and there that delivered, but never at any time did I think it could compare what-so-ever to the old episodes, unbelievably written by most of the writers that worked on the movie.<br/><br/>What annoyed and angered me more than anything was the horrible attempted political commentary (E.P.A. as a villain?), and Green Day, of course. What I love about the simpsons is the simpson univerese itself. Of course, there were always guest stars from time to time, but it always felt like ""The Simpson Universe-anytown U.S.A"" to me. It felt like the episodes could be shuffled around, and not one would affect the other. The writers developed each character so well that it hardly seemed like a cartoon. The ""good"" Simpsons are timeless. That's the word: Timeless...<br/><br/>...but horrible current political commentary and a Greenday appearance make it painfully clear exactly when this movie came out. If the political commentary was clever or sharp in any way, it MIGHT have worked. Instead, you have your random, cheap laugh, Family Guy-like humor that has unfortunately polluted comedy on screen to the point where it's rare to find something that actually makes your soul giggle and feel like it was worth it (Like the old Simpson seasons).<br/><br/>Why was Burns not the villain? Can someone please explain this to me? It is ""THE Simposns movie"" for God's sake. The man had one scene. Sorry, I know that this is immature and just plain horrible to say, being that every fan would want to make the movie his/her own way, but c'mon. Team Mr.Burns up with Sideshow Bob! Make us feel like we're in Springfield! Anyways, I'm getting off track. Back to my review: What I love most about the old episodes is, in fact, the heart and moral quality. The movie spent most of its time with bad political humor, Homer acting not quite like himself, and a Bart who we just don't recognize on screen. Bart hates Flanders. We all know this. Bart thinks Homer is an idiot, but he loves him. The whole Bart/Flanders story was awful and just...painful to watch. I don't even need to address Homer trying to win Marge back because we've all seen it a billion times before and this was by far the most predictable unimagined way to tell the classic story that we all love: Homer makes mistake. Marge is mad at Homer. Homer dosen't know what to do. Homer makes everything okay somehow. Homer gets Marge back.<br/><br/>(By the way, in the scene where Homer watches the video Marge left him in the cabin, does Julie Cavner's voice sound a little off? Is it just me?) Oh yeah, and if Homer is messing up , where are Patty and Selma to voice their opinion? Where was Skinner? Where was Poochy? Kidding.<br/><br/>It felt like a stretched-out, recent episode that wasn't quite as bad as other episodes, but definitely not even remotely worthy of the big screen. For Christ's sake, if you're going to make a movie that triggers to the ""New Simpson fans,"" at least give us Gill. Poor Gill.<br/><br/>WORST. MOVIE. EVER."

The problem is the writing has become stale and the gags are predictable. M.Groening may like to comment on the current episodes being 'the funniest ever' but in reality, what would he know? The most intelligent and innovative writing can be collated for episodes falling between 1993 and 1997; after that, with the exception of an occasional bulls eye, they've been on a steady decline - even referring to the humourless episodes with the Leprechaun Jockeys or the Homer-raping Panda disturbs me. There are moments here but to sit through a 1hr 26 mins episode of The Simpsons which isn't that great, seems unnecessary.

Well, I guess the movie just reflects where the series has gone for the last handful of seasons. Nowhere! There were way to few references to the most classic scenes from the show, and so many of the characters that makes the Simpsons so funny was also lacking. The Simpsons isn't just funny when Homer is in the picture hurting himself. The Simpsons best humor is the subtle political incorrect satire on the American way of living. That is all gone now.

","Six chuckles, thats how much I enjoyed this movie. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a big Simpsons fan, always has been, always will be, however I was not too impressed with the Simpsons movie, i found it to be moderate at best and does not compare to the TV shows, not the really funny classic episodes at least, it was like a moderate episode stretched 90 minutes. sure there were a few funny moments but i wouldn't at all call it hilarious and it sure wasn't worth the wait or the hype.<br/><br/>First off, the plot was weak and not worthy of a 90 minute movie, it could have been easily fitted into a single episode, and the subplots are just slapstick repeats of old jokes (ie: Bart and Homer, Bart and Marge, Bart and Flanders). The supporting characters were practically non-existent, and the ones that did appear had really shallow lines except for a couple of funny lines from Flanders and Ralph, but thats about it. and well, the intro just sucked, the itchy and scratchy bit was out of place didn't really integrate well into the movie. as for the overall humor quality, well, it was average and disappointing, It contains no thoughtful parody and only very trite satire. Many of the gags are childish. Slapstick humor cannot carry a prime time television show, much less a full length feature film. It contains no complex subtext, no (intelligent) obscure references, no hilarious musical numbers and no intricate visual humor. Many jokes are recycled from older episodes yet are very crudely put together.<br/><br/>I know this isn't the best review of a movie you'll ever read, it sure isn't the best I've ever written, but I guess its just hard for me to critique the show i love so much so hard, and i was trying to be nice with everything i said above, and i'm sorry to report that the movie isn't really worth the theater ticket, but then again, watching it at the theater might be the best way to get you to laugh during this film."

","What started out as a revolutionary TV series has turned into just ""another show"". When the Simpsons first started, it was funny, new, and fresh. The producers continued along that path until the show reached its 15th or so season and the show lost most of its luster and shine. Jokes were bled dry and nothing new was added.<br/><br/>Until, the producers decided to go the obvious route, to make a movie of the long-running show to try to revive its fanbase. Long story short: it was a failure. The show relied too heavily on the familiar, overused, and sometimes not even funny, jokes. But when in doubt, the producers had the characters throw in a phrase/quip/joke/comeback that was either yelled, involved swearing, or both.<br/><br/>The main reason this movie was a bomb because everyone is used to the Simpsons being 30 minutes long. Since the movie was a little less than triple the length, it was about an hour too long."
"DavidSim240183","5","6","8","6 February 2008"," The Simpsons Movie. Was it worth the wait? Hmmm...
","The Simpsons is one of the legit hit phenomena of the last 20 years. Ever since it's conception in 1989, it's wowed, dazzled and amused audiences with its perfect blend of comedy, satire and sharp characterisation.<br/><br/>America's favourite dysfunctional family have become so ingrained in modern pop-culture that I wondered how long it would be before they emerged onto the big screen. And although creator Matt Groening first hit on the idea of a Simpsons movie way back in 1992, it took a further 15 years for the finished result to fully emerge. And the big question surely on everyone's lips is...was it worth the wait?<br/><br/>I'm afraid not. In spite of all the hype surrounding it, the 11 writers who wrote the screenplay, its lengthy production process and mass expectations, The Simpsons Movie comes up short in far too many areas.<br/><br/>I must admit that in recent years, I do feel The Simpsons has lost a fair bit of its sparkle. There was a time when I tuned into the show with almost religious fervour. Nowadays I only dip in every now and again to give it a casual glance.<br/><br/>The first ten seasons were pure televised brilliance. Consistently entertaining. Sharp satire. Witty as hell. But then after Season 11, it suddenly began to lose focus, and become increasingly more tired and formulaic. And that's a problem that infects The Simpsons Movie too.<br/><br/>The film has a plot that really wouldn't have looked out of place in the TV show. Homer adopts a pet pig that he names Spider-Pig (and then later Harry Plopper. Funnier names crossed my mind, Harry Trotter, e.g.). When he puts the pig's waste in a silo and dumps it into Springfield Lake, it pollutes the water so badly it starts churning out mutant squirrels.<br/><br/>The EPA declare Springfield an environmental hazard and encase the town in a massive glass dome. When the people realise Homer's responsible for all this, he escapes with the family and hides out in Alaska. But when the EPA decide to nuke Springfield, Homer realises he must return to clean up the mess he's made.<br/><br/>As I sat through The Simpsons Movie, I laughed aloud exactly five times. A sad reduction of the comic edge The Simpsons once had. The TV show certainly opens up onto the big screen with confidence. There is one dazzling moment where the camera glides through an entire lynch mob made up of just about every character from the show. Bart gets a bit of full frontal nudity (only a bit, mind you!), and Marge even gets a cuss-word that would have been too extreme for the TV format.<br/><br/>But for every laugh-aloud moment scattered throughout the film, you have to wonder why you're not laughing the rest of the time. I first began to get a sinking feeling about the film within the first five minutes when Grampa Simpson has something like a psychic fit while at church. He rolls around the floor muttering portents and predicting doom. I get the impression this scene was intended as an hysterical set-piece, but it falls curiously flat. I didn't laugh once. In fact if anything, the scene feels cringeworthy rather than funny.<br/><br/>And the rest of the film settles into the same kind of scattershot humour. There are many, many sight gags. Too many to recall. But where some of them hit the mark, others go far off it. I liked the scene where Homer discovers Alaska is not the way he envisioned it. So he remedies the situation by putting up a picture of it over the windscreen of his car, and he says, ""There, that's better!""<br/><br/>And one wonderful scene halfway through makes the film worth seeing for this one moment alone. Marge wants to go back to Springfield, and when Homer refuses, she packs up the kids and leaves without him. Marge leaves a videotape for him, saying she's reached the end of her tether with him. She can't just look the other way anymore, and turn a blind eye to his selfishness. And to prove she means what she says, she taped this message over they're wedding video.<br/><br/>Its a surprisingly tender scene. The one moment where the film forgets about trying to be funny and instead makes a strong, dramatic statement. But the cap on the scene is Homer is so devastated, that when the scene fades out it follows up with a cue-card saying, To Be Continued...Immediately. An absolutely delightful moment inspired in its creativity. I laughed for several minutes.<br/><br/>I also liked Homer's M.C. Escher inspired dream sequence that compels him to do the right thing. I just wish the rest of the film had some of the same inspiration. Things come to a satisfying dramatic conclusion, but the comedy just doesn't come fast enough.<br/><br/>Subplots like Lisa getting a crush on an Irish boy, and Bart seeing Ned Flanders as a potential father figure feel underdeveloped. They don't really go anywhere. And there is disappointingly little of Simpson favourites Mr Burns and Principal Skinner.<br/><br/>The Simpsons feels a bit stretched at feature length too. There's a nice self-mocking cameo appearance from Tom Hanks, but the film isn't all that it should have been. Its easy to say that's because The Simpsons works best as a TV show instead of a film. But the sad truth is, The Simpsons ran its course a long time ago. The film is just as empty as the show has become.<br/><br/>Where it once cornered the market of primetime animation, The Simpsons now seems decidedly tame when held up against the no-holds barred material of South Park. The Simpsons is a spent force. You'll probably disagree with that today, but in time, you'll come to see that I'm right."
"SeasGangDry","3","6","8","23 January 2008"," The universe has been explored...
","The Simpsons has often capitalized on its medium, and when it was first aired on The Tracy Ullman Show and shortly thereafter in a regular television spot, its uniqueness as a cartoon adult sitcom allowed such tags as ""D'oh!"" and ""Don't have a cow!"" to actually be considered subversive. If those lines no longer make you dizzy with laughter, then this movie will leave you disappointed.<br/><br/>This is because The Simpsons Movie blandly reheats almost twenty years of this family's dysfunction--Homer's loutish carelessness reacts unfavorably with (pick one or more) Marge's anxieties, Bart's need for a father, Lisa's hodge-podge of social causes, and Maggie's no-longer-cute-and-now-just-plain-annoying highly advanced reasoning and fine motor skills--and somehow feels the great urge to commit to an 84-minute rehearsal of its basic themes. The television show is actually poorer for the advent of this movie, since the latter brought into sharper relief the basic flaw in a show that once claimed to be different from the rest of the trash on TV (Matt Groening's words) by positing an animated universe in which anything could happen.<br/><br/>If ""anything"" can happen in this universe, why are we being served the same threadbare stock situations or character-driven plots of the early 90s? How is the sappy reuniting of Homer and Marge after a period when their marriage is put under pressure by buffoonery at all different from any other sitcom? What does the movie offer that we couldn't get from watching an episode on television, or even the two-part ""Who Shot Mr. Burns?"" (a much more successful ""movie"")? More money for its producers? The truth is that ""unlimited possibilities"" cannot be conveyed by any one kind of medium, for in order to make it intelligible, we have to add the content that necessarily limits it. A cartoon world is still a world, after all, and if ""random"" or ""zany"" has come to be expected, it becomes a norm, and hence very much self-limiting. <br/><br/>Sadly, by regurgitating and then flogging all of the show's underlying premises, The Simpsons Movie took some of the shine off the nostalgia I've always felt for Springfield."

","It's funny enough. I sat in the theater smiling or laughing like everyone at the situations and inside jokes.<br/><br/>But the problem is exactly what could be anticipated: It provides no reason for the jump in medium; failing to answer what in the movie couldn't be done on TV? You keep waiting for the movie to exploit some cinematic angle but it never ever gets around to it, not in any major way. How can it be that the marketing gag of turning 7-11s into Quikee-Marts is a more clever and memorable concept than the idea for the movie? <br/><br/>The end credits are a microcosm of the problem: They start one way, then... they're interrupted by a Monty Burns gag. You wait for the next cameo and it doesn't arrive. Instead... a row of theater chairs appear and the Simpsons start mocking the credits from them. Sounds promising, right? But then that idea is abandoned in barely a minute, before it even gets started. Then the credits just run normally. This is a movie designed by committee.<br/><br/>In a very poor move, Monty Burns plays no part in the plot. And look at that title! ""The Simpsons Movie"" (!) The movies hum-drum goals are exactly embodied by that disappointing, run-of-the-mill title."
"Zaptharo","2","7","10","19 September 2008"," Only an Extended Recent Season Episode
","After watching this for the second time after a friend of mine forced me to, I asked myself, just what is so special about the Simpsons Movie? Am I supposed to believe that what the critics say is actually true? Don't be fooled. The Simpsons Movie, as it turns out, is just an extended recent season episode filled with more pointless plots and humor. It's sad too, because I was a big Simpsons when it was still going strong. What made it great was it's intelligent humor and ability to reason in a well developed manner. It was a breakthrough in television and it led to other adult themed cartoons such as South Park and Family Guy. But this, this was so disappointing I was left wondering how much longer the Simpsons show was going to last.<br/><br/>As I watched the movie, I found jokes to be recycled from older episodes and ridiculous plots that led to nowhere. I never understood the point of why Homer brought ""Spider-Pig"" home, only to disappear soon for the rest of the movie. The plot was perhaps the worst aspect of the movie. Lisa falls in love with an Irish boy, Homer dumps waste in a lake, Marge goes angry, the EPA traps Springfield in a dome, the Simpsons family escapes and goes to Alaska, Marge and the kids are captured, Homer is aided by a Native American (aka boob lady) while trying to return to Springfield, a time bomb is placed in Springfield, and Homer and Bart save the day while riding the dome on a motorcycle. When you take these plot lines together, they make little to no sense. Which is what led this movie to disaster.<br/><br/>The characters were also a disappointment. The Simpsons family was the only cast that actually had a part in this movie. All of the beloved characters we've come and known over the years (Principal Skinner, Moe, Barney, Mr Burns, Apu, Krusty the Clown, Mayor Quimby, and Sideshow Bob amongst others) get little to no screen time. Instead, we get EPA Guy and an irritated Arnold Schwarzenegger. Those guys, along with ""Spider-Pig"", the Irish Boy, and Boob Lady, get more than double the screen time that the more well-known characters get. If anything, it was a recipe for disaster. Most if not all of the characters in this movie seemed forced and uninspired. Rather, this wasn't the old and beloved cast we knew. We were watching a watered down version of the show that just happened to be a movie. 85 minutes of low quality toilet humor without an ounce of genuine talent involved, with paper thin plots on top of it. I could of asked for more guest stars, but even they haven't fared well in the recent seasons of the Simpsons, so they could of made the movie even worse than it already is.<br/><br/>I'm beginning to lose trust in the Simpsons and Hollywood in general, since they seem to dilute and damage nearly every movie franchise they touch. Like the recent Indiana Jones, TMNT, Transformers, and Star Wars movies, the Simpsons movie is a failure that should be placed in the bargain bin. Just what happened to the magic these franchises once had? They've been turned into corporate cash cows, and the Simpsons is no exception. If you take my advice, you would be smart enough to purchase the older seasons of the Simpsons on DVD (Seasons 2-8) and forget the atrocity that is this movie. The only part that amused me was the beginning, when Homer told me that I should be watching TV at home and not paying to see a piece of garbage on the big screen. After that little part, I was fast asleep in the theater.<br/><br/>2 out of 10."
"DeanBitterman","5","7","10","28 April 2008"," OK movie, but not so much for old Simpsons fans
","The Simpsons movie was something I wanted to see when first watching the Simpsons 15 years ago. Now the show is only a hollow shell of what it once was, a show with sharp, subtle humor, and down to earth, believable stories. Then the stories went from believable to unbelievable, but still retained the same exceptional humor. Now all is lost, and the Simpsons movie was created in this period. The movie for the most part, was entertaining to see, but provided the occasional laugh with characters I have grown to love. That being said, parts of the movie, I found extremely unfunny, and tasteless.<br/><br/>Examples: 1. Seeing Barts penis 2. Homer giving people the middle-finger 3. Awkward Marge/Homer sex scene 4. Swearing that never took place in the series.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was a decent entry in the series to see; simply for the animation quality, and characters in a longer than usual episode. That being said, I was glad I only paid a dollar to rent the movie as it was not worth much more than that to me. Fans of the Simpsons years ago, should see this movie, and steer clear of buying it. Instead save some money for seasons 3-9 on DVD."

","To be honest, I've been a huge fan of the Simpsons since first watching it at the age of 6, and am always an avid fan of the classic seasons (1 to 8) and seasons 9 to 12 at a stretch. But since 2002, the show's fallen flat and failed to produce even a fraction of the humour or originality from it's heyday. I dreaded the release of this movie, knowing it would really only be one aimed at the younger audience that never got the opportunity to start with the classic episodes.<br/><br/>In the few months before its release, we were promised a new storyline and fresh, new, original jokes. However, it took 11 writers (one being the show's creator Matt Groening) to produce an overlong episode of the series as it is today, with the culmination of sad homophobic jokes and the same 8 sub-story lines that have been used since the classic era, but with extremely stale jokes.<br/><br/>The story (or small shred of what should be a storyline) consists of Homer taking in an obscure animal as a pet (overused subplot #1), single-handedly causing an environmental cock-up that has the rest of the townspeople baying for the family's blood (overused subplot #2) and forcing the family to flee Springfield (OSP #3).<br/><br/>During all of this, Bart disowns Homer for being a negligent parent (OSP #4), Lisa experiences first love for the 217th time (OSP #5), Marge and Homer fall out to an extent where they threaten to divorce each other (OSP #6), so it's up to Homer to try and patch up the family's differences after having an apparition telling him to go back to Springfield and sort out the mess (OSP #7).<br/><br/>If you're still awake by the end credits, make sure you catch Maggie's (10th) first word (OSP #8), that is if you haven't already lost the will to live after the extremely unfunny jokes and soul-destroying cameo scenes from rock band Green Day and actor Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Avoid this movie at all costs. Alternatively, If you want to watch it for the only witty joke in 8 miserable years of pro-Bush humour, fast forward your borrowed DVD or online video to the final 5 minutes which involves Homer literally being.... I won't give it away for those who haven't seen the movie already or avoided it up to now. Other than that, it truly is one to avoid and a total waste of money, proof that Groening should have pulled the plug on the series at the turn of the millennium."

It was slightly better than the new episodes on TV. but it is hardly a return to the quality of the early 90s. The humor was dumbed down and most of the laughs generated in the theater were from a character banging his head or something childish. A true return to form would show a comedic style that reaches all age and intelligence levels not just the slapstick humor of late. If you're looking for a classic Simpsons movie, I do not recommend this; however, if you are looking for some laughs and aren't expecting much this movie is good."

","Given the standards set by one of the funniest shows ever - certainly the most humorous by a mile from America, this was really disappointing.<br/><br/>Others go into greater depth as to why, too deep really. The problems were quite simple: 1) The who plot was tediously dull - never cared for the outcome. It wasn't a plot for a film. Imagine real characters played by real people. Would it still be interesting or a film script? Never in a million years. Who Killed Mr Burns would make an ideal script for a real film. Frank Grimes would. This never did. They should've worked on a good script and fitted the characters & gags around that.<br/><br/>2) There were no subplots.<br/><br/>3) No jokes - barely any to make you laugh - Fat Tony dumping the body & Chief Wiggum's response was one of the greatest gags ever. Worth a mark on it's own. Where was the rest of those? One or two others (from Martin) but nothing that hurt you, like in the TV show.<br/><br/>4) Underuse of the good characters. Homer has gone from the funniest character in the show to slightly irritating and the rest of the Simpsons have never been the well crafted or interesting characters. Where was Burns, Capt McAllister, Wiggum, Ralph, Quimby, Brockman, Martin? Were Patty & Selma even in it? Overuse of new characters too.<br/><br/>5) Recycled gags & plots. Whole town V Simpsons has been done to death, so to Marge leaving Homer, Simpson's moving away, Homer's invincibility crashing into things (catchphrases can remain funny but entire scenes rarely do).<br/><br/>6) Far too much music throughout the film which added nothing.<br/><br/>7) Nothing to do with the pig was funny, nor Homer getting Bart to skateboard naked seemed to be cobbled together in 2 minutes.<br/><br/>I'll still give it 5/10. It was The Simpsons after all and though such a let down from the standard it has set, there was probably some enjoyment in there."

We were waiting for Bart's eating his shorts as usual and we only got a very prudish séance of streaking on a skate board. The main theme is pollution and we had been told that it was going to be awfully gory and we got Al Gore, well wrapped up in his fat and becoming an ecological terrorist in the hand of some bureaucrat of some environmental agency under the guidance of a president who was supposed to drag us down into the darkest layers of the political world and as for blackness and darkness we get a Swharzenegger that does not know how to read.

","Unfortunately i did not think the movie lived up to the hype. probably the most successful TV series/cartoon ever made, but not one of the greatest movies. I did think before watching the movie that the writers would struggle to find the perfect storyline to ice the proverbial cake that they have spent so many years 'baking', and they did. not the most original story line in history with some very random plot twists, and some very out of character decisions. A lot of the gags played on previous jokes from the TV show, which being a watcher i understood, but didn't find all that funny, but left the first timer guessing a bit. the movie as a whole had a surrealism about it, as though it had not been written by the same people who had previously provided me with hours of entertainment. very predictable in places, but awkwardly random in others. i must say i did find parts of the movie funny, and didn't wish i hadn't seen it, but that does not save the film. i feel this film has come 5 years too late, they should have made it in the shows prime."

","Here's a metaphor for youthis ""film"" is a man with a shovel, who finds himself deep in an icy and bitterly cold cavern, with only a fire to keep him from a ghastly and lonesome death.<br/><br/>The fire once burnt so heartily and with such radiance of colour and tender warmth, however those days were long ago, in the time when the number of season had yet to breach into the realm of double figures.<br/><br/>Recent years have seen the fire wither and decay into a quivering and feeble sliver of a flame, emitting a truly pitiful amount of the much needed heat to the man. So, fuelled by his desperation to stay alive (a desperation so intense there was not time for logic or reason) the man proceeding in wildly shovelling vast amounts of his own solid feces, which over the years had accumulated into a neat and adequately sized pile.<br/><br/>He was a strong man who never tired, and was relentless in his rapid shovelling of excrement. Naturally the the fire was extinguished almost immediately, as the bombardment of cheap ""jokes"" similarly extinguished my burning fire of respect for the franchise.<br/><br/>The mans' fate was inevitable from the start, as was the movies', from the very moment the idea was conceived the stench lurked on the horizon.<br/><br/>I sincerely hope that some noble being will take the honour in dispensing a large quantity of gasoline into the deep and dark pit that the simpsons now inhabit, and after which kneeling down to stroke the head of a match briskly across the rough hide of the trusty steed at their side, and finally lossening their grip and letting it drift down the hole, to kill the Simpson's franchise once and for all, because I fear that more filth like this movie will cast too darker shadow over the earlier gold that made the simpsons a household name, and that people will instead see the Simpsons as the very disease it is shown to be in this ""film"""

","Went to the Australia premiere Tuesday night and this movie was awful. The Simpsons have steadily declines since season 11 but maaaannnnnn.... This was terrible. <br/><br/>There where several problems with this film which will cause original fans of the series to find it painful to watch. I found the plot to be quite poor, every single character had completely different personalities and the jokes where not at all funny, basically because you did not believe that a particular Simpson character would 'say' or 'do' that. For example, in the original seasons, we would have never even imagined or believed that Homer would fall in love with a pig, or that Bart would ride a skateboard naked. Plus, since when could Homer ride a motorbike? 'Spider-Pig' and many poorly scripted one-liners is poor humor and is not the same quality the Simpsons where during its prime of seasons 5-8. <br/><br/>Pros<br/><br/>Amazing animation and detail, Excellent voice acting, Tom Hanks<br/><br/>Cons<br/><br/>Poor Story, Poor Character personalities (suprisingly Homer is the most annoying character in the film) and Poor mindless jokes<br/><br/>Bart riding his skateboard naked, Homer falling in love with a pig singing 'Spider Pig' a bloody million times and boob jokes are not good humor.

","Finally I have had the pleasure after many long years of waiting to screen test this movie- and afterwards I can scarcely say this is definitely going to be the highest grossing animated movie ever made!! It has all the usual characters (its obvious when watching that the creators wanted to show every character from the TV series even if it means giving them a small part) of course there's Homer, who is as loud and proud as always, and Marge, who is cautious but loving throughout Homers huge mishap (which would stretch out to be the storyline) and Bart, Lisa and Maggie are all back too. <br/><br/>The storyline is quite different for a Simpsons theme- Homer miraculously pollutes the local river, thus the power plant is closed down and the residents of Springfield are evacuated. Cue the Simpsons who must fight to save their town or lose it forever!!! I was interested to discover that Mo was given a lot of the limelight in this movie, and that Homer was less seen than some of the other characters- hmm... Anyways, there really is little to criticise about this movie. A lot of people are rattling on about the movie being too similar to a single stretched-out episode, but this was always going to be an issue from the beginning. I suppose if you go into the movie expecting an overly long episode then thats what you'll get, but if you take it with a pinch of salt then the Simpsons Movie is great fun, and very funny."

","The more and more I saw previews for The Simpsons, the more I looked forward to seeing this movie. However, what looked promising only turned out to be a terrible, terrible movie.<br/><br/>Here's my suggestion: Watch the trailer for the movie. The trailer covers just about the entire storyline which is paper thin at best. The set up into each joke was far too predictable and hard to laugh at when I knew it was coming. Spider-pig, naked Bart, Homer sledding... every major joke was covered in the trailer and it made it near impossible to laugh at.<br/><br/>There's a reason why the last time I watched this show was sometime last decade and this movie only cements the fact that I have no desire to ever see another Simpson's episode for the rest of time.<br/><br/>The most significant part of the movie? The very beginning. Why? Because Homer (or Matt Groening) summed it up best for us that we're all fools for paying to see something in theatre we see at home on the TV for free.<br/><br/>With all that said, please, do yourself a favor and do not watch this movie."

What I cannot understand are all the positive reviews! Did all you people see the same heap of **** I just witnessed?? Call that a plot? Call it funny? No. The only mildly amusing bits were what I'd already seen in the trailers. Spider pig. But I'd seen it so many times already that when it came on screen I just wanted to sink into my seat and die. I almost felt embarrassed watching it. I think I might make myself feel better about the Simpsons by going on YouTube and watching some classic clips. It might, just might cheer me up a bit! My advice would be to save your time and save your money."

It almost felt like they were holding back intentionally by throwing in some hilarious bits and pieces and then reverting to the lowest-common-denominator jokes that drag the whole thing down.<br/><br/>There were also a lot of characters who were basically nonexistent, and that was pretty disappointing... not to mention the fact that you've already seen a lot of the funnier moments in the trailers.<br/><br/>Simpsons fans should see it, but try to lower your expectations!"

Subplots were inexplicably abandoned, gags became unbearable visual references, a la ""Family Guy"", and the overall plot became incredibly outrageous, even for ""The Simpsons"". And, I hated that Marge used inappropriate language; it simply wasn't funny.<br/><br/>Perhaps the film is a better experience if you chew peyote, listen to Johnny Cash, and dream of your favorite ""Treehouse of Horror"" episode while trying to forget that you're watching the WORST SIMPSONS MOVIE EVER!

"ExpendableMan","6","5","7","11 August 2007"," Not bad, but way too late
","There's an advert doing the rounds in the UK Odeon cinema chain at the moment proudly proclaiming 2007 to be the best summer of movies ever. Having seen it several times, I'm beginning to think I might be getting too cynical to go and see films anymore, because so far this year I have ho-hummed my way through Spiderman 3, sat befuddled through Pirates 3, smirked occasionally during Shrek 3 and failed to see what the fuss was with Transformers. And now, having seen the Simpsons movie, it pains me to say it but the best thing I can bring myself to say is that it's okay. It's not outlandishly brilliant, or a complete disaster. It's just average is all. Six stars out of ten which passes an hour and a half quite nicely but doesn't leave you craving the DVD release. But, at least it's better than the Family Guy movie.<br/><br/>On the plus side, the kids are going to love it. The screening I attended was packed out with ankle biters and they laughed every second, but for the seasoned Simpsons fanatics there is a definite sense of slight disappointment. The jokes are funny and the characters are as charming as ever, but it doesn't quite make the big enough leap to qualify as anything other than an extended TV episode. Sure, the animation is better and the colours sharper, but it's hard to shake the impression that it's merely an overlong TV script, knocked out quickly on a Friday afternoon so as to meet a deadline.<br/><br/>The obvious comparison points would be the South Park and Family Guy movies. The Family Guy one was a disaster - three episodes strung together with no funny jokes and an overwhelming air of self satisfaction. The South Park movie meanwhile was terrific - it took the formula that made the show so great and amplified it to every extreme. The Simpsons movie falls somewhere between the two; it's still a step up, but ever since the series got increasingly outlandish, having Homer and co embark on an epic adventure to save Springfield isn't quite so dramatic anymore. If this had come out around the time of the eighth or ninth seasons when the show (arguably) was at its peak, it would have felt more like the event it always should have been.<br/><br/>What's more, there's Homer. Let's be honest about Homer Simpson for a minute here, he's not that great a character anymore is he? He's crass, self-centred, bigoted, stupid and has so many mood shifts he's teetering on the brink of having multiple personalities. And in this film he's a complete jerk who becomes increasingly difficult to cheer on the more the plot develops. The lovable but dim-witted buffoon of the early series is now gone, replaced by a lumbering imbecile that sings an unfunny song about Spiderpigs.<br/><br/>Considering how beloved the Simpsons are however, none of what I'm saying ultimately matters. It's going to make millions and keep on making millions and while it is occasionally so funny I was in pain, it still feels like a let down, probably because it overdoses on slapstick and a large number of jokes might as well consist of Matt Groening shouting: ""Look everybody! Homer Simpson is an idiot!"" It's okay, but sadly is just the latest average film in a summer that's overflowing with them. I really, really hope that The Bourne Ultimatum is incredible, or I'll have to give up on multiplex blockbusters and start going to independent cinemas, wear berets and take up chain smoking."

","The Simpsons Movie was so over-hyped I looked past the fact that the series' episodes haven't been funny since season 12. The characters aren't funny anymore and seem to do the same things again and again becoming caricatures of themselves: Bart does badly at school and unlike originally, is now completely amoral. Lisa is no longer just clever, she's a mouthpiece of the show's liberal mindset. Marge is just so boring now and just nags non-stop and every episode seems to invent a new way for her marriage to Homer to be on the rocks. Homer himself is now a complete nincompoop who just acts like a slapstick buffoon. This film almost parodies how one-dimensional the characters have become.<br/><br/>The plot is completely nonsensical much like the episodes are these days but it's made worse because it's been made four times as long as an episode. At least the episodes finish in twenty minutes, this tortures us by making us think it will somehow become entertaining - believe me, it doesn't. Like other reviewers on here, I thought the film version of the show played like an overly-extended episode from the unfunny later seasons.<br/><br/>The show itself has become a liberal mouthpiece these days and the film is no exception. Almost every joke is predictable and is about the liberal agenda: Mr Burns said something ironic about how rich white men don't control America, Christianity is made fun of repeatedly as is Intelligent Design, the American President is Arnold Schwarzenegger who, shock, horror, is stupid and controlled by a big evil white corporate executive or something, (I thought this character would be funny as he has the same voice actor as Hank Scorpio which reminded me of when the show was good). When the family arrives in Alaska some man said something about how oil companies are destroying the environment which might be true but it's NOT FUNNY. Please stop preaching to me!<br/><br/>I didn't laugh once through the whole film whose plot is borrowed from other episodes: Marge and Homer's marriage is in trouble again, Springfield is polluted again and produces mutated animals again (seriously, how many times are we going to see that?), Bart thinks Homer is a lousy father again, no one is listening to Lisa's wisdom again, Maggie's hidden intellect is unnoticed by Marge again etc etc. There's nothing new in this to keep me interested and by the time the film was halfway through, I watched it to the end for the same reason I watch the episodes to the end: in the hope I might watch something funny.<br/><br/>A Simpsons film usually is about the other characters too but they're so underused in this that they feel more like cameos.<br/><br/>A Simpsons film would've been a good idea in the mid-1990s when the show was still good, but not now. This film is completely unentertaining."

Is there one person on this earth who finds repetitive slapstick (Homer repetitively sticking his hand into a lake which is 'electrified'???) and predictable 'childish' humor funny (Moe turns off lights at the bar, and his clothes are stripped from him???)? Unfortunately, there are many people who laugh at this crap... Hahahahahah...NOT!!!!!! Is it just me, or was this humor targeted to satisfy complete retards?

Homer as the Ape from 2001 etc etc. <br/><br/>But the biggest crime for me was that the movie concentrates on a plot that takes the Simpsons away from their usually fantastic supporting cast. Why use a nondescript villain instead of Mr Burns or Sideshow Bob?<br/><br/>I found myself thinking about Robert McKee during the middle of it all -Not something I like doing. But one thing that usually prevails in a well made, well scripted film - is that a sense of normality is thrown into imbalance - but this all felt imbalanced from the start. Bart for example felt like a different character. We never saw Homer at work. Or with Barney or at Moes. <br/><br/>Having said all that it is worth seeing - but maybe on DVD and some of the best jokes are at the end credits.<br/><br/>As title says I've given it a one in an effort to encourage a more responsible pattern of voting as this is not a perfect movie.

","Ahhhh, The Simpsons, 20+ years and still going strong... well still going anyway.<br/><br/>I think breaking point for me came when I recently felt strongly enough about a new episode that I rang a friend to tell him that the new Simpsons episode was actually very good. That's depressing when you think about it, especially considering that I've been watching it (and loving it) since Day 1. It's been maybe 10 years since I could make that call and mean it.<br/><br/>So after nearly 20 years they decide to announce a movie at last, or realistically 10 years after at last. Once it finally did arrive though the film was pretty good, better than I expected early on... but as I will point out again and again momentum just couldn't last.<br/><br/>Thanks to Homer (of course) Springfield has become the most polluted city in America, in an update on Escape from New York it is ""domed off"" with a giant glass object from which there is apparently no escape. The inhabitants of Springfield are - as the creator of the dome puts it - trapped like carrots.<br/><br/>It is the events leading up to the doming and subsequent escape that showed the most promise. All of the show regulars were shown but many seemed underutilised (Burns and Smithers get maybe 1 minute total). There are some quality jokes to be had, mostly due to Homer's lack of parenting skills and people getting hurt. There is also some full Bartal nudity.<br/><br/>The guest star (if you can have one in a film, and I'm saying you CAN!) is Russ Cargill, the boss of the Environmental Protection Agency who places the dome to protect the Earth. He is voiced by Albert Brooks (Marlin himself!) and he gets most of the best lines in the movie, including the ""trapped like carrots"" one mentioned earlier.<br/><br/>Unfortunately though what ensues is strongly reminiscent of the show's lifespan so far;<br/><br/>* Great start.<br/><br/>* Homer gets most of the laughs.<br/><br/>* Marge is the voice of reason and the bringer of down.<br/><br/>* Lisa has a subplot that goes nowhere.<br/><br/>* Show runs out of momentum halfway and we must realise the best is behind us.<br/><br/>In fact I can now pinpoint the exact moment that the movie loses it...<br/><br/>35 minutes. Simpson family escapes the dome, Cargill orders around the clock surveillance, has a soft/tuff guy rant and admits to being drunk with power. It is a brilliant 30 seconds, unfortunately nothing after it comes close to being as good.<br/><br/>><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><><<br/><br/>The Simpsons are pariahs in their own town and flee to Alaska, only once happily ensconsed in Palin's backyard they find out that Cargill has started to doubt his own dome and has a far more severe and permanent Plan B in mind for Springfield.<br/><br/>Marge and the kids set off to save the day while Homer searches for a deeper truth... which he finds when he meets a lady with giant boobs. Aren't they always the answer.<br/><br/>In truth Giant boob-lady is just gimmicky and tacky, the Lisa's new admirer bit was a waste of time aside from giving her a few minutes screen time and Marge has little to do in the film aside from doubt her marriage.<br/><br/>The first half was actually pretty great even if the only thing the dopey and impressionable remember is Spiderpig. If you watched the second half in isolation as two 20 minute episodes you would go away very unimpressed.<br/><br/>I still love The Simpsons, but boosting the first half of a film is a little like cheering when your sports team loses narrowly to a better opponent. An honourable defeat, but a defeat nonetheless. Despite that even though this is by no means classic it has enough good jokes and even sub-par Simpsons is still funny.<br/><br/>Final Rating - 7.5 / 10. All the bagging and a 7.5? As I said, average Simpsons is still pretty good. If you like The Simpsons: You will laugh. You will very likely enjoy this. (It just isn't a patch on Season 3 through say 8.)"

","Having not seen this movie since my second viewing in 2008, I thought for The August Rush pop this one in and see it again because my memory was foggy on this film. The Simpsons Movie is a lighthearted, fun movie that never bores and has something happening every second. Homer is surprised to find that a bunch of ""giant suckers"" paid to see a movie like this when it will come on TV for free. The Simpsons have ran for currently twenty one seasons, producing over four hundred episodes and have a merchandise line as long as The Great Wall of China. With action figures, dolls, slippers, posters, apparel, an Xbox, DVDs, VHS tapes, Blu-Rays, and now a movie to go along with, The Simpsons are in good shape to a possible 30th season and maybe longer.<br/><br/>The Simpsons is probably one of the only classic animated programs on TV anymore with others like South Park and Spongebob Squarepants. No show has ran for as long and has had so much publicity like The Simpsons. Not being the biggest fan of the show, but having seen various episodes and possessing knowledge of the show I knew I had to see this. I wasn't surprised a movie of the yellow family was made.<br/><br/>The film is something that couldn't be cut down to a thirty minute show. Springfield Lake is already in trouble with pollution, but gets worse after Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger. To store the pig's droppings, he gets a big silo labeled ""Pig Crap"". Marge tells him to dispose of the pig's droppings and he does so by dropping the gigantic silo into the Springfield Lake causing mad pollution. Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, talks it over with President Schwarzenegger and they choose (if you want to call it that) to put a gigantic dome over Springfield to contain it's severe pollution causing the whole town to erupt in anger to The Simpson Family and forcing them out of the town. The Simpsons find a way out of the town and are on the run away from the EPA.<br/><br/>The film is cute and very energetic like its on its own medicine. Its a fine example of a TV show that has a good film adaptation. One down fall of the film is it's afraid to take risks. While earning a PG-13 rating, we only see three things (language, finger gestures, and nudity) that we would never see on FOX. South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut however took numerous jumps that Comedy Central would never allow. It still holds the record for most swear words in an animated movie (with 139 uses of ""the f word"").<br/><br/>If only The Simpsons Movie took more leaps and didn't have to shade their faces whenever they made a big step. The Simpsons have kept their near squeaky clean appearance on television for more than twenty years, they deserve a couple leaps. Not to say it was bad, just once in a while, everything needs to step up. Also, its a shame that some characters like Principal Skinner and Miss Crabapple didn't get bigger roles in the movie. Some character like them and Chief Wiggum I wish played a bigger part in this movie.<br/><br/>Other than that, The Simpsons Movie is a highly enjoyable animated movie that shows after twenty years on the air, The Simpsons can still bring hard laughs and amusing one liners that are memorable. Seeing this film after a two year absence gave me a boatload of fresh laughs and a very funny plot. The Simpsons Movie isn't just a movie, its an enjoyable animated ride with the family we love.<br/><br/>Voices of: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, Albert Brooks, and Tress MacNeille.

"racesgirl2000-1","10","2","2","5 May 2010"," Great movie
","I have to admit that I'm really convinced of the concept of putting an animated TV series on the big screen in the first place. Even the ""South Park"" movie that tried to incorporate theatrical elements such as the musical numbers didn't really justify the need for a cinematic adventure. Most animated comedy shows have a very fast paced humour with quick editing. This works for an episode of 25-30 minutes but in a movie with 90 minutes running time, it would really great for the audience.<br/><br/>As a consequence ""The Simpsons Movie"" is unusually slow at times. At the same time the storyline is not really stretched to cinematic proportions. Epic as it may be, similar topics have already been dealt with in the TV show (and better). It's been said before and it's true: nothing here tries to push any boundaries and except for the length of the whole thing (and maybe some annoying people in the theatre who watch the movie with you) you would never realise that this is a ""Simpsons""-motion picture.<br/><br/>Other flaws include the fact that some inhabitants of Springfield have only very brief cameos (Mr. Burns!) and that some ideas have been used in a fairly similar way before. As entertaining as the movie still may be, it is also pretty predictable at times. This kind of ""underachieving"", as some critic called it, may have its own charm, but in the end one would have hoped for this to be a bit more special. The movie is by no means a catastrophe, but by ""Simpsons""-standards it's just not good enough.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons"" have become a brand. People know what to expect and therefore applaud even a relatively average movie like this one. To rely on that is a bit lazy, however, and one wishes that producers put an end to Homer's adventures as long as we can still remember him and the other beloved inhabitants of Springfield as characters that completely revolutionised comedy at one point and not as money making merchandising props."

But I can tick off a dozen episodes from the TV show's first eight seasons that were better, tighter stories and funnier besides.<br/><br/>It's a bad day in Springfield when Homer decides to ignore environmental warnings and dumps a silo full of pig leavings into the local lake. The EPA seals off Springfield with a giant dome, and the Simpsons become fugitives from both the government and their frenzied fellow Springfieldians. Can Homer save the town, or will he lose his family?<br/><br/>Director David Silverman and the movie producers try to create a stand-alone feature film while at the same time rallying the Simpsons' deep and loyal fan base. I think they lean too hard in the latter direction. A lot of the film's gags require audience familiarity with secondary and tertiary characters from the TV show, a.k.a. the Comic Book Guy thanking Marge Simpson for letting him wear her pregnancy pants. (""I've never known comfort like this!"") Who would have guessed Cletus the Slack-Jawed Yokel would have more lines than Mr. Burns?<br/><br/>The joke of Homer's stupidity is beaten to the ground like Joe Pesci in ""Casino"". But I laughed because it's still funny all these years on. Like Homer's trick of catching fish by dropping a bug zapper into a pond. Or his reason for choosing to move to Alaska: ""Where you can't be too fat or too drunk!""<br/><br/>Most of the jokes are single-shot affairs, like what you get these days watching ""The Simpsons"" or its pale imitator, ""Family Guy"". The opportunity to do something appropriately novel with the old formula is largely ignored. The pollution story is neither new nor interesting. The biggest sustained laugh involves Bart skateboarding naked for its numerous hidden-weiner gags. ""Listen kid, no one likes wearing clothes in public,"" an arresting officer tells him. ""But it's the law.""<br/><br/>The writers behind ""The Simpsons"" are clever enough to throw a line like that at you every few minutes, and the characters are enjoyable company that don't wear out their welcome. But I never felt I was watching anything here other than bits and pieces that would have wound up on the TV series in some form at some later time.<br/><br/>Given that it's ""The Simpsons"", and a national treasure, it's still fun to sit through ""The Simpsons Movie"". But like ""Mt. Rushmore: The Board Game"", I was left wondering about its necessity."

","When a successful TV series is being transported to the big screen, there's always some expectations and worries lying ahead. Some of the big screen adaptations of a series works well (""South Park"", ""Ducktales"", I can't remember others by now), others works terrible (""Hannah Montana""). Thankfully, ""Simpsons The Movie"" is not on the latter mentioned category! <br/><br/>Since it's already two years since this movie was released, I'll guess many have already seen it, so it's going to be unnecessary to tell the fans to not worry. But for those who haven't seen it; don't worry. ""Simpsons The Movie"" is a delightful and highly entertaining movie experience, series adaptation or not.<br/><br/>The movie is fresh, amusing and never gets boring during it's 87 minutes of screen time. It's also surprisingly funny, just as the funniest episodes used to be. It never feels odd or strange to see the characters in a movie situation, since one is used to see them during 21 minutes or so in a episode setting. Almost all the dear and familiar characters from the show are in the movie and their personalities are like you're used to see them. There are some few new touches, though, like the sweet and increasing relationship between Ned Flanders and Bart, Homer bonding to the Spider-Pig and Maggie being smart, which is nice to see.<br/><br/>The animation it self lives up to the standard of the series and it's bright, colorful and refreshing, despite there are some few and obvious CGI shots who stands out. The score is great and supports the movie, without being distractive. There are also some few cameos by Green Day and Arnold Schwarzenegger, which is fun to watch. The plot it self isn't so distinctive; like usual, there are some mistakes to make and lessons to learn by the characters, but the story still works pretty well.<br/><br/>Overall, I can't recommend ""Simpsons The Movie"" highly enough. It's a successful adaptation of one of the worlds best and funniest series and has the spirit of the show as well.<br/><br/>By the way; Get sure to not stop the movie before the end credits roll out."

","Having been watching The Simpsons from its incarnation I did not know what to expect from this long overdue movie. Would it be the original, linear, character driven humour of the older episodes that could do no wrong or the fast moving, random, zany but ultimately empty episodes of the last five years. Unfortunately this film fell into the latter. I know it is all a matter of taste but for a Simpsons follower of well over a decade this movie wasn't even a patch on classic episodes through the beginning and middle seasons in particular. The main problem is the plot is ridiculous and implausible and there are just too many characters we all know and love to accommodate. To top this off the whole thing was so fast moving and random with too much stuff going on it seemed more like a sketch show than a satire. But having said this there were some funny sequences, not as much as I would have liked but some, lets face it when is The Simpsons never not funny! Its all just a shame that this wasn't made ten years ago, when The Simpsons was the best thing on television.<br/><br/>6/10"
"billion_mucks","6","2","2","17 January 2008"," Not my Doodle-Lee-Doodle Movie
","Let's be honest, cult series ""The Simpsons"" has been decreasing in quality as long as seasons grew higher. There has been a lot of more political innuendos, more toilet humor and less classy dialogs. Well, my five doesn't go to the movie itself but to the movie as a representation of the Simpsons to the Big Screen. If we go back to early Simspons, conflicts were simple dumb and hysterical, not complicated, neither multi-layered and not critical politically but sociologically. The charm that the family shared was based on wit and an amusing essence that was separated and appointed to each character: Homer is brainless exhilarating, Marge is the average caring mother, Lisa is the Voice of Reason, Bart is the Rebel we all have. Each has it's sharp connotation.<br/><br/>But it seems Groening forgot that essence, that one that attracted youngsters and delighted adults. Some characters remain with the initial spark, yet Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart seem exploited to fit into the Hollywood standards. It depraved it's natural beauty. Homer mainly. There's some unevenness in it's humor and mood that leaves me unsatisfied.<br/><br/>Don't get me wrong, the movie is funny and if you choose brainless fun, not to take it too serious, it will contempt you. Yet, the addition of Nudity, desire of killings, gay people, politics, pork crap, cheap sentimentalism... The formula seems for a funny pot-humor Hollywood presentation, but the Simpsons are celestial.<br/><br/>I had a nice laugh, but this series is sacred. You can't play with them. I enjoyed it, laughed, but I can't call it a good movie yet. Maybe it's the idea of the movie that was wrong. I find myself preferring to watch over and over again the episodes from the first seasons, where Groening wasn't yet affected by that growling Machine we call Hollywood."
"Red-125","6","2","2","1 January 2008"," Definitely not the Simpsons at their best
","The Simpsons Movie (2007), directed by David Silverman, is definitely not the Simpsons at their best. Most of the things that make the Simpsons great on TV--the throwaway gags, the multiple plots, the zingers sent at the Fox network and at the U.S. government, and the incredible cast of supporting characters--are missing from the movie.<br/><br/>It's discouraging to realize how little David Silverman accomplished in the 87 minutes (basically four TV shows) with which he was able to work. Instead of giving us four times the fun, he gave us one quarter the fun. OK--the movie was overdue, and I guess any Simpsons movie is better than none, but this was an opportunity wasted.<br/><br/>After watching the film, I tried to understand what went wrong. The biggest single problem, in my opinion, is that the plot was too linear. The director and screenwriters forgot that we don't want the Simpsons plot to go from A to B to C. We want it to start at A and go to Q and W before it gets to C, if it ever gets to C at all.<br/><br/>Moreover, the movie makers chickened out. On TV they will take on any government institution. Here, the villainous government agency is the EPA. Plenty of government agencies are doing terrible things to the U.S., but I wouldn't exactly put the EPA at the top of the villain's list. As U.S. President, they chose a character meant to be Arnold Schwartzenegger. Now, there are plenty of ways to make fun of the Governor, but no one has suggested he's stupid and, furthermore, he's the one public character that can't become President. No real fun there. <br/><br/>So, if you're a Simpsons fan, and you have to see the movie, be warned. If you're not a Simpsons fan, buy the Season I DVD. Then, once you're hooked, you can safely see the film."
"bk-87668","6","2","2","12 December 2007"," A parade of obviousness
","No, this wasn't a very funny movie. Let's see how did they manage to mess this up: The style deviates from the TV show even more than the new episodes deviate from the style and spirit of the golden era episodes. For example, the humor was much more ""mature"" (i.e. childish). The TV show I loved never resorted into cheap stuff like that. That integrity was something I always respected about The Simpsons, even though I do love mature humor as well.<br/><br/>Another example of a dumbed down joke is the President Schwartzenegger character. Why not President Wolfcastle? Not obvious enough? Similarly, many classic characters were wasted. Yet they had to introduce new characters and move the plot outside Springfield. It is also remarkable how they manage to make the absurd cartoon world unbelievable. The glass dome thing wasn't very believable even though I could believe Mr. Burns blocking the sunlight (who was also almost absent in the movie). In hindsight, I think having Burns as the evil character would have worked much better because he is an established character, not just a new face with a celebrity voice.<br/><br/>The plot is a typically convoluted Simpsons plot that tries to mimic the hilarious randomness and unexcepted twists, failing miserably much like most new episodes do by emphasizing the wrong parts. It's not funny when Homer does something really, really stupid. Constantly. It's not interesting if the Simpsons suddenly decide to go to Alaska and do something there. They already went everywhere. Similarly, it's not very interesting to watch Homer and Marge doubt their love for the zillionth time.<br/><br/>It is interesting though, that people even thought a Simpsons movie could be a success quality-wise. The show simply did everything at least once and it was funny. Then it did the same things for the second time (with celebrity guest stars) and wasn't very funny anymore. Then the movie came, wasn't very funny and pretty much did the same things yet again.<br/><br/>The song was also over-hyped, even though the musical number was visually the most interesting thing about the movie."
"ClaytonDavis","6","2","2","25 September 2007"," Simpsons doesn't deliver
","Depending what generation you're from, you can appreciate ""The Simpsons"" on different levels. I can remember watching one of first episodes with my older siblings when I was five and thinking, this is the funniest show on the planet. Watching it nearly twenty years later, it has lost its spark and everyone waited in fright to see which ""Simpsons"" we were going to be seeing. The film however lies somewhere in between classic Simpsons and broken down, fireless Simpsons. So I guess the viewer got mediocre Simpsons.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie starts off fantastic with our Itchy and Scratchy humor that we love but after the first twenty minutes are over, Homer and the gang takes a small decline into general second-rate comedy. When Homer accidentally pollutes Springfield's water supply and the government encases the whole town in a glass dome, the people turn on them and declares them enemies.<br/><br/>The story is just so ordinary and average that it leaves the classic Simpsons fans, a little dead in the dirt and even worse disappointed. As middle-of-the-road as it may be, Oscar will surely take it on the Animated Feature film list but with the highly acclaimed Ratatouille, Simpsons are left Oscar-less and stuck at the Emmys unless there's a sequel in James L. Brooks' future.<br/><br/>This critic is left a little disenchanted and sorry for The Simpsons Movie and only hopes the best for the family.<br/><br/>Grade: **½/****"

Meanwhile Bart's once again growing resentful of Homer's bad parenting skills and when he starts to show more attention to a pig he rescued from Krusty Burger he turns to next door neighbour Ned for guidance.<br/><br/>It's this pig that kicks the main part of the plot off, as Homer selfishly dumps a silo he's been using to store it's waste in SL, and causes a major environmental catastrophe. This causes the EPA to drop a massive dome around Springfield and when the townspeople find out it's Homer's fault, they all turn out to lynch him. the family manage to escape to Alaska, but Homer's selfishness drives everyone away once again and, realizing he stands to lose everything that matters to him, Homer hot foots it back to Springfield to sort out the mess he created and patch things up with his loved ones.<br/><br/>When The Simpsons first appeared as a tiny sketch show on The Tracey Ullman Show in 1987, it was hard to imagine that twenty years later it would be the most successful cartoon and lasting cartoon shows ever (more so than the Bugs Bunny cartoons from Warner Brothers in the 1950s) and finally a movie's been made about it. I really got it into my head that tonnes of praise would be heaped upon it, with five star reviews coming left and right. But most critics simply lamented how average the movie turned out to be, struggling to give it any more than about three stars. And I'm afraid, speaking as a long time fan of the show, I can kind of see their point.<br/><br/>It's been ten years in the making and it's testament to how difficult it's been to make that it wasn't out by the time the show was at the height of it's success in the 90s. But one episode takes six months to make, so a film was always going to be tricky, no matter how great the demand for it. But, unfortunately, that may be a big part of the problem. The show's still very popular, but not as much as the time when it was really cutting edge (especially for a cartoon series) and not afraid to poke fun at sensitive subjects in the news and around the world at the time. The movie plays it too safe, keeping the clever gags down to taking pot shots at well known films, including Titanic, An Inconvenient Truth, Independence Day, Night of the Living Dead and disaster films from the 70s, as well as celebrity cameos from the likes of Green Day, Arnold Schwarzenegger and Tom Hanks. The plot struggles to endure the 80 minute running time, without a solid narrative flow and a bit incoherent. The cracks start to show quite early on as you notice what works well for half an hour can't quite translate to a feature length film.<br/><br/>Having been a dedicated and loyal fan of the show for over ten years now, finally seeing The Simpsons Movie is something I can only compare to finally having sex, really. Something I really built myself up for only to be left, to be honest, a bit disappointed. ***"

","I've finally been able to agree with a friend, whom sees movies in a totally different frame of mind as myself, this was a shocker. Usually, his tastes in comedy and situations drastically differ from mine. We had both agreed that the film wasn't up to par and just a strung out version of a regular television episode.<br/><br/>Needless to say, driving away from the theater, we had a conclusive bitch-session about the movie being very slow paced and excessive plays on old clichés, general idiocy, the Muntz mock, and defunct family units. There was an abundance of dry filler that dragged down the film even more to the point of wondering if one was able to count a few sheep without falling into a deep sleep. I must admit that I chuckled the odd time, but it wasn't enough to be pleased and leave feeling satisfied with the price of admission.<br/><br/>I witnessed that a lot of people typed out that this film was a knee-slapping, barnyard circle dance of a movie, but I thought otherwise. My friend laughs at the most silliest things and is immature by nature, but he also thought the film wasn't good. I'm more of a reserved person, but I concluded that my comments be based upon his final outlook and I couldn't be any less in agreement.<br/><br/>I suppose we both have outgrown 'The Simpsons' family nest and it's about due time. I surely won't miss the gratuitous violence, bullying, typically decrepit family values, and general nonsense. Yeah, it will be the last time I watch 'South Park' as well.

And if they did all that JUST to come out with this movie that while never NEVER reaching the classic status of Simpsons yesteryear, yet still much better then the series proper is only to have it viewed as some kind of Oscar-worthy film. Well all I can say is very well played indeed sirs. For those of us that remember how good the series truly was, this bit of fluff involving Homer dooming the the town of Springfield due to his shenanigans, this film was not really made for us and will feel rather repetitive (IE: Homer and Marge fighting AGAIN, Lisa finding a crush AGAIN, even a few jokes are repeated from the series) but rather the newer fans who started watching it at the start of this millennium (yes i know, I shudder at that thought as well) The fact that this film is currently in the top 100 when it has no business in even IMDb's top 250 is both sad and supremely mind-boggling.

I feel it has borrowed heavily from the Seth Mcfarlanes Family Guy which admittedly made quite a few parts funny but I wouldn't consider the creators to have the same experience in that are of humour.<br/><br/>I enjoyed the movie at the beginning but then it became too random and it didn't seem to reach me. It was a big let down because of the hype, however i always retain that cartoon series', just like computer games, shouldn't be made into films. I guess its a money thing, who's going to turn down millions?"

","Homer takes a pig into the family but, as much as it amuses him, it messes up the house and makes Bart feel even more isolated from his father. Meanwhile Lisa finds a soul-mate in her quest to educate the community in local environmental matters. However when Homer finds that his pig excrement problem is getting out of control, he dumps the silo in the lake  triggering an environmental catastrophe. On the orders of President Schwarzenegger, EPA director Russ Cargill seals Springfield in a plastic dome. Resources naturally run low and the town yet again turns on Homer and the Simpsons.<br/><br/>Out of a summer of mostly mediocre sequels and franchise movies, The Simpsons stood out as the one that many audiences were waiting for the most. I know I went on a weekend night (and I hate crowds  particularly noisy multiplex crowds) in my desire to see it. The film itself though, doesn't really live up to the expectation and, although funny, does come across like the faltering first steps of a baby  at times moving quickly but mostly looking like it is about to fall over at any moment. Part of the reason for this is probably that the bar is set too high  something that it did for itself. Of course being a brilliant TV series is hardly a criticism but it does work against the film, particularly as it struggles to fit into the 90 minute format.<br/><br/>It isn't so much the matter of having enough plot to fill it, because the Simpsons has always jumped around quickly  using one event to lead to another and then another. However doing it across this length of time is not quite the same. Strangely though it wasn't this I had the problem with, it was the way the film format meant that it did have to have more of a ""narrative"" feel to it with more talking and plot development. The problem with this is that it is such foreign territory that it stands out  it jars with the funny moments (of which there are plenty) and I found myself wanting more of the latter and slightly put off by the former. It is not that the plot is bad, but just it breaks up the normal tight and fast pace that I am used to with the episodes and I missed this.<br/><br/>Is it funny though? Well, yes, it is but just not as funny as the many, many brilliant episodes that I enjoy. It is rarely as smart and witty as the TV series. The style of humour is typical but at times it is a bit obvious and not as out and out clever as I would have hoped for  again perhaps a problem associated with the bar being set high by expectations from the TV series. This is not to say that it isn't funny because there are still plenty of great moments and lines but they don't merge into a great flow  rather they are asides from the main plot. In a way the attempt to have more of a ""story"" with character threads mean that there is less time for the quickfire material and it shows in the way that many characters are limited in their screen time. Of particular disappointment is Mr Burns being limited to just one scene  albeit one of the best of the film, complete with the most typically Simpsons line ""ah, for once the rich, white man is in control"". The voice cast are all great, despite some of the many, many characters having little to do; while guest stars are wisely limited to Green Day and Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>Overall then, it is a very funny and enjoyable movie that is fun despite the fact that it never really finds a consistent pace or flow. Fans will enjoy it as much as they are disappointed perhaps but it is still a good film that is one of the best films from a mostly lacklustre summer offering thus far."
"paulmamak","2","6","10","31 July 2007"," A good effort, but it was wrong to have made a film once the franchise had weakened.
","This film to me did not really fulfil what The Simpsons is about, as it was made once the franchise had gone downhill. <br/><br/>The way the film started was OK, with a mildly funny Itchy and Scratchy cartoon followed by a slightly comical title sequence. However, then came along the appearance of Green Day, which is fair play, but obviously only made their appearance to promote their tacky version of The Simpsons theme tune.<br/><br/>Then there was the amusing scene with nude skateboarding Bart, which was just revisiting a used gag in a previous episode, apart from being a bit more revealing. However, the writers did manage to squeeze in the humorous gag when the Flanders family are praying. On a rarity you were able to feel a little remorse for Bart, which strengthened the scene.<br/><br/>Then came the introduction of most probably the worst character to ever be a part of The Simpsons, a pig. Although it had something to do with the plot, each scene it was in made the film cringing to watch, why the writers thought that Homer blowing raspberries on a pig would be funny is beyond belief. I also have no idea why the song Spider Pig was so funny? OK its a rip off the Spiderman theme tune, but the writers gave it lyrics that sounded as though they had been improvised by a 2 year old. <br/><br/>The overall destruction of Springfield lake was also a revisit from a previous episode. Which introduced you to President Arnold Schwarzenegger, which if the writer's were on the ball should have been President Rainier Wolfcastle. This was an attempt to make a stab at the Governor of California, but it seemed like they had based him more on President Bush. Therefore the writers shot themselves in the foot there ""CRETINS!"". Then they once again introduced an out of the blue character who just so happened that he wanted to destroy Springfield.<br/><br/>There is then every attempt to squeeze in as many of the characters as possible, giving the odd one liners, which really was a let down.<br/><br/>From then on Bart shows more of an interest in Flander's as a father, Lisa finds a boy she likes and Marge questions her relationship with Homer, sounds very familiar!<br/><br/>Therefore, its up to Homer to put things right as usual with a happy outcome with a little aid from Maggie and a poor special appearance from Tom Hanks.<br/><br/>All in all it could have just been another episode, it hurts me to say this. There was barely any sign of originality, more just retracing previous jokes and predictable gags.<br/><br/>The Simpsons has given us a great ride, but enough is enough, you have gained much achievement in your work and you will provide enjoyment to audiences for the rest of eternity. For now though drink your final rounds of Duff from Moe's and head to Springfield Canyon to watch the sun set over Springfield and leave everyone in a happy state of mind."
"ryd_online","6","36","89","18 July 2007"," Both as funny and as disappointing as you'd expect.
","Having viewed a screening this morning, I thought I'd throw down my thoughts... seeing as I seem to be the first. The Simpsons Movie is just what you'd expect. The characters are all there, the tone is the same... it really is just a big, cinema scope episode of the show. In order to make the big screen transition seem worthwhile, the stakes have been raised, the animation contains flourishes of detail you'd never normally see, and there are a handful of elements designed to shock certain demographics just enough to get people talking, but not so much as to create any genuine scandal. While funny (particularly in the first half), you can't help but feel a nagging sense of disappointment. Partly for opportunities missed, but mostly because it really is just a super-sized episode of the show from TV. I don't think anyone's going to be surprised by this though - it's not as if they were going to break the format in any major (or even minor) way. After opening with an Itchy and Scratchy cartoon, the titles follow the same format as the series, visiting mainly different locations in Springfield, but being fundamentally recognizable. From there, the first half is well paced and humorous and visits the majority of the characters one hopes to see. Various elements are very effectively set up in the first half and the wheels being very much in motion throughout, once the plot really starts to kick in (about the 40 minute mark) the film starts a gradual slide into mediocrity. The progression of the necessary story events takes a front seat and the humor drops off. Everything becomes quite predictable. It's not that any of it is bad - it's just no better than the show. If you watch it with a crowd, you'll laugh the majority of the time, just don't expect any quantum leap from what you see on TV. Sure, there are some nifty 3D tricks on display (and a few bad ones - check out the sides of screen during the ""camera move"" through the torch-bearing angry mob and you'll see the figures become pixelated with digital zoom as they pass through extreme foreground), everything is bigger and the stakes are higher, but you won't find a single surprise here. Maybe that's the point though. This franchise has become something of an elder statesman of popular culture, do we really want to see anything change? If you're reading this, you know you're going to see this film. I just advise to free yourself of any unnecessary expectation - you'll enjoy it a lot more if you do. Neither great nor bad, The Simpsons Movie coasts through with the occasional spark of brilliance. Just like the show really."
"TheLittleSongbird","9","5","8","29 October 2009"," I asked myself a question when watching this movie- would it make me love the Simpsons more, or would it ruin the show altogether?
","I have to say the answer to my own question is the former. I loved the Simpsons when I was 10-12, but just over a year ago for some reason I stopped watching it. Maybe I didn't find it as funny and creative anymore. Anyway, The Simpsons Movie is a constantly hilarious and witty movie, that completely exceeded my expectations. Yep, it is very silly, but it is lots of fun as well. So much so, I have decided to give the show another chance. The animation is true to the style of that of the show, with crisp colourful backgrounds and excellent character animation. The music by Hans Zimmer is wonderful, while the master has done better work, the music is still pretty darn good. The theme tune is still as irresistibly catchy as it was when the show first started. The story is a good one, there are tons of hilarious moments and one or two heart-warming ones too. Grandpa's revelation in the church at the beginning was hilarious, and I liked it when Lisa finds a special boyfriend in the name of Colin. I did worry that the environmentalist message would be too heavy handed, but it was handled just right. The voice cast do an exceptional job bringing the iconic characters to life, especially Dan Castallenetta as Homer. And they were aided by some delicious dialogue. I have no real complaints of this movie, though if the film was five minutes longer, we could've learned more about EPA. Overall, I thought The Simpsons Movie was absolutely terrific. 9/10 Bethany Cox"
"burninblazes","3","5","8","5 July 2008"," Essentially lame and unmemorable (Big spoilers)
","The Simpsons TV show lost its way a long time ago. There were many factors, but one big thing is that the show lost a lot of complexity and depth to the parodies, and just became too blatant, lazy and shallow. The complexity wasn't just about making it a multi-leveled joke, it was about parodying real lives, pain and woes and just circumstances that many of us could relate to. At some point that went out the window. I had little hope that this movie would be a real change of pace, and honestly it was about what I expected it to be in terms of quality. It was mildly entertaining, it couldn't compare to the classic episodes, and it didn't have much point for existing. I had a slight hope that there would be a better plot or something that gave the movie a purpose, but nope, it was pretty basically an extended episode. Towards the beginiing of the movie Homer tells us we're dopes for watching, and Homeboy is right.<br/><br/>Things that sucked about this picture: <br/><br/>1. Homer is still too stupid. Remember in the old days, there was a balance of ""normal"" and ""extra stupid"" with Homer. Now it's just ""one really, really stupid guy who sometimes acts/speaks as if he loves his family, although you never actually feel that love when watching"" <br/><br/>2. No true emotion. The old Simpsons episodes could actually be touching at the same time as they were hilarious, which was part of the genius. Now, they can write it in that this character loves that character, but where is the emotion? They don't manage to capture that feeling and convey it to the audience, perhaps because it is so shallow.<br/><br/>3. Spider-Pig. WHAT THE HELL. When I saw this in the previews and I heard that this was something that was popular in the movie, I was confused because it looked incredibly stupid and lame. But I thought, maybe, just maybe, there was something else to it that made it funny in the movie. No, no, no, there wasn't, and the pig all together was a pointless inclusion. If they had to go with the ""Homer destroys the lake"" thing, couldn't it have something to do with the power plant? Or does he not work there anymore? Why the stupid pig? <br/><br/>4. Pointless characters. The little Irish boy. Who? What? Why? Green Day... I don't even think that was Billy Joe's voice, it sounded like a woman. And the EPA dude, well, I guess he had a point, but wouldn't the movie have been cooler if it was all some grand scheme from Side Show Bob, or the space aliens, or the staff at the kids' school, or something grounded in the Simpsons' lives? If they had to bring in a new villain, couldn't they have made him a bit more entertaining? <br/><br/>5. EVERYBODY in town except Flanders and the Irish boy want to kill the Simpsons. I dunno, it just bothered me to see Otto trying to kill the kids. At least limit it to Homer, the other Simpsons didn't do anything! <br/><br/>6. Why was the sandbox a transporter? No explanation? OK....<br/><br/>7. Bart wasn't badass enough. If Homer had made the ridiculous dare to him to go skateboard nude in the old days, Bart would have found a way to trick Homer so Homer was the one doing the skateboarding naked. Then the buddying up with Flanders... I just never quite bought it. Bart knows Flanders. Flanders is not a mystery to Bart. Why does a kid like Bart suddenly feel so compelled to experience the fatherly wonder of his dorky neighbor? <br/><br/>8. The ""Marge doesn't know if she loves Homer because Homer is such a jerk - nope, she loves him"" thing has been done to death.<br/><br/>9. Groundskeeper Willy... did I miss it, or was there not one peep out of him during his appearances? <br/><br/>10. Where was the cat? <br/><br/>11. Last, but definitely not least, it JUST WASN'T VERY FUNNY. I wouldn't go so far as to say that it was wretchedly unfunny, but it was just ""ok"". This was nowhere near hilarious. It was mildly amusing. There were two times I remember laughing, 1. when Homer first touches the electrified fish (it got old after that), and 2. when Homer first goes up to the silo labeled ""pig crap"" (look, I was grasping at straws here). I did like the Tom Hanks thing. Edited to add, the ""Grand Theft Walrus"" part made me laugh. Not so much the game but the title. Wait, is that supposed to be a joke about Alaska? Oh...<br/><br/>I don't know if the Simpsons ever had much need for a movie, but if this movie had been made in the series prime, many moons back, I'm sure the creative force that was propelling the show could have given us a great movie. Or they could have done a live-action movie, which although it could have been absolutely horrible, just may have been executed in such a way as to be interesting and enjoyable. Whatever the case, this is what we got, and they can take it back.<br/><br/>If you want to know the glory of The Simpsons just forget that they still produce cartoons (and movies) under that name, and go back to the early years. I'll take the crudely drawn but very creative stuff over this shiny, uninspired crap."

We both went in rather excited and left underwhelmed.<br/><br/>The movie had a few moments that made both of us laugh, and my son laughed at a few more things than I did, but unfortunately it was not enough to carry this movie for the duration.<br/><br/>The wittiest jokes in the movie are actually part of the introduction. The MGM opening, Bart's writing on the chalkboard, and the part where all the people watching in the theater are called suckers (which looking back, resonates a bit more now).<br/><br/>Whether or not it was intended this way, I think a character with Bart's personality, being punished and made to write that line on the chalkboard, is more of a stab at the MPAA, than a witty anti-piracy message.<br/><br/>All in all, not a bad movie, not a great one either. Definitely better to wait for DVD and watch this where it belongs, on TV."
"breakingnews85","4","14","30","26 July 2007"," Disappointing at best
","As a fan of the show (the first 10 years that is), I looked forward to seeing the film hoping that it would recreate some of the comedy of the early days. Sadly I was disappointed as this film stead in line with recent episodes of The Simpsons i.e. not being funny. It lacked imagination, a good plot and above all humor. Fans of the show will also be disappointed that some of the main characters including Mr. Burns, Smithers, Krusty and Skinner, in particular have very few words in the film. Moving the action of the film away from Springfield also irritates the viewer.<br/><br/>The attempt to include emotive issues such as the relationship between Bart and Homer and the marriage of Homer and Marge has been done over and over before and on the majority of the times, far better. In the old and classic episodes, we felt something for the characters in emotional episodes, in this we feel nothing for them. Also, Ned Flanders probably has the most lines outside of the Simpson family, but not one funny sentence comes out of his mouth. The Itchy and Scratchy scene at the beginning sets the tone of a lack of humor.<br/><br/>One interesting aspect of the film that will appeal to fans, is that in any scene with residents of Springfield, you can see various characters who appeared in the show once.<br/><br/>No matter what, die hard fans of the show will go to see the film, but for the ordinary person, who's not a keen fan, don't bother, this film isn't funny. It sadly failed to live up to the classic episodes of old."

You want to see more then just the same thing...<br/><br/>(BTW, I have a copy on VHS of the very first Simpson's Episode, The Christmas Episode one that most of the people who watch the Simpsons today have never, and probably will ever see...Basically saying, I am not just some guy who just discovered the Simpsons, I grew up with it) Essentially this movie was exactly what it said it was in the very beginning and we are total fools for paying for something that we can see on television for free...<br/><br/>There was nothing special about this. There was nothing that you couldn't see on television.<br/><br/>I think the main flaw with this movie was that instead of making a full length movie (which time wise it was), was that they took a half hour episode, and stretched it out filling in the gaps with something that was supposed to humor...<br/><br/>The thing that makes show is that it gets to the point. It is a satire first and foremost, with a little bit of slapstick throw in between.<br/><br/>If it is too long, it just gets boring. I mean I totally get the political references, and I get the sight gags. But so what? All they did was act as fillers to make a very short story way to long.<br/><br/>Take the Southpark Movie: Bigger Longer Uncut (now I am not comparing them in humor or style, but merely as a parallel to TV to movie porting...) The creators of Southpark are under certain restrictions, as are the Simpsons creator. What they can show, what they can say etc. Southpark is very much a show designed for older audiences. Much like the Simpsons were in their original incarnation. Dark Humor. The thing is, is that when the Southpark movie was made, the essentially took every little thing that they couldn't do on television, and exploited it on the Big Screen.<br/><br/>""F"" this, ""F"" that, no censorship etc. They really tried to make it over the top. I mean aside whether or not you liked the movie is irrelevant, the point is, is that you got to see lots of stuff that you wouldn't normally see...<br/><br/>Another parallel could be the upcoming ""24"" movie. Again, the fans of the show want to see 24, but they don't want to see the 24 they see on television. They want to see the 24 to the extreme.<br/><br/>In the end, there are 20 years of Simpsons episodes. That roughly 600 hours (give or take). You could buy the first few years DVD's and get more out of it then this movie gave us.<br/><br/>Thankfully, I didn't pay to see this..."

","In the film based on the hit television series created by Matt Groening, Homer must save the world from a catastrophic event that he himself has created. It all begins with Homer, his new pet pig and a leaky sill full of droppings - a combination that triggers a disaster the likes of which Springfield has never experienced. As Marge is outraged by Homer's monumental blunder, a vengeful mob descends on the Simpsons household. The family makes a narrow escape, but is divided by both conflict and location.<br/><br/>As the fates of Springfield and the world hang in the balance, Homer embarks on a personal odyssey of redemption - seeking forgiveness from Marge, the reunion of his splintered family and the salvation of his hometown.<br/><br/>After 25 seasons, 500 and something episodes and a lot of awards and honors (including the Peabody Award, 23 Emmy's (r) and a designation from Time magazine as the best-television show of the twentieth century), The Simpsons was finally made as a feature-length motion picture.<br/><br/>And it's a good thing because it takes a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format to fully and completely capture the stupidity of Homer Simpson. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE was a long time coming for me because I was expecting to see my favorite TV show on the big screen, so when I first saw this, I thought it would be a disaster, but after watching this on DVD, I actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The animation is really good and the dialog is just incredible, especially the one-liners and the other jokes that the eleven screen writers who worked on this script for the film, really brought flavor, width and good storytelling to the screen. David Silverman directed this film and his style is really amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is just both hilarious and emotionally powerful. This goes to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner as Homer and Marge Simpson, because Homer's famous quotes, ""D'oh!"" and ""Why, you little...!"" is in this film and Marge's dialog written for the film is really amazing.<br/><br/>Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith as Bart and Lisa Simpson are just as funny as they are in the cartoon, but Maggie Simpson only says one line of dialog and that is at the end of the film, when they are watching the ending credits and she takes out her pacifier and says, ""Sequel?"".<br/><br/>Hank Azaria, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille and Harry Shearer plays various characters including Ned Flanders, Milhouse van Houten, Mr. Montogomery Burns, Smithers, Jimbo Jones and other various characters in the film are really entertaining. The only thing that was kind of missing was Mrs. Krapabel, played by the late Marcia Wallace. She has a cameo though at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Did I forget to mention the rock band Green Day also has a cameo appearance? They are at the beginning, finishing up the classic theme song composed by Danny Elfman, while the musical score is not composed by Alf Clausen, composer of the TV series, it is composed by Hans Zimmer. The other performance that I did not mention was Albert Brooks as Russ Cargill. He was also very entertaining and quite perfect for the villain.<br/><br/>If there is one thing I can criticize this movie about is Maggie Simpson, because the creators just don't know that this character needs to be able to grow. Stewie Griffin from Family Guy also needs to grow, but having him talk and not allowing to walk and talk is just not enough. I would love to see Maggie talk more.<br/><br/>Overall, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is one of those TV show to film adaptations that I think needs to be seen by everyone. It is a perfect, well-made movie with memorable quotes, great performances and very good action pieces. I love this movie and I love the series, but I would love to see another SIMPSONS MOVIE on the big screen sometime soon. This is one cartoon movie, along with Shrek, Toy Story, SpongeBob SquarePants, Frozen and any other animated movie that I don't gets enough credit.

Also, it has Ralph seeing Bart naked on the street and going ""I like boys now"". I think that moment alone should deserve six stars, but I digress. Then a plot kicks in about Homer polluting a lake and being hated by everyone and the movie really starts dragging itself to the end more and more. From then on there isn't really much creativity left, it's just the Simpsons running from one place to another and some attempts to political satire that come of as rejected material from ""South Park"". I get it, Arnold Schwarzenegger doesn't seem very bright, now move on. This movie is only 83 minutes long, but it really feels like they had to do anything they could to even reach that length. Overall, this movie isn't a total disaster like some have claimed, but I did expect a bit more from these writers."

","It's about time! The longest running animated show finally became a film. And if you were like me and anticipated it extremely, you'll feel let down. But just a little, for in my opinion it is more than just a long Simpsons episode. It has many memorable, funny aspects that only a movie could have. The main reason why I saw this is because I was curious at how they would turn this series into a movie, and I do not think that it could have been done better. Being as big of a Simpsons fan as I am, this is the movie that was worth waiting for. Without even having too much swearing, this is a film you will respect for being as good as it was without having too much innuendo. Joke-after-joke, they managed to make it a great movie along with being a feast of laughter."
"ILostMyNameCanIHaveYours","Null","3","4","11 October 2008"," Brings Back What Use To Make The Show Great!
","Awwww, the Simpsons. I can't remember a time when this show was not on. More importantly though I remember when the show was funny. During those days I was a die hard Simpson fan. To tree house horror episodes were we meet Kang and Kodus, to who shot Mr. Burns, or To when Crusty the clown was framed for armed robbery. Yes our yellow skinned friends have bin threw so much and I use to love every minute of it. Tragedy came when the writers began to run out of ideas and new ones took over that could not come up with well thought out humor. The show for me went down hill big time when Family Guy (still funny but A Simpson rip off) appeared. With its bizarre random styli of humor giving its key to success I notice the Simpson started trying to mimic it a little. Truth be told it was always better off having its well thought out plots, smart jokes and not to mention a real ending instead of just simply stopping. Fear not dear readers! This movie does indeed have an ending, a good one to, but you will be sad when it does come because you won't want this movie to end! This Film has every thing that made the Simpsons show a success. It has to be of one of the funniest movies I have seen in recent years.<br/><br/>The story takes us back to the town of Springfield with the Simpson themed being played by Green Day. Any way Grandpa Simpson receives a vision from God for telling Springfield's horrible end. With the exception of Marge no one in the family seems to really care and thinks he's crazy. Including Grandpa himself! In the mean time Lisa has a new boy friend from Ireland who also really into preserving the environment. Together they attempt to get the town to clean up the local Lake. Bart is starting resent Homer for being really a lousy father. To his shock he starts to realize that he really likes there next door neighbor, Ned Flanders and wish Flanders was his father. Lisa unites the whole town to clean the lake perfectly and no ones allowed to dump anything in it. Homer however would break that rule. I will not say what he dumps into the lake but trust me it's gross. Anyway, the lake becomes so polluted because of Homer that it gets the attention of the United Sates Government. The Environmental Protection Agency seals the whole town in a glass dome because the place so badly polluted and no ones allowed to leave, ever. Thus Grandpa Simpson prophecy comes true! So now it's up to Homer to save the town he just doomed....Again.<br/><br/>The Simpson movie will have you cracking up with laugher before the opening title appears. There are hysterical one liners threw out the film and catches the humor of the show before it went down hill. Pulse it nice to have a hand drawn film for a change. I was starting to forget what that looked like since every thing has to be CGI these days. They matured the humor a little for the big screen I notice. We have one scene were Homer gives people the finger and one moment involving Bart you may all know by now but I won't give it away just in case you have not seen the film. All your favorite characters are here. Chief Wiggim, Crusty the Clown, Moe, Upoo, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Ned Flanders, Barny, Fat Toney, Mole Man, Bumble Bee man, Comic Book Guy, Skinner, and of course Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Marge and Homer J. Simpson. We also get the voices of Green Day and Tom Hanks. Both making a brief but humors appearances.<br/><br/>If your a died hard Simpsons fan then you have to see this movie. If you're like me and think the show has lost what made it so special you still have see this movie. It's a real treat. If you never heard of the Simpsons. First of all were have you bin? Seconded, still go see this movie because it's funny! That why I give The Simpson Movie a 10 out 10. WoooooooWhooooo!"

","To me people are trying real hard to like this movie and their beloved character Homer, and so they rated this movie with a handsome review. But for me it was merely a decent movie experience – after 150 plus draft they have chosen this one to work on, seriously? That was really weak.<br/><br/>Is this movie written by The Simpsons’ writers or Al Gore? This is not really the story you would expected from the good episode of The Simpsons. There wasn’t much plot at all. It felt weird and though I love the randomness but the pace is fast but it feel really brief and it keep on skipping. Sure it was entertaining but it was not funny ha-ha.<br/><br/>The good thing is visually it look very stunning, I love it. It looks absolutely joyful and colorful, and the direction is great. But I didn’t quite find the story very compelling. Homer is too hypocrite in here.<br/><br/>Tell the truth I had a pretty hard time writing this - it is The Simpsons; what is at you there in series that you haven’t seen it yet? This is like a longer episode of it. They even managed to put all the character even for a few seconds.<br/><br/>Ask if it still entertaining, yes it is!! Not a fully let down. Maybe my expectations are too high on it.<br/><br/>Recommendation: Managed enough for me to still buy its DVD.<br/><br/>Reason to Watch: What More? It is The Simpsons.<br/><br/>Reason Not To: Not a very good Rating: 6/10 (Grade: C+)"

","I've been a fan for many years of those wonderful wonderful yellow people. I grew up with them and will always stay with them (TV On DVD) but this movie disillusioned me and i just wanted to slap not only David Silverman but Matt Groening and the entire team that made this atrocity to the Simpson name. I wanted a masterpiece and i got a average romp. Watchable but compared to expectations world wide, I don't want to swear in my comment because I might get in trouble but anyway. We follow Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and the rest of the Simpsonverse as Homer screws up (again). Endangering lives he dumps Spiderpigs (An actual funny character)'s crap in the already polluted lake. The town obviously very peeved with Homer try to kill him but they escape when the government seals off Springfield in a dome.

Why president Schwarzenegger? Did they ask him to do a cameo and he turned it down? It wasn't even a real caricature of him--they just dressed up Rainier Wolfcastle and used the same voice!<br/><br/>It should have been Bush! Having Bush and Homer meet would have been great (I know they showed a picture of him meeting Bush in one episode).<br/><br/>I can only assume they didn't want to offend any of the sad leftovers who love him.

","Having just read another comment posted about this movie I came away in a state of complete shock. This was not a fitting send off to a show that has led the way in comedy and animation for so many years.<br/><br/>I haven't enjoyed the Simpsons for about five years and I had hoped that the movie would at least see a return to form, with some good laughs, some memorable moments and a well constructed plot. However, during the movie I laughed about 3 times in total and these were at the bits that had been featured in the Trailer.<br/><br/>If you are looking for a guaranteed laugh at a cartoon i suggest Family Guy, it owes a lot to the early Simpsons cartoons but has been much better recently and is far better than this movie.<br/><br/>Watch this purely because it's the Simpsons, but don't expect anything great."
"Joshbond","6","3","4","11 September 2007"," Love it or hate it
","In my personal opinion it was a love or hate movie. And at first i really didn't like it. I thought the storyline was a little stupid and they made everybody in Springfeild act retarded just for the sake of it being funny. And it was waaay too short. I mean i am serious when i say this. It felt like a double episode. So don't get comfy in your seat. By the time your halfway through your popcorn it will be over. The storyline was pretty good, not amazing, but you have to cut them some slack. They did EVERYTHING in the god knows how many episodes they have. I love the Simpsons but i'm not going to buy this movie or rent it when it comes out on DVD. I'll watch it again but not in the near future. It was just OK. And i couldn't get over the fact that it was just OK. About 40 minutes into the film it stopped getting funny and the audience wasn't laughing at all. Maybe it was because people we're only laughing through the beginning because it was ""THE SIMPSONS MOVIE"" and had to funny just for that reason, or maybe the writers we're in crappy mood halfway through writing it. I would have really liked it they threw in some famous episode references. It seemed like they forgot their roots, why people ACTUALLy watched this film. The only character that fell into place was Homer. Which i mean.. Okay how do you screw up an idiot? You don't. I wish they took a little more time to make this, make it longer, and add some of the real creative and smart humor that The Simpsons really is made of."
"biedjee","5","3","4","1 September 2007"," Bad, bad, bad idea
","(warning, may contain minor spoilers) <br/><br/>I am quite a Simpsons fan. I've always loved the series on telly, and over the past years I have faithfully bought all 'complete series' DVD box sets. I know the series take a dive after series nine, and I'm still doubting whether to buy series 10 when it comes out next month. Better quit while you're ahead, is my motto. <br/><br/>If only the creators of The Simpsons had had that same motto. 20 years in the making, they finally got round to putting the yellow family to the big screen. And while all the buzz was very positive (old producers coming back, the complete writers team of series 2-7 collaborating on the script, etc etc) the movie ultimately fails to deliver. There are some really funny jokes, but the story itself is just downright stupid. Furthermore most of the side-characters are reduced to screenfiller for most of the movie. With the exception of Flanders, Grampa Simpson and (oddly enough) Comic Book Guy and Cletus, none of the supporting characters have anything to do in the movie. Ms Krabapple, Barney, Selma & Patty, Apu and even Moe barely have talking parts? What a waste! <br/><br/>Instead we get a strange Native American lady, an unfunny secret agent and ""President Schwarzenegger"" (whatever happened to The Simpsons' own Schwarzenegger spoof Rainer Wolfcastle?).<br/><br/>Bad, bad, bad idea."
"sullibrandon","6","3","4","22 August 2007"," Hilarious but Lacking True Plot
","The Simpsons has become part of our culture like none other. They have been around for nearly 20 years, and are still going strong, with end of the series not even a speck on the horizon. It was inevitable that they come out with a movie sooner or later, and for the most part, The Simpsons Movie is worth the wait. It is rife with the self-aware irony, witty satire, scathing parody, and hilarious comedy that the TV show has become known for. In fact, it is so much like the TV show that, if you weren't sitting in a darkened room surrounded by hundreds of people, you could be fooled into thinking it was a three-parter episode. In a film where hilarity is a given, something more must be asked of it, and, unfortunately, the Simpsons fails to stretch itself in any way, being content, for the most part, to stick with its tried an true formula.<br/><br/>Rather than attempt to explain the paper thin plot, I'll just summarize the basic idea for you. Springfield's lake is dangerously over-polluted, so the city puts a ban on dumping any further garbage into the lake. Homer, of course, screws everything up because of his mis-directed love for a young pig, and thus the US government forces all of Springfield to live under a giant indestructible dome, causing the town to riot against the cause of everything (Homer, once again), forcing the Simpson family to escape the indestructible dome and flee to Alaska to start anew. Meanwhile, Bart must deal with a realization that Homer is unsatisfactory as a Dad, Lisa finds the perfect guy for her, and the ever-enduring Marge has to question whether she really wants to endure any longer.<br/><br/>With 400 episodes under their belt and counting, one thing the Simpsons have to be respected for is their longevity. No other TV series (aside from the Tonight Show, which doesn't even really count) has managed to stay alive this long, while still maintaining a healthily hilarious pulse. Though it doesn't carry as much clout as it once did, each new TV episode that comes out manages to be satirical, witty, and downright hilarious. The Simpsons movie is all of these things, lampooning religion, environmentalism, the government, and a sizable helping of other subjects too (most notable a spot-on cameo of a very notable star.) The movie is just plain hilarious - no question. There weren't two minutes during this film where I wasn't practically busting a gut laughing. But one also has to take into account that with 400 episodes down the drain, there aren't many plot-lines left to do. I'm not a huge fan of the TV show - I respect it and appreciate its witty comedy and satire, but I'm not a regular watcher, so I can't speak to whether or not this plot has been done before, but one very clear thing that I did notice was that if everything superfluous were stripped away, the movie would be about the length of a 44-minute Simpsons special.<br/><br/>Take Homer's love for the pig - the thing which causes him to bring ruin to the entire town. Though it does give us the line that is already becoming a classic - ""Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig, does whatever a Spider-Pig does...Can he swing - from a web? No he can't, he's a pig..."" this whole thing is basically a plot device - once the pig has served his purpose we really don't see him anymore. Lisa's new crush is basically just adding on a little romantic subplot that doesn't affect the outcome of the film at all, and Bart's questioning his father's love is merely for the sake of adding screen time. If enough work had been put into the plot, all these things could have worked together towards a resolution - but as it is the only strong thread that runs the length of the movie is Homer. Marge questioning her devotion to Homer comes in a close second, and it's good to see some real conflict in these characters we love, but it's not enough to save the paper thin plot. Another disappointment is that none of the extra characters have any strong involvement - we see cameos from Moe and the gang, but that's all they are. Ironically the strongest character in the movie (aside from Homer) is a government official whom I don't believe has been in the TV series at all.<br/><br/>All this criticism being leveled against it, though, I would still give it a positive recommendation. It's a disappointment if you're looking for something beyond the series fare, but if you're just looking for a solid comedy, look no further. One of the reasons it's disappointing is because of the sheer comedic brilliance that we've seen these writers capable of. If they can write comedy like that, don't you think they could have at least come up with a plot that doesn't artificially extend itself with four or five superfluous story lines? Apparently not. Eh. Maybe they'll do better with the next movie. Because whether the series continues or not, you can bet this is not the last of our favorite yellow family's visit to the silver screen."

","The Simpsons just aren't what they used to be. The Simpsons Movie is a strong effort for the franchise as of late, in that it was often funny, but it's still missing the depth of the classic seasons. That, and Mr. Burns, who should have been the main villain but was reduced to a cameo- one of the greatest villains of animation brushed to the side when he had his greatest chance to shine.<br/><br/>Some jokes- Homer stuck between a rock and a hard place for example, seem Simpsonish. But the movie as a whole didn't have much of a point, unless you've been faced with the dilemma of living inside a giant dome and you've got to destroy it, and what about the environmental problem posed earlier in the movie? No solid conclusions, solutions or coherent plot needed, just laugh, please.<br/><br/>And, for the record, Spider-Pig was not that bad."

","To begin this review, how do I do it: Once upon a time they made this cool show called the Simpson every Tuesday @ 7.00 pm My brother, sister and I would watch this hilarious show without fail. One day it got cheesy and more cheesy then South Park came to play and the Simpsons began to copy this show and that was when my disappointment grew even more. However: when the movie came I thought maybe just maybe this would be the show I once saw as a kid maybe it would redeem itself... I was wrong... As my brother and I sat in that theater we were disgusted, angry and bored. The jokes were somewhat funny but then the whole thing began to drag, and as we sat in our seats we were broken and upset and left the movie.<br/><br/>On the whole this movie was satanic and horrible. I can never watch it again both movie and series. Another good thing from the past destroyed!

I love the Simpsons and i have since i first saw it, but i'm not such a big fan to the later seasons, This movie had some descent fun jokes, most of them were slapstick but what more can you expect from an animated movie.

"alrodbel","1","4","6","2 March 2010"," For this Simpon's Lover, only Sadness
","It's difficult to explain to someone who ""doesn't get it"" just why I can watch the Simpsons year after year after year. I'm old, somewhere between the age of Homer and Abe, which is quite a stretch of time, but I watch the same shows over and over.<br/><br/>There had been something that was so true, so human, that was expressed in only the way that this show was able to do. Sadly, this film could have been written by someone who got their character descriptions from a one paragraph synopsis.<br/><br/>So Bart was this bratty thrill seeking kid who sort of hated his dad, and a part of him preferred the Flander's family. Give me a break! The Homer strangling Bart, the regular routine of Bart's face distorted in agony, never ever really happened. It was another level, part of the insider's gag in the TV shows, but the one page synopsis didn't convey this. Those of us who saw the episodes when Homer was a child, or a teenager, know that he wanted to be more but it didn't work out that way. He would never ever harm one of his children.<br/><br/>I love the guy, and all of the people in the Simpson's home, and all of those in Springfield, because I know they are so much more than that one page synopsis described. Homer is a screw up....because that's just the way he is. And yet he is loved by his family, and finds a home there as well as in his job. And what a job that the series has created, where he had the status of controlling a nuclear reactor that was immune to endless spilling of coffee on it.<br/><br/>And Lisa is not just a dreamy eyed kid who would dump Milhouse for the Irish boy. The real Lisa would have agonized over this, would have felt Milhouse's pain. That's what the TV series was.....complex. Milhouse was a person, a weak person who had a best friend, and even an aspirational love...Lisa.<br/><br/>As much as I was a Simpson fan, or maybe because I was, I avoided watching this film; but then it appeared on FOX, available on my new HDTV. I feared it would be something like this, destructive of the fragile, rich, interwoven world that had been created over twenty years of brilliant programs.<br/><br/>I know it's been a tremendous financial and critical success. But, for me it's a betrayal. It's evidence that the Simpsons has become just another vehicle for maximizing profit for inside stakeholder. That's why they sold out to Coke in that Super Bowl ad last month. They got their ten-twenty million to lend their public affection to a brand of cola; but in doing so their own brand was tainted, as just another property to be sliced and diced as the market dictates.<br/><br/>And so this movie is to me part of the final dissolution of a great artistic cultural phenomenon. Like a giant star of the outer reaches of the cosmos, that expands into a super nova before shrinking into nothingness, this spectacle of movie was an explosion of vacuousness, soon to be replaced with only the memory of the vast light it shined in the universe.<br/><br/>Nothing lasts forever."

Homer does something incredibly stupid, alienating not just his neighbors, but his family as well. He then has to do something to redeem himself, usually enduring horrible pain and/or humiliation in the process.<br/><br/>This is a fan movie, where they manage to have a vignette for every one of the series dozens of characters. You won't get the Comic Book Guy jokes unless you've seen the series and know who Comic Book Guy was. ""Lamest. Analogy. Ever.""<br/><br/>Of course, the creators of this show are liberals, and they let their liberal stripes show, criticizing the Patriot Act and environmental deregulation.

","I went into the cinema with low expectations and came out feeling the same.<br/><br/>As most would know, The Simpsons have been declining in quality for close to ten years now. The Simpsons have relied more and more on slapstick and physical humor over recent years, instead of the witty and clever humor that made The Simpsons what it is today.<br/><br/>The lack of sub-plots and incredibly low use of established and popular characters describes this movie. The movie simply follows The Simpson family throughout their journey for the most part, with nothing much else really happening. The movie also fails to bring in established characters for more vital and lengthy roles, thus giving it a plain and predictable feel.<br/><br/>To say this movie is hilarious, is an exaggeration of mammoth proportions. The returning of some of the old writers is noticeable at times, but their efforts prove to be in vain as the overall style of the movie is in the modern Simpsons fashion.<br/><br/>Although there are good jokes peppered throughout the movie, they are sadly outnumbered by the more crude and dare i say ""dumb"" jokes.<br/><br/>Many Simpsons fans may feel the need to rate this movie extremely high, but this movie is nowhere near being a classic and has come around ten years too late.<br/><br/>As a huge Simpsons fan myself, i am devastated that The Simpsons has become a slapstick and ordinary show. This movie is simply an above average version of that. A 7/10, but only because it is The Simpsons. A good movie, nothing more.<br/><br/>Three Golden Era episodes all back to back, will make for a much more entertaining time."

","I was a huge Simpson's fan for years until they just clean ran out of story lines. So, they began to recycle other peoples story lines, Go completely absurd and just became not funny any more. This show is clutching at what the Simpson's once was while toying with a story line that was very boring and totally UN-inventive. To be honest, Its a product that is at the very end of a wonderful life as feint glow of what it was. A few laughs throughout but only a feint sparkle of what the show once was. I do not recommend this in the Cinema as it is of a TV standard only. You'll just be disappointed if you do. On a better note there are some closures to some story lines from the TV show and a few political stabs at the real world. Overall it gets a big thumbs down, Simpson's fans will watch it anyway and the show is geared to set the producers up with a final cash cow before the bitter end.

But they did.<br/><br/>I saw this with several on its first showing at my cinema with a dozen of my friends who are all aged between 14 and 15 and a theatre full of 7 year old on a day trip but its safe to say we laughed a hell of a lot more than they did. The film got a PG rating by the skin of its teeth in my opinion due to the sex references and violence (especially the Itchy and Scratchy Movie at the start.)<br/><br/>I don't care is it isn't suitable for a family trip out. This film is perfect for an older audience and thats what the Simpson's should be for 10 year old's and over.<br/><br/>I was slightly disappointed that some of the greatest one episode characters didn't show up e.g Kang and Kodos, Hank Scorpio and The father and son carnies (who's names escape me.) i also thought that Spider-Pig should have had a MUCH bigger part.<br/><br/>So to sum up: See this film if: -You like the Simpson's -You are over 10 -You don't want to be known as 'The Guy That Missed The Simsons Movie'<br/><br/>Bring on the Sequel!"

","I had to vote this a bit unfairly low because as an absolute Simpsons fan dating back to watching the Tracy Ulman show in college, I can't understand where the high average is coming from...<br/><br/>I'll just summarize what I think went wrong with the movie compared to the ""classic"" episodes:<br/><br/>--Lisa's childhood crushes and youth activism episodes have never been funny. I almost suspect it was a ploy to capitalize on the popularity of cartoon characters with Irish accents. --Ned Flanders is best used as the butt of a joke, letting us laugh as his over-the-top cautiousness or religious behavior. He was just sappy in this. --Bart should definitely be the prankster, not having heart-melting moments and needing a hug. --Homer just has to be slapstick-stupid, and spend less time thinking! --It added no great one-liners to pull out in the future on when life imitates the Simpsons (as it almost always does)."
"dark_lunar_wolf","6","18","43","24 July 2007"," The Simpsons finally arrive!
","The Simpsons have been around ever since I could remember. We all grew up with Homer, Bart, Lisa Marge and Maggie. It was only a matter of time before these iconic characters would jump to the big screen. A lot of Simpson fans have waited for this moment. I was a huge Simpsons fan when I was younger but as I grew up the seasons decreased in entertainment in my opinion. Because the show for me didn't have that same appeal as it used to, I didn't think much when I heard the movie was coming. I finally started to hear good news like the old writers were coming back. The trailers that were released made me chuckle and I began to get excited. So what did I think of The Simpsons Movie? It was a solid good movie.<br/><br/>The movie itself was kinda refreshing animation wise as all we get now are 3D animations. The Simpsons stuck with 2D and thats where this movie shines. It was so good to see a 2D animation back on the screen. The movie didn't feel long and boring. It was an hour and twenty seven minutes long I believe. Not once during the movie did I check the time or got bored. The Simpsons did what it used to do for me and thats ENTERTAIN!!!! Homer is the highlight of this movie and that's never a bad thing. Homer always makes you laugh especially with his new pig which was my favorite part of the movie. A lot of secondary characters don't get even a line in but that's OK we know who all these characters are, we don't need them on screen for the movie.<br/><br/>One thing this movie does is, it highlight's a few emotional scenes which worked in some parts but didn't in some. When an emotional scene came up you felt for the characters because you know them, but the end result of the emotional impact falls dead in it's tracks.<br/><br/>One thing did strike me watching the movie, this whole movie does not add anything new to The Simpson franchise. It doesn't necessarily do anything new for The Simpsons but one thing that stuck in my head on the way out, they should stop making Simpson season's on TV and release a movie once every two years. The movie was far more entertaining then any of the new episodes could ever be.<br/><br/>Overall The Simpsons movie was funny, entertaining and I left with a smile on my face. It's downfall was the stupid end results of the emotional scenes which I kinda felt like they've done already on the show. The Simpsons is worth checking out, it's a solid good movie. I'd give this one a GO!"
"mOVIemAN56","6","6","11","29 July 2007"," Nothing to write home about, funny at times, a bit dry at others
","Many people have been waiting for the Simpsons Movie to come out for nearly 10 years. Ever since the website was launched back in 1997 people have been anticipating the film to be released. Finally it was green lit and the Simpsons Movie was released on the 27th of July, 2007. I managed to see it opening night with a packed house, some even dressed as the Simpsons characters we have come to love. I must admit I never thought I'd watch the Simpsons with 300 people around me, let alone in a movie theater.<br/><br/>The plot is pretty Simpson-like. Springfield has become a polluted city and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) decides to drop a massive dome on the city to prevent the pollution and the citizens from escaping the area, all with approval from President Schwarzenegger. Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks doing great voice acting again) is out to keep every Springfield citizen inside the dome no matter what. The Simpsons escape and become fugitives but begin to work on freeing Springfield from the evil Cargill and EPA.<br/><br/>The voice acting is at its best. Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria and Yeardley Smith are all exceptional as the characters they have portrayed so long from the show. I did have a few problems with the characters in the film however. The film gives Bart more feelings then are usually customary for his brat-like attitude. He becomes to caring in the film and is less funny then usual. Now Homer is ten times funnier then I have seen him in the past 5 seasons of the Simpsons. Marge and Lisa are still their normal selves. A few characters are all but cut from the film including: Principal Skinner, Mrs. Krabappel, and Mole Man. <br/><br/>The flow of the film is a bit bad. They'll be a stretch of 10 minutes without a laugh then a bunch of laughs in another stretch. I felt they could have spread out the jokes a little more, especially toward the end of the film when there seemed to be far fewer jokes then in the first half hour. Most of the jokes are Simpson-like: easy to understand, low blows, and a bit of slapstick. A few jokes will have you on the floor crying they are that funny while others you may be like ""wtf?"" Though that only happened twice for me. However the jokes are way better then what have been on TV for the past few seasons. <br/><br/>A few downsides was that I believe the people making this felt that had to include as many characters as they possibly could. For no apparent reason some characters just show up, say something, then aren't seen the rest of the film. I didn't think that was really necessary. Mr. Burns and Smithers should have been used way more then just the two scenes they were in. Also I felt the need for celebrities to make guest appearances, while a part of the shows storied history, was also unneeded. I saw nothing funny about Tom Hanks appearing for a scene as well as Green Day being in the opening scene of the film which gets things flowing. I felt The Simpsons Movie was wasting precious minutes they could have put to more funny things (though when the barge Green Day is on begins to sink and the band members begin to play violins reminiscent of the scene from Titanic, I did laugh).<br/><br/>Overall, I would not call The Simpsons Movie by any means a waste of time. Fans of the show will love it as I did. There were some stretched out, overall boring scenes that could have been shortened but the comedy made up for most of it. I can honestly say it is the funniest I've seen Homer since 1998. It's well worth a visit to the local movie theater. There ain't too much language, there's a lot of laughs and I think it will give anyone who is a fan of the show a good time though some may be disappointed for the reasons I stated above.<br/><br/>3/5 stars"

I expected it to be a really funny and good animated film, but it's actually worse than the tree house of horror episodes. The animation was better than the average Simpsons episode, but I wonder where the heart is? Where is everything I associate with the series? Some characters just disappear or go in and out without any reason, in the plot, and unfortunately some of the prominent characters are just bi-figures in this motion picture. I rather look forward to next season of the series. This film was only a couple of gag up on each other, if you aren't a fan of the series, don't bother to spend money on it. I'm sorry but I can only give it a 2 out of 10. It didn't correspond to my expectations."

","Being a big fan of the show, I was highly anticipating this movie. And considering the fact that the humour in the last couple of seasons has dried up, I was hopeful that this movie would not disappoint, since it's been years in the making!<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie was pretty good in my opinion, and even if you may have seen all 400 episodes of the Simpsons shows, this movie will still keep you entertained. The first half of the movie carries most of the funny scenes, whereas the second half is concentrated on Homer and his impossible mission. There were also a couple of lewd scenes which makes people wonder about its PG rating. It didn't bother me though...<br/><br/>I give this movie a rating of 8 because I find the story line good and original, with few repeated jokes from the series. Having created the longest running TV sitcom, Matt Groening and Co. have done a good job in creating this long awaited movie. You must also respect the fact that they have not produced a lame movie with lots of reused jokes, despite creating 18 seasons prior to this. A definite must see for any Simpsons fan. Let's hope Matt Groening's Futurama movie will be as good, or even better!!"
"dplynch-1","2","11","24","27 July 2007"," Every bit as bad as the show has been the last few years!
","This movie stunk. It was formulaic and unfunny. I laughed maybe twice in the entire movie. The length given of 87 minutes is also inaccurate - my showing started at 1pm, I got my sandwich and went inside by 1:10, watched at least 5 minutes worth of previews and was out by 2:28. Actual running time: 75 minutes at most.<br/><br/>The writing was flat and unimaginative, and even though I went in with low expectations, I was still very disappointed. As much as it pains me to admit it, The Simpsons jumped the shark many years ago and this awful movie only confirms the death of a once brilliant franchise.

"thedevilsadvocate2003","4","11","24","26 July 2007"," So so disappointing
","At the end of the 20th century, the Simpsons creators must have been in heaven. They had made a TV show that was pure comedy genius. At this point they must have given up trying to make decent shows again. The past 7 years of shows have been poor at best. Some episodes make you chuckle but it's just not the same. Although with the appearance of the Simpsons film I was hoping for a nice surprise, a breath of fresh air if you will.....how wrong I was. The storyline was predictable after about 5 minutes. I won't discuss the essentials of the storyline but I will comment about the jokes in the film. They can be described in 2 words: Childish & Poor. I don't think the Simpsons writers are aware that times change. Unfortunately they have not moved with the times and in this film resorted to ""penis"" jokes and witty one liners. Witty, probably not the word to best describe it. Before anyone comments that I must not be a true Simspons fan because I rate this poorly couldn't be so wrong. In fact, i'm such a big fan that I can accept it's a poor film. Better than recent seasons yes, but if you're hoping for anything close to Seasons 1-9 then you are very much mistaken. The Simpsons WAS a brilliant show, it now just feels old and stale. Maybe it's soon time to stop it altogether before it loses it's credibility. Shame that won't happen as it's still far too profitable."
"WriterDave","7","9","19","31 July 2007"," Super Size This!
","It's hard to believe it's been almost twenty years since ""The Simpsons"" first entered our homes. Over the years we've seen the emergence of cartoons more scathingly satirical (""South Park"") and more randomly ridiculous (""Family Guy""), but ""The Simpsons"" has always kept chugging along. While it's been well past its prime for almost a decade now (oh, how we miss the Conan O'Brien years), Matt Groening and his team have decided to fire on all cylinders for the first foray onto the big screen. Staying true to its form and not trying anything too daring, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is essentially a super-sized 90 minute episode.<br/><br/>The plot of this film is a rehash of the standard ""Homer does something completely idiotic and selfish and gets all of Springfield in trouble and makes Marge hopping mad."" There's plenty of homages to some of the past great episodes (Jumping Springfield Gorge, Bart Becomes a Flanders), and all the characters are doing their classic shtick. Chief Wiggum almost shooting himself while eating free donuts that have been stacked on the barrel of his gun is especially funny. Most of the hearty laughs are found in the peripherals. ""The Simpsons"" has never been accused of being subtle--witness here a literal visual depiction of Homer being stuck between ""a rock and hard place."" Always gently poking fun at religion (the stuff with Grandpa in church is priceless), politics (here we see Arnold as President), lampooning pop culture (Homer playing ""Grand Theft Walrus"" in Alaska is a joke about five years too late but still laugh-out-loud funny), and most successfully taking sharp jabs at itself and its corporate sponsors, the film delivers plenty of sight gags and one-liners to please even the most casual of fans.<br/><br/>As the ""Comic Book Guy"" might point out, this isn't exactly ""The Greatest Episode Ever,"" but it packs in more chuckles per minute than anything I've seen on the big or small screen this year."

From start to finish it was funny with a joke nearly every minute. The special cameos of Green Day and Arnold Swartzenager were gold. The only thing wrong was it was to short, 18 years in the making and all they got was 89 minutes. The actors delivered on the voices as well if not better then in the seasons.

"grahamryn8","3","15","36","26 July 2007"," Could this be made any less funny?
","Well, yes it could, if they hadn't made it of course...which i would be happier if they didn't. This film destroys everything the Simpson's once had, but it just seems to be an overly drawn out present episode (and we all know that these don't live up to the older ones) which rushes to a conclusion and reuses jokes from the series, but somehow, giving them less appeal.<br/><br/>But lets try and look at the positive side of things and round up the plot: After Greenday's concert barge dissolves in lake Springfield, the crisis seems apparent. The lake is brimming with pollution to an unbelievable level, so Lisa, with her new Irish friend (who's father ISN'T Bono as he keeps telling us) try and draw the towns attention to what they are doing to the lake. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig and dumps a silo of its leavings into the lake, completely ignoring the new laws about waste disposal. This causes mutations in the wildlife which get the E.P.A (environmental protection agency) involved.<br/><br/>With only 5 options to choose from which will stop the spread of the damage caused, president Schwarzenegger chooses for Springfield to be placed under a colossal dome. However, after the Simpsons escape, Homer begins to hatch a plan to save Springfield after he realises that not only will he lose his home, but he may also lose his family.<br/><br/>The Simpson's are best know for their humour, and that is something that this film lacks. At the screening i attended, the cinema laughed rather feebly twice, both times within the first half hour. That leaves over an hour of references to fox, Ton Hanks and desperate attempts to make this movie funny.<br/><br/>Characters are introduced but the movie does not allow their characters to develop and the audience quickly bores of them and wishes that some of their favourites had taken up that screen time.<br/><br/>Overall, this film was a great disappointment to me. They'v had 16 years to think and possibly plan this film, and it seems a complete let down that this is what they came up with."

Well imagine seeing four of those in a row and you have The Simpsons Movie. I wish I could unsee it.<br/><br/>Yes, it was extremely funny in places (but most of these are in the trailers) and there were gags and wit throughout but not enough humour to keep me interested. The plot(?) is extremely loose and makes little sense. I know a lot of the episodes are like this but the movie just doesn't work as the episodes do. It seems as though they have tried to give a line to every Simpsons character ever even though a lot of them are not relevant to the storyline.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot to live up to but I cant help but think if I had never heard of the Simpsons before and went to see the movie it would be just as bad. In fact, it may be worse as most of the laughs came from what you already know of the characters through years of watching them on TV. If you love The Simpsons, I would suggest just watching all the trailers and allow your imagination to fill in the rest. If you go see the movie, chances are you will be sorely disappointed."

The organist plays a slow version of Green Day's American Idiot. There was an advertisement for a TV program and a short pause where the screen turned black. It said, ""To be continued...immediately!"" When they were hiding from the law, Bart saw the wanted poster with the Simpsons family and drew on it. And there was a family that looked like the drawing who walked in and they got arrested instead of the Simpsons. The whole plot with Homer and the pig and Lisa having a crush with a foreign boy was pointless. Marge used the Lord's name in vain in this movie. She was never this hateful in the cartoon series. A very serious added Bart wishes Flanders was his father plot ruined the comedy aspect of the movie. For those of you who walked out as soon as the credits were shown missed a lot of surprises.

","This wasn't at all what I expected. Sadly, The Simpsons Movie has fallen into the ""let's dumb this down for the masses"" trap. Big time. I am one of those sad losers who thought The Simpsons, in their prime, were the greatest thing since sliced bread. Off beat, intelligent humour that had an ability to draw you into each episode like nothing else on T.V. at the time. Recently it has lost it's originality and that is to be expected from such a long running series. As soon as they killed off Flanders' wife it was obvious, to me, that they had reached the bottom of the creative well. So, as happens when they the creators are desperate to keep the show afloat, they start writing sub Tom and Jerry style slapstick with plenty of prepubescent story lines and boring, bandwagon current affairs themes. And so it carries on with The Simpsons Movie. A mixed bag of rehashed old jokes with a virtually no original gags apart from SpiderPig and that was washed clean of laughs because some company f-wit thought it would be a riot to show it on all the trailers ! What a waste. They also tried to cram every single previous character into this film. Obviously, they couldn't so it leaves everyone wondering where their particular favourites were. Sideshow Bob etc. Would it have been impossible to write a plot that revolves strictly around certain characters without the need for the stupid cameos ? All this and I won't even begin to mention what I thought of the Bart skate boarding scene or Homer making advances to the pig scene. The Simpsons in their heyday never needed to resort to this sort of low level garbage for laughs. In the long run this film will be forgotten. Banished to the sin bin of movie waste products and the classic episodes can be re-run forever."

There were plenty of cameos from old characters that you could barely be seen as a camera passed through a crowd, but a lot of people show up. It was basically just a really long episode, but much funnier and more time for stupidity from Homer and a lot more room for jokes. I also would tell people to stay for the credits. A few moments were ruined a little bit by the previews, but not to the level where it ruins it at all. There is not much to say about this movie except it is the Simpsons that we have grown to love back in all of their glory."
"Electrified_Voltage","7","5","9","1 August 2007"," Not a stunning movie based on the groundbreaking TV series, but still has some good laughs
","It has now been two decades since the Simpsons were first seen on TV, featured in animated shorts on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"", and nearly eighteen years since the full episodes started coming, but it has only been a few days since the world-renowned cartoon family finally made it to the big screen! Personally, I think the groundbreaking series used to be incredible, but no matter how good a show is, it can't likely maintain its quality for eighteen seasons, so I also believe that since the show's heyday, it has gradually gone downhill, and I don't watch new episodes anymore. However, I still planned to go and see this movie when it came into theatres, and certainly wasn't as disappointed as I could have been! <br/><br/>While Green Day performs on a vessel in Lake Springfield, they begin to talk about the environment, but receive a negative response from the audience of Springfield citizens. Garbage thrown at the band damages the vessel, causing it to sink and kill the band members! After this incident, as Lisa tries to warn other Springfield residents about pollution, nobody listens, until she meets an Irish boy named Colin. Together, these two manage to convince the town that the lake should be cleaned up. However, after Homer adopts a pig, he must somehow dispose of its waste, and decides to depose of it in the lake, causing heavy pollution! After President Arnold Schwarzenegger is informed about this by Russ Cargill, the head of the EPA, a giant dome is placed over Springfield, trapping the city's residents inside! Homer finds himself in a lot of trouble when the town learns that he is responsible for the lake's pollution! <br/><br/>I laughed pretty hard during the intro of the movie, with Itchy & Scratchy, which made me think that the movie might turn out to be excellent, but it didn't. Not all the gags in the movie are as funny as the one at the beginning (though some are), and some parts are not so amusing. I was also bothered by the animation. With the backgrounds (more enhanced than the ones we expect to see in the series), it's not quite the same. Fortunatly, the Simpsons do go on a reasonable adventure in the movie, there are some very funny moments after the Itchy & Scratchy intro, including the part where Homer dares Bart to skateboard naked to Krusty Burger and back, and Bart decides to do it, as well as several moments made funny by Homer's stupidity. All this is far from enough to make this long-awaited movie perfect, but it is enough to make it pretty good.<br/><br/>It appears the idea of a ""Simpsons"" movie first came up long ago, and the plot for the 1992 episode, ""Kamp Krusty"" was originally intended to be for a movie, but the show's writing staff just couldn't make it long enough, so instead, the plot was used for the first episode of Season 4. It has been fifteen years since that episode first aired, and ""The Simpsons Movie"" has finally come! Unfortunately, it probably would have been better if it was made during the TV show's days of glory in the 1990s. In fact, it could have turned out to be as good as all the classic episodes! However, although it sadly wasn't made until those days were long over, it could have turned out worse. The movie may show the declining quality of ""The Simpsons"" to SOME degree, but not completely. Unless you're a big fan of the recent seasons of the show, I wouldn't consider ""The Simpsons Movie"" a must-see, but if you don't like the way the show has been going lately, you still might find SOME entertainment value in it."

A lot of cheap jokes that would be considered cringe-worthy in an episode find themselves pride of place in this lack-luster film. If you are a genuine fan of the simpsons, i really would advice against seeing this movie, because its really saddening to see such an exceptional TV series turn into such pathetic drivel. I'll admit that this film does have its amusing moments but watch one TV episode and you'll find vastly more entertainment. Also, although the animation is exceptional, its a far cry from the simsons origins and the CGI just enforces that this has become more a celebrity stacked technical masterpiece than the funny, genuinely clever show it once was. Hugely disappointing."

","I walked into this show a dedicated follower of the Simpson's's with a friend and fellow follower. Both of us grew up with the show during it's prime and have been watching the slow decline in quality with grave disappointment. That being said we were both willing to take a chance on the movie, paying full admission price to see it at a theater. Our logic was that being as this was a big event with a lot of hype, the producers and writers would demand the best of themselves, and due something, perhaps not stylistically identical to but in terms of quality, at least on par with the Simpson's's during there 1999-2001 era, not it's finest for sure but surely it could be a lot worst. I was wrong.<br/><br/>Through out the entire movie, I did not laugh one time, and this was in a movie theater, the atmosphere of which alone has made sub-par movies the subject of giddy laughs for decades. And yet the best it got out of me was a mere chuckle. Most of the jokes were in fact so bad that I could do nothing more than look over at my friend to find that we were both cringing with embarrassment at having payed for this atrocity. <br/><br/>When the movie ended and we left the theater in a crowd of what turned out to be mostly five year olds who didn't know any better, and there equally naive parents, I contemplated the idea of demanding my money back for such a terrible film, however that bore one consequence that I could never live down. I'd have to admit face to face to the vendor that I had actually watched it."

","The greatest TV cartoon ever made has finally been made into a movie. The Simpsons Movie is just as funny and clever as the TV series, if not more-so. While the plot may not be as well developed, it's a more than attractive story to me. This is quite easily the funniest movie of 2007. It's quite possible you'll die of oxygen deficiency, you'll be laughing so hard. There are so many funny things in this movie, I couldn't possibly list them all here, but I will list the ones I can remember. The opening Green Day scene, the church scene, Homer & Bart on the roof, Russ Cargill, President Schwarzenegger, Homer whipping the sled dogs, and that random pig. There are also a few emotional scenes here and there, and that's one of the things that made the TV show great. The animation and the music are even better than in the TV series, of course. This movie is just amazing. Right after Ratatouille and Surf's Up, The Simpsons Movie is my third favorite movie of summer 2007. My sincerest thanks to Matt Groening and company."

","THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is a fun movie but nothing, I feel anyway, that has to be seen on the big screen. I could just of easily waited for it to come out on DVD and enjoyed it just the same.<br/><br/>Leave it to that lovable oaf, Homer, to mess things up in Springfield (It's location you may be asking? Well, you ain't gonna find out in this movie and they make a joke that has to do with this). Homer disposes of a silo, full of pig crap, into a lake which causes life in it to mutate. In comes the EPA to put a giant dome over Springfield to make sure nothing escapes from Springfield to cause a widespread epidemic. Of course, when the townsfolk discover that Homer was the cause of this, they aren't to happy. They head toward the Simpson residence, torches a blazing. The Simpsons escape the town, via a sinkhole, and make their way to Alaska, where they hide out for awhile. When Marge sees on TV that they (the EPA) now plan on blowing Springfield to smithereens, she wants to go back and stop it from happening, but Homer will have nothing of it. Why should he go back and help a town where the people wanted to off him and his family? So, needless to say, Marge takes the kids and heads back herself. Of course, Homer realizes, with the help of and old woman, that he must go back and help his family and his town.<br/><br/>I suppose they do put things in this film that they couldn't of got away with on network television, Homer flipping people off, A few swears here and there and, probably the most ""thing"" of all, Bart Simpson's genitalia. Yep. I wrote it. In a scene that recalls stuff they did in the Austin Power's movies, the filmmakers strategically place stuff in front of a nude Bart as he skateboards through Springfield, on a dare from Homer mind you. Only thing is, Bart skateboards behind a shrub, leaving his top half covered and his bottom half exposed. Funny? Yes. Something I had to see on the big screen? No."

If this is what it's all about, then I haven't missed a thing.<br/><br/>Some say that the earlier years were great satire. Well, maybe that is true, and there were a few satiric anti-corporate and anti-government bits in this film, but way too few to sit through the really stupid bits that are only funny to a Middle Schooler.<br/><br/>My only exposure to the Simpsons before this bore, was looking at the x-rated cartoons on the Internet. I'll take them anytime."
"morphion2","8","6","13","28 July 2007"," By its very nature, what we've been waiting for. It delivers as well as it can.
","Here's what I think: a good portion of the world has waited for a long time to see the Simpsons on the theatre screen. This kind of anticipation for a film has no precedent, as far as I know. It's absolutely huge. The logical, human extension of this anticipation is that many people are going to be disappointed. Others are going to be thrilled that the moment has finally arrived. I tend to think of it this way  recall the dizzying excitement that you felt as a child when you were going to stay the night at a friend's house. You would stew it over, hype it up, bounce up and down at the thought the entire day before. Sometimes you couldn't sleep. Now imagine that excited anticipation, subconsciously preserved for fifteen years.<br/><br/>Because I think it needs to be understood that for a lot of us, ""The Simpsons"" is more than a show. It's a cultural load bearing pillar of our childhood. It's a resource of knowledge and life. So as much as it is impossible to live up to the expectations of a generation still bouncing up and down at the thought, and as much as no film could ever encapsulate the breadth of ""The Simpsons""' brilliance (from 1992 to 1997), there is still a part of me that feels some deep untouchable itch put to blissful rest at the mere sight of Springfield on the big screen.<br/><br/>Is it a good movie? I think so. Kinda. It has a plot, and character arcs, and jokes, and all that. But truth be told, it's just about impossible to think of it as a film. When people ask if it's good, they don't mean ""Was it a good film?"" They mean, ""Was it good ""Simpsons""?"" The answer to this question is, again, I think so. Kinda. There are definite upsides to it: writing credits include some of the most prolific writers from the series' golden years: Mike Scully, David Merkin and John Swartzwelder highly amongst them. These people were big believers in taking the show ""back to the family"", and though the character stories cooked up for the film are retreads (Homer endangers the family, then endeavors to save them; Marge's relationship with Homer is put into question; Bart feels he'd be happier with another father), they're at least done by writers who know the characters better than any. There's also some of that good old fashioned *tasteful* celebrity cameo usage which has grown short these past few years: Green Day, Albert Brooks and Tom Hanks lend their voices to mostly great effect.<br/><br/>But there are problems as well. Some computer animation here and there puts us just a little bit out of it, we're not used to seeing the camera of Springfield move in that bizarre two dimensional three dimension way that computer assisted cartoons do. This isn't as big a distraction as the fact that ""The Simpsons"" simply works best in an episodic format. It's hard work to enjoy them through one solid plot for feature length. It can be done, but it's a slightly strained kind of enjoyment. Like you're giving the film a hand when it slips a little. Kind of an interactive experience, if you want to be optimistic about it.<br/><br/>And the film does slip. I'd say roughly sixty per cent of the jokes got laughs out of my full theatre, and me personally. This is no criticism  at the rate the show's been going, it's practically a miracle. Add that to the aforementioned fact that the film format isn't what ""The Simpsons"" was made for, and you've got yourself what's really a pretty funny production. The film's opening scene, of the Simpson family watching ""The Itchy and Scratchy Movie"" and making amusing parallels, Homer's ""spider-pig"" bit and Bart's naked skateboarding sequence are even downright hilarious (see also 'President Schwarzenegger'). And even though the scenes that cop the ungainly task of moving the plot forward do feel something like awkward punctuations, they need to be there to keep the relatively consistent laughs coming and they don't stop the show completely. We may be able to see the seams, but like an old soft toy, we love it anyway. And really, if you don't; if you're not willing to cut this movie some slack for old time's sake, what are you doing watching it in the first place?"

","I don't do TeeVee, so my encounters with these are either through reader recommendations, the usual case, or when something has a movie theater incarnation. I wasn't aware of the great controversy about the genuineness of ""The Simpsons"" versus ""South Park."" I do know that when I watched that South Park movie and several of the episodes, I was impressed, I often laughed and I wasn't ashamed of why. It was the sort of humor that is clever and that allows you to share in its cleverness.<br/><br/>This isn't clever in the big. In fact, it follows a Disney-inspired template: an unworthy man is redeemed, a boy reunites with his father. And this in the safest of Disney messages: give a hoot, and the government is evil. Noticeably absent is any business about media companies with huge budgets being evil. There used to be a bunch of this, I think: clowns and cartoons, dumping on TeeVee cartoons and cynical, manufactured humor.<br/><br/>There used to be winks at the audience, a sort of: ""this is a bit going after a stupid, trailer park laugh, and the funny thing about it will be the fact that we are doing it with both of us knowing it."" Somewhere along the way, the show became a brand and when that happens you do everything you can to support the brand. Things like taking over convenience stores for advertising purposes. Would the early incarnation of this start with Bart writing ""don't illegally download?"" Would ""South Park?""<br/><br/>This isn't ""The Simpsons"" any more; its ""The Flintstones.""

","This movie has everything. I picked this up since I'm a fan of the show, and boy, does this movie live up to the no-doubt high standards of the show in its Golden Years. It's practically moving at the rate of a joke per minute and leaves barely a dull moment once it took off. The cast is fantastic featuring Tom Hanks and Albert Brooks alongside the typical show cast (with the voice of Dot from Animaniacs as tons of characters). The animation doesn't upstage the voices (which could be music is just absolutely phenomenal (see 'Spider-Pig') and the satire good or bad depending on how you think about it) but is still interesting and wildly entertaining, and the shading is good and the is just delicious and all along I knew that the writers were really doing their best to make this the best that they could, to make this work, and it shows. It really, really shows. For example, the words that Grandpa Simpson spouts during the church scene at the beginning just so well work their way into the plot, which I won't give away. Also if you didn't know already there IS a scene in which Bart skateboards to Krusty Burger naked, which is pretty dang hilarious, and comes with a huge shock...{They show Bart's wiener}...was not expecting that... Nevertheless a 10/10. 'Nuff Said."

","It's no secret that the 18th season was extremely poor, with just the odd good episode and many many pathetic ones. It shows that this had been in production for a long time before it was finished since this is worthy of the classic years of the show.<br/><br/>This just plays out like one of the regular episodes of the show only stretched out to feature film length. The same level of humour you'd expect from a standard episode is on display and the entire writing team is involved so as to hone this to its full potential.<br/><br/>It's a shame we don't get to see much of the regular cast outside of the main family but most characters get something to do even if they are mostly wasted. Two new characters are brought in to replace them, Russ and Colin, but neither is particularly interesting. Spiderpig however is incredible.<br/><br/>The obligatory celebrity cameos are here too. Tom Hanks is a bit unnecessary but he gets some great lines in his fleeting appearance and at the start we get the opening theme performed by Greenday. They had a number one with their version of it. Another piece of the soundtrack to reach number one was Homer's Spiderpig song which was the shortest song to reach number one in the charts for a few months. Speaking of the soundtrack the regular musician for the show Alf Clausen is left out entirely and the theme composer Danny Elfman is not involved either. Instead they got in Hans Zimmer and the score he wrote for this is amazing.<br/><br/>The Simpsons made something of a quantum leap from shorts to its own series but it doesn't do the same from TV to movie. But why should it? If it ain't broke don't fix it. This is better than a lot of Zombie Simpsons and on par with a standard Classic Simpsons. And that's all it needed to be. 8/10"

","Comparable to an ""average"" Simpsons episode at best. Really only one part of the movie made me laugh, which was already shown in the previews long before the movie came out... which is the scene with Homer holding the pig to the ceiling and singing ""Spider pig"". Now, you know it's bad when the funniest thing in the movie is an asinine minor new side character. The whole ""Marge can't live with Homer anymore"" and ""Homer doesn't know how to be a father"" themes have been covered by tons of episodes already. The movie was a rehash of tired old ideas. I have to admit that I didn't expect much going into this... and not much is exactly what I got. It wasn't great and it wasn't bad. It was just plain average. There was the infamous shocking scene where we see Bart's privates... but it just wasn't funny. It didn't feel like it belonged in a Simpsons movie. Now that they've gotten the tired old themes out of their system, maybe the sequel will be better. Involve more of the tried and true old characters... they're the ones fans want to see!"

","Ultimately I feel that Simpsons fans WILL be satisfied with this movie. The bottom line is, this movie is funny. The gags and one liners are pretty much what one would expect from the writers and the animation is quite good. If you like the show you will probably like the movie.<br/><br/>That being said, I don't think there is anything really remarkable or special about this piece. I have heard the criticism, ""It's just like one long episode,"" repeated over and over again. I don't think that's really the case here. In a lot of ways, I don't think there's really much of the same ""feeling"" that the episodes have. For a show that is driven by so many diverse characters, I would have expected more interaction and complexity. The plot is a standard morality tale focusing most of its energy and screen time on the Simpsons themselves. Although the movie is funny, it lacks the contribution of many of the characters that have made the show so enjoyable. The plot is far more outlandish than what most of the episodes offer, and I felt that this was somewhat off-putting. The post modern, self referential tone has begun to run thin. I gave this movie a 6, as I feel that it WAS indeed funny, but far to disorganized to warrant a higher score. See it, if only to lament how good the show used to be."

","Most of the jokes fell flat, as did most of the sentimental scenes. It was disjointed. But there were some nice action scenes, and it worked just enough to make me not sorry that I paid to see it on the big screen.<br/><br/>Those are my impressions in a nutshell. More words? OK...<br/><br/>There are really two big problems with The Simpsons Movie. The first, and more important one, is that it has no coherent, well-planned script. The creators apparently finished enough scenes which were eventually cut out to make a whole other film, and were removing and adding stuff until the last minute. This is a poor method of making sure that your film has a flow rather than simply a progression of events. Unfortunately, The Simpsons Movie's scenes often have no bridge between them, especially in the beginning, before the plot really gets going. One funny scene ends and another begins, and you get a weird sense that they could've switched their order around and no-one would've noticed. They're there more to show a joke than to fit into the bigger picture. Of course, this makes the plot not very coherent either. I really got the impression that any single 10-minute stretch of the movie could've been replaced with something completely different and still make as much sense as it did before.<br/><br/>The second problem is that the movie makes some attempt at developing the Simpsons' characters and actually having a sort of moral. It only half-works, because you don't really get a sense that the Simpsons are real. In order for the comedy to work (which is the main focus of the film), many of the characters act like caricatures. It is therefor hard to relate to them when the film suddenly turns around and says ""nope, these folks are real, you're supposed to cry now"". The TV show has a similar problem. And, to be fair, so do some very fine comedy films like ""Hot Fuzz"".<br/><br/>I should as well mention here that my theatre audience (Toronto, on a Tuesday a few weeks after the movie's premiere) was depressingly quiet, and there was only a bit of laughter. This seems to be one film which benefits greatly from being seen with an appreciative crowd. Unfortunately, after you take the appreciative crowd away, the film doesn't have enough merits to really be enjoyed by one person.<br/><br/>Oh, it's alright. As I mentioned before, there are some really impressive action scenes, and some jokes actually DO work. But I think it's closer to being an ""ok"" movie than to being a ""good"" one."

It was a little longer version of the T.V. show with a little more refined cartooning, a little more risqué dialog, a little more Maggie, and a little glimpse of Bart's little yellow wiener. If anything, there was a little TOO much Simpsons and really not enough supporting characters. I wanted more Burns, Ned, Wiggam, Moe, Apu, Crabapple, Skinner, etc., etc.. It was kind of like having chili made with meat, beans and tomato but no chili powder or spices. Kind of tasty but not enough depth to it. It could have been made longer with other, supporting plot lines involving some of the other characters that we've all come to know and love. ""The Simpsons"" has been around for a long, long time and has become an icon in American culture. Futurama, Beavis and Butthead, Southpark, King of the Hill, et al......where would any of those shows be had it not been for ""The Simpsons""? In short, this effort fell somewhat flat.

At its best, it prompted a smile, maybe even a snigger, but this was nowhere near the best that the Simpsons can be. Whereas the best episodes feel like 40 minutes of material stuffed into 20 minutes of episode, bursting at the seams with content and comedy, this film felt like 40 minutes of material stretched out over 80 minutes of film. There was no pace, no zip, no zing, and, almost, no characters!?! Homer was always going to be the centre of the film (and rightly so) but where on earth was the rest of the town? (Okay, I know, they were under the big dome  it was a rhetorical question). Why no real time for Apu, Mr Burns, Mrs Krabapple and the rest? Basically, this was an average Simpsons episode that went on a bit. Still funny in places, but very disappointing when you think what might have been.

","Funny how long we had to wait to finally watch the Simpsons' family on the big screen : whereas all the TV shows have now extremely rapidly their own movie adaptation (including ""South Park"" after only two seasons), Matt Groening waited almost twenty years (his yellow family first appeared in ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" in 1987 !) to bring us ""The Simpsons Movie"". And hopefully, it was worth the waiting.<br/><br/>At the beginning of the movie, Homer Simpson yell at the ""Itchy and Scratchy Movie"" screening he went to see with his family : ""Why do we have to pay to watch something we can get for free on TV ?"". Well, like Kramer once said in a ""Seinfeld"" episode : ""Why going in a four stars restaurant while you can eat all by yourself cheat pasta in your apartment ? Why riding horses on LSD while you can sleep peacefully in your bed ?"". ""The Simpsons Movie"" is nevertheless bigger, larger and uncut compared to a twenty minutes episode, but the script compiles the best jokes ""The Simpsons"" could offer without a pause, when the direction of the movie, assured by David ""Monster, Inc."" Silverman is a real cinema one and looks technically very impressive on the big screen : so, no matter what, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a real theater experience.<br/><br/>But the great achievement of the movie is to look both original and sincere and true to the spirit of the show : it almost looks like a ""best of"", but only with new materials. The movie is for instance, like the show, very clever and subversive in its jokes and details (the appearance of President Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Al Gore's movie parody, etc.) but ultimately very conformist and American in its moral and ending (the family is the most important thing in the world). And it's certainly this mixture of conformism in the subversion that allowed the show its wide audience and its worldwide success. The critic is here, but tempered by the message and morality of the movie.<br/><br/>All this will certainly pleased the Simpson's fans, or people like me, how lost their tracks years ago and are very happy to see that Homer is still inconstant and stupid or Mr. Burns still rich and mean. It almost make me want to take a look at the last season, and sure make me wait for, like Maggie said, a ""sequel""."

","This movie was fun, but not hilarious like I had hoped. I think it would have been much better had it contained more new jokes in the original humor style of the earlier seasons that made it famous. I realize this is a tough task for a show that's been on the air as long as the Simpsons has, but the movie had 11 writers who all had written episodes for the show at one point or another. You would think that this would really help out the originality, but it really didn't. In fact it seems like the opposite was true. There were a lot of jokes that had felt like they had already been done in the show disguised as new jokes by making slight alterations. For Example:<br/><br/>Spider-Pig/Harry Popper was almost the same idea as the Helper Monkey from the ""Girly Edition"" in season 9. The clapping joke in Alaska was like when the Murderhorn collapsed in ""King of the Hill"" in season 9 crossed with some Bart humor. The angry mob of people reminded me of the one in ""Homer Badman"" in season 6. The Flanders/Bart relationship was already explored in other episodes in the series like ""Home Sweet Home-Dum-Diddly Doodly"" in season 7. And there are many more...<br/><br/>I honestly appreciated the jokes more the first time I saw them in the show and did not feel that the ones in the movie were good tributes. They did not make me remember the good times as they were probably designed to.<br/><br/>In addition to the redone jokes, there were also plenty of gay, nude, and sexual humor that really felt cliché to me. I would have rather seen them done more originally or replaced with better jokes.<br/><br/>Now don't get me wrong though, the movie had some better new jokes too. I liked Ralph Wiggum's trumpeting in the 20TH Century Fox logo and Homer making a stop sign misspelled ""SOP"" followed up with the government agents saying they couldn't stop for every ""SOP"", ""Yeld"" etc. The Spider-Pig music was funny as was the ""Paying to see something they could have seen on TV"" joke. I liked most of the jokes involving Moe's Tavern and Moe himself, and the Bottox joke too. There were probably a few others, but I can't think of them off the top of my head right now.<br/><br/>I'll withhold giving it a star rating or anything like that for now, because I have only seen the movie once. Maybe after seeing it a few more times I will like it better."

Marge nags as per usual and sounds closer to Patty or Selma than her original voice. Bart skateboards nude in a hilarious sequence, but becomes an obnoxious thorn in the movie's paw as he becomes a total jerk towards Homer (He never realized Homer was a bad father in how many seasons?). Lisa, almost no one's favorite character, actually gets some great moments and she finds a cute Irish boyfriend.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks has two funny bits on the film, and Al Brooks is underused.<br/><br/>Now, any true Simpsons fan probably stopped watching about 7 years ago, as the show's last best memorable episode was probably ""Behind the Laughter"". The film gets a better sharper aesthetic that is a little more reminiscent of the show's golden years. Think of it as Revenge of the Sith to the original Star Wars trilogy. Hardly stellar, but a breath of fresh air compared to the recent garbage.<br/><br/>The film strikes at brilliance once or twice, keeps the laughs coming generally, and I'm sure everyone will be singing ""Spider Pig"" to the point of tedium by the end of the summer. The film kind of runs out of steam halfway through, but picks it up by the end.<br/><br/>Sidenote: Subtly making the EPA the villain of the movie just put a bad taste in my mouth, a reminder that FOX controls the strings of The Simpsons.<br/><br/>This was a solid movie but I can't in good conscience support what means God knows how many more unnecessary Simpsons seasons.

Its familiarity is something it relies upon heavily and it runs for 84 minutes which is slightly too long in the end.<br/><br/>Enjoyable and entertaining, albeit familiar Simpsons formula."
"MartinHafer","4","4","8","14 September 2008"," A single episode's number of laughs stretched out to 87 minutes
","""I was right!"" was something I was able to say to myself when this movie was complete. That's because I assumed based on other TV cartoons that were stretched into full-length that THE SIMPSONS MOVIE would carry on the tradition of producing a mediocre film. Several Charlie Brown films, THE SPONGEBOB MOVIE and THE POWERPUFF GIRLS movie all were decent enough cartoons that were disappointments on the big screen because the usual pacing of the shows just couldn't be maintained for an entire film.<br/><br/>THE SIMPSON MOVIE certainly has its moments, but the plot involving the evil EPA placing a dome over Springfield could easily have been handled on television. Plus, there just seemed to be a ton of padding--most of which bogged the film down to a crawl--particularly the messages about saving the planet. I am all in favor of protecting the environment, but because the occasionally heavy-handed message seemed out of place in a cartoon comedy, the film had me wanting to trade in my car for a Hummer (no crude joke intended) and eat a Spotted Owl. The bottom line is that the reason 99.673% of its audience watches the show is the humor and irreverence--here, it seemed amazingly blunted and bland thanks to the pacing and environmental message.<br/><br/>So was it a bad film? Not really...but it sure could have been better and it's sure not worth buying the DVD. My advice is save the money and use it to purchase one of the seasons of the great show.<br/><br/>PS--Of the films I mentioned, perhaps Spongebob made the best transition to the theaters. However, considering it was shown on Nickelodeon only months after its theater debut, it obviously had rather modest pretensions."

"jak-stiid","9","4","8","2 August 2007"," A Successful Adapted Film
","The Simpsons are still running for over 15 years on television as America's favorite animated family. The characters, settings, catchphrases and humor are easily recognizable by fans and non-fans. After a stressful work on the script with over 10 writers and almost 3 years of animation, it gives us a near-perfect lengthy film that can be considered as an episode to the big screen. And by the way, all of the original voice actors are in there including celebrities and brief cameos.<br/><br/>Word on the story says that Homer makes Springfield out of control after a news report found a dumped silo (with Homer's name) under Lake Springfield, which was recently cleaned by the citizens. After the EPA catch a multi-eyed creature caused by the polluted lake, the evil rich EPA head Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks) fools President Schwarzenneger (A brown-haired Wolfcastle) by making him choose one of the 5 unstoppable plans twice, cover Springfield with a glass dome and attempting to bomb Springfield. The Simpson family sets off to hide somewhere safe after escaping the mob by jumping into a sinkhole on a sandbox, discovered by Maggie.<br/><br/>The story worked pretty well for a Simpsons first feature so far. It is completely more focused than the television series, since the script is more intense and deeper yet still retain to cram a load of humor in there. The introduction of new original characters helped though Russ Cargill is usually the most developed new character from beginning to end. However, key characters such as Plopper the Pig and Colin should have more roles but it's the SIMPSONS MOVIE, we need to focus on the family. Ha.<br/><br/>The animation is much, much more detailed, fast-paced and smoother than the series because it is in a widescreen format. It lets the animators to add more frames by making the characters talk with many movements. The angry mob scene worked really well for it's widescreen format. CGI backgrounds and objects are also a nice addition but it makes the 2D animation a bit flat in my opinion.<br/><br/>The voice work in the film is top-notch and showed more expressions than a single episode of the series. All the original actors done their voices but too bad most of them had brief lines such as Skinner and Nelson. Cameos from Green Day and Tom Hanks (Yes, THE Tom Hanks) suits their animated counterpart. The emotional scene of Marge ditching Homer to risk their lives to save Springfield was touching, which I considered to be one of the best scenes in the film.<br/><br/>The humor worked pretty well in it's progress. The first half did have a fistful of sight gags while the other half has a number of comical lines. The nude-boarding with Bart was seriously unpredictable for a PG-13 film, because of a brief...Well, it kinda broke the child nudity rule in an animated film. Some of the humor were flat, such the iron-ball slapstick with Homer was cheesy at it's best, since it's more of a Family Guy gag.<br/><br/>Despite the brief screen time of favorite secondary characters and a partially-broken plot, The Simpsons Movie is an excellent animated film to watch for hardcore fans and film-goers. It raises more hell than Hellraiser that you would desperately want a sequel, which is a possibility.<br/><br/>Props to Matt Groening and his team for doing such a rough work on their first film ever on the Simpsons franchise."
"elliott_38","3","23","75","25 July 2007"," D'oh! They forgot to make this movie funny!
","There's no question about it; this movie will excel in the box office regardless of the amount of reviews criticising it. It's The Simpsons, and Mr Groening is fully aware that he could serve up cold vomit in a tin, slap a Simpsons logo on it, and he would still make a hefty profit. This film wasn't far off exactly that. <br/><br/>The animation is, well 2D, which is a rather refreshing change to view on the big screen; seeing as every animation is in 3D these days. However, it is far more impressive than the conventional animation which we see in the televised version of the show. <br/><br/>The plot lacks substance, and has little depth, and fails to evoke intrigue by the audience. It reflected the more recent episodes, which are tired, and almost unbearable, and that's for half an hour! Imagine sitting through one ninety minutes of it! The basic plot outline is the government wants to destroy Springfield, and it's up to the Simpson family to stop it. <br/><br/>The script has no wit or charisma, and the humour became dependant on slapstick comedy as appose to clever jokes. This is a shame, as one of The Simpsons greatest achievements was the ability to make those with a drier sense of humour chuckle. <br/><br/>The character focus is on the Simpson family; naturally. However, it is often the supporting characters who provide the greatest comic relief, and it is unfortunate that so many of them play such minor parts within the movie. <br/><br/>In conclusion, this movie will become a success. Some will rate it highly; others will chastise it, and in my opinion rightly so. The Simpsons have let standards slip, and this movie is a glaring example of how a once much loved family show has now become a tired and downright second-rate animation."

"Look_The_Other_Way","8","6","14","30 July 2007"," A pleasant surprise for this fan of 20 years.
","When ""The Simpsons Movie"" was announced, it raised my interest, even though I had pretty much given up on the weekly show, which should have retired with the 20th century. The trailers I saw did not appeal to me at all. Still, I decided that I would give the film a try, IF it got decent reviews from fans and/or critics. A few hours into the weekend, I convinced myself to go, with no expectations, and hoped that it wouldn't be a total wreck of a film. Boy was I surprised.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" is a funny, smart, and endearing flick that left me with a sense of giddy satisfaction that I haven't felt since the show's heyday in the 90's. It revolves around a fairly simple story(that gets increasingly elaborate,) held together by perfect characterizations and lots of humor.<br/><br/>There's something about seeing a comedy on the big screen that makes it so much more fun. ""Simpsons"" offers a diverse comical dish that includes broad slapstick, satire, irony, social commentary and good old fashioned madcap cartoon shenanigans. The jokes work more often than not, and there's enough humor to evoke steady laughs and smiles. Even the gags that seemed overly silly in the trailer (I'm thinking specifically of the Rock and a Hard Place sequence) worked well in front of a diverse audience of hundreds. (In retrospect, I wonder if the rock/hard place gag was not meant to be more of a isolated set piece rather than literal action that takes place in ""real time."" Hmm...) The film takes some risks , including a few sight gags and jokes that would not make into Fox's prime time lineup, but it also seems strangely...sterilized at times. Suicide jokes, middle fingers and animated ""doodles"" aside, I was still left with the feeling that the creators held back in some ways, more than they would have even on the small screen. Something about the film seems edited, even incomplete in some spots. On the other hand, I'm glad they didn't go too far. As crude as it can be at times, The Simpsons franchise has always maintained a certain level of class and good nature. Shows like South Park and Family Guy would not exist without ""The Simpsons,"" yet their brand of comedy does not suit Matt Groening's classic.<br/><br/>The most surprising aspect of ""The Simpsons Movie"" is its genuine heart, an element that has been missing from the series for nearly a decade. There are some truly sweet moments in the film, and the script, along with fine animation and excellent voice work, helps to create some interesting character nuances that I don't think I've ever seen before. For the first time since I was a child, I actually cared about what happened to the Simpson clan and the citizens of Springfield. Bart and Lisa were real, believable kids, without losing their distinct edge. Maggie was used well for comic relief. Marge was perhaps the most well-developed character in the film. But I was most impressed with the handling of Homer. Throughout the history of the series, Homer has gone from temperamental disciplinarian, to passive but disgruntled father, to lazy but lovable oaf, to irrational idiot, to town whipping boy and finally to, well, to complete a**hole. All of these elements are present in the film, but they are slowly stripped away, and for a few fleeting moments, the audience is able to see a real person, flawed but kind-hearted, and ready to accept responsibility. Will this ""new"" Homer last? Only time(or a sequel) will tell. Remember, this is the same guy who survived death and disaster on many occasions throughout the series, and made many a vow of change, only to revert immediately(and comically) back to his old ways.<br/><br/>The animation is excellent, and its heartening to see a return to hand drawn work, even with the incorporation of some CGI. The combination of styles works nicely to produce a few cool visual sequences.<br/><br/>The soundtrack consists of a pleasant incidental score and a rock version of the main theme, performed by Green Day. Perhaps the most memorable piece of music is the use of Marge and Homer's ""theme"" (the Carpenters' ""Close to You."") Overall, it's a bit sparse musically, but as with the boundary-pushing gags, less may be better than too much. Still, I wouldn't have minded the town of Springfield breaking into spontaneous song, at least once.<br/><br/>Its rare that I can say this about a modern film, but at 87 minutes, I felt that ""Simpsons"" was too short! An extra 20 minutes or so would have allowed for further plot development , and some of the issues left up in the air as the credits rolled could have been better resolved.<br/><br/>""The Simpson Movie"" has something for every type of fan, and even something for non fans. If I were to compare the film to the progression of the series, I'd say the humor is of late-90's-era quality (a little broader and zanier than ""classic"" Simpsons humor , but still solid and clever.) The story and direction, however, remind me of something from the earliest season(s) of the show, with steady pacing, blatant morality, and character-driven plot. This movie is not for very young children (I wouldn't take any kid under 11 or so.) If you don't like or cannot appreciate subverted and ""irreverent"" humor, this may not be the film for you. But if you've ever enjoyed the the Simpsons family, you will enjoy ""The Simpsons Movie."""

","What can I say? I've been a Simpsons fan for practically my whole life, and this movie exceeded even my expectations. I was wary walking into the movie, as over the past 8 seasons or so The Simpsons have undeniably declined in quality. But this movie has reminded me of the glory days. From the opening itchy and Scratchy bit to the finale with Homer and Marge, this movie will have you laughing, and at one point, even sad. This movie was definitely worth going to on opening weekend. I will get the DVD, but you shouldn't wait until then. As for ""spider-pig"", or ""harry plopper"", or whatever the hell you want to call that pig, don't worry. It plays no crucial role in the movie.<br/><br/>(And yes it is true, you do see Bart's....member.)<br/><br/>A fan's dream come true."

","I just saw the movie and after years of waiting for a movie based on one of my favorite shows, I was eagerly exited about finally seeing it. I don't often see a movie on the first day, but not only did I see it on the first day. I was 4th in line at the very first showing at this Toronto theatre. Well, after waiting about 15 years, I finally saw it and let me tell you, it was definitely worth the wait. I would have to compare this film to the best cartoon movies of all time. The last really good cartoon movie was South Park, but the animation isn't quite as good as the Simpsons. I compare this more to Roger Rabbit, which had great animation, a great story and humor too. Not only do they parody not only their own show, but other cartoons like Disney, which I have never been much of a fan of. This is a movie that has to be seen on a big screen, not on a DVD or TV. The animation is almost 3 dimensional in some scenes and I have to admit, the look is a little different from the regular show. The movie has a bit of a different look. Fans of the show will notice this. The movie moves quickly and there are lots laughs and entertainment from the very beginning to the very end. Do not leave this movie until the curtain is closed. This movie is a masterpiece and if there is another one, I'll surely be there. I am fortunate to live in a time to witness this event. I really call this movie an event. It's not just a movie."

The jokes were not that funny at all, even in the jam packed cinema the laughs were quite shallow. To give you a general idea, the clips you see in the trailers, is just about as funny as it gets. Having seen the trailers actually ruined it for me.<br/><br/>Everything we saw has already been seen before in the series. If anything, the movie came way too late. There were also many failed attempts at being funny, where the cinema was just completely silent.<br/><br/>All I can say is don't get your hopes up too high after reading all these reviews. This film is not amazing and it is not the best thing this summer. Seasons 5-9 was definitely a lot better."

","South Park did it perfectly, and now finally, after celebrating 20 years (since first seen on The Tracy Ullman Show in 1987) and the 400th episode on TV, the greatest cartoon and sitcom family The Simpsons finally go on the big screen. The story is basically Homer (Dan Castellaneta) polluting Springfield lake with a huge silo of his pet pig's excrement, and the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) sealing the town with a large transparent dome, and all town members want to kill the family responsible. Homer and the family manage to escape through the sink hole, and head for Alaska till things cool down, but it only gets worse when the villain, Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks, as A. Brooks), who works for President Schwarzenegger (mocking the actor/politician using the Rainier Wolfcastle character) plans to blow the town. Homer is the one who caused the incident, but he is also the one who saves the day on a motorbike with Bart (Nancy Cartwright). The story sees a couple of returns to past episode plots, including jumping Springfield gorge, Marge (Julie Kavner) revealing a secret wedding video (that she tapes over), and after some comedy hiding (including bubbles, flowers, kids, etc) you finally (and unexpectedly) see what a Simpson penis looks like, Bart's! There are also some small supporting stories among the big one, including Bart seeing Ned Flanders (This Is Spinal Tap's Harry Shearer) as a new father figure, Lisa (Yeardley Smith) falling for Irish boy Colin (Tress MacNeille) who has the same interests and knowledge as her, and many moments with supporting characters. Other characters seen at least once/twice in the whole hour and 20 minutes, some slightly side-lined (and normally bigger) include Abraham ""Grampa"" Simpson, Patty and Selma, The Flanders: Ned, Rod and Todd, Milhouse Van Houten (Pamela Hayden), Apu, Ralph Wiggum, Chief Clancy Wiggum, Dr. Julius Hibbert, Martin Prince (Russi Taylor), Reverand Lovejoy, Nelson Muntz, Cletus, Mr. Charles Montgomery Burns and Waylon Smithers, Lenny and Carl, Principal Seymour Skinner, Edna Krabappel (Marcia Wallace), Grounsdkeeper Willie, Mayor ""Diamond Joe"" Quimby, Fat Tony, Comic Book Guy, Sea Captain (MacCallister), Professor Frink, Krusty the Clown, Itchy and Scratchy (in TV cartoon), Kent Brockman, Troy McClure, Moe the bartender, Barney Gumble, Dr. Nick Riviera. Guests include rock band Green Day, Joe Mantegna as Fat Tony and for me an unexpected Tom Hanks. Filled with some great laughs and many lovable characters, this is a fantastic family comedy film, and a treat for fans of the show. The TV series was number 6 on The 100 Greatest Pop Culture Icons, it was number 12 on The 100 Greatest Christmas Moments (for all Christmas episodes), it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest TV Characters (for Homer Simpson), it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Kids' TV Shows, and of course, it was number 1 on The 100 Greatest Cartoons. Very good!"

"Donatien3","9","5","11","3 August 2007"," Long-awaited movie lives up to the hype
","For a series which has been as long running (currently into its nineteenth season) and as influential as ""The Simpsons"", you figure the much anticipated movie would be on a hiding to nothing. Seemingly, anything less than a box-office smash would bring out the doomsdayers, calling for the show to die an honourable death. Fortunately, ""The Simpsons Movie"" lives up to most expectations. There are plenty of jokes in its ninety minute duration, pop-culture gags (including Homer's Spider-Pig routine, which is sure to gain cult status amongst most Simpsons fans), and special appearances by Green Day (putting their own spin on Danny Elfman's theme, before being drowned ""Titanic"" style) and Tom Hanks, as well as plenty of self-referential gags (including Homer stating 'why would we pay money for something we can see for free?'). Considering Homer Simpson's been the focal point of the show from the beginning, it's appropriate that everyone's favourite bald, yellow-skinned oaf dominates the main story. After throwing a silo of pig excrement  in a vat which suspiciously looks like a wang - into Lake Springfield, the US Government are forced to entomb Springfield into a giant dome, and the residents want Homer's blood. Facing a lynching, The Simpsons flee to Alaska to rebuild their lives. While I won't spoil the fun by giving away too much, suffice to say Homer must pull his family  and the town - from their do (o) med existence. There's also a small subplot of Lisa finding love with an Irish boy named Colin (who, he stresses, is not Bono's son). For a show which has garnered such a following, it's good to see that the fans are looked after in this movie. Not only are we treated to revised credit sequence (including a new chalkboard gag from Bart), but subtle references to past episodes (such as Homer calling Jesus ""Jebus""), and the added factor of nearly every character on the show making an appearance (with a hundred speaking parts), most of who can be seen in the angry mob marching to Homer's house. If anything, this movie is visually stunning; the animation is fluid and colourful, and the longer format allows for a lot more action-orientated set pieces than the show's usual twenty-two minute platform (literately starting with a bang with a scene from an ""Itchy and Scratchy"" movie). It's quite a contrast to the early episodes of The Simpsons, which look almost prehistoric in comparison. While many believe the show is long past its prime, making this movie now, as opposed to a decade ago, allows for the more expansive action, which a show like this certainly deserves. Overall, The Simpsons movie lives up to expectations - though some hard-to-please fans are sure to find fault somewhere  and is, at times, laugh out loud funny, with plenty of its trademark topical humour, pop-culture references and the obligatory celebrities. Bring on the sequels."
"RealLiveClaude","10","5","11","28 July 2007"," Very funny, back to the Basics...
","When I started to watch the Simpsons in 1990, I saluted this series by its exaggerated caricature of the North American Society. Luckily, the series touched so much the heart of French Canadians we did a special dubbing here adapted to Quebecquers.<br/><br/>However, these past few years, even with the excellent dubbing, most episodes fell flat and I miss the first seasons which were real classics (sort of what happened to the Flintstones before their children and the Great Gazoo arrived, a thing I forgave to Hanna-Barbera since because the original series was great cartoon) This time, Matt Groening and his team thought it over, put some new perspective and voilà ! The movie is well told, very funny moments, some clever wisecracks, and Homer Simpson trying to be a hero here after his downfall (and almost hung by a lynch mob).<br/><br/>I won't tell more. I haven't seen the English version, but I believe the cast is again on the top of things, especially that I praise the work of Harry Shearer, who takes so many voices here...<br/><br/>Here in Quebec, we feared that a version from France would have spoiled our fun (no offense to French fans, they do deserve a version of their own) but it is the same cast and crew of the French Canadian version we hear here and they do a wonderful job (I still remember Hubert Gagnon learning us French on TV in the 70s, dressed as a super-hero-like extra-terrestrial, and veteran actress Beatrice Picard doing great sitcoms on the TVA Network in the 60-80s)...<br/><br/>Go have some laughs in 90 minutes, you'll have your Simpson faith restored in you..."
"TOMNEL","9","5","11","27 July 2007"," Bravo to the Simpsons. This was a hilariously brilliant movie!
","The Simpsons is without a doubt my favorite television show, and because of this, the movie obviously had to be perfect...and it was pretty darn close. It seems having 11 writers from the show helped. All the jokes used were the best jokes, and they were mostly new ones, not seen on the show. I was laughing through the entire movie because of this. The direction, by longtime Simpsons director David Silverman looks better than ever, and made the movie even better to watch. The emotion that many fans have said is missing from recent episodes was quite plentiful here, making it not just an 80 minute long joke, but it layered the film, making it a movie and not just an average Simpsons episode. Though the plot itself is pretty thin, it's still obviously there. The movie deals with Springfield deciding to clean up Lake Springfield because of Lisa, and Homer dumps a silo of pig excrement into the lake, causing the Environmental Protection Agency to go nuts and lock Springfield in a dome. Once head of the EPA Russ Cargill (Voiced by A. Brooks) decides to blow up Springfield, it's up to the Simpsons to save the day, and Homer to grow up. A gripe I've heard by many people, is the movie didn't have enough of the side characters. Where it is true that the Simpsons were in much more of the film than any other characters, most of the other characters had many funny lines, like Moe, Chief Wiggum, Milhouse, Nelson, Lenny and Carl, Barney, Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Grampa and dozens of more classic characters. So, in the end, in no way was this movie a disappointment, and this is coming from a huge fan of the early Simpsons, who has remained a fan over the years. Long live the Simpsons!!!! <br/><br/>My rating: *** 1/2 out of ****. 79 mins. Rated PG-13 for crudities."

It's not as subtle as say, season 3, but the movie takes full advantage of the big screen. It's amazing to see Springfield feel more alive than ever. Tell your friends stuck in 1989 that the animation will make their eyes pop out. <br/><br/>Bart would've loved the movie. Marge would approve of the ending. Homer would like the action.

"buiredintime","10","5","11","27 July 2007"," If this is 3 TV episodes put together then....
","....you might as well make South Park, Spongebob, Family Guy all three part TV episodes because that's basically what a lot of people are saying. My personal opinion is that it's a lot like South Park in the way that it goes above and beyond the television. It takes risk that aren't possible on television.<br/><br/>In the case of The Simpsons movie it's perfect as a stand alone movie. There are so many great moments in this movie that I can't even begin to tell you how great it is.<br/><br/>I won't speak of the plot because it's already been said, but I'll speak more on the writers, and some of the jokes that made the movie the gold standard for television to movie adaptations.<br/><br/>Okay the only way to write a classic TV to movie adaption is to get some of the originally writers. In the case of South Park and Spongebob pretty much everyone involved in the origins of the TV show participated in the movie why because they know the show hands down know what makes it work know why it was loved in the beginning. Simpsons is no different if you look at the list of Writers you'll know with the exception of Brad Bird and Conan O'Brian that most have returned, and it works you have just to name a few John Schwartzwelder, Mike Reiss, Jon Vitti, David Mirkin, Al Jean and Matt Groening. If you notice like I'm sure most of you have that these guys pretty much made the Simpsons what it is today a classic series that has lasted longer than most of you who see it have been alive.<br/><br/>But we can't forget David Silverman. This guy was the first director ever on the Simpsons TV series he helped pretty much create the classic feel of course it's Matt Groening's world, but we get the point.<br/><br/>You then have to have some of the great jokes that made the series what it was, and by gods you need to have the supporting characters that helped the show what it was. In Spongebob and South park a lot of the best characters where left out. It kind of ruined it for me. Not with The Simpsons movie though. Also bringing jokes from the television show that you never expect, but make you giddy makes it all the more worth while. For me it was The Praise Jebus line.<br/><br/>Anyways with that I can definitely say without a doubt that The Crew of the Simpsons have created something rather unique and fun, and also quite different and larger than the television show, and once again it's not a three part television episode I can't stress that enough.<br/><br/>Peace."

","Homer adopts the pig from a Krusty Burger commercial and sets off a series of events that ruin the environment so bad that President Arnold Schwarzenegger puts a glass dome over the entire town of Springfield! Lake Springfield becomes the most polluted watershed of all time as Homer dumps a giant silo filled with ""pig leavings"" into it. An evil Skull and Crossbones laughs in the poisoned lake and it creates a mutated squirrel with a thousand eyeballs (but no 3-eyed glowfish). Makes fun of several films including itself: Frankenstein (villagers wielding touches), Austin Powers, Lake Placid, Disney movies, ""Under the Dome"" TV Series, the ""Helping Hands"" from ""Labyrinth"". Look carefully for ""special"" cameos in the riot-torch scene. Other movie references that I missed, I am sure. Homer also saves the day after the EPA decides to blow up the dome and the town as well. (It will become the ""new"" Grand Canyon.) Great stylized animation and typical irrelevant Simpsons humor throughout. (Look out! Here comes the Spider-Pig"") Just remember, like Homer, if things get really bad, flee to Alaska with your family and go on a ""vision-quest"" to find your purpose in life. (Was that big idea stolen from ""Dances with Wolves"" or ""Star Wars""?) Starts out with a relatively ""mild"" Itchy and Scratchy prequel. EPA Director ""Cargill"" is named after the poultry company and voiced by Albert Brooks. Highly recommended for all Simpsons fans. Baby Maggie saves the day at the very end and Marge forgives Homer, as she always does."

","The Simpsons Movie (2007): Dir: David Silverman / Voices: Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer: Celebration of the longest running animation on TV with a movie that is well worth the wait. Simple plot with the water becoming polluted and a big dome placed over Springfield by outside authorities. Homer Simpson is responsible due to his ability to not think. Director David Silverman is backed with hilarious pop culture references. Homer is voiced with great amusement by Dan Castellaneta and he messes things up without thought or fear. After being driven to Alaska he will have to face his faults and reunite the town and his marriage. His wife, Marg is voiced by Julie Kavner and she is the voice of reason. When she threatens to leave Homer she is obviously waiting for him to clue in to the right decision. Mischievous Bart is voiced by Nancy Cartwright who longs for bonding with dad but develops another bond with neighbour Flanders. Lisa is voiced by Yeardley Smith who is love-struck. Baby Maggie may be the smartest of them all. Harry Shearer voices Homer's well meaning yet annoying neighbour Ned Flanders. Creative storytelling despite some obvious smooth over elements that one expects, but everyone is here for the animated landmark for the TV series that took cartooning to new heights. Score: 9 / 10"
"willcundallreview","8","2","3","5 August 2015"," Funny movie making a successful transition
","The Simpsons, a classic family of TV, and now they have finally taken to the big screen, and in good fashion. With the kind of jokes that the Simpsons seemingly had lost, this mixes good old fun with overall stupidity to make a comedy well worth your time. Even the whole town of Springfield come out to salute the show in style, every crazy thing that happens seemingly normal, and is testament to the wacky ideas that the creators put out there.<br/><br/>The story is fun, over the top but fun and when Homer is bad, well bad things happen. The town of Springfield has a few new additions to it than what we are used to(and that's not to mention the unique style of animation this movie uses), yes the town seems in disarray at first but the story has a way of throwing us a few curve balls here and there, and keeps us glued to the screen from start to finish.<br/><br/>The well known voices are of course in this movie, we even get a cameo that actually is fairly funny as well. Dan Castellaneta as characters such as Homer, Barney and Krusty the Clown is a great voice to use, coupled with Bart's voice done by Nancy Cartwright(plus Ralph, Todd Flanders and Nelson), Julie Kavner as Marge and Yeardley Smith as Lisa, this is one voice cast that is really quite something, oh and they also throw in Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer and Albert Brooks to complete the boiling pot that is The Simpsons Movie.<br/><br/>David Silverman is the director and he does a good job, he seems to be able to work with the script well but also add in a few moves of his own. On that point the script, and it has a seemingly endless list of names to it so I'm just going to say it is all good and fine and really along with the direction forms a nice basis for the humour of this movie. Some will go along and say this is one silly movie and to be fair, it kind of is, but it's silly where you laugh and if anything it's like making a silly thing, but putting brains behind it.<br/><br/>I know people who don't like the Simpsons and maybe even fans too felt this was a bad idea, stick to TV right. Well I think this was a great choice to do, in fact I would even go so far as to say this had brought new life and maybe even new fans to the Simpsons. It all comes down to the originality of the plot(disregarding Stephen King) and the freshness of the jokes, it just feels like this new wave has come over the creators and suddenly the writers are on fire again once more.<br/><br/>I think the movie also points out some good points, of course most of the rational points are shut down by Homer but in any case they show faults in society today. The environment is so close to Lisa's heart and yet the town seem hell bent on destroying it, and then there's the president who's quick picking of his options show's a humorous look at the government and their policies in the world. Of course don't look into it that much, this is just a comedy after all but the satirical take's are pretty nicely done and not that obvious either.<br/><br/>All in all this makes me feel glad, I am a Simpsons fan and I watched this as if I wasn't, but even that couldn't stop me liking this as a film. I think it's the kind of movie you can watch again, yes OK maybe it won't necessarily be one of your all time favourites but in any case you may want to revisit this little yarn in the future, and have a few chuckles also."
"joshuadrake-39480","8","2","3","21 April 2015"," ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a dream come true!
","In the film based on the hit television series created by Matt Groening, Homer must save the world from a catastrophic event that he himself has created. It all begins with Homer, his new pet pig and a leaky sill full of droppings - a combination that triggers a disaster the likes of which Springfield has never experienced. As Marge is outraged by Homer's monumental blunder, a vengeful mob descends on the Simpsons household. The family makes a narrow escape, but is divided by both conflict and location.<br/><br/>As the fates of Springfield and the world hang in the balance, Homer embarks on a personal odyssey of redemption - seeking forgiveness from Marge, the reunion of his splintered family and the salvation of his hometown.<br/><br/>After 25 seasons, 500 and something episodes and a lot of awards and honors (including the Peabody Award, 23 Emmy's (r) and a designation from Time magazine as the best-television show of the twentieth century), The Simpsons was finally made as a feature-length motion picture.<br/><br/>And it's a good thing because it takes a 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen format to fully and completely capture the stupidity of Homer Simpson. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE was a long time coming for me because I was expecting to see my favorite TV show on the big screen, so when I first saw this, I thought it would be a disaster, but after watching this on DVD, I actually enjoyed it.<br/><br/>The animation is really good and the dialog is just incredible, especially the one-liners and the other jokes that the eleven screen writers who worked on this script for the film, really brought flavor, width and good storytelling to the screen. David Silverman directed this film and his style is really amazing.<br/><br/>The acting is just both hilarious and emotionally powerful. This goes to Dan Castellaneta and Julie Kavner as Homer and Marge Simpson, because Homer's famous quotes, ""D'oh!"" and ""Why, you little...!"" is in this film and Marge's dialog written for the film is really amazing.<br/><br/>Nancy Cartwright and Yeardley Smith as Bart and Lisa Simpson are just as funny as they are in the cartoon, but Maggie Simpson only says one line of dialog and that is at the end of the film, when they are watching the ending credits and she takes out her pacifier and says, ""Sequel?"".<br/><br/>Hank Azaria, Pamela Hayden, Tress MacNeille and Harry Shearer plays various characters including Ned Flanders, Milhouse van Houten, Mr. Montogomery Burns, Smithers, Jimbo Jones and other various characters in the film are really entertaining. The only thing that was kind of missing was Mrs. Krapabel, played by the late Marcia Wallace. She has a cameo though at the beginning of the film.<br/><br/>Did I forget to mention the rock band Green Day also has a cameo appearance? They are at the beginning, finishing up the classic theme song composed by Danny Elfman, while the musical score is not composed by Alf Clausen, composer of the TV series, it is composed by Hans Zimmer. The other performance that I did not mention was Albert Brooks as Russ Cargill. He was also very entertaining and quite perfect for the villain.<br/><br/>If there is one thing I can criticize this movie about is Maggie Simpson, because the creators just don't know that this character needs to be able to grow. Stewie Griffin from Family Guy also needs to grow, but having him talk and not allowing to walk and talk is just not enough. I would love to see Maggie talk more.<br/><br/>Overall, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is one of those TV show to film adaptations that I think needs to be seen by everyone. It is a perfect, well-made movie with memorable quotes, great performances and very good action pieces. I love this movie and I love the series, but I would love to see another SIMPSONS MOVIE on the big screen sometime soon. This is one cartoon movie, along with Shrek, Toy Story, SpongeBob SquarePants, Frozen and any other animated movie that I don't gets enough credit. My rating is definitely an 8 out of 10, I know I am almost close to a 10 out of 10, but 8 out of 10 work"
"ofpsmith","9","2","3","13 March 2015"," D'oh!
","Who doesn't love the Simpsons? This show has spoofed every American political and social event that has gone on in the amount of time it's been on. So when they made their first feature length film, they just decided to outdo themselves. Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta) the well known father of the most outrageous middle class family in the United States, has just polluted an entire lake with pig excrement. Typical. As a result EPA director Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks) encourages President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) to put a dome on top of Springfield so they can not be connected in any way with the outside world. Homer and the rest of his family are the only people to escape Springfield and make a life as fugitives. And it's up to Homer, Marge, Bart and Lisa to defeat the evil Cargill and save the day. I honestly can not do this movie justice by writing about so I'll just say, go see this. It is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen."
"CuriosityKilledShawn","4","2","3","20 June 2013"," I have tried very hard to like this movie
","An 18-year wait for...this? The Simpsons movie lets the credits roll at the 77-minute mark and barely delivers anything memorable as the jumbled, unworkable script struggles through flat deviations and repetitive plot points (Homer and Marge having marriage trouble AGAIN...really???). The caustic satire and lampooning of politics that even the worst episodes of the show are laced with are utterly absent here. After 158 drafts by 15 different writers whatever original, worthy ideas they might have had are all carelessly mashed together, neutering all of them in the process.<br/><br/>When Lisa points out that Lake Springfield is dangerously polluted to the point of crisis, Mayor Quimby orders a clean-up. Homer disobeys and dumps a silo of pig feces in it, causing an immediate toxic surge. The EPA seal the town in a giant dome to contain the pollution, proving Grandpa's vision in church to be true. The Simpsons escape the wrath of townsfolk and flee to Alaska for a new life.<br/><br/>Wow! How about THAT for a horribly convoluted plot synopsis. I mean...Alaska? How could it take 18 years to come up with this? The comedic timing is just...wrong. The movie is broken on so many levels, it feels nothing like the TV show. It's such a weird, dissatisfying experience. The scope widescreen composition is very good however, and Hans Zimmer provides a truly wonderful score which is far better than his other more popular efforts in recent years.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is not something I can watch again and again, it lacks the vital spark of the show while at the same time feeling like a 3-episode arc. Groening says it will be a very long time before we see a sequel but they really to spend that time coming up with something great? How about The Simpsons Xmas Movie? Or a 3-hour Bartman mini-series? The possibilities are endless, and this movie squanders the immense Simpsons universe on a rotten script."
"japamo","8","2","3","15 July 2011"," Cool Simpsons Universe Takes Movies in its Stride
","With ""The Simpsons"", we don't have just a mere earthly empire, we have a universe. ""The Simpsons"" reputation for raucous, insouciant, yet human and insightful social commentary has been indelibly established. Only a global criminal scandal along the lines of Rupert Murdock's ""News of the World"", or a catastrophic flop could annihilate this universe. Therefore, I don't think there was excessive ""flop"" sweat and pressure among the ""The Simpsons Movie"" (hereafter TSM) animators, writers, producers, and directors to generate a flawless movie. Oh, I'm sure they cared enough to generate at least a respectable movie. But they also weren't primed to jump off any skyscrapers if TSM didn't win any Academy Awards. The Simpsons universe is cool - almost Bugs Bunny cool. But it also isn't afraid to make fun of itself as well as everything else (hence the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" cartoon and Homer's subsequent dismissal of people watching something they can get for free). The Simpsons Universe survives because it does not take itself TOO seriously -- just seriously enough.<br/><br/>Now, did the ""TSM"" creators manage to make a cool, respectable movie? I think they did, and rather more than respectable. Is TSM essentially any extended ""Simpsons"" TV episode? I think so. But that's good, because I have always considered even the most mediocre ""Simpsons"" episodes (at least the ones I've seen) to be above-average mini-cinematic events, densely packed with detailed characters and story lines. TSM merely allows more time and breathing room to present its variation of ""Homer screws up, then has to save the day"". It would be redundant to spell out the plot here. Other posters have already done that. Suffice it to say that a lot of the trademark ""Simpsons"" TV characteristics appear in the movie.<br/><br/>For example, we have the way a ""Simpsons"" plot never directly emerges, but has to be backed into. How can you predict that Homer's adoption of a pig initially destined for Krusty Burger slaughter would set in motion an environmental disaster, a federal quarantine, and even imminent destruction? As a second example, we witness the impulsive behavior of a 239-pound id as Homer bonds with a pig, dumps pig feces into Springfield lake even after it's protected from pollution, and prompts the whole town to exile him and his family as a result. As a third example, we see the deeply buried but true affection the Simpson family members have for each other, even at their worst and most despairing. In Alaska, Marge takes the kids and leaves Homer, perhaps permanently, unless he learns to care for others.<br/><br/>Within the confines of a movie, even the Simpsons universe can't give you everything. It can't showcase every Springfield citizen in detail for example (you'll have to wait for sequels). The movie was correct to focus on the Simpson family itself and their individual problems, to remind both Simpson fans and newcomers of the real reason why many people adore these crazy people. It goes beyond the jokes, the satire, and the pratfalls (and TSM has more than its share). Again, even when things seem lost, the Simpsons (especially Homer) pull together and acquit themselves well. And they're so cool when they do! TSM does not break new ground, or try to be profound. It would have been terribly wrong to do so. TSM had two simultaneous, interconnected goals: 1) preserve the ""Simpsons"" mythos for true believers and 2) explain to newcomers why the ""Simpsons"" are so wonderfully enduring. I think it succeeds on both accounts. TSM did what it had to do. And that's just fine!"

","When talking about ""The Simpsons"" you know there will be people running to 2 different sides. Some of them loved the show, now hate it and some of them love the show, period. And there are of course, those who never enjoyed it.<br/><br/>I've always enjoyed ""The Simpsons"". Granted I've enjoyed the first few seasons a lot more (even though it seems to be going back to its roots now), but still enjoy the new material. The movie could be considered a mix between old and new Simpsons, and for me, the only place it fails is at not giving the side characters more screen time.<br/><br/>Other than that, the movie is hilarious from start to finish, even if some of the jokes are sketchy at best, most of them succeed at at least making you smile, and others at making you laugh of loud. The plot is very crazy and nonsensical, but hey, it's a cartoon, as long as it is entertaining - which it is - it works!<br/><br/>The animation is top notch, very fluid, with some 3D elements thrown in (thankfully not too many). The voice actors did an excellent job, as usual. Music is good, but didn't stand out too much, it did it's job (except ""Spider Pig"", which is awesome!). Of course, there's Green Day in it, but I don't enjoy them (not my cup of tea to be honest).<br/><br/>It's a great fun, hilarious and very entertaining movie that should be watched by people who enjoy the Simpsons. Especially the ""newer"" seasons, I can see people who don't like the new seasons hating this movie.<br/><br/>9 out of 10."

Unfortunately, with what seems like centuries of development time, such a closely guarded production, a cast of thousands of characters, and such a multitude of scribes, TSM should have been a monumental masterwork. What it feels like is one of the just-OK episodes of the series, playing out in 2.40:1 widescreen and with an orchestral score.<br/><br/>The story could easily be compressed into an episode if some unimportant things could be cut. The problem is, the movie is 87 minutes long. Are you kidding me?! After this long, I wanted The Return of the Freakin' King!

"djavh","7","2","3","5 September 2007"," A mirror of several latest seasons of TV show
","A lot of long term TV shows have the same problem. Shows about ordinary family or people that live their simple lives in little cities are very simple and all situations in screen can be recognized from everyday life. Shows such as ""South Park"" or ""The Simpsons"" were prime at their first seasons. Plots were simple, characters solved problems in their own towns, with their neighbours and friends.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, later such shows become cardboard and soulless. Stories are fantastic, new and onetime characters appears in every episode and you can feel a boredom, because these shows are trying to report every pulpy sensation witch are sicken because it were in every newspaper and in all news a long time ago.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" has the same problem. The plot is too complicated and unreal. I don't know what to say more, because it has same problems as the last eight or seasons of TV show. The jokes are not bad, but tired and familiar from the show. The only great and very funny jokes are all about Homer. His cogitations, ideas and world-view are inexhaustible source of killing jokes and phrases. Homer is the funniest guy in the movie, but other characters are imperceptible.<br/><br/>So, in conclusion: the biggest weakness in this film is a cardboard story. The movie is still good, but if creators of show would create the Simpsons movie, let's say, ten years ago, I think, that movie would be at top 250 now.<br/><br/>Sorry about my English."
"Brothepro","6","2","3","26 August 2007"," About time!
","Since the show began back in 1989 it has been a phenomenal success launching itself to become one of the shows to watch in the 90s. Since then it took a dramatic dip for the worse with good episodes coming in few and far between. The movie was rumoured for ages since the show was at it's prime and finally these rumours have come true as it was confirmed in the summer of 2006 to be released in July/August the following year. So would it live up to the standard of the old episodes providing classics each and every week or would it fail and flop miserably like the newer episodes? It's a bit hit and miss I must say as it feels like a new episode but extended hugely with some old style jokes gone a tiny bit ruder than usual. For example when Bart skateboards down Springfield naked is very funny and Homer using film and book character names for his pet pig. However this happens early on the film where this was a lot better than the average expectations given by critics. From then on in the plot seems to fell like a new episode, past its prime, which is stupid. Long story short The Simpsons get expelled from Springfield as the town gets quarantined after Homer ultra-pollutes the town. Typical new Simpsons.<br/><br/>Yet unlike a fresh episode of the series it seems funnier which gives an edge over the sceptics opinion in it being too silly. Yes it is silly but it ain't to the point of extreme, like the episodes where it based itself on bible stories or something crap like that. Unfortunately, for hardcore fans of the show characters like Moe, Mr. Burns or Apu seem to only have a part worth approximately a few seconds which is bad, because these characters seem like ordinary people except they are portrayed to be funny which is not like the Simpsons family who are different people which sometimes can be less hilarious. What is worse is that the characters added to the movie like that EPA guy who wants to destroy Springfield is unfunny.<br/><br/>Overall there are some good parts and there are some bad parts to this film but nonetheless it is a good animated comedy, not to the standards of the classics but far better than the new episodes. Expect this film not to get the best animated film at the Oscars as it isn't good enough."

The Simpsons writers have always been very clever and from what I had read, this was to be a back to basics format of high content wit. Maybe I am being too critical but once the hype dies down not likely I think. A very Luke warm affair unfortunately. Laughs were continuous throughout the movie as you would expect from an over-hyped crowd including myself. It seems that the creativity levels have been drained with the Simpsons franchise. Whilst I watch new episodes on TV they are a little hit and miss. I really felt the movie was a bloated version of this.

","I thought the movie was good. It was funny when homer choked bart all the time and when homer took the bomb with him on the motorcycle and drove all the way to the top of the dome and saved Springfield, but also emotional when Marge left Homer alone on Antarctica and Homer watched the video Marge had made. The animation was great. I think the movie can be watched by all ages and both boys and girls can watch it, but i think mostly boys would like it. Overall just a great and funny movie."

","I think the movie was great, it has a lot of action in it, and it never got boring.
the characters never got boring, even the baby who could´nt talk did not get boring. They went into details, but not so much that it could get boring. There was always something going on, even in the first minute of the movie. The characters kept in character, homer was funny in a weird way as always, and so on. I Think it was good that the view got on all on the characters so that it did´nt have the same segment throughout the movie."
"datautisticgamer-74853","9","1","1","3 December 2017"," Among the funniest movies I have ever seen, but strong regardless
","Since today was rather dull, I decided that I should view another movie in my trove to critique. I was somewhat conflicted before I came to a settlement on this. I have seen this movie ever since its premiere on home video, and it's even better than I've always remembered it. Allow me to explain myself.<br/><br/>The story essentially feels like a compilation of 3 Simpsons episodes, but it was structured differently than the TV show in order to make a film plot. As especially notable in its pacing, this works especially to its advantage, though the humor still very strongly delivers. There were many chuckles that came out of me during my viewing and even a few LOLs. One thing I was surprised about was that the slapstick was actually really funny, if familiar coming off a TV show that at that point had existed for 18 years. It has great morals about avoiding selfishness, which resonates today in a society that has become vulnerable to warping by such selfish people. Of course, I'm not going any further because... you know... Anyway, the story does offer some familiarity, but should serve as a tutorial for how to structure film versions of TV shows, much like South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut. The animation is also accustomed coming off its parent show, just with a higher budget to differentiate itself. It actually looks pretty brilliant in movie form, as the style used for The Simpsons almost always hits the intended sight gags. Being just a glorified TV episode, though, the animation does have some limitations in effects, especially considering the advancements made to CGI by 2007, but it's probably a nitpick; the animation in a film doesn't necessarily need to be sickly sweet eye candy to be fine. If you are accustomed to The Simpsons, you will know the characters, in which case the returning cast would probably become slightly less interesting. There are plenty of new characters, though, namely the fascinating villain of Russ Cargill. Cargill himself demonstrates the selfishness, as in his overreaches of power, that particularly make the morals Homer learns strong. Beyond that, it might be easy for most of you to identify with the characters, as they are written here in a way that would inform of their traits to newcomers. Oh, yeah, and the Spider-Man parody makes for one cool song. Beyond that, don't remember this film for its music; it isn't a musical, but the songs aren't that pointless depending on the scene. Once again, I have to be nitpicking here...<br/><br/>Whether you know The Simpsons or not, I can almost guarantee that this film will lighten your day. If you aren't a fan of The Simpsons, you might enjoy it for its new characters and ideas, but even then, I have one thing to say. I never was a fan of The Simpsons to begin with for the simple reason that I almost never watched it. Yet, this film managed to entertain me to an end I cannot describe. What does this mean? It means, rhetorically speaking again, that as foreign to the source material you might be, this is not a film to look over. I might even place this, if just slightly, above Ratatouille as the best mainstream animated movie of 2007. It's that great, and I would overall recommend this movie to animation fans."

","'THE SIMPSONS MOVIE' - 2007<br/><br/>Directed by David Silverman{Directorial Debut}<br/><br/>Starring Dan Castellaneta{The Pursuit of Happiness; The Cat in the Hat}, Nancy Cartwright{The Little Mermaid; Rugrats Go Wild} and Julie Kavner{Doctor Dolitle; Click}.<br/><br/>Plot Overview: After Springfield becomes the most polluted city in the USA, government employee Russ Cargill(Albert Brooks{Finding Nemo; Lost in America}) decided to place a large dome around Springfield, trapping the inhabitants. When the townsfolk uncover that it was Homer(Dan Castellaneta) who sentenced them to this fate, Homer and co must flee Springfield and try to evade the government.<br/><br/>It would probably be fitting for me to voice my thoughts on the show before I review this film. I don't mind the show. I think that I respect it more than I like it. It did a lot to Television, namely animated shows so I highly commend it for what it contributed to entertainment. But as a show, I think it's fine. And as a whole, I think this movie is fine also. I liked it. I don't think it even holds a candle to South Park BL&U(if comparisons are gonna annoy you then you may wish to turn back now) but it succeeds as a family friendly piece of entertainment. Which is what The Simpsons has always been.<br/><br/>What things did I like about this movie, for a start. Similar to the TV show, the voice acting is great. Dan Castellaneta does a great job at voicing all his roles, particularly Homer and Grandpa. Nancy Cartwright voiced my favourite character from the show, Bart, and does it excellently. She also voiced a couple other characters but Bart is her main piece of meat to play with. Julie Kavner was great at voicing Marge as well as others. I thought that every voice actor did a good job and provided a decent amount of range for all the characters. <br/><br/>Another thing that I can praise highly is the animation and cinematography. Having a bigger budget(I presume) would definitely give them greater freedom to make the animation stand out and they certainly did that. 'The Simpsons Movie' looks great from an animation standpoint, and even the cinematography/editing are great too. It is a very nice looking movie.<br/><br/>And now there is something that may sound controversial but hear me out. I don't find The Simpsons funny. It's never been my style of comedy. It's fine for what it is but I really don't think it's this titan of comedic genius that many people claim it as. It's fine. That's were it begins and ends for me. It is fine. That is also a similar opinion to the comedy in this movie. I think the longer run time probably helped because there was more time to pack in jokes and gags, and quite a few of them did hit for me. Few of the jokes definitively FAILED but by the same merit virtually none made me laugh out loud. I smiled consistently and once or twice elicited a mild chuckle but there wasn't really a point that I fully lost control and laughed.<br/><br/>And now for some issues! Yay! I cannot stand their attempt at satire. Similarly to how BL&U tried to satirise censorship and people's backwards opinion on what is and isn't allowed, The Simpsons Movie tries to satirise the US government's inability to do anything remotely useful. I really don't see the point in doing this. Maybe a simple moral or two here or there but basing the ENTIRE plot of the movie on this intricate attempt at a 'BRILLIANT!' satire just didn't work. BL&U did this excellently, but then again that was what South Park was known for. Mocking culture, religion, law and politics. The Simpsons has always been, as far as I know, a basic family show that is fun to watch, so their dry attempt at getting into the 'greater meaning' game was rather pointless and stupid, in my honest opinion.<br/><br/>I was also annoyed at certain things to do with charters. Firstly, all the 'good' non-main characters were COMPLETELY sidelined. Flanders barely has a role, Krusty doesn't, Ralph Wiggum doesn't, Willie doesn't, Millhouse doesn't, Mr Burns doesn't. Instead, we get a very dull and uninteresting antagonist, and an Irish twerp. Colin was a very uninteresting love interest for Lisa and I seriously do not understand what role he actually played in this movie. And then there is the villain; he was SUCH a disappointment. He wasn't funny, he wasn't smart; his one and only role was to satirise the government, and even then he failed miserably. The GOOD characters we all know and love should have remained, and in doing so drop the utterly ridiculous satire of the government. I really like the dome idea but maybe have Mr Burns or someone do it and make him go FULL evil. That'd be funny, or even do a mild mannered character and make them snap. That'd be funny. But no. We get a very boring story about how the government is evil and useless(I'm not disagreeing with that statement but it didn't need to be in The Simpsons).<br/><br/>As a whole, I do like this movie. It's fun and entertaining to an extent but it does lack a solid villain and plot, as well as some of the best characters in the show. But, if you do like the show, I can recommend it. A fair percent of the jokes hit and it's by now means a chore to sit through. But the flaws do really stand out, for me at least. Despite this, I recommend this film. I'll rate 'The Simpsons Movie' 7 'Spiderpigs' out of 10!"

","Homer, due to his ""high"" level of intellect, pollutes Springfield's lake with a silo full of crap and as a result, the government of USA isolates the entire city in a giant glass dome. An angry mob chases him and his family but they miraculously escape, going straight to Alaska to start a new life. All seems fine but when they realize that Springfield is going to be ""transformed"" into a new Grand Canyon, they decide that something must be done. From there, a real struggle begins, both morally and physically. Is Homer going to help his family defeat the government or Springfield is going to be eradicated from the face of the earth? A great Simpsons movie filled with its typical humor and loads of action which is really enjoyable. The plot could have been more complex and some scenes could have been a little more thought but overall it's a good movie!"
"areatw","8","1","1","23 July 2017"," Seamless transition to the big screen
","Many 'Simpsons' fans, myself included, were fearful that the world's most popular TV show would fail to live up to expectation when transitioning to the big screen. It almost felt inevitable that 'The Simpsons Movie' would disappoint, and so when the initial reactions to the film were overwhelmingly positive it was a huge relief.<br/><br/>'The Simpsons Movie' is every bit as funny as the TV show. The transition from small to big screen is seamless and everything that people loved about the show was successfully retained in the movie. The plot far exceeded my expectations and the jokes come thick and fast with many laugh out loud moments. Fans of the show needn't worry - it's hilarious."

","When I saw this in theatres...I hated it. The Simpsons premiered on Fox a week before I was born. I grew up with this show. I had known for a long time that they were working on a movie and I was so looking forward to it. It was never a bad movie - it just wasn't what I expected it to be and I was upset by that at the time. This is the first time watching it all the way through again since its debut...and I have to say it's grown on me. I can appreciate everything it's trying to do much more now. Don't let sentimentality or unrealistic expectations sully your memory of this movie. Give it another chance. Very little is as great as Seasons 1-9 of Simpsons, but this sure comes close. Here's hoping they have one more like this in them!"

","(75%) I've loved almost every minute (and repeated minute) of the Simpsons for years now, and probably always will. It's one of the very few TV shows that I actually regularly watch. A truly great, very clever, and massively funny show. This really is just a feature length episode made at a time when the show was becoming more hit and miss with its comedy, but it's still filled with laughs, and is good fun to watch. And while it's cinematic enough for the big screen, yet still very much the Simpsons we have grown so accustomed to seeing on the small screen. Fans have probably seen this a million times by now, but anyone who hasn't for some reason should really give it a chance."
"hayashimegumi","8","1","1","5 June 2014"," If you needed a silly funny movie to watch, this could be the film you're looking for!
","The main Simpson family consists of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie and they reside in the fictional town of Springfield. Each of them have their own unique characteristics but in addition to Homer's epic level of intelligence, the family is largely, helplessly dysfunctional (which is kind of sad) but that's their life and that is, funny. <br/><br/>This film is indeed hilarious, there are lots of American humor, lots of sarcastic moments and lots of references to films like those of Disney, Titanic, Harry Potter, etc., in this film but those might be confusing to those who are new to the TV series too. However, The Simpsons fans, who are really fond of the family members will like this! It's the only film they have so far and people who like the typical adult American sitcoms would also enjoy this. <br/><br/>To be honest, this film is not easy to justify as it does feels like several episodes merged into one instead of one great film. Some people may find this film as one of the best animated feature film but this is truly no justice for a successful franchise with lots of potentials. Still, at the end of the film, it is strangely fun and fulfilling. Love the themes, which are mostly about family, religion and environment. If you needed a silly funny movie to watch, this could be the film you're looking for!<br/><br/>PS. This film is great for preaching about environmental."
"kalletheman","8","1","1","24 November 2013"," a show where everyone can find themselves
","If I had to pick up a series to bring to a deserted island the 24 seasons of Simpsons would be a easy pick. <br/><br/>The show is about a dysfunctional family where almost everything is represented. A not so bright alcoholic husband, a caring mother with OCD, a vegetarian liberal daughter, a criminally challenge bad boy son, a senile and disliked grandfather, a revolutionary and secret agent grandmother, pets and a wide variety of people in a fake town in America.<br/><br/>Unlike most shows Simpsons holds a high level overall and even gotten sharper and better in later seasons. They do a great job keeping up with current affairs and what is going on in the world, trying to shed some light on the different stances one could take via their very diverse town.<br/><br/>The voice actors are amazing as well, sadly they are fairly old and the future of the show is uncertain. Will they replace Homer, how will they replace him and can they even do it?"
"jakeb3-111-928264","Null","1","1","20 July 2011"," A film which you must watch
","The Simpsons Movie is certainly one to watch. <br/><br/>The animations of the characters including Homer and Marge, and the setting including Springfield and Alaska are at a high quality. When I was at the cinema in 2007, I was astounded by their improvements on the graphics compared to their television series. The team should be proud of themselves. <br/><br/>Aside from the animation, there was a lot of comedy. One of the man highlights for me is the relationship between Homer and his family. There is no doubt that the writers put in such an excellent job conducting their 'master-piece' and they should be commended. The plot-line helped build up the comedy value which a family film like The Simpsons needs. If you do not believe me, see for yourself because this film is the one to watch. <br/><br/>It is always hard to find a negative a film like The Simpsons. However, if one aspect needed improving it would have to be the opening as it slightly lacked substance. Homer nevertheless saved the day with his joke to the audience. <br/><br/>As Maggie at the end suggests, this film does need a sequel. If you are a fan of The Simpsons, like me, you will be at the edge of your seats waiting for it to come out."

I would like to see a sequel based around Sideshow Bob though. <br/><br/>Overall a great film that despite not meeting some fans high standards is much much funnier than some of the tripe that gets passed off as comedy."

","The toughest thing about making a movie based on ""The Simspons"" is that the filmmakers would have to come up with something that will ultimately surprise fans of the series and also be a hit with non-fans. ""The Simpsons Movie"" may have had split opinions upon release and to this day, but as an animated film, it succeeds.<br/><br/>I'm not a big fan of ""The Simpsons"", I'll watch the show once and a while, and it is one of the finest animated shows out there. Many Simpsons fans love the movie, and many Simpsons fans absolutely hate it. For me, not being a big Simpsons fan, I thought it was good as an animated film on its own. For one thing, the film tried very hard to revive traditional animations, an art form that is sadly dying and trying to come back. Traditional animation has been confined to television over the past few years, while computer animated extravaganzas get released theatrically. (This goes for all the non-Pixar animated films that come and go)<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" opens with a bang. The Itchy and Scratchy cartoon and the movie theater joke at the beginning set the tone of the film. We get a blown-up version of the show's opening and then Green Day performing the theme song. (Not a fan of Green Day)<br/><br/>Springfield has been facing many issues with pollution, a satire of what was going on back in 2006 and 2007 and what is going on now. In years from now, this will probably be dated, unfortunately, but at the time and even now, it's pretty funny. It advances the plot that tries very hard to be more than just a 90-minute episode of ""The Simpsons"", and I think it succeeds fairly well.<br/><br/>So the first twenty minutes is basically the usual antics. Homer and Bart have a dare contest, which leads to Bart skateboarding naked to Krusty Burger. Lisa falls in love with an Irish boy named Colin (Who didn't have much purpose in the story, unfortunately), Marge pieces together what Grandpa said in church, which later ties into the story. Bart then starts to feel neglected by Homer and turns to Flanders. Homer starts showing attention to a pig that nearly gets killed at the Krusty Burger. Pretty soon, Homer is obsessed with the pig, naming him ""Spider-Pig"" and ""Harry Plopper"". (Of course, since those series' then-new installments came out that year) Unfortunately, Homer puts the pigs' waste (and his) in Springfield Lake, which was packed into a makeshift silo. Springfield Lake has now become hazardous. A dome is put over Springfield by the head of the EPA, Russ Cargill, who turns out to be the film's villain.<br/><br/>Once the news reveals that Homer dumped the silo into the lake, an angry mob drives the family (with the exception of Grandpa) out of Springfield. From there, they live in a new life in Alaska. The second act begins, but unfortunately, it isn't as well structured as the first act.<br/><br/>The second act shows that a lot of content was deleted. I am well aware that there was enough content to make ""two more films"", so they had to cut it down to make a consistent 87-minute film. 87 minutes is a bit too short, I think a 100-110 minute runtime would've been better with a slightly longer second act. I felt the film was shorter by the time the third act was reached, as it breezed through the second act. The first act was quick, but the second act was too quick despite the script and the story.<br/><br/>Thus I felt the middle of the film was a bit forced. The third act is perfectly paced. The climax is a thrill and the film got a bit epic in scope towards the end. Once all ends happily, then it feels like a regular non-epic film. While its structure was still good, the very fast second act could've been improved along with a few other things.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" is a very funny film, without a doubt. The jokes are well-timed, and since the series gets past the TV censors and onto the big screen, dirtier jokes were pushed for this film. In terms of the animation, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is nice to look at. The computer animated effects are subtle and the animation looks a little bit more polished than the show. It has the feel of an animated film, rather than a blown-up TV episode. Some people felt that way about this film, I did not.<br/><br/>As an animated film, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a fast, funny and often exciting film that can appeal to non-fans of the show. As a ""Simpsons"" movie, it'll either please fans or disappoint them. Depends on what kind of fans they are. The U.S. box office intake might prove this. A well-made animated film. As a ""Simspons"" movie, it isn't the greatest. They did what they could do, and I thought they did pretty good.<br/><br/>A 8.5 out of 10."

","I stopped watching ""The Simpsons"" series many years ago; admittedly that was mostly due to constant repeats So when I came to watch this I'd forgotten just how funny the show can be. I don't usually laugh out loud when watching a film on my own but I did several times during this one.<br/><br/>The pollution in Lake Springfield has got so bad that people have finally listened to Lisa and taken measures to prevent people dumping anything there... of course somebody ignores the new rules and that somebody is Homer Simpson; he dumps a huge silo of pig manure into the water which makes the pollution so bad that the Federal government decides to take action, and the action the take is to enclose the town in a huge glass dome. With the angry mob closing in on them they managed to find a way to get out of the dome and flee to Alaska while civilisation in Springfield collapses to such an extent that the government decides to just blow up the whole town and everybody in it. Marge doesn't like the sound of that so insists the family return to save their home town although homer is less keen.<br/><br/>While the main story isn't the best imaginable it serves to provide many opportunities for laugh out loud moments, highlights included Bart's naked skateboarding, Homer and his pet pig and his encounter with an Inuit shaman. For a series well known for having celebrity guest stars it managed to keep these to a minimum which I think was wise, too many animations these days are packed with famous actors who aren't necessarily great voice actors whereas The Simpsons uses people who are proper voice actors."

","Simpson the movie is a very good movie; it's about the Simpsons family who lives in Springfield. I like the movie and think its funny. The movie is about the Simpsons and their hometown Springfield, one day, the town recognized that the cities lake is poisoned whit garbage and toxic waste. The city decides to block of the lake, but Homer Simpson don't care and dumps a septic tank with waste from his pig, the whole town goes mad. At the same time, USA decides to close in Springfield in a huge dome with a little hole at the top, so the toxic wont spread. Maggie, the youngest kid in the family, sits and plays in her sandbox and suddenly, she's on the other side of the dome, the family is chased by the whole town because of Homer and they have to hide, so the family runs to Alaska.<br/><br/>My opinion is that the movie is good, there's happening things time after time and that's the best with it, I don't think it should happened things all the time because a movie needs to slow down to be good, otherwise maybe the one who watches the movie goes hyper and can't focus on the movie. So I think it's good to have parts in the movie when it's calm. I also like that they did a movie, so it not only elementary with the TV program, which is also very good."

I still don't get Spiderpig and it's appeal - just stupid, as was 'Boob Lady' - completely pointless character.<br/><br/>This aside, the movie is satisfying. I honestly think I went into the cinema with pure hatred in my eyes, I expected it to be bad. Now two years later I'm a bit less biased and, well, I haven't watched The Simpsons in so long that it was like revisiting old friends.<br/><br/>The narrative is pretty good, despite the brain-dead distractions of Spiderpig and Boob Lady. I really feel that Russ Cargill should have been Scorpio. I know, I know...Scorpio was a one-off parody villain who wouldn't have a reason to harm Homer and Springfield.

","We all know that 'The Simpsons' is a very successful TV show and it's been around for quite a while (since 1989 I think, presumably) And after over 400 episodes, what are the makers of the show going to do next? They make a Simpsons Movie! I would say I like The Simpsons. I've seen a couple of episodes and thought they were really funny and entertaining. But what about the movie? Well, for starters, it's obviously had that fun factor. This presumably is a lead up to the jokes/gags which is what makes the fun. They're were some really funny gags in this like Bart's nude skateboard to the Krusty Burger. That was classic. However, in some, I felt that the film makers just wanted to make it really funny, that they ended up not delivering. All in all the entertainment was good. Another thing that leaps into mind is the action and adventure. You wouldn't find that in a normal Simpsons episode but to see it in this movie, is great! It got quite exciting in some parts, particularly at the end, where Homer tries to save Springfield. Also, I loved the fact that Homer and his family run away to Alaska because they're not wanted in Springfield. The characters were as funny as usual, but the most funniest one was that Spiderpig (aka Harry Plopper!) I actually found the Spiderpig song to be really funny.<br/><br/>Overall, I would say The Simpsons Movie is what we all could have hoped for. It certainly had the fun Homer factor! It may not be really good, but hey, you wanted entertainment - you got entertainment!"

When I do catch it, I rarely know how old a rerun I am seeing, so I was not up on the supposed steep decline in quality that the show has taken in the past few years.<br/><br/>There a lot of ways it would be possible to criticise The Simpsons Movie: maybe there isn't enough plot for a full film, what there is is wildly outlandish, subplots are abandoned, it doesn't distinguish itself enough from a long episode of the TV series, or its message seems kind of mixed-up. However, it redeems itself in the best way a comedy film can: by being very funny all the way through. The characters of The Simpsons remain true to their TV selves, there's a constant supply of good jokes (some of which had me laughing obnoxiously loudly), and there's even a kind of character arc. I wouldn't dare ask for more.<br/><br/>I do wonder whether Dr Nick stays dead in future TV episodes."

We also see Colin,  Lisa's Irish boyfriend who shares her desire to stop pollution  the persistent head of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Tom Hanks. Staying true to the ridicule of the television series it explores more emotional and serious issues.

Despite being up against Transformers, Bourne Ultimatum and Harry Potter the order of the phoenix, the Simpsons Movie still grossed millions all over the globe thanks to its massive fan base and the show itself has now become legendary.<br/><br/>The Simpsons has become bigger than any other TV show and has been showing now for almost 20 years and with all the DVDs, specials and a collection of merchandise that will never end, a film was inevitable.<br/><br/>Sadly the show has hit a slump these last 5 or so years with unfunny parodies of celebrities, predictable slapstick humour and a meaningless narrative.<br/><br/>This picture uses the TV show's recent trends to get its entertainment across. There is plenty of obvious humour such as an Arnold Schwarzenegger President, Lisa's love life and a typical and frankly boring villain.<br/><br/>What is good however is Matt Groening's depiction of real life. He uses real life issues and puts a good spin around them such as advertisement, nudity and a collection of others in the end credits.<br/><br/>Homer's opening line is typical mocking of film life.<br/><br/>Though this film's ultimate goal is to entertain, it is a feel good hour and a half joy ride with occasional moments of old classic Simpsons but majorly lacking a cutting edge style to surprise and shock.<br/><br/>This feels like a stretched episode which you don't get for free. The plot feels ordinary in every sense and the only difference from a normal episode is that these jokes about films make it different from normal sofa views.<br/><br/>If you are currently enjoying current series then you will not be disappointed but if you remember the days when the Simpsons really entertained through a sophisticated story, unsurprising hilarity and a group of real life characters we could all relate to then I am sorry to say this film doesn't have anything to bring that back.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is moderately enjoyable at times, but always predictable with an occasional film joke that was only funny in the cinema."

","I have never watched the show (not a big fan of TV) but was curious to watch the movie, just to know what its really like. It might be the low expectation or more because of the good stuff in the movie itself that I liked it. Continuing with the animated movies' world's theme of environmental message, this one also has one and they are well mixed with the jokes from every character in the movie. That was the best thing about this movie that every character had added to the humor, it wasn't like you wait for a particular character to show up to make you laughin a word it was very funny.and I am gona start watching the show also"

","First I must make it clear that I'm a huge Simpsons and Futurama fan.<br/><br/>When it comes to the Simpsons episodes, I will make it clear that they are the product of genius's.<br/><br/>So, it was logical that I believed Simpsons the movie would be just as great, but I was wrong. The idea with the episodes is that they are only around 22 minutes long. During that time, you probably laugh several times, seen some kind of parody, and found out that the beginning plot had actually nothing to do with the ending. GOD I just love Simpsons. Therefor, you see that most stuff happening in this movie, have something to do with the plot. I will admit that this movie had some fun stuff in it, but compared to the episodes where you laugh several times during 22 minutes, while this movie is 87 minutes, I believe you get more fun by watching 4 episodes instead."
"sme_no_densetsu","7","1","1","14 October 2008"," Not grade 'A' Simpsons but still a decent flick
","I've been a Simpsons fan since at least the second season but the announcement of the long-rumoured movie didn't excite me much given that the glory years of the show are long gone. Nevertheless, I still expected something special from the team behind the big screen version.<br/><br/>The movie isn't bad but it's nowhere near as good as it could have been. For one thing, I can think of many, many episodes with a much better story than this. After close to twenty years it must be difficult to come up with something new, though, so I guess the so-so story isn't that surprising. However, I am surprised that there was no musical number, particularly since the TV show is known for several memorable ones.<br/><br/>I can't really say that the big screen (and big budget) was used to much advantage, either. Sure, there were a few nifty visuals and more detail than usual but the possibilities were endless. The length is even a bit on the short side at 87 minutes. This feels more like a standard episode padded for time and given a spit-shine rather than a story written specifically for the screen.<br/><br/>The voice acting is top-notch, as always, but chances are that some of your favourite characters are featured very briefly or not at all. Having the Simpsons leave Springfield (temporarily) didn't exactly help matters there. Also, I have to note that Albert Brooks's immense talents were unfortunately wasted on a thoroughly uninteresting character. The Tom Hanks cameo was a nice touch, though.<br/><br/>In conclusion, enjoy this film for what it is but don't expect something that's on par with the best that The Simpsons has to offer. Stick with ""South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut"" if you're craving a feature length animated comedy."

","A lot of the stuff was familiar but still funny. The pig story reminded me of the lobster. The best thing about the movie was how they really made it cinematic and opened the town up and really made it look good. I liked the Disney interlude when all the animals come in and undress Marge and Homer. When Grandpa yells ""I'm part of the mob!"" was funny. The Green Day scene was really funny-sinking like the Titanic while playing violins. Albert Brooks gave one of his trademark great voice performances and the his conversations with the President among the highlights of the movie. Julie Kavner really did some of her best work ever as the voice of Marge. Grade A-"
"blippster","8","1","1","7 August 2008"," Tremendously Funny!
","This, for me, was one of the highlight movies of 2007. If your reason for not seeing it is 'The Simpsons sucks these days', then I urge you to give it a shot. It is much much better than the most recent episodes of the show, while admittedly not as good as the 'classic' episodes from about seasons 2-10.<br/><br/>The characters are all there, in full yellow, as funny and witty as ever they were. The jokes are certainly the best I've seen in a while, and had me laughing long after they had been said. In the true tradition of the show, there are special guest appearances, from Tom Hanks and the members of Green Day.<br/><br/>But what I feel makes this especially good, is that it feels like a movie, not an elongated episode. The story is allowed to have more depth than if it were told in just one episode. The animation is as good as it has always been, and from a technical perspective, the movie is very sound.<br/><br/>There will be a few surprises along the way, especially during Bart's skateboarding scene (people who have seen it will know what I'm talking about), and, as with every episode, there are a few new characters, notably Russ Cargill and President Schwarzenegger.<br/><br/>Truly, this is worth seeing for any Simpsons fan 8/10"
"JimmyZappa","6","1","1","4 August 2008"," Family Guy The Movie - Special Yellow Edition
","I've been waiting for a Simpsons movie since I was a kid. I gave up hope and went on with my life as I got older, but the fans of old and new were still waiting for that holy grail to suddenly appear.<br/><br/>It finally came many years later. And, not surprisingly, i've never been so disappointed. I read one review state that this wasn't an ""extended episode"" compared to South Park: BLAU and Beavis and Butthead Do America. That person could never been more wrong. While the Simpsons had its moments, taking advantage of what it could accomplish on the big screen that the little screen couldn't handle (fancy CG effects, akin to Futurama) it failed to do the little things. And those little things pile up and MAKE the movie.<br/><br/>Beavis and Butthead had an epic journey that spanned some of America. What we got in the Simpsons was a trip to Alaska (probably written in to showcase how pretty the movie can look) and...yeah, that's pretty much it. I thought it was kind of pointless. The journey in Beavis and Butthead actually had a point and was consistent with it. Simpsons had everything tacked in just cause it wanted to be funny. Like they had a bunch of good ideas for jokes and they just picked the best ones, then based a story around it.<br/><br/>South Park was more epic. It made use of its R rating by going BEYOND the show and even went as far to include musical numbers. Creators Matt Stone and Trey Parker went on to state they wanted to make a movie and do some of the things they couldn't do for television. And they did just that. Simpsons, of course, didn't hit that mark. It was really a long modern Simpsons episode with Futurama-esquire CG riddled here and there to give the impression it was bigger and better than a normal TV episode. Everything else was styled in the same way as the TV show, there wasn't much to clearly make it look cinematic. Even the straight to DVD Furturama movie made up for lack of cinematic presentation with a mindblowingly good (and well thought out) story.<br/><br/>One of the biggest faults of this movie was the fact that it relied too heavily on Family Guy humor. Jokes that are too random and is not consistent to the story (or what little story it has). This has been going on for a few years since the Family Guy fad was in its peak. Even before, it was already steadily going downhill. Unfortunately, that carried over to this movie. Some of the jokes, especially involving a certain Pig and Maggie, fall way flat. No one in my theater was laughing. Some kid next to me was even going ""okay..."" during some of the so-called highlights of the film. I had the exact same thoughts, so did my friend, and so did everyone else in the theater. And the staple of the series, the character driven story lines, were completely absent.<br/><br/>They tried to do something like that with Bart and the Flanders family but the chemistry didn't work. It was incredibly weak how they tried to make Homer the screw up and why Bart decided to defect to the Flanders' family. Plus hasn't that already been done before? Can't really blame them for that, a show running for nearly 20 years and you're bound to run out of ideas. Plus I didn't have any sympathy for Homer. He was just dumb, not lovable dumb just...dumb. He was the cause of everything, but it seemed like he could care less. The old lovable Homer would've done all these things by accident, not knowing the harm it could bring to everyone. I also expected Maggie to play a pivotal part and was really disappointed when she was just reduced to a quick gag. The only reason why I give it a 6 instead of a 4 or 5 is cause its the Simpsons. And it's not even the Simpsons I (and millions of other people) grew up with, but its that nostalgia that gripped me and paid for my ticket ultimately. Without that, this movie would've bombed hard. I'm sure at least half of the people that saw this wanted to see classic Simpsons in the big screen even though it can't be possible now (despite many of the old writers and one of the bigger series directors coming back).<br/><br/>By the end of it, there was no applause. Other highly anticipated movies like the Dark Knight and Spiderman were met with applause in the end, but not this movie. Everyone just upped and left. Disappointed. This is really sad since the Simpsons is actually more iconic to modern society than either Batman or Spiderman. What's worse is that the newer episodes i've seen are finally going back to the basics: homer is not as stupid, character driven story lines are back, and the humor is stripped from its Family Guy shackles and goes back to being coherent to the story.<br/><br/>There is a rumor (maybe an early confirmation?) that a sequel is in the works. If the newer episodes indicate anything, it might be good if they don't try so hard. At least this was the first non-CG movie i've seen in theaters in awhile, I can give it that at least."

"Alex_DeLarge_Is_Here","3","34","123","22 July 2007"," Disappoints on a Massive Scale
","After 18 years on air, most people can say this about ""The Simpsons"" They've done everything, and then pushed to do more. Sometimes a funny story line comes along and sometimes the writing still manages to have a spark. Most of the time it just seems like a burden. That ""The Simpsons"" has become such a staple on the FOX station that they are reluctant to take it off the air. ""The Simpsons Movie"" carries the same burden that has trudged down the past few seasons of the TV show. It's noted on the FAQ that the movie domain had been purchased by FOX in 1998. That's when the movie should of been made. When ""The Simpsons"" still seemed fresh. Here we SEE Homer, we SEE Bart, and the rest of the Simpson family, but that's just it. We SEE them but it doesn't seem like the writers tried. Homer says ""Doh"" and the audience is expected to laugh. Bart is full of smart assed remarks that even now seem dated and childish. I wont even go into the sappy and poorly constructed subplot that concerns Lisa and her ""first love"". It seems slopped together and underwhelming. In reality the entire film feels belated and rather then: FINALLY, A SIMPSON'S MOVIE! It feel more like: BETTER LATE THEN NEVER. As much as I wished to be pleasantly surprised, what I got felt more like a extended episode. However, it seemed like an episode that you'd rather flip by then stay and watch. In the words of Homer - ""Doh""."
"TJ1380","6","14","44","27 July 2007"," Disappointing if you're a fan from the earlier years of the show.
","Let me start this review by saying that when ""The Simpsons"" was at its best it was quite possibly the best show on television. It was clever, funny, sarcastic without coming off as too mean-spirited, and it had a lot of heart. Unfortunately, that was about ten years ago. About halfway through the show's nearly two-decade run it kind of went on a downward spiral from which it has yet to recover. The episode plots started to make less and less sense, the jokes got dumber, and much of the heartfelt sentiment that was part of the best episodes seemed to disappear. In fact, the show that exists now seems to be entirely different from the show I grew up watching. It still has its moments, but for the most part it just isn't the same. If ""The Simpsons Movie"" came out ten years ago and was based on what the show was in its earlier years, I can guarantee that it would've been better than just about any other movie to come out that year. Sadly, what we have now is a movie based on the ""new"" show, the show that often favors cheap laughs over the cleverness of the ""old"" show's glory days.<br/><br/>That's not to say that this movie is a total waste of time. Although I don't think I can recommend this one as much more than a DVD rental or a Saturday afternoon matinée, there was still quite a bit that I did like. There's quite a bit of sharp social commentary about the average American idiot's complete disregard for the environment (the average American idiot is, of course, represented by Homer) as well as the untrustworthiness of our government. There is also some surprisingly touching and emotional subplots that pop up, such as an uncharacteristically lonely Bart looking to Ned Flanders as a father figure, and Homer facing the fact that Marge just might leave him for good (it's a subject that has been handled many times on the show, but it's never seemed quite as sad as it is here). Homer proves once again why he's such a memorable character as well. It's still nearly impossible not to laugh at him, and despite his idiocy and selfishness he proves that deep down he cares more about his family than anything else.<br/><br/>As much as there was for me to like about this movie, there was still a lot that I found kind of annoying. It's hard to explain why, but the script itself feels a little slapdash for my tastes. We don't get into the main plot until about a half-hour, and until then the film seems to consist of a bunch random jokes and general weirdness that feel like they're very loosely tied together. When we do get to the main plot (in which Homer practically single-handedly pollutes Springfield so badly that the corrupt head of the Environmental Protection Agency seals the town inside a gigantic glass dome) it's almost too outlandish even for a Simpsons movie. The movie also seems to go over everything a little too quickly, and as a result some of the more interesting and emotional subplots seem to be short-changed at times in favor of jokes that for the most part aren't nearly as good as the best that the television show had to offer.<br/><br/>While I didn't hate this movie, I have to admit that it was kind of a disappointment to folks like myself who think that the best days of ""The Simpsons"" are long gone. If given a choice between watching this movie and watching a marathon of ""Simpsons"" episodes from the first seven or eight seasons, I'd pick the marathon anytime."

"dragonshield","10","5","12","2 August 2007"," Non-stop laughs after non-stop laughing.
","I just saw ""The Simpsons Movie"" yesterday when I went to the cinemas. No matter how bad ratings and reviews it would have had I personally would have gone and see it anyways, as I have always loved the series. I've never really been a HUGE fan, but I'm one of those people who do not change the channel if Simpsons are on. I certainly don't want to give away any spoilers on the story, so I'll just leave my usual writing of the plot out, as in this case it's pretty crucial. All I can say about the plot is that it was a surprise to me how good it actually was and it certainly won't be a disappointment to any Simpsons fan there is.<br/><br/>Before this movie was out I heard people saying how the series had ran out of jokes and the movie can't be that good either. Well, it would be pretty obvious if the series ran out of jokes, but to me that has never been the case. I actually like the newer Simpsons more than the older ones, so I'm again one of those people. I can agree with everyone when I say that when watching this movie it felt like watching a longer episode of the series, but what made it more movie -like was the transferring to the big screen. I especially loved the animation; Though there is also 3D animation used besides the usual 2D, it still had that same heart as we all know the Simpsons of. This movie was most definitely one of the best ""episodes"" I've seen from the Simpsons. I guess the makers had lots of pressure on making a movie after the series had been on TV for 18 years and that is natural, but the way they have done it deserves an enormous appreciation as despite the pressure the makers have made a very successful from TV to a movie -translation. Probably the best we've ever seen.<br/><br/>The humor. Oh my, the humor. I'm being as honest as I can when I say that I haven't laughed that hard in ages, as the movie is throughout non-stop laughing and it is one of the funniest movies I have ever seen. Actually, there were only like 2 - 4 parts in the movie where there was a 30 second - 1 minute period of some drama where you didn't laugh, and that is so little time that you just can't complain. I myself found those parts entertaining as well and they were also surprisingly serious which caused moments that made you relate to the Simpsons, just like any other family. Anyway, despite those moments it was indeed non-stop laughing. Unluckily, I just felt that I was sitting in the wrong audience as I felt like laughing at parts where no-one else was laughing. I can see no other reason than the rest of the audience ""not getting"" the jokes, as there were also so much jokes only the Americans find funny. Or if you are a person who know about the current situation in the USA you'll be finding those jokes funny as well. There were also so much jokes, or more like hints I'd say, about the American politics nowadays which I found hilarious but the rest of the audience just didn't laugh and that to me was a disappointment. I didn't let it affect me so I continued to watch the movie without caring what the rest of the audience was laughing at or not.<br/><br/>Getting back to the story I found it very entertaining. It was actually a little bit different than the episodes of the series, as there was a real message in it and I also found it heart warming in a way that I've never seen the Simpsons before. Comedies like these are really hard to make, as when having so much humor throughout it usually tends to get a bit repetitive and boring. The Simpsons had one advance on their side and that was the fan base that had been growing for 18 years. But that doesn't make the movie an easy thing to do though, as that also increases the pressure on the makers's shoulders. What I mean by the fan base is that people have got known the Simpsons over the years and the movie wouldn't probably be even that funny without the series, obviously. For example every time Homer was on screen you just sensed the atmosphere it caused in the audience and people were stand-by for laughing, just because it was Homer Simpson. The humor doesn't get repetitive or boring at any part, which is a real achievement, as how many movies are there where you can honestly laugh from the beginning till the end? Yeah, not so many.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" does the impossible; By being a movie made from series it just doesn't disappoint you. Or at least I can't imagine it to be a disappointment to anyone. How many times you can honestly say that? Yeah, again, not so many. I don't care if I felt like watching a long episode of The Simpsons, as when laughing that hard throughout you can't really complain. It was an absolutely hilarious film, it makes history in the history of the comedy genre and it is a definite recommendation for every Simpsons fan there is. You don't see me giving 10's so much, but in this case I honestly have no other option. The movie is indeed as excellent and perfect as a comedy can pretty much get. Thanks for The Simpsons and thanks for the makers."

I have never laughed so hard and so much at a single film before. To the point where my face and sides were sore before even the half way point. I was not the only one, it was pretty much unanimous hilarity for the entire cinema. The animation is superb, the dialogue is as we've come to expect from the Simpsons' brains trust, and there are some extra little thrills and spills that you can tell they've been dying to lay upon us for quite some time. Personally, I felt that they pretty much nailed the ideal length for the movie. But it sets such a cracking pace that they probably could've push it out to 2 hours. All in all, this was an extremely enjoyable and rewarding trip to the cinema, and one that I will no doubt be making again and again 10/10"

"metallicorb","10","5","12","29 July 2007"," The Simpsons Movie Review by Metallic Orb
","The production of this movie has been contemplated since 1990 by Simpsons creator Matt Groening. He often said that the making of a Simpsons movie would result in the end of the series. This is not the case. The series has been renewed for at least another 4 seasons.<br/><br/>My greatest fear was that this movie would ruin the series. Luckily this did not happen. The first twenty minutes of the film are completely brilliant.<br/><br/>My second greatest concern was the development of an animated TV series into a feature length film. It is difficult to stretch slapstick humor and witty phrases that often depend on commercial breaks for their full effect into something that will work in a film. I believe The Simpsons Movie accomplished this. The viewer must keep in mind that the film is indeed a movie and so longer dialogs should be expected in order to fully develop the plot. This is one way in which the movie varies from the TV series.<br/><br/>Following the tradition of social commentary in the series, there is an overarching theme in the film of being conscious about how we treat the environment. Green Day guest stars in the film and there is a special cameo appearance by a big name Hollywood star that you will all recognize. Most of your favorite Simpsons characters will be seen in the film as well as a few new ones like the ""Big Boob Medicine Woman"" and ""President Arnold Schwarzenegger."" Aside from some full frontal nudity, expletives and Homer flipping the bird, this movie is a solid extension of the series and must be seen by any casual Simpsons viewer for its fast-paced humor, clever commentary about our society and the opportunity to finally see all of your favorite Simpsons characters on the big screen!

","Originally, my plan was to leave my three kids at the movie theater to watch the Simpsons, however my kids said I couldn't because it was PG-13.<br/><br/>I watched the movie today with my three kids and I was ready to take a snooze throughout the movie. To my surprise, I was awake and laughing throughout the movie.<br/><br/>I never paid attention to the Simpsons TV show before. The movie was filled with interesting scenes, actions and humor. I actually loved it! A 10 out of 10!<br/><br/>The funniest parts are the first part of the movie when Homer said something to the audience because I said exactly the same thing to my kids before taking them to the movies.<br/><br/>The next funniest part is the skateboard scene."
"bully720","10","5","12","27 July 2007"," Greatest Movie in the History of History
","As anyone who has read even a single solitary post on this website knows, I am a pretty big Simpsons fan. Nearly every joke I've written on this website has been a twisted version of something I heard on the Simpsons, made less funny and claimed as my own without even realizing I had stole it. I have seen every episode of the show numerous times and annoyingly recite lines from it amongst my friends. I feel as though I know the characters on that show as well as I know people in real life. I believe it is the funniest television show in the existence of forever and the absolute apex of achievement by man (slightly ahead of Tecmo Super Bowl...slightly). That's why when I first heard the movie was being made over a year ago I was worried. I thought this movie reeked of a cash grab by a show on the decline that was looking for one last big financial windfall before riding off into the sunset. I was worried because I had waited 18 of my 23 years for this movie to come out and there was no possible way it could meet the ridiculous expectations I had created for it. I was wrong. The Simpsons movie was the most exhilarating experience of my life. It was like being conscious during your own birth and realizing all of the wonder and magnificence that awaited you during your new lifetime. If you compiled every great thing that Frank Capra, John Ford, Stanley Kubrick and Woody Allen ever put to film and then multiplied it by a number so large that saying it would take a lifetime you still wouldn't even be close to how great this movie is. Jesus Christ himself could have come bursting through the theater doors riding a surfboard on a wave of fire, carrying the head of Satan in one hand and shooting a shotgun into the air with the other and I still wouldn't have been able to turn away from the brilliance that was occurring on screen and if that last sentence didn't make sense to you then you haven't seen the film yet. That's how amazing this movie is. I don't know how more highly I could recommend it. But if you want to have your life changed for the best then go see this movie. Right now. And when you're done watching it watch it again. Please."

","For years, there had been speculation as to whether or not there would be a big screen version of the longest running animated show. Well, now it's, and I gotta say that I really like ""The Simpsons Movie"". With just the right balance of gags and plot line, they keep the whole thing going.<br/><br/>The story has Lisa exposing - via a presentation called ""An Irritating Truth"" - that Lake Springfield's pollution levels will reach catastrophic levels unless the people take serious action immediately. While the city bans dumping, Homer tosses his pet pig's crap into the lake - he was taking the crap to the treatment facility, but had to get to Lard Lad Donuts for a free donut - turning Springfield into the most polluted city in the country. So, EPA head Russ Cargill (voice of Albert Brooks) gets Pres. Schwarzenegger to agree to put a giant glass dome over Springfield to prevent it from polluting the rest of the country (while also removing Springfield from all maps). Sure enough, news soon comes out that Homer is responsible for the city's misfortune, and the family has to flee through a sinkhole. Now comes the question of how Homer is going to deal with the mess that he's created.<br/><br/>Pretty much every major character from throughout the show's history appears in at least one scene. Along the way, there are some great lines (""Why are we watching something in the theater that we could watch for free on TV?""). The subplots involve Lisa's crush on Irish immigrant boy Colin, and Bart viewing Ned Flanders as a father figure, while Marge and Maggie also do their usual stuff.<br/><br/>Yes, maybe it is a little late for the movie to arrive, but I still assert that they did a near perfect job. Really funny. And just remember what Tom Hanks said in his guest appearance."

","Walking into this movie with my two friends I knew right away that this was going to be great. The entire movie made me laugh and like always the characters worked. This will probably be the funniest movie of the year and if it isn't then we will be in for a treat on the big screen.<br/><br/>I give this a ten because The Simpson's movie is one of the funniest movie ever made, and is in the top 5 best movies of the year! Since the show started I have kept up with it and now all of it has paid off. If they make a sequel (which I hope they will) then I will watch it and laugh even more than last time.<br/><br/>Now can't we all agree that this is a great movie?"
"toshguy","3","4","9","4 August 2007"," A big disgrace for The Simpsons!
","Just like the last 3 or 4 seasons of the TV series, this movie is simply a disgrace for the name of the once so great show. The humor is very dry, or perhaps to be more exact - childish and simple. I bet small children, smaller than 12 years, really like this, but the integrity of the show is lost. Not that this feature had any to begin with. The good thing about The Simpsons in their earlier years was that the humor could appeal to both children and adults. I'm sure this movie got such a high rating because mostly people with an extremely simple taste voted for this title, teenagers too, of course - most of them still on a very immature level. In conclusion the only thing I have left to say to people over 20 (which aren't imbeciles) - if you still have a good opinion for The Simpsons, don't watch this movie!"
"phgapn","9","4","9","3 August 2007"," They stuck to what works
","The makers of the Simpsons did exactly what they do on a weekly basis with their long running TV show. They made a well written story, used smart, political, and at the same time silly humor, and made everyone in the theater laugh hysterically. They did good by sticking to the primary role of every character. For instance, Ralph and Otto made brief but hilarious appearances, which is what they usually do during the show. They didn't try too hard to get every character a laugh in the movie so they could stick to the main characters. Which brings me to another point. The Homer v. Bart sub-plot was very well done. Barts pretty much always been on homers side (except for when Bart gets emancipated) and the fact that Bart finally drew the line in this movie was kind of cool. The only reason I'm not giving this move a 10 is because it was too short. If its this funny, make the damn movie 2 hours long at least! I highly recommend this movie to anyone. Follower of the TV show or not. SEE IT"
"slicedbreadisoverrated","4","4","9","25 July 2007"," Not ""excellent"", but not the ""worst. movie. ever."" either.
","There is a handful of genuinely laugh-out-loud moments to rival the mid-90s seasons of the TV show, but there's an over-reliance on decade-old jokes (""Pray to Jebus"" ""BYE EVERYBODY!"" et cetera) and an almost complete lack of the subtlety that made it transcend being 'just a cartoon' in the first place, but you sort of forgive these shortcomings because it's The Simpsons. Here's a tip; wait until later in its run when you won't be sat next to try to families with young children (""Look there's Itchy!"" when Scratchy appears on screen at the start made me seethe pedantically, but maybe that's just me being a fifty-year-old inside a teenager's body) because it'll greatly increase your enjoyment of it.<br/><br/>It's beyond doubt that Futurama would have made a much more effective feature film by sheer virtue of it being the Groening creation less naturally constrained by the realms of possibility as well as offering more cinematographic scope and proved potential for genuine emotionally connectivity than the inhabitants of Springfield, but The Simpsons Movie isn't sacrilege by any means. Just don't expect to be rolling in the aisles."
"kishonadish","Null","4","9","25 July 2007"," Decent nothing more
","After 18 long years, the greatest comedy masterpiece of all time has finally hit the big screen and the hopes and expectations of the true Simpsons fans couldn't be higher. But does this movie deliver? Yes and no really.<br/><br/>It is hard to describe the plot of this movie as the writers have used the four main characters Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart and then added a supporting plot to each one. So you can get to see your favourite Simpson's characters dealing with different situations which are all related to the main story. But the only character which delivers the best moments in the film is naturally Homer. Who else? In the film Bart starts to look at Ned as a farther figure after he is neglected by Homer after he didn't take the wrap for Bart causing anarchy in his naked skateboard stunt. This storyline has its moments but feels slightly contrived because after all Homer and Bart have a love hate relationship and after 18 years he finally feels that Flanders is a more suitable Dad? Hmm.<br/><br/>But as the trailer states you get to ""see Homer, Marge, Lisa, Bart and Maggie and a cast of hundreds"". Well you get to see the other characters and I know this is the ""Simpsons Movie"" but I feel that there are some excellent (no pun intended) back up characters in the Simpsons and several situations in the movie when they could have been used more were squandered. For example Mr Burns who was superb in the short instance when he was in the film was wasted really. Considering he is such a power craving and evil man, I think he would have been slightly more ruthless if he found out that someone with more authority had thought of a scheme to block all townspeople from leaving the town. Maybe I am getting a head of myself here though.<br/><br/>The main man behind all this chaos in Springfield is President Schwarzenegger, which I found to be an excellent idea for a satirical character by the writing staff of this movie. ""I was elected to lead not to read"" got the best laugh out of me during the 87 minutes of the movie.<br/><br/>But to be honest most of the jokes in this movie, I wouldn't describe as hysterical. I found myself smirking more than laughing out loud. Personally I have been a fan of the show for 18 years, and I even watch the new episodes every week which are mixed bag but I do get a kick out of some of the newer ones. The Simpsons movie will not appeal to doubters and/or ex-fans who do not currently like the newer episodes. But I still felt like this movie was worth watching and a slightly enjoyable way to pass time.<br/><br/>It just could have pushed a bit more boundaries and made the most out of some the ideas which were there. So overall The Simpsons Movie was decent but hardly the best moment of the shows history."
"MLDinTN","4","3","6","6 July 2008"," Just like the TV show, so why make it a movie
","I used to watch the Simpsons all the time, but grew out of it when I got out of high school. So, I haven't seen the TV show in many years. But still this movie seemed just an extended TV episode. You are a sucker just like Homer said if you paid to watch this. I watched it on cable. The plot deals with the pollution of Springfield. It gets so bad the government encloses Springfield in a dome and a lot of it has to do with something Homer did. So Homer and the fam find a way to escape the dome and move to Alaska. But of course, Marge and the kids can't leave everyone behind, especially when plans are to wipe out Springfield. They go back to help and eventually Homer gives in and goes to.<br/><br/>To me it seemed like the cartoon uses most of the same jokes and plot points it did 10 years ago. I think one gets tired of it after about 5 years.<br/><br/>FINAL VERDICT: Only worth seeing if you are a fan of the current TV show."

I think they are trying to milk the series for all its worth. I can not give a fair review, but I was not overly excited. 3 out of 10 donuts for this one. I would rather watch Old School or Semi-Pro for 2 hours than this. To TV ish. At least I did not have to pay for it. Reminds me of the X files movie. No one went to see X Files either.

"WyteRabit","2","3","6","23 December 2007"," What the %@$# was that all about?
","I've always thought that the Simpson's was a slightly better than average animated comedy. Over the years it's had its moments but after the first few seasons, the frequency of these moments declined. Overall, I've always felt that South Park and Family Guy were superior series, but I'm willing to give credit where credit is due. The series was OK.<br/><br/>Now... Let's get to this piece of cr*p that was trying to pass itself off as a comedy. Sorry, but I couldn't find one thing funny. There may have been a moment or two when I rolled my eyes and tried to smile (just to give myself hope that there may be something decent to come). Unfortunately, that never happened. The jokes were so bad that you'd need an IQ lower than your shoe size to think it was funny. But, according to the rating given by the users, I guess there are more of those that I imagined.<br/><br/>In closing, although I consider myself a fan of ""stupid humor"" as well as slapstick and intellectual humor, I can't say this film qualified as any of them. It was tedious to watch, had no redeeming moments (except the end credits), and was a total waste of time. I would rather have watched Plan 9 from Outer Space."

","Oh dear. If you knew how much I loved the Simpsons for the first eight or nine seasons... It was groundbreaking TV; the funniest, slyest, most subversive, most honest programme on the box, and I couldn't get enough of it. Each episodes rewarded repeated viewing to catch all the references to film and TV, as well as politics and real-life situations. Then some of the key writers started to drift away, and so did my enthusiasm. The show became only sporadically funny, often irritating, overly reliant on guest stars, and at times unnecessarily surreal. What had essentially been a story of a dysfunctional family that echoed (though sometimes in bizarre ways) the dilemmas that many families faced, became just another cartoon sitcom. And this film shares all the faults of the latter-day TV seasons, with some new problems thrown in... From a barnstorming twenty-odd minutes (including Ralph Wiggum's appearance before the film even starts!) the film becomes a polemic about green issues, Homer is even more intractably stupid than ever, Bart is almost completely sidelined with the Flanders, Monty Burns hardly gets a look-in... It really would have been a great TV episode (hence the first twenty minutes!!), but becomes tiresome and repetitive - Homer's done the stupidity redeemed shlock quite a few times in the series, and his method of self-discovery just doesn't ring true. There are some great jokes in this film, but only enough to fill an average early-season episode. I did love ""Eski-Moe's"" though! Maybe I'm being harsh; after all, this isn't bad, and WAY better than your average American comedy film, but expectations were so high..."
"rvnc","4","3","6","23 August 2007"," 'I've become everything I ever hated!'
","Anyone remember that line? It's from the great man himself, Homer J. Simpson, perhaps the greatest TV character ever, and that quote sums up the Simpsons Movie.<br/><br/>Quite frankly, compared to what it was in the 90s, it's complete rubbish. The best jokes are the ones you've already seen in the trailers. There's one great line from Ralph, and a couple of decent 'Homer gets hurt' gags but thats it. The jokes are all stupid, slapstick comedy designed for people who find somewhere injuring themselves over and over again hilarious. It's almost as if it is 'Jackass', but in cartoon form. Gone are the brilliant observations, the masterful one-liners, the superb songs, and yes, the occasional superb physical comedy gag( Homer falling down Gorge is my favourite) I know it's asking a lot for it to be as fresh and witty as it was but come on! How can 'Spider-pig, spider pig' compare to 'No-one who speaks German can be an evil man' <br/><br/>As for the story, it's an episode stretched too far with a schmaltzy finish and few guest stars thrown in. In short everything the Simpsons has been circa 2002. I mean Marge and Homer splitting up? That was old back in 1998! Entertaining and much loved characters such as Krusty, Chief Wiggum, Burns, Smithers and Apu have about 20 lines between them, replaced by Green Day and Tom Hanks. The focus is entirely on the Simpsons, which is a shame because they themselves have become painfully one-dimensional. Compare the Homer seen here to Homer in 1992 and you'll see what I mean. The Simpsons no longer have any depth. Homer is stupid and selfish. Marge is kind-hearted and nags a lot. Bart is stupid and rebellious and Lisa is always on her soapbox. As Lisa said a long time ago 'You don't want to be a one-dimensional character with a silly catchphrase'. Sadly you have become one."
"thefilmguru-3","6","3","6","9 August 2007"," thefilmguru reviews: The Simpson's Movie
","The Simpson's Movie has had movie critics dribbling at the prospect of it being the new movie to bash. It's perfect bait. With this much of a fan base and this much hype surrounding its release, even the public were waiting to hate it. But alas. Not even the critics are pretending to hate this film.<br/><br/>In a summer of hyped movies that have been major disappointments, (Pirates 3, Spiderman 3) The Simpson's Movie is a welcome injection of solid fulfilment and humour into this years solid blockbusting rubbish.<br/><br/>The creators have strived to adapt a fast paced television show into something audiences need to stay with for an hour and a half. With all the writers being used to making a passable, easy storyline for the TV show, it seems they thought the only way they can keep people interested is to see the relatable town in extraordinary situations. It sort-of works, but a lot of people may be disappointed by the change in pace and style from the TV show.<br/><br/>Scenes are able to stretch their legs in a longer running time, this aiming to make it not feel just like a long episode, but as you are still watching a 2D cartoon, it seems odd that it's subjected to such a mature structure. This does test the concentration as your brain instinctively expects a flicky, snappy, choppy, quick-scened riot.<br/><br/>But, the creators have been very wise, because while they have upped the running time and therefore the scene length, they have also upped the gag count. All the above criticism is all forgotten in the array of chuckle-worthy jokes flying at you every 30 seconds. Unlike the structure and pacing, they manage to keep the style of jokes loyal to the TV show. Homer repeatedly hurting himself and Homer strangling Bart are just some of the old favourites that have made it to the big screen. And these well known ones are mingled in with some genuinely strong and funny new material. This silencing some that say that The Simpson's has run out of steam. But, people who are new to The Simpson's (who aren't many), will not get the inside jokes which clog up quite a lot of the scenes. This is because the film sets off expecting everyone to know the characters already, therefore the people who don't, may not get some gags which are related to certain character traits.<br/><br/>But it never overstays its welcome. After all I've said about The Simpson's relishing the chance at breathable scenes, they still never forget that at its core, it's a TV show, and usually we only intend to stay with these characters for half an hour. Therefore they clearly and nicely round it off at one and a half hours.<br/><br/>All in all I believe that The Simpson's hasn't disappointed, but while its humour isn't an acquired taste, I still believe this is mostly only going to entertain the lovers of the TV show, due to the many nudge-nudge-wink-wink styled inside jokes. However, in a cinematic age of action movies and things blowing up, The Simpson's Movie is welcome as the only real intelligent thing aroundÂ…with a few things blowing up to top it off."
"aeo","2","3","6","4 August 2007"," It is only a 30 minute episode that has been stretched into a movie
","I wanted to like it but I was disappointed. This movie is basically three thirty minute episode combined into one. The story is OK, nothing great. You do see it on a big screen so that is interesting but that is not enough to warrant a full ticket price. The story is basically Homer messes up again and causes Springfield to be designated as a toxic dump so the government places a dome around Springfield trapping everyone inside. Homer redeems himself and saves Springfield and cleans up the toxic waste. If you are a Simpson fan like myself, then there is nothing new here. My friends child liked it though so if you have a small child, they should enjoy it. If you really don't have to watch it, then wait for it on DVD or even cable."
"BJBatimdb","6","3","6","29 July 2007"," Over-hyped
","Love the Simpsons on TV - but there was always a danger that stretching the format to feature length would just add padding to the same number of jokes, and - sadly - that's what's happened here. The Simpsons is by no means a bad movie but it's just not so much funnier or smarter than any one of the TV episodes that I think it's worth paying cinema prices. Sure, there are some great gags and very funny lines but at the end of the day, it's a very long cartoon without even the surprise of original characters to recommend it (as happened with movies like Monsters Inc and Shrek). If you (like me) prefer the TV episodes that deal mostly with the immediate family and the way they cope with rather mundane problems, then you'll probably be underwhelmed by this movie. By necessity its plot is widened to encompass world issues and other locations. I notice the rating has already dropped from a ridiculous 9, and fully expect to see it slide to a more sensible level once people come to their senses. No criticism is implied of the makers - I think they did as well as they could with the feature format. I just think most half-hour shows work well precisely because they're half-hour gems, tightly packed with ideas, laughs and funny asides. Watching exactly the same formula for three times as long didn't work for me."
"Myrilandel","9","3","6","28 July 2007"," Whoo hoo! Best movie ever
","Ever since I've started seeing previews for this movie, I've been excited. Could it possibly be? Classic Simpsons humor brought to the big screen without mangling the characters that have become so real and interesting over the years? Well, I'm happy to say that this movie delivered, and then some. Hearty laughs were interspersed with genuine heartfelt moments (seriously, I got teary-eyed at one point), and the magic of the early seasons of the show was captured flawlessly. Homer wasn't just a food-monster with a few one-liners every so often, and all the other characters had similar depth. All this was achieved within a mere one and a half hours.<br/><br/>I applaud all my favorite Simpsons writers (yes, you too, Swartzwelder, much as you try to avoid the spotlight). This movie has waited decades to be made, but it was certainly worth the wait. I can't wait to see it again."
"Skint111","6","3","6","27 July 2007"," A fun watch but not a classic
","The Simpsons Movie is consistently mildly amusing but the big, BIG laugh never arrives. There's nothing that's particularly brilliant or surprising, especially when you remember what episodes in the first 10 years of the series threw up. This could be because we're over-familiar with the show and were expecting too much from the movie. It was never going to be a movie of an 18-year-old TV show that was going to provide the year's most remarkable, invigorating, innovative cinematic experience. Still, it's a good natured, good hearted film which seeks to entertain. My favourite moment, by far, was Bart's nude skateboarding, it's splendidly done.<br/><br/>That this is in the IMDb top 100 already (and My Name Is Bruce has entered the top 200) clearly demonstrates how unreliable the ratings system is. I can't say I really understand how it works. IMDb claim it's the thousand most regular voters who make the chart. Presumably the special thousand are constantly changing. But how does that explain the high new entries of movies popular with certain fan types, followed by their gradual sliding? So the fan boys are also the most prolific voters? All very strange, and surely a sign of a system in need of a change. How about barring films from entering the top 250 until they're at least one month old?"

I not saying stay away from the film but I wouldn't say go and see it. It will do well but is no way a classic. When you have stories of a two year writing time and family guy/American dad coming up you expect something to wow you at the end.

"MaxBorg89","8","5","13","30 July 2007"," THE greatest experience of summer 2007!
","Films that make one laugh within two minutes are very rare. Those that manage to do so within twenty seconds have practically never existed. Until now. The Simpsons Movie is a cracker right from the 20th Century Fox logo, where Ralph Wiggum pops up and does his own rendition of the company's celebrated fanfare. This shouldn't be unexpected, given the TV show, the most popular animated program of all time, has made fun of Fox countless times over the course of 18 seasons and 400 episodes. Now that the world's favorite yellow family has finally made the transition to the big screen, they even have the guts to do some self-spoofing, as the most famous dumb-ass in animation history, Homer Simpson (Dan Castellaneta), in a moment of truly inspired meta-cinematic madness (another one being Bart writing ""I will not illegally download this movie"" on the chalkboard), states while watching an Itchy & Scratchy movie with his kids: ""I can't believe we're paying to watch something we could get on the TV for free! If you ask me, everyone in this movie theater is a big sucker! Especially YOU!"". The last sentence is accompanied by his finger pointing directly at the camera, before the familiar title sequence begins, proving beyond any doubt that: a) Homer is deservedly considered the greatest television character ever aside from Fonzie; b) It was totally worth waiting 18 years for The Simpsons Movie.<br/><br/>Having been kept a secret for months prior to the film's release, the plot is actually ridiculously simple: because of the growing concern for the environment, no one is allowed to dump garbage in Lake Springfield anymore. However, someone ignores this and dumps a load of pig, uh, crap in the water, causing a major pollution and prompting the President, Arnold Schwarzenegger (!), to charge Russ Cargill (Simpsons veteran Albert Brooks) with securing the area. Hence a gigantic glass dome that isolates Springfield from the rest of the world, prompting the inhabitants to put a price on the responsible's head. His name? Homer Simpson, of course (""D'oh!"").<br/><br/>Naturally, he chooses to run off to Alaska, only to realize he will eventually have to deal with what he has done and seek forgiveness. But given he is Homer, he might as well try to have some fun on the way, leaving it to Marge (Julie Kavner), Lisa (Yeardley Smith) and everyone's favorite TV brat, Bart (Nancy Cartwright), to actually save the day.<br/><br/>Considering the differences in creative freedom between big and small screen, one might think, even hope, The Simpsons Movie will be edgier than the TV version. Those people will be sorely disappointed, as the film tries to be nothing more than a 90-minute version of one of the best episodes of the show, and succeeds. Then again, it's not like the feature length counterparts of Beavis & Butt-head or South Park were that different from the network originals (aside from the swearing not being bleeped out in South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut). And in the particular case of The Simpsons, its longevity has made it an indelible, recognizable part of everyday life, meaning any changes in tone or themes would be like betraying the show's spirit. Thus, except for a few PG-13 gags regarding sexual orientation (Ned Flanders: ""The Good Lord is telling me to confess to something"" Homer: ""Gay gay gay gay gay gay gay..."") and bestiality (Homer's weird relationship with a pig), everything is just as all remember it: Lisa is still an annoying smart kid, Bart is still a master of mischief, his dad is still incredibly, deliriously moronic, Mr. Burns (creepy, despite only two scenes at his disposal) is still a vicious evildoer, and the movie is a rock-solid reminder of why the series is the ultimate cult program.<br/><br/>All a die-hard Simpsons fan is looking for, he will find here. Hilarious physical gags? Check, in fact the bigger screen allows the 11 writers (just imagine if this gets an Oscar nomination for Best Original Screenplay), including creator Matt Groening, to come up with more spectacular stuff than usual (just watch as Homer finds himself between a rock and a hard place - literally!). Tender moments between Homer and Marge? Heck, probably the best in Simpsons history! The big, fat bloke strangling Bart? Check (""I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!""). Movie spoofs? Check (""Spider-Pig, Spider-Pig...""). Celebrity guest appearances? Just one (Tom Hanks; Arnie is voiced by Harry ""Mr. Burns"" Shearer)), but it is priceless.<br/><br/>In the end, all these things turn The Simpsons Movie into an unstoppable gag-machine, a film that will make you laugh for the entirety of its running time, the most fun anyone will have in a cinema this year. Hell, it is so good it is hard, if not impossible, not to say: ""Yeah!"" once one of the characters, resuscitating the movie's self-awareness, asks the fundamental question: ""Sequel?"". Let's just hope it doesn't take another 18 years to make it..."

And I understood from that screening that the audience over reactive to the gags in the film. Although they weren't as funny as they supposed to be, the audience still laughed because of the passion of The Simpsons; during some of the jokes that were displayed in the film, immediately the audience laughed out loud over it. They all knew it wasn't a classic gag that would go down in the history books, but they laughed because it was The Simpsons and it goes to show that the series has earned such a huge portion of respect from the fans. And it makes everyone realise that it's not just one episode that makes The Simpsons great, it's the amount of episodes that defines the franchise; there's an episode for every member of the audience in terms of genre and this film basically just summed up all the aspects from the past two decades into one 90 minute viewing.<br/><br/>In the end, I'll have to say; it wasn't the best (feature length) episode I've ever seen from the Groening brigade, but it had some funny moments that were only suitable for the cinema experience. I would say to you all to go and watch it and find your own opinion on it. It does better than the new television episodes but it's lost the spirit of the old classic's."

","Yes, today as many other did, I went to see the Simpsons Movie. I took my seat, expecting to laugh my head off at the upcoming spectacle. Instead, I was treated to a few funny jokes, a couple of 'Homer stunts' and other things as such. In Homer's words: 'It's just a bunch of stuff that happened'. Although I noticed some changes from the series: the language was stronger, the full frontal nudity didn't bother me but may bother some conservative of mind parents. If you are offended by nudity, language and sex jokes, don't come to see this film. However, it's a good laugh for the kids and fun while it lasts. But no, this film is not a masterpiece of animation, it's not a good story, it's not a good film. Nuff' said!"

"pbtran","10","4","10","6 August 2007"," A++ for Simpsons Movie! If you're a fan, this is definitely one to watch.
","We probably laughed throughout the movie with ""simpsonized"" gags and humor. The best part is the scenes with President Arnold Swarchenegger and the quote, ""I was elected to lead, not to read."" The main plot is that the Environment Protection Agency (EPA) is the evil entity in this movie and Homer has to save the day, since he was the one who caused the environmental disaster in the first place. One suggestion to folks is to stay after the end of the movie credits to see Maggie Simpson's first spoken word. It's definitely worth staying to hear Maggie Simpson speak. I would wait indefinitely for Matt Groening and company to make another movie sequel."

I think people who only seen a couple of episodes can really enjoy this as a comedy movie. In fact, two of the people that joined us for this movie ha never seen a single episode, and they thought it was great. For the fans, you have to be stupid to dog this. Admit it, it was hilarious!

When I got out of the theater, it reeked of pee yet I didn't mind because I didn't blame anybody for laughing so hard.

"dee.reid","10","4","10","28 July 2007"," ""The Simpsons Movie"" - An event 20 years in the making
","For those accustomed to watching it on the small screen every weekday night, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a long time coming, a motion picture event that's 20 years in the making. I've been watching ""The Simpsons"" ever since I was a kid growing up during the early 1990s, and I myself have waited for something of this magnitude. The creation of series originator Matt Groening, people who have seen the 400+ episodes of ""The Simpsons"" know that a movie has been on the table for over a decade, but nothing has ever manifested itself. So, fans just had to revel in one episode after the other, knowing, that one day, their dream of a ""Simpsons Movie"" would become a reality. And now here we are, 20 years after the cartoon first appeared as a short on ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" way back in 1987. Groening definitely had a hand in this production, otherwise ""The Simpsons Movie"" would have sucked big time. Unlike other theatrical adaptations of a television work, nothing has really changed, except that there's a bigger budget, better animation, but the characters are all the same. That makes for great animated cinematic entertainment. It's just nice to finally see a creator in control of his creation for once. Director David Silverman's ""The Simpsons Movie"" finds America's favorite dysfunctional family the target of a lynch mob after Homer buys a pig, and he disposes of its waste in Springfield Lake, turning the already-heavily polluted lake into a toxic cesspool that causes multiple eyes to sprout on any wildlife that comes into contact with it. To make long stories short, the EPA comes in and seals off Springfield with a massive dome. When it's discovered that Homer is responsible for the Lake Springfield toxic cesspool, he, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie are forced to go on the run to Alaska and start over (don't ask how they get out, just watch the movie). EPA man Cargill (voice of Albert Brooks) manages to fool President Schwarzenegger into launching an operation to nuke Springfield so that it becomes a tourist attraction similar to the Grand Canyon, since nothing will be left except for a smoking hole in the ground (actor Tom Hanks does an infomercial on the subject). Marge eventually discovers this and decides to head back to their hometown, sans Homer. Eventually, Homer gets the guts to return as well and save Springfield with his family. I literally could not stop laughing at ""The Simpsons Movie."" It gets you from the opening scenes (complete with a performance by Green Day) to the time the credits begin to roll. You'll be laughing so hard that you'll be barely able to catch your breath. I know I was laughing so hard that after a while I became tired and it got so that when something funny happened (and those comedic moments come at you left and right), it was strenuous to do so. That's an effect of a truly unique film experience. All of our favorite characters are here, some get more screen time than others (the film's only real weak point), but if that makes you mad, just watch the television show but still, don't hold that against the movie. I could tell that ""The Simpsons Movie"" definitely satisfied the cravings of my fellow cinema-goers, since their response to the movie was overwhelmingly positive. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is a simple culmination of 20 years worth of entertainment in 87 minutes. A cultural phenomenon has finally reached its peak and its core fans were overwhelmingly satisfied with a film experience they're not likely to ever forget.<br/><br/>10/10"
"DonFishies","8","4","10","27 July 2007"," A return to the satire and wit that made the TV show so memorable in the first place
","It should come as no surprise to anyone that The Simpsons Movie is as hyped or anticipated as it is. After eighteen seasons, the show still pulls in decent and consistent ratings, and even though the quality of the show has fallen a bit by the wayside the past few years, it will still rule supreme as one of the most popular television series' of all time. But with dodgy episodes as of late (and by late, I mean at least the last five years), the real question was whether or not the film would suffer.<br/><br/>Thankfully, it seems, the writers were waiting for something like this to truly let the show and its characters shine.<br/><br/>Curiously, the trailers are very cryptic as to what the film is actually about. I found out a few days before, and I think it ruined a few of the surprises that were in store. But for the most part, for all Simpsons fans young and old, be prepared for a treat.<br/><br/>Yes, the film does feel like an overextended episode, but not in the traditional sense. Whereas the Family Guy DVD movie literally felt like three episodes of the show strewn together, The Simpsons Movie actually makes a point of allowing the entirety of the film to feel cohesive and all so very attached to itself. Of course, this also means that it did not truly stretch the fabric confines of what is allowed in a movie as opposed to what is allowed on television (save for some extra violence, a few casual swear words, and one very bizarre skateboard-related dare). But while this element helped the South Park film become the controversial musical epic that it was back in 1998, I think it would have worked against The Simpsons.<br/><br/>By making it very in tune with the TV show, and feeling like it could stand side-by-side just about any episode, it is a true ode to the fans, and to all people who just loved watching the show in its prime. Loaded to the max with references to pop culture and even the series itself, it truly is a blast to watch for anyone who catches the random episodes shown every hour of every day.<br/><br/>The story, for what little amount of story there is, is fairly intriguing and a lot different than I envisioned it (even with knowing a little more about it). The many writers have clearly understood what worked and what did not over the entire Simpsons run, and have constructed what I would believe is a new rendition of the olden style. It feels like an old Simpsons episode, but we know it has been created now, during the slump of creativity where the show is concerned. I always hoped that they were saving all the good ideas for the movie, and with a few exceptions, I think I was right. It is better written, better voice-acted (everyone is back, and everyone is just as good as ever), and so much funnier than anything that has come out of that camp since at least the early 2000's. There are moments where I laughed so hard, that I forgot I was watching a Simpsons cartoon as new as this. And even when the comedic moments fall flat on their face, it still comes off as something worth a smile.<br/><br/>The animation is an interesting case all in itself. While the characters are animated using traditional hand-drawn techniques, all of the backgrounds are clearly computer-generated. It works in instances where the characters are just talking or when they are moving around normally, but it looks a little bizarre during scenes with excessive movement (the mob scene in the trailers is one such example). It gets a little jagged, and the hand-drawn stuff just does not look proper in any of these scenes. One small scene close to the end of the film, with Homer dreaming, just looks horrendous with the combination of traditional and computer animation. It just does not work together, and I think it may have been better off to just stick with traditional animation for the entirety of the film (since computer generated versions of The Simpsons clan would have truly been one of the worst moves in film history if it were to have been done). I liked that the creators experimented with such a process, but it just looks like it should have been done a little differently.<br/><br/>But I cannot help but feel that this film may truly be the swansong for The Simpsons. With it being handled so well, and actually edging back into the satirical wit the show once had, the film feels a lot more like a goodbye than anything. By bringing everyone together like this, it makes me imagine that the creators are trying to come up with the most proper goodbye that anyone could imagine for these insanely popular characters. It truly was a collaborative effort, and it shows in how much works in the movie, and how much no longer works so well on the show. After years of waiting, the creators finally delivered on a promise first thought-up in the early 1990's, and it will be worth the wait for many fans. But if this not the way they were figuring they would go out, than what is? Should I start getting excited for what may be in store for this family of five in the future, or should I stay content that the filmmakers actually pulled of the movie, and truly made it great? <br/><br/>Whatever the answer, the wait is over, and fans should rejoice. The Simpsons Movie is funny, sweet, tender, and all so entertaining. It is exactly what we have been waiting for, and almost no one should be disappointed by the final result.<br/><br/>8.5/10."

","I got the chance to see this movie last night at a sneak preview showing and I have to say that it was hilarious. I haven't been too keen on the past couple of years' worth of TV episodes, thought maybe they were running out of steam finally. Turns out they were saving up all their good material for the movie!<br/><br/>The movie is absolutely hilarious. I was almost in tears at points! I've been fairly lucky as I haven't seen the TV spot that everyone it seems has seen with the pig was a complete surprise to me and it was great!<br/><br/>Way to go on this movie to everyone who worked on it!"
"Quinoa1984","10","5","14","27 July 2007"," ""I'll teach you to laugh at something that's funny!""
","There's been maybe too much hype about this movie, though at the same time it did affect me in the way it was intended for die-hard fans (e.g. all the time this past week I kept thinking ""ah, Simpsons movie"" as I re-watched episodes from past seasons on DVD), and the anticipation almost became boring after so long a wait. The question then comes, was it worth it? For all of the ultra (and mostly kidding) hype and ultra promotion and the almost decades-long wait for some people? Absolutely. It delivers, at the least, a good time for those who may even just watch the show casually, and have even scoffed it off after years of shows that have spurned off from it like Family Guy. It's a reboot, if one can imagine, for those that think the show has gone too slack for the audience. But since it's an institution at this point, one of the longest running shows in the history of TV, what would one expect? <br/><br/>It also has what the fans want, even if it's in the smallest things like seeing Homer acting like the classic idiot that he is (and with a pig no less, going from Spider-Pig to Harry Plopper. in a single bound) or Bart acting like a proto Dennis the Menace skating through town without his clothes on (d'oh, spoiler). But it's also- as more than a few fans and observers have said- like one long episode of the series...which can be said about most animated TV-show-to-movie transitions (with the exception of South Park). Its plot is not too untypical for a Simpsons episode: Homer does something dumb, the town is in jeopardy, and only he and the rest of the family (more or less) can come to the rescue. It is a fairly simply plot, but then again, why carp? If the writers tried to shoot for the moon with something too ambitious- or, actually, more-so than I actually expected- they could've fallen flat on their faces. It's this level of quasi-simplicity that allows them to go for jokes that might not get on regular TV (this includes, to be sure, jabs at the 'crawl' at the bottom of a TV screen, and the old ""to be continued"" gag).<br/><br/>But this being said, as an extended episode, it's one of the best episodes ever made! Praise enough? What does a great episode have anyway? What about a great movie? There's a sincere attempt to just go for broke in terms of tackling all kinds of comedy: subtle and biting satire on current events (environmental mishaps, governmental s***-headedness and evil-doing, Tom Hanks), ""scatalogical"" humor, chiefly in the MacGuffin that triggers the rest of the plot (that's a good pig); total zaniness (want to see Homer split into a dozen pieces as he has to come to an epiphany while stretched to Dali degrees?); and subtle-to-obvious jabs at religion, family, alcoholism, Green Day, and of course the Hollywood summer blockbuster itself. Where else will one see a bomb-detonator robot shooting itself in the head over the pressure? <br/><br/>The gags come at ten-to-twenty second clips much of the time, and it even has (gasp) some of the heartfelt moments from early on in the series, surrounded by jokes that still can hit best with a packed audience. It is, simply put, a true crowd-pleaser, one of the best in recent memory, and definitely aside from Grindhouse THE movie so far this year I will want to watch again and again. Woo-hoo!"
"nirvana_rulz","5","6","18","26 July 2007"," Mediocre to the Max
","The Simpsons have entertained countless numbers of children,teens and adults but somewhere around the 10 season everything started going downhill! This movie is no exception. The main comedic source seems to rely on slapstick comedy, because when someone gets hurt its funny...not. The problem being we have come to love the Simpsons through its it vast range of different comedy styles, but most importantly it's previous wit and irony that was once employed by the show. Now it seems like recycled material trying to imitate the same humour family guy delivers. The difference being family guy knows what it is...the Simpsons doesn't anymore. The movie delivers tired gags and lots of low brow humour, probably enjoyable for the ages 3-13. I'd wait for it on DVD."
"kiran_kamtekar","5","6","18","26 July 2007"," A lot of potential gone to waste
","The Simpsons used to be the best show on television by far. This was a time when the stories weren't wacky, the homages to other shows/films didn't take up half the episodes and Homer was just someone who ""wasn't that bright"". Over the years Homer degraded into someone who was there to be stupid and get hit on the head with slapstick becoming the main form of humour. This film actually starts strongly with some big laughs early on but as soon as the story moves into the Dome section everything goes wrong. Most of the humour and plot has been done before in episodes (especially Homer having an epiphany and the townsfolk turning on the Simpsons). The Simpsons has a wonderful supporting cast of characters but absolutely NONE of them are used for more than a few lines. Instead it focuses on Albert Brooks' Cargill character. I'm a big fan of Albert Brooks' Simpsons appearances but here he uses pretty much the same voice as he did for Hank Scorpio (to the point where I thought he would pull off a mask to reveal he was Hank Scorpio). There were some scenes for the fans (such as the brief glimpse of Trillo and the wreck of the ambulance by Springfield gorge from season 2's Bart the Daredevil, but me and my 4 friends all agreed that the the film wasn't as funny as it should have been and in fact the last hour was simply dull as we'd seen it all before in various episodes."
"Matt_Layden","8","3","7","4 August 2007"," Fresh, Ambitious & Really Funny, The Simpsons Score On The Big Screen
","Homer dumps some 'waste' into a nearby lake in Springfield, causing the EPA to take dramatic matters. The decision is made to enclose the city in a dome, thus making Homer public enemy number one.<br/><br/>From 180ft paintings in the grass next to sacred images, to 7/11 turning itself into a Kwik-E-Marts and numerous TV spots on the fox network, it was no surprise that almost everyone on earth knew there about The Simpsons Movie. The longest running show on television, 18 years later is finally hitting the big screen. To say it was hyped would be an understatement. Can a show that has been falling down the ladder in quality and viewers make the jump to the big screen? Well, with 11 writers, all from the good days of The Simpsons, it's safe to say that they hit this one out of the park.<br/><br/>While they tried their best to keep the plot of the film under wraps before its release, the basic plot of the film was known to be before I saw the film. It did ruin a few surprises and jokes, but not the overall experience. Like Homer says in the opening bit of the film, why pay for something when you can see it for free on the television. Well, this movie is the answer to that. It pushes the envelope further, which is a luxury the creators have in the film world that they do not have in TV land. Where shows like Family guy appeared on TV and garnered big success, it seemed The Simpsons was losing a battle it was always winning. Now after it's big screen debut, The Simpsons, I'm hoping, is back on track to being the show it once was. What Family Guy failed to do with it's ""film"", which felt like 3 episodes edited together, The Simpsons does wonderfully. <br/><br/>The animation is crisp and up-to-date. Seeing this film did not make me miss the flowing hair on certain chef rats or big green ogres. While we have seen Homer in ""3-D"" it simply would not have worked here and I'm glad they stuck with the traditional animation. <br/><br/>For fans of the show, it's always fun finding those inside jokes scattered throughout the film, such as Homer finally making the jump over the gorge, a feat he failed to do in 'Bart The Daredevil' and the ambulance that is still crashed at the edge of the gorge. Aside from show references, there are hundreds upon hundreds of film references, which include: Titanic, Star Wars, Spider-man, An Inconvenient Truth and many, many more.<br/><br/>The film is definitely for all ages, both adults and kids, who are fans of the show, will find this film entertaining. While in the theatre the laughter was unison with young and old. The good thing is, you don't really have to be a fan of the show to get the jokes. There is enough comedy in this film for both parties. It does help if you know the history of some of the characters, such as Millhouse's lust for Lisa, and the cold heart of Mr. Burns. There are also some new characters introduced, whether or not we see them recurring in the show is another story. <br/><br/>The voice acting is on the spot here, which is what would be expected from the people who've been these characters for almost two decades. As with many episodes, there are celebrity guest voices, but I can't really say who lends their voice without giving away the joke/surprise that it's meant to be. <br/><br/>Yes, this does feel like a Simpsons episode stretch to 90 minutes, but that is a good thing. Crafting a film from a series that has been on the air for nearly two decades is a risky thing, but they pulled it off. The film is oozing of the first few seasons of the show, which are the best, but it's also fresh and ambitious. Those 11 writers for the show, show us that they care about these characters and prove to us that they are still in good hands. Will the success of the film, spread back to the show? I hope so. And to answer Homer's question. Why pay for something when you can get it for free on TV. Well, because it's funny, that's why."

All of you folks who complain that the show no longer measures up to it's heyday (seasons 3 through 9 in my opinion) and then go to watch the movie made from the show you were just complaining about deserve to be disappointed. ""The show is not as good as it once was"" Is anything? I have the feeling that no matter what went on in the movie some people would have found things to complain about. People complained that the plot was thin and then complained about the lack of favorite characters (Mr. Burns, Apu)who would have contributed nothing to the plot and would have only been inserted to throw out a weak one liner that these same people would then have complained about.<br/><br/>People complained that the studio didn't use the movie medium to push social or film-making envelopes like the South Park movie did. The South Park guys were just waiting for the chance to push that envelope and doing a movie gave them that chance. The Simpsons however, have always been more about subtlety. Would it have made anyone happier if Bart had came out and dropped an F-bomb?<br/><br/>The Simpsons have become an American institution (and yes, maybe even a brand) but in doing so they have also made a lot of people laugh, made a lot of people very happy.

","The Simpsons used to be one of the most razor sharp satires on television... about 15 years ago. Unfortunately - just like a lot of shows that don't know when to call it quits - the Simpsons TV show has become a fairly patchy, predictable and somewhat juvenile comedy  devoid of any great wit.<br/><br/>So I wasn't really holding out for much out of a Simpsons Movie  and sure enough  it was fairly patchy, silly and not all that razor sharp.<br/><br/>The plot (if you could call it that) involves Homer setting off a chain of events that leads to the Environmental Protection Agency placing a dome over Springfield as it has become too polluted (or something)... Although there are some sort-of-funny sequences  the writers appear to be more interested in sight gags, cheap laughs and quirky references rather than biting satire and mature humour. All of the characters are complete stereotypes (which has made the Simpsons to be rather stale TV show after almost 20 years).<br/><br/>Another thing about the Simpsons Movie  is that it just feels like an overlong TV episode  nothing has really improved or been enhanced to make it a ""big screen movie"" (just some better animation). I don't think a joke at the beginning (where Homer says why pay for something that is for free on TV) doesn't help The Simpsons Movie become a big screen event. At least the South Park Movie was made into something special (eg: a musical whilst upping the crudeness of the jokes).<br/><br/>Please please put this stale old family down...!"

","I'm a big Simpsons fan. While I haven't been watching the series recently I think I can say the writers are losing it. The Simpsons I know have something called wit. About the wittiest part of the movie was when Homer was stuck between a rock and a hard place. I saw this in the previews and it was mildly funny. Also, the movie does not take full advantage of all of the great supporting characters. I am not familiar with the current writing staff, but the writing was not in a Simpson's fashion. The entire movie the viewer has to sit through the slapstick part of the Simpson's which I personally do not find very funny. Three parts I did like: When the mafia is dumping the body in the river When the truck drivers are stopped at the ""sop"" sign. When the Dr. gets hit by the glass<br/><br/>Other than that this movie was very mediocre, in fact, quite boring at times.<br/><br/>PS- How can this be the Simpson's without Mr. Burns in a major antagonist role? That is what has been part of the Simpsons' success. There are character that we expect to be in certain roles.<br/><br/>Please feel free to share your comments."
"redsoxmb545-1","9","3","7","1 August 2007"," Simpsons Fans Rejoice!
","At last, after nineteen glorious seasons, the hilarity that is the Simpsons has been made into a full length theatrical movie. The Simpsons Movie is everything you could possible hope for it to be, and more. After Homer over-pollutes the river with an overflowing silo of ""Pig Crap"", Springfield becomes becomes the most polluted town in the wold. This causes the EPA to encase the entire town into a glass dome. Homer and the family escape, and now they must find their way (around their own problems) to save Springfield before President Schwarzenegger orders for the annihilation of the town. Simpsons fans rejoice, the movie is far from a letdown. It will leave you rolling in your seat with laughter with the rapid amount of hilarious jokes and gags. What makes this more than a bunch of Simpsons episodes strung together (besides the screen and sound format) is the depth of character explored and the focus of the story. In addition, The Simpsons Movie is much more offensive than a typical episode, with much more language and sexual humor. Parents beware, it earns its PG-13 rating. Even if you aren't a hardcore fan of The Simpsons, you'll still love this fantastic, outrageous comedy."

","It has been a long wait for the Simpsons to come out on the big screen, and it was definitely worth the wait, there was no disappointment. Funny from start to finish with plenty of memorable moments and chaotic situations. There were a number of old characters and locations, like Gabbo who appeared in a crowd of people and Springfield Gorge even made another appearance for those who remember the episode Homer tried to jump over it on Bart's skateboard. Although it did have more adult themes in it than the TV show, there were still plenty of laughs for the children. <br/><br/>Great Film, worth seeing multiple times."

But I expected more of it, maybe I got my hopes up a bit to high. Still I do feel it wasn't worth 10 bucks to go see in the theater.<br/><br/>They could've just brought it out on DVD like some other shows have done.

"FMACDONALD","8","3","7","30 July 2007"," One Of The Best ""Episodes"" Of The Series
","When Mike Judge brought his series Beavis & Butthead to the big screen, he made a commercial free 90 minute episode. Die hard fans that expected to hear the two idiot stars of the show swear and see nudity were extremely disappointed, while occasional watchers (like myself) thought it was hilarious. The result? Even though it was one of the highest grossing animated movies of all time, Beavis & Butthead were canceled the following year.<br/><br/>When Trey Parker & Matt Stone brought their series South Park to the silver screen, they slapped an ""R"" rating on their already ""R"" rated TV series and gave the fans what they wanted to hear, swearing and nudity. The film's plot revolved around the 4 main character's Stan, Kyle, Kenny, and Cartman swearing. The result? South Park was a huge success and recently celebrated it's 10th season on TV.<br/><br/>So where does the Simpson's Movie stand? Somewhere in between these 2 movies. While there are 2 scenes in the film that they could never get away with on TV, the film for the most part is a 90 minute commercial free episode. There's even a joke about that in the very beginning of the movie. However this isn't a bad thing. If they had Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie swearing on the screen it would have taken something away from it. I'm glad they stuck to what made The Simpson's such a great TV show.<br/><br/>In the beginning just about every supporting character makes a cameo, which is understandable, in a show that has over 1,000 supporting characters. There's even a great joke made by the punk rock band Green Day about the most successful, and over rated film of all time, Titanic. The Plot unfolds as Lisa gets the city of Springfield to clean up Springfield Lake (which is supposed to be Boston Harbor, yet another inside joke by native New Englander Matt Groening). After bending over backwards to get it clean, Homer decides to dump pig waste into it instead of the waste dump because the line was to long and he had to get to the donut shop for free donuts.<br/><br/>In doing this Springfield becomes the most polluted city in America and get's in-closed in a giant dome. In a nutshell everyone's life becomes hell, thanks to Homer Simpson.<br/><br/>The Simpson's is my all time favorite show, and I for one am psyched that they finally made it to the multi-plex after years of hinting for a movie. Die hard fans (like myself) will find it funny as hell, while even the casual fan (such as my wife, who I saw this with) will have a hard time not enjoying it. Over all it's just The Simpson's doing what The Simpson's do, just on a big screen, nothing more, nothing less.<br/><br/>A lot of people seem to think that the show has run out of steam, since the writing team split up to do Futurama. I have to disagree. I've been watching this series since season 1, and 18 seasons (yes you read right, 18 seasons) later, the longest running sitcom in history (I don't want to hear anybody complain about it's easier because it's animated) still has yet to let me down as I have never missed an episode.<br/><br/>It's nice to see that Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie have finally made it to Hollywood. However I can't help but think that maybe this could mean that the series is finally coming to it's end. If that's true I can only hope that maybe we'll see more of The Simpson's in Hollywood. That's something I can't complain about."
"real_a_lie","5","3","7","29 July 2007"," Hardly the cinematic event everyone was expecting...
","It's quite hard to know what to say about this movie without being overly critical, because I am after all an avid fan of The Simpsons (or at least the earlier series of the show). Unfortunately, however, the amount of publicity this film has received does not make up for the fact that The Simpsons Movie lacks any real substance and may as well be an extended episode of the show. Of course, it has its funny moments which got the whole cinema laughing, but everything that happens has been seen before, albeit in a slightly different fashion.<br/><br/>The storyline is absurd, even bordering on pathetic at times and whilst it is on the whole entertaining, there are no moments of originality (except, perhaps, whilst Homer is alone in Alaska). I suppose when a show has been running for as long as The Simpsons, it's inevitable that original ideas would soon run out. It's a pity, though, that the film hadn't been made ten years ago when the show was at the peak of its popularity and hadn't yet had recourse to bizarre, often senseless plots upon which The Simpsons Movie is based.<br/><br/>As with the new series, the film is padded out with large doses of sarcasm (which is occasionally very immature- for example, Ned Flanders shouting out ""penis""), unnecessary guest performances and Homer being injured several times in largely predictable ways. Given that it IS a cartoon, any inexplicable events may be excused, but I just didn't feel there was cohesion at times (for example, the whole of Springfield is trapped in a dome yet somehow The Simpsons are the only people to manage to escape).<br/><br/>So, I would say that I am very disappointed with this effort- or lack of it. The Simpsons will always be a great show in my eyes, but maybe what Homer says in the film is right after all: ""you must be suckers to pay for this when you can see it at home"". Little differentiates it from a normal episode on TV apart from the running time and slightly better animation."
"superrashid","9","3","7","28 July 2007"," A must-see for any Simpsons fan
","What do you get when you have the 11 best writers in Simpsons history work together? Comedic gold.<br/><br/>One of the biggest surprises to me was that The Simpsons Movie actually feels like a movie and not just four consecutive episodes. It contains one of the most ridiculous plots in the series' history and yet almost feels epic. It involves the Simpson family leaving Springfield. It also contains two mildly interesting subplots: Bart turning to Flanders as a father figure, and Lisa getting a boyfriend. I won't give away any more than that, cause I'd rather not ruin anything. The writing is great. No matter how bad Homer screws up, he still remains a lovable character who's impossible to hate (I also credit Dan Castellaneta for that, the voice actor for Homer).<br/><br/>From the opening seconds until the ending credits, the movie is hilarious throughout. Just as funny as any season one through nine episode. The film is PACKED with one-liners, sight gags, movie references, and the occasional inside joke. My eyes were glued to the screen the entire time trying to pick up on as many as possible.<br/><br/>I've always loved the voice acting in The Simpsons and thought it to be tremendous. But the actors go all out in the movie. Dan Castellaneta, Hank Azaria, Julie Kavner, and Harry Shearer were all excellent, but it was Yeardley Smith's (Lisa) acting that left be speechless.<br/><br/>My only real problem with the movie was the length. 85 minutes is just not enough to do justice to one of the greatest comedy shows of all time. I would loved it to have been 10-15 minutes longer. And the lack of Mr. Burns was also slightly disappointing.<br/><br/>Sure being a Simpsons geek I'm probably be slightly biased. If you dislike the show, you'll probably hate the movie. But if you're a fan of the show (like myself), you'll love the movie. It's laugh-out-loud funny, while still having a lot of heart. It's as simple as that."

","I am a long time fan of the show. I thought they should do a movie and looked forward to the movie, but if you really appreciate the amount of action, the willy-nilly progress of plot development, and the pow-pow-pow of the comments and references of the half hour show, it is natural to be a bit cautious about the onset of a 90 minute (or so) version therof.<br/><br/>Did my duty, skipped work in order to view the Simpsons movie on its first outing.<br/><br/>It lived up to the Simpsons characters and to the depiction of history as: ""just a lot of stuff that happens."" If you are an Alaskan, you are in for a special treat. 'Nuff said.<br/><br/>Although it has some must-see moments, all in all it's not a lot more than the average television episode crams into the half-hour slot of its existence. (And less than is sardined into the three stories per half hour of the Halloween specials).<br/><br/>There were Simpsonic characteristics that were simply missing in action: Weird plot twists - The movie gives no sense of the incredible ADD leaps that can take place in the first five minutes of a standard Simpsons episode.<br/><br/>Attention to characters and objects. In the movie, several characters show up and then kind of disappear, or seem underutilized.<br/><br/>Conclusion: Definitely worth seeing, but suffers from lack of compression. Some aspects borrowed from Futurama. If you are not a Simpson show watcher, this is a good intro. The TV show packs more punch in shorter jabs."

Burns, Barney, Moe, Wiggum all sidelined and given cameos in favour of new and frankly desperately unfunny characters like President Schwarzenegger and Russ Cargill.<br/><br/>Sad, we'll always wonder whilst watching our favourite episodes ""what could have been""...

Homer(Dan Castellaneta),the dim wit he is, puts Springfield on the brink of disaster by dumping a silo of pig poop in the lake. The contamination is brought to the attention of President Arnold Schwarzenegger and he has the EPA place a massive thick dome over Springfield. Little Maggie discovers a ""sink-hole"" that allows the family to escape before the community has their way with Homer. The Simpsons make their way to Alaska; before Marge(Julie Kavner)and the kids leave Homer behind to return and save Springfield from being blown to kingdom come. Bart(Nancy Cartwright)wishes he has a better relationship with his father. Homer returns to go from goat to hero as he cracks the dome to let Springfield thrive again.

Every character got a chance to shine and it was surreal seeing my favorite show growing up on the big screen. I was worried that the writers would throw in a bunch of ""four letter words"" just, because they could. Which would have seemed awkward, but thankfully they didn't. The movie was very quickly paced in my opinion. I was very surprised by the time it was over, because it seemed so quick. Homer was definitely the star of the show, but there was a story for the whole family except Maggie, but she had her ""cute"" moments. All in all I can't wait for a sequel if they make one at some point in the future."

Before the movie release there were some moments while discussing with other fans on forums and other stuff where I thought the movie was going to disappoint but hey!! what I was thinking??? lol, immediately I calmed myself knowing that it was created by the same genius that have been filling our lives with simpsonmania all these years, I thank God for their existence. I know each simpson's character has its own fans club but it wouldn't have been possible to give each one a long appearance time in a coherent way, it would have turned the movie slow and without sense, Just know you watched the best simpsons episode of all times!!!!. I believe the most important characters had their moment:Moe, Mr Burns, Krusty, Flanders, Comic book guy, Skinner, etc. you see, I can't list all of them because now I notice that they all had their moment, obviously I will always wonder why the absence of Sideshow bob, maybe in the sequel.<br/><br/>Finally: Simpsons fans, you can't lose this movie, it is really a masterpiece, it is the best gift, the reward to all those who never lose a chapter, to all those who constantly talk about the simpsons on every funny conversation, to all those who have adopted simpsons modes and ways, to all those who love them as I do."

","As a long time Simpsons fan, I fully expected to enjoy this film. I did. Face it, I've EASILY watched 4 Simpsons episodes back to back and that's LONGER than this Movie.<br/><br/>Before going I wondered if the film version would bring anything extra to watching the Simpsons, it does. Many times there were huge complicated and detailed shots that really made seeing it in the theater very enjoyable. The film might look as exciting on a large HD TV, but it certainly blows the doors off watching the Simpsons on a standard set.<br/><br/>And seeing it in a theater brought a new Simpsons experience for me, a live audience 'laugh track'. I suddenly was aware of how much the audience was enjoying the film as their laughter filled the theater.<br/><br/>As for the story, in classic Simpsons form it threads a huge number of gags together that lead to the primary driving force of the story. There's no need to be specific about the story as it's the Simpsons, anything goes. There is a brief segment after the Simpsons leave Springfield that's about 10 minutes long where the film lags, or at least I wasn't laughing (but was still entertained). Interestingly enough a majority of the children in the audience found it funny. After that it's fast paced classic Simpsons action leading up to the explosive ending.<br/><br/>About the only real disappointment I had was that they didn't do a huge musical number. Maybe they'll have one in the sequel (there is a tease for it at the end). <br/><br/>BTW  Stay for the credits, they fill them with a few things here and there to make them worth sitting through. In fact when the credits started the people sitting in front of us stood up to leave but then stopped (and blocked our view) when they realized they were going to miss more of the film. I think it's the first time I've ever had to ask someone to sit down in a movie theater."
"Rectangular_businessman","5","2","4","14 June 2010"," Not so good as the series
","The Simpsons Movie is suffering from everything excellent that has lasted a very long while, sometimes just there for too long. There is nothing you can reproach to the way the movie is done. This is a super professional work, respectful in the way that it propose to the public a highly polished work. The problem is elsewhere, from an other nature. I have been a fan of The Simpsons since they started in the 90's. I have watched them on TV when I was a teenager then I bought the DVD box sets when they get released lately in the 00's. I pass them very often, this American family being in some way for me, an other family of mine. I have not had the chance to see how the show had become. From what I have read everywhere, this has decreased and it is no longer funny. I only own the DVD up to season 11 and already do not like the eleventh season. Too different in Essence from what I used to love in the Simpsons. Too unrooted. So let's say I am a fan of the ten first seasons. I adore. Adore. Adore them. But not this movie.<br/><br/>Not very funny movie, except for couple jokes which I think they weren't meant to be jokes. There is too much stuff going on that isn't necessary for the plot. And the jokes that are meant to be as jokes, are dry (note: I'm not usually against dry jokes!) and they are trying too hard thus failing at being funny.<br/><br/>The TV series is (was) thousands of times better than this. I can't recommend this movie for anyone - and especially not for Simpsons fans."
"wildanimals","7","2","4","9 April 2008"," Inferior to the TV show, but not bad on its own merits
","While it is no masterpiece, The Simpsons Movie is one of those few TV-show-turned movies that didn't want to make me gag and kick the TV screen (think Tom and Jerry: The Movie.) I feel that The Simpsons has gone down in quality in the last few years, so this movie pleasantly surprised me. It won't win any awards, but as a long time Simpsons fan, I was not disappointed.<br/><br/>The plot is a simple one which involves Homer indirectly causing Springfield to be enclosed in a giant dome. It is up to America's favourite yellow family to save the day. The plot plays out like a regular episode, but it is slightly more surreal. Obviously, there is quite a bit of filler, but it is entertaining filler so I can forgive the film for that.<br/><br/>My only real major quibble with this film is that it is simply too odd at times. I remember The Simpsons as being a down-to-earth show, and there are sequences here that look like they have jumped right out of Balto II: Wolf Quest. They are funny sequences, but unnecessary.<br/><br/>What I like most about The Simpsons Movie is that it knows that it is nothing groundbreaking or spectacular, and it doesn't try to be anything different. If you are a fan, this is definitely worth checking out, because it has more than enough replay value."
"bregund","5","2","4","30 March 2008"," From a die-hard Simpsons fan
","I've been with the Simpsons since the very beginning, when I enjoyed the short cartoons on the Tracey Uhlman show. Even before that, I've been a fan of Matt Groening's work since the Life In Hell syndicated comic, and I fondly remember Akbar and Jeff (""lovers, or brothers, or possibly both""). Who knew that the sly satirical comedy of Matt's genius would translate so well to one of the longest-running TV shows of all time. It's amazing that the show has always found writers who can capture this spirit of satire, which walks a fine line between both portraying and ridiculing the typical American family and the characters with which they are surrounded. Granted the show has not always been spectacular, but it has always been among the best shows on television.<br/><br/>So with such a storied pedigree, you would expect the film to be just as spectacular. Unfortunately, it suffers from what a lot of TV-to-movie translations suffer from: it's difficult (and apparently impossible) to translate a 30 minute program to a 90-minute feature film. First off, Marge's voice sounds weird. Because the characters have breathing room in the film, there is no incentive for them to speak as fast as they can before the next commercial break, so all the snappy, witty dialogue that I have come to expect from the t.v. show has been slowed down so much that the characters sound like they're sedated.<br/><br/>Secondly, I have a huge believability problem with the film. Granted it's a cartoon, but it is physically impossible for Homer to ride the motorcycle at that angle inside the dome, for Bart to be able to reach the little hole at the top. In addition, pig poop is an organic waste, it's not some weird chemical that would cause genetic mutations in a squirrel, this whole thing was just beyond stupid and unwatchable, I had to hit the mute button during that. Also, the part where Maggie moves in and out of the sinkhole was lame, the physics of that are just impossible.<br/><br/>Third, the eskimo woman sequence just comes out of nowhere, it doesn't make any sense whatsoever. I guess I expected a lot more parody from the film, at first I thought they were parodying Misery with that sequence, which would have been really funny, but instead it was just some lame plot device to get Homer to realize how self-centered he was being.<br/><br/>Overall, there is a weird ""reality"" type feel to the film, all the lightheartedness of the t.v. show has been sucked away to leave a harder, grittier Simpsons that I don't think a lot of people expected. In a nutshell: the film isn't any fun.<br/><br/>As flawed as the film is, there are several bright moments that still make it worth watching: Homer and Bart on the roof, Homer daring Bart to ride the skateboard naked, the scene in the gas station when Bart doctors the wanted photo, Flanders constructing the hot chocolate. I'm glad I finally saw this movie, not because it was an entertaining way to spend an hour and a half, but because it proved that not everything is translateable to the big screen.<br/><br/>Given the considerable talent and cash behind this film I expected much, much more."

Well, I never really asked for a movie about The Simpsons, but curiosity is often stronger than the interest itself.<br/><br/>Despite the fact that I grew up during the time when the famous TV series was at its best and the fact that it has been going downhill during these last years, I was still curious (although apprehensive) to see this film once I heard about it.<br/><br/>In my humble opinion, this is a mediocre film. Let's be frank: it isn't much better than the modern episodes of the popular TV series. Yes, it has its moments (some good and funny parts), but not much more besides that. However, this motion picture has something that makes it more distinguish than the episodes of ""The Simpsons"": an original story and the Simpsons family in Alaska. Not to mention that the Alaska's artwork is pretty good here - not bad for ""The Simpsons"". The important message about preserving our environment is also something distinguish about this. <br/><br/>Nevertheless, this is no way ""The Simpsons"" which I grew up with.<br/><br/>I'll also list some of the things I disliked most about this movie. What's the point of Green Day's crappy music? And that ""Titanic"" joke when Green Day sink? And those cameos of Tom Hanks, Arnold Schwarzenegger and others? And, the most important, what happens to the pig? We never see the animal again after the Simpsons escape from their house on fire - the pig was there, left behind and is never seen again. Did the poor animal die burned? I am glad that the Simpsons's dog (Santa's Little Helper) survived, but it bugs me not to know what happened to the pig.<br/><br/>Speaking of the pig, he's the funniest thing about this film. That pig is weird and ugly, but hilarious (especially whenever he imitates Homer).<br/><br/>Overall, for those who grew up with ""The Simpsons"" I recommend this a try. But don't expect too much. This isn't like ""The Simpsons"" from 1989 to nearly the end of the 1990's."
"The_Hippogriff","5","2","4","12 January 2008"," These aren't The Simpsons I know
","The transliteration of a successful TV series into a film isn't a new things, but it seems that no one learned from past mistakes. Orrible movies are the rule, and this movie is the proof.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie isn't a complete disaster, but the result is miles further from the wonderful TV series. Some scenes are hilarious, but are car lamps in a foggy morning.<br/><br/>I can find three major points that affected my vote:<br/><br/><ul><li>The first part of the film is too longer than the second, they aren't well balanced. The first part seems a stretched TV episode, the second a confused collage of scenes. It seems the result of a tidy writer (or with tight deadlines) who decided to cut some scenes to finish as early as possible.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The spectator familiar to The Simpsons has a deja vu feeling through the whole movie: many scenes seems copies of TV episodes.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>The greatness of The Simpsons is the ability to create a caricature of a ""common"" American town and generally of the USA in short episodes, little pills of wisdom. With 90 minutes the result would have been extraordinary, but the result is poor. I expected something linked to nowadays great themes (War on Terror, US elections and so on), but the lack of courage (or money matters) created a family movie without the original wit.</li></ul><br/><br/>My vote is composed of two parts:<br/><br/>Vote as comic film for families and teens: 6 Vote as ""The Simpsons Movie"": 4<br/><br/>The mean is 5"
"jaybob","5","2","4","18 December 2007"," Devotess of the TV show STAY AWAY
","The movie is a mess.<br/><br/>What we have here is a 79 (long) minute cartoon with 8 minutes of credits.<br/><br/>My partner & I barely chuckled a few times. no laughs at all.<br/><br/>When we watched TV episodes we always were laughing out loud & expected to do the same,<br/><br/>We get our films from NETFLIX & see about 25 per month.so this cost approximately $ 1.00<br/><br/>We feel sorry for those that spent up to $ 14.00 (per seat) to see this waste of talent.<br/><br/>Also we do not understand all the good reviews, You all had to see a different film.<br/><br/>This is one of the most disappointing films of the year.<br/><br/>Ratings: ** (out of 4) 52 points(out or 100) IMDb 4 (out of 19\)"
"ghr-12","6","2","4","27 August 2007"," Reasonably entertaining, nothing more. The youngsters will love it.
","8.0?! I think this movie will settle at 7.6 in time. Entertaining, not bad, but little wow factor.<br/><br/>It is difficult to write 10 lines about this movie, there just isn't that much to write about. Perhaps that is why IMDb is uncharacteristically misleading on this one.<br/><br/>Generally entertaining, but this was really just a longer episode with most of the same old stories being re-played yet again. Looks like it is aimed at 12 year olds who I suspect will love it and then look back 10 years from now and wonder what they were thinking.<br/><br/>Definitely fun to see on DVD, but living in London where it costs $20 a person, if you are lucky, it just isn't worth it."
"Philby-3","7","2","4","18 August 2007"," The Simpsons you pay for
","Why a movie-length Simpsons? No doubt money had something to do with it (this film has grossed $US 125 million in the US alone in three weeks). The huge team of writers have not taken the opportunity to do much different from the usual string of gags, sight and otherwise, delivered at breakneck speed. There is a rather mawkish re-affirmation of ""family values"", but then the Simpsons have always had a sentimental streak. When it comes to authority, subversiveness comes to the fore - the US Environmental Protection Agency will not be urging people to see the film  though small government advocates might.<br/><br/>The sets and crowd scenes are a little more elaborate than those in a standard TV episode; the Alaska scenes are quite beautiful. Although the writers have produced witty and intelligent stuff they stop short of anything that might offend any sizeable portion of their audience. Religious belief is an example. Homer is not the fervent believer that Ned Flanders is, but he goes to church nonetheless. Casting a lovable central character as an atheist is simply not acceptable on US television.<br/><br/>Lots of the secondary characters get a gig, but often a very short one. Baby Maggie gets to utter her first word, right at the end, in the credits, which, by the way, are just about the longest in cinema history and include a sizeable portion of the population of Korea, where much of the animation work was done. If you like the Simpson on TV you'll like the film, but it goes no further than an above average TV episode."
"tastyhotdogs","4","2","4","12 August 2007"," Ordinary- as expected
","Went into this expecting not a whole lot. Some of the recent TV-movie adaptions (South Park, X-Files, in which I fell asleep etc) were terrible. This proved to be no exception.<br/><br/>The plot revolves around Homer dumping some pig excrement into a local river that causes a massive overflow of pollution. The EPA decides to place a dome over Springfield so that it well never harm the outside world again. The Simpsons manage to escape the dome, but when they hear of a plot to blow up Springfield, decide (eventually) to return and try to save it.<br/><br/>As you'd expect a few OK jokes, but the storyline was just terrible. It had to be a big story, but this missed the mark badly. They should have done this with the ""Who Shot Mr Burns"" story or even the brilliant ""Behind the Laughter"" episode. Too many key characters given little screen time (Moe, Ralph,Mr Burns, Skinner etc) and too many potential story lines not explored enough ie Flanders and Bart. I started to get restless it was that boring.<br/><br/>D'oh."
"andymac67","7","2","4","11 August 2007"," Overwhelmed with what to do with all that extra time in the movie?
","Have to agree with jdwhite in his review. Just saw the movie tonight and while it was a thrill to see The Simpsons on the big screen and in a movie length feature, it was good but not great.<br/><br/>It had it's moments but there were also parts that were rather weak I thought. It's like they were overwhelmed with what to do with all that extra time. It lost a lot of character because the ""characters"" (the various faces of Springfield) just weren't very deep. We only saw a small percentage of the characters that make up Springfield and not much focus on them.<br/><br/>Would I buy the DVD when it's released? Absolutely. It's a must for anyone who is a fan of The Simpsons.<br/><br/>I give the movie a 7 out of 10.<br/><br/>It's still amazing when you see the credits at the end and you realize just how many of the voices have quite a few characters that they play."

","A long time now since I wrote up anything on here about a movie. I saw this with my wife and teen-age kids last night and well,no surprise here they loved it as if it were the stuff Oscars are made of. My better 1/2 and I laughed at most of it,blushed at certain moments and cringed in others. Cringing at the sight of Otto and his paraphinelia and Marge taking God's name in vain and other moments that made me feel like donning a big hat,trench-coat and dark glasses!<br/><br/>No trouble with Bart's nude skateboard ride,happy to say. I and my familyhave had healthy discussions about body acceptance. We're all Simpsonswatchers here and for a feature length film it was good. maybe were I closer to my kids' age,I might rank it higher. Such is the price ofbeing an adult and parent.<br/><br/>We discussed it after we went home,then all was right again. my rating is seven because of those blushing-cringing moments. I'd still see it again though."
"lee_musson","6","2","4","31 July 2007"," Good But not Great
","Lets face it The Simpsons belongs on TV in 20 min episodes and thats where its finest moments can be found. The movie is overlong, relies heavily on visual comedy and lacks the satirical cutting edge of the best TV episodes. That said, it's entertaining and there are some very funny moments. Homer is hilariously stupid and steals the film. Shame some of the supporting characters don't get more air time though. I wanted to see Mr. Burns more as well as Apu, Sideshow Bob and several others who were barely seen. The first part of the film is good but the middle part isn't that funny. It does pick up towards the end but never reaches the pinnacle of the best Simpsons episodes. I think they should have worried less about having a plot and spent more time writing those great gags. Still, after 15 years a good effort."
"altima-2","7","2","4","30 July 2007"," Circus
","A good movie, though it is not worth re-watching. I expected more from it because the series offered more than you can find in this film. You could expect to see clever jokes and interesting situations, irony and satire. But it all is not about this movie. Whereas the TV-series are a poignant satire, depicting modern culture, politics, customs, the Simpsons Movie is just a funny full-length cartoon for those who'd like to relax and see some family and story which have nothing to do with reality. And that's it. In this movie they even don't show the US President himself - you find Schwarzenegger there instead of Bush. You can spend some time for the Simpsons Movie to have a relaxing evening. Though you'll never find in it anything so hilarious as in the series."
"rivermonk","6","2","4","29 July 2007"," A big disappointment for a big fan of the series
","I have been a big fan of the show since the early 90's and have watched the series morph and develop into something very different over the years. Although the last ten seasons or so have not compared to the first eight or so, there have still been some gems that continue to draw me to watch.<br/><br/>I was a big fan of the the South Park movie and even the Power Puff Girls movie, both of which took each series to a new level.<br/><br/>I approached The Simpsons Movie with cautious optimism and refused to let all the hype set me up for disappointment. Despite the fact that my expectations were set on medium, it pains me to say that I was still disappointed. The movie has very little of the cleverness of the series and although there were some laugh-out-loud moments, it was at best a long, mediocre episode.<br/><br/>I imagine that casual Simpsons fans will find the movie to be a better than average comedy, but die-hard Simpsons fans will be left feeling short-changed."
"sky_bull","7","2","4","28 July 2007"," Something for EVERY Simpsons Fan!
","First of all, let me start by saying that I was definitely planning on waiting for the DVD of this movie. I was convinced that I wouldn't be missing anything that I could see every night for free! Alas, the trailers were relentless, and mercilessly drug me out to the local movie house. Boy, am I glad I didn't wait! There was so much big screen goodness you could not possibly look away! Believe me, if you ever loved The Simpsons, from their humble beginnings on the Tracy Ullman show up to now, you will like this big screen treat! Even though it had just a tad of ""PG-13 naughtiness"", it wasn't enough to keep the whole family away. All ages in my theater were laughing up a storm, including me! Congratulations to the writers for maintaining Homer's ""nuclear dad"" image as well! This was his best performance yet! You can easily get caught up trying to recognize the whole population of Springfield, or picking out all of the props from previous episodes or just sitting back and enjoying the plot(there actually WAS one!!). Anyway you approach it. There is something for EVERY Simpsons fan in this movie, so if you've ever liked them, what are you waiting for??"
"mbhfromla","7","2","4","27 July 2007"," Not bad...though I would rather see it on FOX, but hey it's the simpsons and their legacy would not be without a motion picture.
","The Legacy of the Simpsons is that of 20 years. What began as 30-seconds on a Sunday variety show on a network that at the time was a struggling attempt at appealing to a generation of young badasses, would morph into an 18-minutes a Sunday (or thursday) of entertainment and education all rolled into one, a tradition which continues to this day and for many more. As a society, We laughed, We cried, We found hobbies, converted religions, started diets, used catch-phrases and bought so much crap all in the name of THE SIMPSONS.<br/><br/>Now, after 20-years of hopelessly waiting and writhing, it's a film. 87 minutes, but well worth it. For you see, what would a proud tradition like the Simpsons be without this much embellishment. I will say that this was a typical Hollywood Blockbuster complete with the late John Williams and Panaflex (well it was actually animated), but hey, whatever keeps the motion picture companies.<br/><br/>Cheers to Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, Abe, and the whole town of Springfield. We'll see where things go from here.<br/><br/>I give it a 7."

"Coffee_in_the_Clink","7","0","0","27 March 2020"," Better than I remembered it to be
","I remember being underwhelmed and disappointed when I saw this in cinemas back in 2007. A big fan of ""The Simpsons"" (Really, who isn't?), it has still taken me thirteen years to watch the long-awaited movie again. My initial reaction to the film was wrong. Perhaps, as can often be the case, expectations are too strong and a critical analysis can be far too premature around something as big as a movie adaptation of one of the greatest TV shows of all time, so it requires another viewing once the dust has settled and the spotlight has moved on. Not that I am advocating that the second viewing be more than ten years later! But this time certainly let me forget most of the film and allow me to view it as though it was a first viewing. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is better than I remember.<br/><br/>Springfield Lake is a cesspit. The townsfolk of Springfield have been dumping in it for so long that the lake has turned almost volcanic. When the band members of Green Day are killed on the lake when their barge sinks into the sludge, Mayor Quimby - in a rare moment of being proactive - announces that the lake is to be cleaned out and then cordoned off to prevent any more dumping. A few days later, Homer saves a pig mascot from being butchered at Krusty Burger. He adopts the pig and acquires a silo to keep the pig's crap in. When it is full to bursting, Homer decides to break the barrier and dump it into Springfield Lake. This becomes the straw that breaks the camel's back, and it causes such horrendous pollution that it attracts the attention of the US government, who, in order to save the rest of America from the pollution, drop a large dome on to Springfield, sealing the inhabitants inside the town and preventing any entry in or out.<br/><br/>There are plenty of good laughs here and a good contingent of our favourite Springfield characters are given screen-time. The story is a bit pedestrian for a movie and by the time we are in the second half of the film in Alaska the laughs dry up and it does start to drag a little. Still, ""The Simpsons Movie"", although a far-cry from the show at its best, is by no means near it at its worst, or even most average."

","I think this movie is a good movie and has some half decent jokes in it, but if you want to see what the real Simpsons looks like, Watch the first few seasons of the show.<br/><br/>In the past couple years Homer has kind of sucked as a character and this movie represents that perfectly. He is a stupid, lazy bum that doesn't care for anyone but himself. In the first few seasons yes, he is a little slow witted. (Not to the extreme though) and yes he is a little lazy. But he still loves his family and will do what ever it takes to keep them safe and help them. This Homer is not the real Homer j. Simpson.<br/><br/>My favorite scene was the part where Cheif Wiggum told his monkey to attack Maggie. Maggie takes her milk bottle, smashes it, and makes motions to stab it. I liked it because it caught me off guard.<br/><br/>One thing I didn't like was the love story line with Lisa. I just think it didn't go anywhere and was only a way to give Lisa something to do in the movie.<br/><br/>Overall, it isn't a bad movie but if you like the classic Simpsons characters, this movie is not for you."

I wouldn´t say that its a good movie for kids who are younger than 8 years old, because it has scenes were kids are hurting and parents that are bad at taking care of their kids. Particularly homer is very bad at taking care of his kids. But the no care taking is making the movie funnier, even though its a bad thing.

","I absolutely love The Simpsons. It´s my favorite t.v show, and I feel it´s still watchable to this day. Seasons 1-11 are fantastic, 12-20 have a huge chunk of great episodes, and since Season 21, there´s been some episodes that I didn´t care much for (ones that I found forgettable and not that entertaining), but there is still some pretty good stuff here and there.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is enjoyable. The one big issue I had with it is it should of been made in the 90´s, when people still cared about the show. The fact that it took 18 seasons to make a movie was ridiculous.<br/><br/>Other than that, I really liked this movie. It´s about Homer adopting this pig, and the pig fills this silo up with waste, so Homer needs to dispose of it. Then he is in a rush, so he decides to dump it in the lake, even though Springfield made a new law that there will be no dumping in the lake. Homer dumps it, the lake is poisoned, and now Springfield is put underneath this huge dome because of Homer´s mistake. It is now up to Homer to save Springfield and its people from being destroyed and killed.<br/><br/>I thought the story was pretty good, the animation is amazing, the voice acting is great, and it had some funny comedy to it. I will say right now that Homer Simpson is my favorite cartoon character ever. Yes, he was a selfish jerk in the beginning, but then he learns his lesson and helps his family and friends out, and I thought that was proper character development.<br/><br/>Overall, I really liked The Simpsons Movie. I wouldn't say it is as awesome as the show, but still a very good movie."
"leftistcritic","8","0","0","12 March 2019"," Witty and funny, harkens back to Golden Age of The Simpsons
","I recently watched this movie again as I was looking to fill up some time. While I've watched this movie, directed by David Silverman, probably 5 or 6 times before, it was still enjoyable. It features the common voice actors, Dan Castellaneta (voicing Homer Simpson, Abe Simpson, Krusty the Clown, Groundskeeper Willie, Mayor Quimby, Sideshow Mel, Mr. Teeny, an EPA officer, Itchy, and Barney Gumble), Julie Kavner (voicing Marge Simpson, Selma Bouvier, and Patty Bouvier), Nancy Cartwright (voicing Bart Simpson, Ralph Wiggum, Todd Flanders, and Nelson Muntz), Yeardley Smith (voicing Lisa Simpson), Hank Azaria (voicing Moe Szyslak, Chief Wiggum, Cletus Spuckler, Professor Frink, Apu Nahasapeemapetilon, Lou, Comic Book Guy, Captain McCallister, Bumblebee Man, and Dr. Nick), Henry Shearer (voicing Mr. Burns, Smithers, Ned Flanders, Reverend Lovejoy, Lenny, President Arnold Schwarzenegger, Seymour Skinner, Kent Brockman, Dr. Hibbert, and Otto Mann), Pamela Hayden (voicing Milhouse Van Houten, Rod Flanders, and Jimbo Jones), and Tress MacNeille (voicing the Medicine Woman, Agnes Skinner, Crazy Cat Lady, Colin, and Cookie Kwan). Additionally, long time Simpsons producer Albert Brooks whom is voicing the ""mad with power"" (as a fellow EPA worker tells him at one point) head of the EPA, Russ Cargill. I know some reviews of this film go down to even 2 stars, I'm rating this film 8 stars and I'll fully and completely explain why.<br/><br/>For one, while this film has annoying elements, like Lisa having a sort of boyfriend (an Irish boy named Colin, whom is also passionate about the environment), if it can make you laugh, then it is a victory. The film features Lisa, as the heart of the show, leading the charge to clean up Lake Springfield which is polluted by everyone in the town, which is sanctioned by Mayor Quimby who declares ""code black."" However, Homer, as you would think, it utterly impulsive, slowly fulfilling the prophecy that Grampa Simpson tells the shocked churchgoers (seemingly comprising most of the town of Springfield), after dumping the waste of a pig he adopted in the lake because he wanted to eat donuts. As a result, the EPA, led by a corporate hatchet man, Russ Cargill, quarantines the town in a dome to ""contain"" its pollution, which is sanctioned by President Schwarzenegger (which should have been Ranier Wolfcastle/McBain instead, as this ruins this longstanding Simpsons parody) in a glass dome, trapping the citizenry.<br/><br/>Soon, the Simpsons family (Maggie, Marge, Homer, Lisa, and Bart) are targeted by a torch-wielding ""mob"" comprising all of those in the town. Even Colin is in the ""mob,"" although it is hard to say if he is there willingly or happened to be there. In fact, they would have gone to the wrong house had Homer not pointed out they were going the wrong direction. They escape the town thanks to a sinkhole, yet the town ""mob"" dumbly doesn't follow them while the Simpsons house is quickly destroyed by the sinkhole, apparently. From there, the Simpsons family is on the run from the EPA, which can't manage to track them when they go from Springfield to Alaska, which includes crossing international borders (the Canada-U.S. border two times). If we suspend belief, this narrative is otherwise compelling.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Springfield has descended into ""utter anarchy"" in this dystopia. Soon, Homer selfishly wants to stay in Alaska, their new home, but Marge and the rest of the family go back to Springfield. It is here there is a hilarious criticism of the NSA as utterly incompetent, with the one analyst shouting ""we finally found someone we are looking for!"" Keep in mind this is before the Snowden revelations, showing that the concern for mass surveillance is nothing new to say the least. Another criticism I liked was of how Homer describes the fellow church people, saying that these pious people believe in their ""phony, baloney god,"" knowing they will hear him, while publicly he puts on a face that he cares. This raises the question of how religious Homer is, after all, if it's all just a front of some sort. It reminds me a bit of The Miracle Woman (1931) by Frank Capra, especially of the beginning scene when Florence Fallon (played by Barbara Stanwyck) condemns her fellow churchgoers as hypocrites and liars, although she was much more forceful. The criticism of the rich is evident, with Mr. Burns saying at one point that ""finally, the rich white man is in charge"" (or something to that effect) when Dr. Hibbert, Apu, and Chief Wiggum ask for power to be supplied to the city, which he doesn't do. Clearly, Mr. Burns is representative of the evil capitalist, as he, in a credits scene, and has a dark side, as he is fine with watching someone commit suicide!<br/><br/>I'm not sure, personally about the depiction of indigenous people in this movie, represented specifically medicine woman, as it makes me feel a bit uncomfortable in that it seems to feed into a stereotype. But perhaps that's no surprise as Apu himself is a stereotype, even more so than the medicine woman. Even with that being said, I liked the fan service of the motorcycle, with Homer and Bart above it, jumping over the Springfield gorge, over which Homer and Bart had failed in their attempts to get across it in the past, and getting across thanks to Bart's slingshot.<br/><br/>While I have my reservations about this movie, especially wondering if this movie can be considered canon since it would mean that any episodes after this movie could get awkward since the house was utterly destroyed, as were their possessions, I would say that it is generally enjoyable and I would recommend it. If this movie is not canon, it would make sense because it would explain what happened to people like Russ Cargill, the President, Colin, and other characters just for this movie. I understand the criticisms of this movie, but I just have to disagree with them, as I've stated here. With that, my review of this film comes to a close."

","30 July 2007. The movie version has the same raunchy and rather insolent manner of the television series. The humor, the characters are the same. The transfer to the big screen captured the feel and animated enjoyment of the television experience. However, the big film feature was missing the anticipatory big name guess stars that this venture might have had an opportunity to portray. There was some good moral tales along with the more violent and adult-skewed scenes. The movie seemed to waiver in its attempt to continue onto the big arching theme of disaster and maintain the intimate level of television entertainment. The opportunity to focus on some of the minor characters was lost and the opportunity for more depth overlooked for the more pure entertainment, action. While a fun summer animated event, it was missing the fireworks that a major film is expected to produce. Seven out of Ten Stars."

","Well, the title ""The Simpsons Movie"" is probably the most accurate in film history as of course here we have the big screen full feature film approach to one of the most successful animated series of all time. And even if this 85-minute movie is already over a decade old now, it is from way way after when the series started back in the 1980s. And of course, you will get all the most known characters here from the Simpsons universe. There are some topics here that felt more serious than I expected like Homer's risking of his marriage and family, which admittedly came out of nowhere to be fair with Marge leaving it all behind, even if she did not want to stay in Alaska. Bart gets a little story about being neglected by his dad and looking for solace in Ned Flanders of all people. Yeah well, this did nothing for me to be honest. And the way it gets solved at the very end pretty much shows how insignificant and shallow it was. Lisa gets a little romance story with a musically talented boy, but this one was weak too. Actually it was Milhouse stealing the scene there on more than one occasion. So I would say they key story lines, also the motobike part, are not as crucial or as good as they could, maybe should, have been. What I would have liked instead for example could have been a nice story line with Mr. Burns as main antagonist, but he is almost non-existent here, his one scene with Smithers making gestures is outrageously funny though. The big glass ball around Springfield, well, it is among the better parts of the film I guess and it's fine they included it. But not that great either. The moments when the movie shines are those that are minor and not with big references to the key story. One example would be the hilarious pig (spider pig). Another would be the ways in which Bart's genitals are covered in the most creative fashion really with a nice little reference about censorship in American films. Itchy and Scratchy show up early too briefly, very early in fact, so regardless of which character you like the most, there is one for everybody really that you will enjoy depending on your preferences when it comes to the long-running series. Oh yeah, Side Show Bob was missing right? Shame. I really like him and like I said earlier, he could have been a great antagonist as well. But they did not take the traditional film route here with good vs. evil. Then again can you say Homer is a good character. Well, maybe flawed, but likable, but good? Lisa perhaps is the one who comes closest to goodness. I must say the deep meaning about fathership here, or family life made virtually no impact for me and it was clear that despite all the trademark comedy, the makers also wanted this film to be taken seriously from the dramatic perspective, from the emotional perspective. But for that it is not good enough. It is not better than the series, basically you could say it is 4 tolerable Simpsons episodes put together with a long story line. And as such it works without a doubt. Not Simpsons peak level, not South Park level, but still delivers constantly and consistently laughs from start to finish. I think you may want to give this one a go and give ti a thumbs-up, but yeah this is the kind of film where it is not really necessary to hand out a positive or negative recommendation as everybody who considers watching this one shuld definitely have seen enough Simpsons stuff, enough episodes, to make up their mind themselves. Still I say go for it. Make your journey to Springfield. The comedy is definitely the highlight here and there are almost no moments that felt forced from the fun perspective that it was unfunny or awkward."

","Somehow, 'The Simpsons Movie (2007)' packs all the smart writing, charismatic characters and undeniable belly laughs of the hit show into a tight, ninety-minute frame without diluting any of it, coming across as a slick feature-length edition of those first few series that everyone seems to love (though obviously not eclipsing them). Its only real issue is the fact that it feels more like an extended TV episode than a proper cinematic experience. This isn't really a huge problem, though, since the established format is already stellar as it is; more of a good thing certainly isn't bad, at least not in this case. This feature is absolutely one of the funniest I've ever seen, carrying the torch from the television program that never fails to make me chuckle. Its revamped animation translates wonderfully to the big-screen, with the plot's events also having tangible consequences for the future of the franchise. The witty, wonderfully satirical script creates some incredibly memorable moments, leading to perhaps the perfect send-off for the Simpsons family (who still grace our screens today but aren't anywhere near as revered as they once were). The movie is always an amazingly entertaining, endlessly rewatchable time. 9/10"

"ironhorse_iv","7","0","0","24 May 2018"," Call me, Mr. Burns, because I thought, the Simpson Movie was 'excellent' even with its flaws.
","There was a period during the 1990s when it was impossible to avoid the unstoppable juggernaut that was 'the Simpsons'. The animation show aired on the FOX broadcasting network was must watch TV! However, those days are now over. With adult-driven animation shows being more couple, due to the thanks of cable networks like Comedy Central & Adult Swim, 'the Simpson' doesn't seem as funny and unique as it once was. It has really became, yesterday's news. In order to spice up, the show's ratings; in 2007, between Season 18 & Season 19, the sitcom created by Matt Groening & produced by James L. Brook, finally decided to make a full length movie with their writing and animation staff, after sitting on the idea for so long, since 1992. Thus, the first real steps of 'the Simpson Movie' was born. Directed by David Silverman, the movie tells the story of the working class family having to save Springfield from the Environmental Protection Agency, after Homer Simpson (Voiced by Dan Castellaneta), over-pollution the town's lake. Without spoiling the film, too much, I have to say, it must had been a challenge to make this movie. After all, they had to construct an overall story that they haven't done before for the die-hard fans, while, also bring forth something familiar. For the most part, they kinda achieve it. Taking elements from Season 2, Episode 4: 'Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish' & the opening parts of Season 4, Episode 12: 'Marge vs. the Monorail', 'the Simpson Movie' molded a compelling adventure story that was strong enough for movie length. Unlike, their first try, with Season 4, Episode 1: 'Kamp Krusty' idea, at which point the movie plans were dropped in favor of a season premiere. Numerous other ideas were also attempted, such as the Simpson saving the manatees, which was later used in Season 17, Episode 1 '""Bonfire of the Manatees"", and a parody of 1998's 'The Truman Show'- which was later used as the plot in 2007's 'The Simpsons Game'. Groening even expressed a wish to make a musical parody of 1940's 'Fantasia', which also fell through. In the end, the environmental dome story was chosen. However, there are some debate if this story is honestly original, as some people had speculated on a perceived similarity between this movie and Stephen King's 'Under the Dome' novel. Regardless of that, the biggest flaw within this story, is how much, the sub-stories are tiresome rethread. Seeing, Ned Flanders (Voiced by Harry Shearer) try to win over, Bart Simpson (Voiced by Nancy Cartwright) felt like old news. We already saw this formula plot in past episodes like, Season 7, Episode 3 'Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily' & others. Even the idea of Marge (Voiced by Julie Kavner) threating to leave Homer for being a selfish, apathetic dick, isn't really new. Also, the way, the movie resolve, these issues in the climax of the film, doesn't feel complete or fulfilling. If anything, Homer's normally idiotic, selfish behavior is still around in the end. It's clear, that the film doesn't know, how to do, character arches; as the epiphany really didn't do much to change or evolve him. In my opinion, the movie would had done better, if they didn't make Homer into such an unlikeable jerk. At least, the movie would be, more watchable, as we can honestly root for the protagonist, rather than being dragged along with somebody, we don't care, as much. Despite that, I think there is only one sub plot in this movie that wasn't really needed, and that was Lisa Simpson (Voiced by Yeardley Smith) falling in love. Those romantic scenes really don't add much to the main plot. Plus, her relationship with the boy never really carry on, the main show, afterwards. It was totally pointless. It felt like filler. Regardless of the flaws in the story, as a fan of 'the Simpsons', I can safely say that, outside of a few good episodes here and there, this movie has the best animation. There is noticeably more prominent shading, a broader color palette and conspicuous CGI abound, not to mention a handful of more fluidly-animated scenes which were animated in-house that was really well-put. As for the voice performers, they all do a fantastic job. Even, guest voice actors like Albert Brooks, Tom Hanks and the band, Green Day did an amazing job. As for the jokes. It was a hit and miss. Some action sequences were really funny & smart, such as the breaking the fourth wall opening act with Homer yelling at the theater or Fox running ads for shows in the bottom of the scene. Even, the political satire were hilarious and clever. I kinda dig the jab at NSA (Natural Security Agency) listening in, to everybody and the scenes where the oil companies playing Alaskans to keep quiet, while they rampage the state's natural resources. They were very interesting. However, there were some jokes that seem really dated or flew over the heads of most viewers to understand; such as parody of 2006's documentary, 'An Inconvenient Truth"" & Easter eggs such as seeing a crashed ambulance near the gorge from Season 2, Episode 8 'Bart the Daredevil'. Those are a little bit, harder to catch. Regardless, the movie is probably best, watching on the internet or buying on DVD, than waiting for it to air on television; as it has been known, that certain sequences like the penis & flipping off the bird scene within the movie has be cut or altered by FOX network censors to fit in with FCC practices. Overall: While 'The Simpsons Movie' will probably not outshine any fan favorite episodes. It's still a triumphant collaboration of nearly a dozen of the series' best head-writers and producers. The result is a film that's truly worth watching for any die-hard or casual fan. Like a juicy donut, this is one movie, worth drooling, after. It's a must-watch."

I think the movie was very funny. Mostly because of Homer. He did many fun things like almost destroy the city to get donuts, and making the famous song spider pig spider pig, and when Bart left Homer in a very emotional moment he just said "" you can hold the bomb"" and that is how he made it good again. The final concusion is that the movie is a masterpiece"

","I'm not a massive fan of TV shows turning into movies, most of the time they are just chancing their luck and trying to earn some quick dollar. Only a select few that have garnered a following or popular fan base deserve the big screen treatment. The Simpsons is one of them. In this ninety minute episode, residents of Springfield have been the biggest contributor to environmental pollution. The government take action and seal them off in a giant dome, before eventually wanting to blow the city up. It's up to the Simpsons to save the city. If you aren't a fan of the series, then you shouldn't be watching this...it's not going to change your opinion. It really is just a longer episode with a heightened scale of grandeur, improved fluid animation and a variety of different jokes. If you are like me and enjoy the series, then you'll be sure to come away from this feeling entertained. Plenty of pop culture references from a pig dressing up as famous characters (Spider-Pig and Harry Plopper...) to Green Day dissolving in an acidic lake. It's what The Simpsons is famous for, consistently humorous references injected with a quick witted script to appeal to all audiences. We've got lines of dialogue that joke about race, homosexuality, age...they've pretty much covered all the bases. It's obviously nothing crude, adhering to the tame nature of the TV series. A bountiful of past Springfield residents get plenty of screen time. There is always something amusing about Ned Flanders, and he does have the most quotable line. ""Thank you lord for this bountiful PENIS!?"". The plot moves along speedily, perhaps too fast in certain areas and does delve into issues about marriage which are unfortunately shrouded by the main story. The humour does grow tiresome by the end and my smile slowly melted away. However, this is a delightful watch. It's not going to set the cinematic world on fire, but it's good enough to pass the time."

","Many fans of The Simpsons Movie were very critical of it. While I understand why, the fact is that many of them just don't realize that this film wasn't made for them. Criticism range from the film not being edgy enough, to the fact that the film didn't take place in Springfield and didn't utilize the side characters much, but again, the film wasn't meant for the die hard Simpsons fan. While the show has been on for more than a quarter century, prior to the films release, ratings for the show were in the toilet, and it was only being kept alive by syndication and merchandising money. The point of the film was to be childish and geared towards a younger audience. While fans of the show were expecting the film to be extreme like the South Park movie, what they got amounted to little more than a children's movie. The fans were upset, but the studios gamble paid off, as the ratings went up and have continued to be much better. For those who didn't see it, the film focuses on Homer, who made the mistake of polluting the town, to a point where the EPA put a big dome over Springfield to separate it from the rest of the country. As angry town folks form a mob, intent on getting Homer, the family escapes and goes on the run. The film is far from being the best the Simpsons has to offer, but it served it's purpose in attracting younger viewers and raising the ratings. Fans may have been upset with Matt Groening, but what he did saved the show for who knows how many future seasons. The film isn't spectacular, but it was good for introducing new fans to the characters we all know and love."
"Min111","Null","0","0","12 October 2014"," Finally the first Simpsons movie
","So after seventeen years, the first Simpsons movie finally came out which I found pretty shocking, considering the success of the Simpsons television show.<br/><br/>The Simpsons movie was an instant success according to me, despite many criticising the plot.<br/><br/>The story is about how Springfield causes massive amount of pollution, and the pollution Springfield seem to cause keeps on getting worse and worse according to the EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). The EPA then goes to the US President, and provides the President options on what to do with Springfield. Initially, the EPA hands out a warning to Springfield, that any more polluting, then they will take drastic action, and that every waste must be disposed away in an appropriate and derogatory manner. Springfield took that warning well until one man, Homer Simpsons, disposes the waste into the lake due to lack of care, and him wanting free doughnuts, since a shop that sells doughnuts at Springfield is shutting down apparently. Problem is that no one is allowed to dump things in the lake again, and the EPA has evidence of Homer doing all this. Springfield is now in massive trouble all thanks to Homer, who along with his family must now save Springfield from the EPA, who plan to destroy the city.<br/><br/>The Simpsons movie was a good and successful movie. One of the major problems was that the movie didn't involve much of the other Simpsons characters such as Apu, Flanders, Skinner and so on, and people wanted to see more of them, so its feels like a proper Simpsons movie.<br/><br/>But the movie had plenty of humour, and will certainly keep the viewers entertained. The movie is short, sweet and simple, and most certainly lives up to its name.<br/><br/>Its a good, fun animated-comedy movie for sure, and there's not much else to say really.<br/><br/>The only surprising thing I found was that it's the only movie of the Simpsons, and you would've thought that with such a successful television show, there would be more Simpsons movies by today."

","It's been awhile since I've seen The Simpsons Movie, like 5 years. No doubt, The Simpsons was a great show growing up, that I can't believe is still running for 25 years. The Simpsons used to be my favorite TV show 15 years ago, I don't watch it too often now and I have some of the Halloween episodes on DVD which I got from the Supermarket. However, it seems like almost everybody prefers the older episodes, pre-2000. It just seems like the newer episodes don't have as much appeal as the older episodes. I remember watching a Simpsons YouTube video in it with Justin Bieber from an episode and I saw how the top comment said, ""R.I.P. The Simpsons 1989-1998."" Yeah, those were the good old episodes, even if you watch the TV show on TV nowadays they don't often times show those episodes on TV anymore. If they did start showing the older episodes on Fox, I'm sure The Simpsons would have more viewers than they do now, so I think Fox should start showing the older episode reruns. We can ask what makes this movie not as good as it could be. Well, they try to be funny as obviously the newer Simpsons episodes try to be funny. But, while the movie might have some funny scenes, it seems like the movie mostly tried to be funny and tried to show slapstick humor that a lot of us probably didn't think was too funny. It seems like the most memorable scene from this movie was when Bart Simpson was skateboarding naked. I felt bad for Bart after that scene seeing his sad face. What made this movie not too good, well there didn't seem to be much characterization in this movie. We didn't seem to see as much of the regular characters as we see on the show. They had brief scenes, but nothing much about them. In the show and especially older episodes they had humor as we got to know basically all the characters in Springfield from a single episode about them. It seems like the whole plot in the movie was how Springfield was covered in a dome because of pollution, and the people in the community tried to get out of the dome and protect their own city from the government, making the government and Arnold Schwarzenegger look like bad guys and you kind of feel bad for the people of Springfield and Homer Simpson even if it was meant for comical purposes rather than serious purposes. What was really good about this movie. Well, I've seen TV shows made into movies and often times the movies don't make it look like an episode from the TV show. Instead, they add things that are quite different from the TV show. An example I'm thinking of is The Mighty Morphin Power Rangers Movie. I remember how while they did use the same characters and tried to have the same kind of plot they had on the TV show for a movie, it was too different from the TV show and seemed to lose it's appeal that way and didn't follow the TV show as much as the Power Ranger World Tour Show did so the World Tour Show was better. So, enough about Power Rangers. The Simpsons Movie looks like it's an episode rather then it's own independent movie. We see the same characters and the characters act the way they do on the show. We see similar scenes and types of humor from the movie as we do on the show. We also see things like a message across the screen as we do on the show making it look like you're watching The Simpsons on Fox. So yeah, it's great that it stays along with the show, not just changing the themes around. However, it could have been better written as I heard that this movie was rewritten so many different times. I don't know what plot could have made it better, but probably one where it's more about the characters and less about what's happening in Springfield. Overall, I'd give this film a 7/10. In school often times 70-79 would be a C. I'd have to give it a 70 where it still passes, but barely. I almost gave it a 6/10, but I think it's fair to give this movie a 7/10, but still a C-."

","Title: The Simpsons Movie<br/><br/>Condensed Storyline: After Homer pollutes the Springfield lake, the whole of Springfield is incased in a giant dome and the Simpsons go on the run from the government <br/><br/>Notable Acting: This movie has a sound cast of voice actors who I think are the people who do the TV show, I am not too sure. But it would make sense to have the people who do the show, do the movie. They all do their parts great, especially the people who have over 10 roles to fill<br/><br/>Animation: The animation is almost identical to that of the current Simpsons TV show, so it is high class and very fun to look at. <br/><br/>Incorrect Science: Bleeding Gums Murphy is seen in the angry mob, even though he had died 12 years before this movie. The rest of the movie's flaws can be summed up in two words, ""Cartoon logic""<br/><br/>Overall Feel: My first though is, why isn't there another Simpsons movie. This whole movie feels like a normal episode of the Simpsons, but longer. It has all of the normal story lines a Simpsons episode would have, it has all the normal humour and jokes a Simpsons episode would have. If you're a dedicated fan, or just a person who watches the show from time to time like myself, you will like this movie as it feels pure and feels like an actually Simpson episode but longer as I mentioned."
"RyeDough","6","0","0","22 July 2014"," A Disappointing Mismatch Of Infantile and Original
","It is clear from the outset that this movie is designed for a younger audience. It's excessive use of slapstick violence and an unrealistic plot is a stark contrast to the traditional, more subtle and often sarcastic humour of the original series (in the good old days). <br/><br/>At the same time, however, innuendos creep that are perhaps not 'adult' but certainly for maturer audiences. Jokes about 'playing with yourself' and implied sex scenes (see parents' guide). Whilst these do represent the television series better, and whilst they aren't immediately obvious and would sail over the heads of a younger audience, it has to be said that it does leave me asking questions about who the intended target audience is. It seems to me that the team have just tried too hard to make the movie suit everyone.<br/><br/>The movie itself is mildly funny, but quite frankly that isn't good enough for a COMEDY. I mentioned the plot earlier which, to recap, is too ridiculous, and I was also quite disappointed that many of the series' regulars barely featured (e.g. Apu, who I only remember having 1 or 2 lines).<br/><br/>I guess the movie was OK. It certainly did the show justice for younger viewers, and thus gained a brand new audience for the show. It did however leave many teenagers like myself feeling rather disappointed. It wasn't AWFUL though."

","Back in the 90's, my friends and I were desperate for a Simpsons movie. There would be a rumor that it would happen, but then it turned out to be false. So, when a Simpsons movie was finally announced, we were excited.<br/><br/>Yeah, it took 2 decades for a movie of our favourite TV show to come out. Yeah. One of the biggest problems with The Simpsons Movie is that it came too late. The show had been going on since 89 and in 2007, Simpsons mania was wearing thin. <br/><br/>The show was going downhill for the fans. The episodes got weaker and weaker showing that the writers had lost their touch. This is what happens when you have a show that's been running for too long. It's like a joke that's been repeated over and over again.<br/><br/>Whereas the South Park movie came out 2 years after the debut of the show and Beavis and Butt-head Do America came out 3 years after that show debuted. Those films worked really well and still hold up.<br/><br/>The main problem with this film is that the whole plot involves Homer dumping pig crap into Springfield's water. Really. It took 11 writers and that was the best plop...... sorry, plot that they can come up with?<br/><br/>Also, Grandpa's possession was just lame. I know the filmmakers needed to get a plot here and now, but having Grandpa be possessed like that was just lame and un-Simpson like.<br/><br/>Other scenes I hated where: - Bart drinking whisky. Honestly. - Bart drawing on the most wanted picture in the shop. Seriously, how did the shop keeper not recognize them immediately? Also, the joke where the family who look like the drawing and get caught was done before. - ""The soft, tough, soft, tough"" gag is NOT funny. The filmmakers found it funny, but not the audience. <br/><br/>Also, it's not as exciting as the South Park or Beavis and Butt-head movies. <br/><br/>I remember leaving the cinema with my friends going ""Yeah, it was good, I guess. Not brilliant, but good."" But does it hold up after 6 years? Not really. Too many pop culture gags. Which is never good, cos In 20 years time, someone will watch this movie and not get the pop culture gags at all.<br/><br/>Now here are the things I did like:<br/><br/><ul><li>The score. Hans Zimmer is a genius. - The scale. When the dome is put over Springfield, it looks amazing to watch in the cinema. I love it in movies when things look enormous. - Marge's video tape to Homer. There's just something so realistic about Julie performance in that scene. - The climax is kind of exciting. Springfield looks incredible in those shots. - Homer's line ""Risking my life to save people I hate, for reasons I don't understand.""</li></ul><br/><br/>PS. How did Russ Cargill get on the cliff to point the shotgun at Bart and Homer? Also, how did Maggie get there? And how was she able to lift a big heavy rock to drop on Cargill. Plus, when Homer and Marge are on the motorbike driving down the forest, howcome no glass is there from the broken dome?"
"giggitygiggitygoo451","6","0","0","27 February 2013"," Some Glimpses Of The Old Genius
","The Simpsons Movie is curious. What was one of the greatest television programmes ever broadcast until season eleven, and a very good show until season fourteen, eventually nosedived by the time it reached season fifteen, and the quality of this monumentally enjoyable series plummeted into the rock bottom territory in finds itself in today. The film is an unusual experience, as it offers a mixture of both the great and awful periods of the show and, to its credit, creates a new standalone experience of its own, meaning that despite any criticisms, at least it feels like a legitimate film, not just an overlong television episode.<br/><br/>The story itself however is all over the place, an effect I suspect the writers may have suffered after nearly twenty years of the show being written to fit twenty minute time slots rather than nearly ninety. The plot of Homer bring about the family's exile from Springfield after causing a major environmental disaster, and their eventual attempt to return to the town when they hear of an evil plot hatched by a dastardly government agent, is amusing and gives the Simpson family plenty of screen-time, particularly Lisa who gets a surprisingly affecting love story sub-plot, but as it progresses and more crazy and uneven plot-lines develop, it feels like the writers are struggling to keep it moving forward. Despite avoiding the trap of feeling like an extra-long episode, the film's plot just seems incapable of sustaining itself throughout the whole running time, and occasionally becomes desperate for momentum.<br/><br/>Despite this, Matt Groening and his team should take pride that at times a bit of the old magic that made the show so legendary in its time manages to shine through, and some excellent jokes and one liners are breathed into The Simpsons again, something which looked almost impossible given the standard of the series for the last few years. But the film certainly has some extremely funny moments, including the popular Spider-Pig. The cast are all on fine form, some actually seem better than they've been in sometime, and some of the past guest stars make an appearance, such as Joe Mantegna and Albert Brookes, who makes a hilarious return as shady government agent Russ Cargil.<br/><br/>That being said, it's not always hilarious, and although we see some of the old high quality again, we also see a lot of evidence of the huge drop in standard of The Simpsons, with some blatantly unfunny moments and some cringingly bad jokes. I firmly believe the improvement of the show's animation only emphasized the poor quality of the newer episodes, and similarly with the film, the high definition, crystal-clear picture of the new and improved animation often reminds us that this is not the same Simpsons that changed the way we view television comedy series. This constant reminder of the drop in quality isn't helped by the fact that there are just times where the film is not funny. It tries very hard to be, giving it an occasional feeling of self-consciousness that doesn't feel right and actually makes the jokes more unfunny and a little awkward. This mixture of both hilarious and banal jokes is strange, and it really feels as though we're watching a classic older episode that has been spliced together with a terrible new one.<br/><br/>Another weakness that in the film's defence was to be expected, up to a point, is the lack of adequate screen-time for most of the supporting characters. In fairness, expecting every one of the many minor characters to appear for a large amount of time is unreasonable, as even if they were each given just five minutes to themselves, the film could have run for hours. However, some characters, such as Chief Wiggum and Mr Burns, are given a satisfying amount of time to shine, merely a few funny lines or a couple of amusing moments, but that is plenty of time, and in that case, the same certainly should have been expected for other hugely popular characters like Krusty, Moe or Apu, who, although make a brief appearance, are robbed of any memorable or enjoyable moments. I don't ask for huge sections devoted entirely to these specific characters, just the couple of lines or small moments that would have satisfied everyone.<br/><br/>Worse than this is that some characters don't even make a real appearance at all, appearing only briefly in the background, such as Mrs Krabappel, Barney, or my personal favourite character Sideshow Bob, whose scene was cut entirely. During the film, there is a fantastic shot of all the townspeople, looking fantastically detailed in the sharp and refined high-definition picture, but what is the point of even animating them at all if they don't get the screen-time they deserve? Realistically, it would have only added a maximum of ten minutes to the running time, which I can safely say we all could have survived with.<br/><br/>Despite these faults, there is something the film should be applauded for- it gives depth back to the Simpsons themselves. One of the truly great things about the series was that the characters were three-dimensional. They had an emotional aspect that felt real, something sorely missed from the series for several years. The film brings that back. For the first time in years, we feel for the characters. We want Homer to do right by his family. We want Lisa to be happy in herself. We even want Bart to say ""eat my shorts"". This vital ingredient has been absent from the show for some time, and is most welcome in the film.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is an interesting film. It mixes good and bad aspects of the show, along with touches of its own unique style, and overall succeeds pretty well. Whether it's a nostalgic glimpse of the show's glory days, a sad look at the state it's in today, or just an entertaining ninety minutes you're after, this film has it."

","I've never really been a fan of ""The Simpsons"", not even during its glory days in the early 1990's, so I can review this movie on its own merits. In fact, I rented it to watch with my girlfriend who likes the show more than I do. She didn't seem to get too excited over it either.<br/><br/>Basically, the story is about Homer adopting a pig and causing it to mutate, and he accidentally poisons Springfield's water supply with its excrement. He and his family are run out of town, but soon afterward the EPA learns of this and the Schwarzenegger-like US President is convinced to put a giant dome over Springfield to prevent the pollution from spreading. Homer and his wife and kids, already outside of Springfield, travel around and eventually decide to do something about the dome.<br/><br/>Besides its length, the only difference between this movie and any regular Simpsons TV episode is that you get to see Bart's genitalia during the skateboarding scene toward the beginning.

","The Simpsons has spawned beyond the television world. With merchandise like toys, games etc, it has become a pop culture phenomenon around the world and virtually anywhere with critical acclaim from children and adults alike. Now finally going to the silver screen as eagerly anticipated, The Simpsons Movie is a neat film but could have been much better, probably than it should.<br/><br/>It begins in church where Grampa has a mental breakdown though he could sense things in the future. 'Twisted tail! A thousand eyes! Trapped forever!!Eeepa! Eeepa! Eeeeeeepaaaaa!' Apparently he is correct to all of them. 'Twisted tail!' meaning literally a twisted tail from a pig Homer adopts called Plopper or Spider Pig or Hairy Plopper.'A thousand eyes!' from a mutated animal with a countless number of eyes, 'Trapped forever!!' meaning the huge glass dome covering Springfield for it damaging the environment.Eeepa! Eeepa! Eeeeeeepaaaaa! is also right. Although it is an acronym for Environmental Protection Agency,EPA.<br/><br/>Later on, an angry mob of Springfielders attack the Simpsons house as Homer (accidently) caused the 'pollution' by dumping a silo with Plopper's feces in a river (which it recently then was being cleaned as decided by Lisa). The river once again becomes dirty and a squirrel becomes mutated in it. The citizens find out it was Homer's silo as it was labelled with his name on it.<br/><br/>The Simpsons are trapped in their own house by the angry mob which the only way out in one piece is by the sinkhole in a sandbox in the garden. They each jump through, Homer struggles through but eventually makes it. The sinkhole gets larger and larger and sucks in the family's property and destroys the house. The Simpsons are now homeless with their wrecked yet vacated house uninhabitable.<br/><br/>They flee to Alaska while the EPA are looking for them for Homer's silo incident. The Simpsons mostly have a swell new life at Alaska. Meanwhile, back at Springfield, the town tries to break through the wall, to no avail. The furtherest they have proceeded was a mere crack. Head of the EPA, Russ Cargill, sees this and then has another 5 options for the president. He picked number 3 for the first 5 but was clued into an intended choice by Cargill - Blowing up Springfield.<br/><br/>The Simpsons see an advert which declares a new Grand Canyon in the same site as the would be obliterated Springfield. Aware that it is an intended destroying of the town, the family decide to go back to Springfield except Homer who thinks they don't need as the citizens tried to kill them. Homer stays in Alaska whereas the five go back. He eventually leaves Alaska soon though his family are found by the EPA and taken back to Springfield.<br/><br/>A bomb is activated in Springfield. Homer gets in the town through a hole at the top. He rides a motorcycle with Bart holding the bomb around the top of the dome. He throws the bomb at the exterior of the dome, which explosion cracks the glass and destroys the dome. Cargill is knocked out and probably killed by Maggie by a rock, Homer gets a good reputation from the town, the Simpson's house is being rebuilt and everyone in general is happy. The End.<br/><br/>I indeed saw The Simpsons Movie at the cinema. I was anticipating it months before its release. Though it probably was released earlier in the UK, there were floods in the country that had some stores and stuff closed. Rough time there. The film is generally good. It has funny and creative moments, rich animation though it could have been smoother and is memorable. But it was disappointing, it was like any other. The Simpsons years ago was not.<br/><br/>I understand the effort here, that the script had been rewritten numerous times but one time, it was originally intended Season 4's premiere 'Kamp Krusty' to be the movie. The episode didn't fit for a film but a Simpsons film then could have been great as the series was much better then.<br/><br/>Overall, a neat transition from possibly the most famous cartoon family ever and would please fans of the series and possibly others."

","Before I say anything, this is the friggin Simpsons movie, go see it. A movie 18 years in the making is alone worth price of admission. But (sigh..) I hate to say anything even remotely bad about The Simpsons; the original animated show that is above and beyond funnier than any other sitcom styled series imitators (ahem, Family Guy), and has brought me so much laughter over the years without resorting to using a gimmick (*loud cough* Family Guy)...the movie still, isn't, ah, erm, perfect. Although I went in with very high expectations being a super nerdy lame-o Simpsons fan, I was a little bit disappointed because its seems like they used all their funny segments for their trailer and advertising. But the biggest problem seemed to be that the writers were overextending themselves to make this a movie with the Simpsons, instead of an actual Simpsons movie. The Simpson family seemed very out of their element because of a big moralistic crafted center, weird awkward jokes made to attend to a broader audience, and side characters and scenarios that didn't quite match their shows counterparts. Maybe I'm just saying all this because I am just to big of a fan of the show and nothing in my mind will ever match the series genius, but that's what happens when you a super critical bitter nerd like me who gets offended if someone doesn't know what ""In Rod we trust"" means.

"elshikh4","6","0","0","8 February 2010"," What ? How ? and Why ?!
","WHAT?<br/><br/>While the viewing, I wrote some lines that could develop a review later, but I was in confusion what to entitle it, so read some of the nominees: (Not The Simpsons Movie; It's The Average Simpsons Episode!), (When 20 Minutes of Comedy Drag for 87!), (Disappointing!), (Not The Movie We Wanted!), or (Real Boring Episode.. But where is the movie?!!). However, mainly, I was in great confusion about the movie itself, asking: What was that anyway?!<br/><br/>HOW?<br/><br/>I'm a fan of the original TV show. And if you're one, you have to be angry all the way. The Simpsons is a wacky ride, and important part of its secret remains in its sophisticated details whether in the drawings or the gags, the constant satirical spirit towards EVERYONE and EVERYTHING, and playing all of that in fast pace. Accordingly, this movie must be hanged, or at least not to be called The Simpsons. And it excruciates me even more when I see at the closing credits how this movie was written by a little army of scriptwriters, leaded by the show's creator, and some of its writing's stars, with consultants as well!<br/><br/>The writing was a catastrophe. If we come out of one episode with a huge amount of fun, then with a movie, a cinematic one, we must have more than that, read: 10 doubles the fun. But not this time. Because there are no swift gags, or parodied pop culture. I thought that I was watching a ""live"" Disney family movie from the 1960s, but with sneering at the politicians. I don't know why they didn't use this incredible bunch of characters to produce comedy during, for instance, the city was under siege?? (For me, I adore Mr. Burns, he's my favorite, however all what he had was a scene?!!). The thing was that it didn't low the bar only, it gave us bad and dirty jokes too: The red Indian lady's breasts, Bart is unclothed, Bart is drinking, and the city's ignorant doctor is brutally murdered at last?? Look at a moment like when Melhouse knows about the bomb; his response was wearing a garbage basket! Is any of that funny? Not Simpsons funny, but just funny?? The answer is NO. It seems like stuff written by Ralph Wiggum!!<br/><br/>And when it comes to the drama, don't get me starting; the storyline of Lisa and her boyfriend was totally aimless and humorless. Bart and Ned's was only interesting at the end. Some events were reused from the show; like Lisa got a boyfriend, spots of Homer's pet on the roof of the Simpsons' living room, Homer knows something about himself through primitive magic after acrid drink, Homer jumps over the canyon. Some moments were provocative. I mean what was the need to show Bart drinking Ned's cocoa, then cutting to dirty water that Marge wipes on the floor! Or seeing Burns, while the closing credits, talking about suicide (??) that was vague and useless. Basically, these closing credits weren't as half creative as some of the show's. Let alone the last shot which was a real killer; Homer is fixing the roof badly, so what's dazzling about that? Rather what's new?? I'm sure that utterly blank last shot is a reason why this movie will be hated by a lot of people. It's the weakest end that a movie can get!<br/><br/>And where are the cameos??? I remember just Tom Hanks? Well, sometimes there were more than 4 high guest stars in one episode, now with a *Hollywood movie* all what we got was Tom Hanks??!! Tom is fine yes, but where is the rest of Hollywood for God's sake? Busy doing cameos for the show??!!<br/><br/>The cinema's medium is different than the TV's. That truth is painful when it had been carried out here. Simply the cadres got no sophisticated details, and relayed much on the close-ups. Believe it or not, for the shows' addicts, that was one true reason for feeling the bore harshly. It made the TV show more cinematic I can tell you that!<br/><br/>It comes to its senses in only the last 10 minutes as a comedy, visual riot, and drama. But that, apparently, was not enough. It even will make you ask yourself burningly: why the previous 77 Minutes weren't as hot as that??!! Aside from that sequence, I can't find something that good to hold to. Maybe the wildness of the main idea. Couple of lines and scenes (and I mean just couple!). Plus the extremely romantic finale between Homer and Marge. Though as a whole, none of that did ""leave us laughin'""!<br/><br/>WHY???<br/><br/>It can join the list with the mystery of killing JFK, the accidents of Bermuda triangle, and the fact that there are actual fans of ""The Bold and The Beautiful""! Some may refer it to the self-fancy, excessive confidence, blah blah blah. Others may refer it to the fact that the team of writing was working since 18 years already, so they consumed the good ideas early. Well, I don't think this or that. I think that this movie didn't have the appropriate time all along. The show was running during the making of this movie, so they were working in the movie, and in the episodes together. Working in 2 things together always leads to: 2 bad things, or one bad thing. Anyway, I know that this movie wasn't that good, to a degree that makes you think whether it's a work of guys copycatting The Simpsons, or it's the show's makers doing their job insufficiently!<br/><br/>Wanna the truth? The show is better; it's dynamic. This one is sluggish."

","I've been a long-time Simpsons fan, but I agree that this movie was a poor effort on their part. I do indeed agree with most of the negative reviews, but most of the people who flame this movie aren't really that honest about it and don't give enough insight to really say what made this movie bad. So here we go, a much more honest review from a long-time Simpsons fan: The storyline was really generic and like others say, it does seem like propaganda, but that's not why I didn't really like this movie all that much. Animations were indeed spectacular, but I'll be lying if I said they weren't trying too hard to impress audience members, because let's not forget, a majority of today's typical viewers care more about animations than quality, which I find sad. As for humour, this is the most important category, in my opinion. It was there, I did laugh a few times, but it was really lacking and I really felt it was trying too hard. Worst thing was that Homer was basically unlikable throughout the entire thing when he's usually a pretty lovable guy from time-to-time.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie was really average in my eyes. It had potential and just barely passed. If you're a Simpsons fan boy who thinks all Simpsons stuff HAS to be awesome and the best ever, you're fooling yourself, but who am I to say you can't enjoy it? If you do, go ahead. If you're a hater who never liked Simpsons in the first place, then just don't bother commenting on, let alone watching, this movie in the first place.<br/><br/>That is all."

","It's a shame that this movie didn't take the opportunity to expand its horizons beyond the confines of the TV show. <br/><br/>If anything, there was less substance to the plot than in the average episode, particularly one from the earlier years when the satire was front and centre. There were very few scenes with anyone other than the core characters, which rather diminished the whole experience. Expecting to carry 90 minutes in a narrower scope than the usual 22 minutes was really asking too much. <br/><br/>What jokes there were seemed to have been written predominantly to appeal to a younger audience. Perhaps the fear was that older movie-goers would not wish to be seen attending a cartoon and therefore a different demographic was needed. There were a handful of the slightly edgy comments that reflect the ""old"" Simpsons, for example running a preview ticker along the bottom of the screen. However, for the most part these felt perfunctory, almost as if the writers considered that they had to include a minimum number of moments prior to getting back to the farce.<br/><br/>As might be expected, the ""reset button"" was used to ensure that the continuity of the series was not impacted. This is to be expected, after all, Bart has been should be in his early 30s by now. Unfortunately this does mean that there is no chance of character development or any emotional investment in the film, thereby demanding a greater level of comedy. Which doesn't really come out.<br/><br/>A shame. It was certainly an amusing way to pass the time, but there are better satires out there, and better comedies. The Simpsons is no longer King of the Hill ..."

","Oh dear, the Simpsons has gone downhill these last few years, and the movie's no exception: layered with weak, predictable, basic comedy, a dull, one-dimensional storyline and that relentless Hollywood-style soundtrack, one can't help but feel that Groening & Co. just haven't really tried with this movie, nor with any Simpsons productions of late, come to that; it's just about the money, now. Now, I'll admit, there are some high-lights to the movie: an entertaining parody on state-sponsored adverts starring Tom Hanks, for example, & a parody of 'President Arnold Schwarzenegger' by (predictably, but none-the-less funny) regular character Rainier Wolfcastle, for instance. But these moments are few and far between, I'm sad to say; the rest is just pumped out with weak humour, weak, over-stretched parodies, and silly music that serves only to undermine what intelligence exists within the movie. And to think what the Simpsons was just 5-10 years ago: intelligent, lovable, unique, etc. Groening & Co. need to stop counting the pennies, and instead realise that what made the Simpsons so funny and lovable was, simultaneously, its mockery, not embracement, of modern culture, & its embracal of old, American values. The sooner they realise this, the better."

","The Simpsons Movie seems to have fallen on damning criticism from all angles. Personally, I don't understand the problem; this is fresh, well written Simpsons on top form. Anyone who was expecting anything radically different from the TV show were bound to be disappointed - this is a film that needs to be taken for what it is - an hour and a half long Simpsons episode, with tightly packed, top standard Simpsons humour. As for the scale of the movie; it is much greater than the average episode; it is clear the creators have pushed the movie to the limits and tried to explore how to make it seem grander than the TV show. In a way, I think this movie is cursed by it's own popularity as a TV show, and therefore some of the jokes and story lines are bound to seem ""old hat"". But if it is taken as a standalone comedy, it is a more than worthy addition to a beloved show, and hugely enjoyable in it's own right. Roll on, sequel!"
"oscar_fa","7","0","0","27 August 2008"," Decent film that does not compare to the best seasons
","When I listened that they were going to make a Simpsons movie I had all the bad sentiments for how bad the last seven seasons have been. The show has become an incoherent succession of unfunny events with one-liners scattered here and there and has lost all the spirit that made the show so good in the beginning, and I was afraid the movie would be a continuation of this. Well, my expectations were so low that I actually thought the movie was fine although it doesn't compare to the best episodes in the starting seasons.<br/><br/>The Simpsons was always an intelligent criticism to society, episodes made you think and there were one-liners yes but these served as a complement to the humour and not as the only thing on which the show hangs on. There were very established characters, funny references to pop culture but above all, the show had a heart and created many memorable moments that were why the series was so successful and gained its so deserved reputation. Sadly, the late seasons have destroyed whatever character development was established before, with characters not acting as we knew them but in some random strange way for the sake of creating some ridiculous plot. The trade-mark criticism to society has gone, leaving the episodes insipid and empty, and there are no memorable moments to remind us that the characters we were watching were actually very human and a (if stretched) reflection of society.<br/><br/>The movie however respected the built-up character of the protagonists (even though this is in relation to the late seasons) and at least did not change it further - although Bart going with Flanders could have never happened. The plot was better than anything seen in the last years of the TV show but does not compare to the brilliant starting seasons. There were no moments to remember in this movie but at least there were some nice touches like giving Maggie her character back and better jokes than they have been used to lately. All in all, I think this movie looked better for me given the very low expectations I had, but it is sad to know that the show will never go back to be the same and that it is now living off its reputation, with less and less people watching that it will eventually have to die."

","I am not an avid viewer of The Simpsons and have only seen a few episodes, which were fine but didn't set the world alight. I approached this movie with anticipation as the hype surrounding it was mammoth. <br/><br/>The hype was over the top but it was a good comedy with a message that is important. However quotes from the press like ""best comedy of the decade- News of the World"" and ""laugh a minute"" from reviewers on IMDb are far fetched. This movie has extreme high points but it misses regularly. Scenes like Bart's skateboarding naked and the regular gay jokes are brilliant. As are the scene with Mr Burns' suicide quip and 'Grand Theft Walrus'. There's also beautifully animated scenes including Homer's broken snow heart but there are also the low points; Homer and Bart on the roof is yawnsome and a terrible final scene as is Tom Hanks unfunny cameo. <br/><br/>It feels in the film as if the makers were torn between commercial success and making the best movie they could. At times the adult themed jokes and innuendo is great but then scenes of Homer or Bart getting injured are put in for kids to laugh at. And is it so impossible for kids to enjoy a scene without action or dialogue; Homer's broken snow heart and the touching Carpenter's classic song deserved longer on screen. <br/><br/>Schwarzenegger as president was really good but the underuse of certain characters like Maggie, Mr Burns and Krusty meant Homer, Bart and Marge got to take up most of the screen time with their insanely annoying voices (clear your throats and Bart stop laughing). <br/><br/>As for the story, it is good and the Alaskan animation is lovely. Unfortunately Homer is hard to like and the father-son relationship is inconsequential as both Homer and Bart are irritating and to be honest have very few redeeming features. <br/><br/>My favourite show on TV is Family Guy and even though Peter Griffin is sexist and stupid he is ridiculous in his attempts to do good and bad, which lead to hilariously compromising situations. And at the end of the day he always cares about his family. Homer to me just feels hollow and is hard to like. His epiphany (very funny) feels unreal and I can't say I was rooting for him and Bart to survive. <br/><br/>In all The Simpsons survives the hype but it could have been so much better with a more adult rating. Now excuse me I'm going off to watch Family Guy. No annoying voices, great belly laughs and a baby who wants world domination and his mother dead. Watch and you will not be disappointed."

","By the time of the release of ""The Simpsons Movie"" in 2007, the television show that bears its name had been on for nearly twenty seasons and had practically become its own institution. ""The Simpsons"" has become the gauge by which animated programs have become judged time and time again. To a point the show has also changed the complexity and number of situations available to the sit-com format, to say little of what it has shown to be the limitless nature of branding and mass marketing. It would nice to think that a big screen version of the show would again cause waves within the industry.<br/><br/>Instead ""The Simpsons Movie"" is merely a bigger (widescreen, et al), longer version of the show. Compared to the bulk of the output of the show during the mid-2000's the movie has far more to offer than the show, including superior animation. The main storyline presents a post-""Inconvenient Truth"" environmental story whereby the town of Springfield is at the brink of being an environmental disaster. Of course, the obese, bumbler, Homer, tips them over the edge, causing the Environmental Protection Agency to enclose the town with a huge dome, which creates havoc and mob rule. It's a good, topical plot line for the frequently liberal-minded show and one that does sustain the running time, but unfortunately it doesn't seem to have the repeat value of many of the shows best episodes."

Still, when I heard of a Simpson's movie, I made sure I saw it on the first day it was out.<br/><br/>What can I say? I went into the cinema thinking of the recent seasons, and expected nothing more then an OK movie, with a few good laughs, but nothing special. It was more then a few good laughs, but it still didn't match up to the classics, back in seasons 3 - 9.<br/><br/>1. The plot wasn't great, and it certainly wasn't 'classical Simpsons'. The Simpson's has always been ridiculous, at the edge of realism. I guess the writers just tried to be a bit too epic. Saying that, there was little subplot, and what was there had been done before.<br/><br/>2. Too short. The Simpsons have had so many years to make a movie, and 90 minutes, although reasonable, just didn't seem enough.<br/><br/>3. Important 'backup' characters had too little screen time. Don't get my wrong, the writers tried their best to fit some of the less important, yet essential characters (sometimes) into the story, but as I've said before, 90 minutes was simply not enough.<br/><br/>4. The humor was good. Sometimes. There were jokes that I thought could have been worthy of the classics. Then there were jokes that were mildly funny. Then there was somethings they just tried to fit in for the hell of it. I didn't like Spiderpig.<br/><br/>But otherwise, the movie was decent.

","The Simpson Movie has most of the great qualities of the TV series - pointed iconoclastic social satire (digs at religion, bureaucracy, crass materialism), clever slapstick humor, dialog that is both intelligent and intelligently stupid, and great visual gags (esp in the first 15 minutes). Much of the humor references some of the best specific scenes from various episodes (probably only long-time fans will understand these jokes).<br/><br/>'The Simpsons Movie' is basically a very good (not great) episode extended to 90 min - that's both reassuring and a slightly disappointing: Reassuring because it reaffirms the seemingly infinite versatility and mutability of the show's formula, but also a little disappointing because the writers/producers/etc don't take as many chances with the formula as I would've liked. I was hoping for something that would transcend the TV show the way 'South Park: Bigger, Longer, and Uncut', took that that show's bawdy, offensive humor to new levels, then transformed it into a statement (and big middle-finger) at the MPA for it's misguided priorities and hypocrisy. The Simpson Movie never goes much farther than the TV show; the PG-13 rating does enable the writers to be a little more naughty with some of the jokes, but not in a way that enhances the TV show's insight, irreverence, or overall effectiveness.<br/><br/>As an ardent fan maybe I'm being too hard on the film and expecting too much. The series has been on so long and lampooned virtually every aspect of U.S. culture (and numerous others), maybe there just isn't anywhere left for the creative team to go they haven't at least touched on already. Taken as it is The Simpson movie is an intelligently written, visually clever satire.

"teh_mode","7","0","0","1 October 2007"," The glaring faults of any movie become transparent when you laugh so hard at it
","In what has perhaps been one of the drollest and most insipid summers in recent Hollywood history, it is not surprising that the ""saviour"" of the cineworld would turn out to be those weird, squiggly-lined, yellow folk from the tellybox. Yes it's The Simpsons movie, or rather, at last it is The Simpsons' movie, for we have waited many a full moon (and many cries of D'oh!, most of which from me whilst watching the latest series) for Matt Groening, James L. Brooks et al to finally enlighten us as to what Springfield's finest would add to grand old experience of the cinema. Indeed, that curiosity slowly but severely began to wain, with every passing series of The Simpsons becoming even more depressing than the last. As a huge mark for the programme I felt increasingly concerned about the motivation for diluting what was once the pinnacle of television programmes into a sad pantomime of its former self. Homer, despite being wackier than ever, was no longer funny. And Bart, ever the smart mouthed rebel, was just not cool anymore. Had the series lost its edge? Or was it just impossible to keep up the unenviable task of maintaining the quality of the greatest TV sitcom of all time? All the reasons questioned are valid, but milking the cashcows that are The Simsons means that long after their peak (a good solid decade now) we are still enduring our yellow friends deep into the 21st century. Like any great pugilist staggering on his last legs, The Simpsons refused to stop running, even after its creator, Matt Groening, left the show. So forgive me for approaching The Simpsons Movie with considerable trepidation.<br/><br/>So given the stigma of what The Simpsons had become still fresh in my mind, I am proud to say I entered the screening with an open mind. And despite what any expectations were, despite how sick I had grown of hearing Homer or Bart belt out yet another token catchphrase, in the 87 minutes I spent in and around Springfield that night, I laughed harder at the movie then I had at any movie seen this year. And it isn't hard to explain why. The writing is back. The team that made the Simpsons what it is reminded me of what made the series great. It is politically savvy, boisterously inventive and the stupid jokes are actually smartly played. The movie doesn't rely on audiences trusting Homer's reputation enough to laugh at anything he says. When a character makes you laugh, it is because they are are funny, not because of nostalgia. Even silly jokes that don't mean anything like the now infamous ""Spider pig"" have a sense of investment behind the delivery.<br/><br/>And all of this is crucial, because as far as the story goes, The Simpsons Movie is as mundane and formulaic as the dumbest Hollywood blockbuster around. There is little room for Lisa's new found romance to mean anything, and Bart's desire for fatherly support in spite of his own will seem recycled to regular Simpsonites and clichéd to the uninitiated. It is also worth pointing out that the movie fails to fully realise the potential of the cinematic medium, with only the score, and an abundance of undercooked character cameos (Mr Burns only gets two scenes!) failing to convince the cinema that it belongs there. And yet none of this matters much, for you will be laughing too hard to care. The important thing is that faith has been rightly restored in a series that had stubbornly refused to get off the TV train when the lights were still on. But smiling at the word ""Doh!"" for the first time in years is something worth forgiving for all its faults."

I assume it was made to get someone laughing, and if someone was laughing at that, it's kind of a shame. Because i imagine that's what the higher ups in the American ideal were trying to do, as they try to drop the blindfold of their deluded ways over the American people. If anyone argues.. someone could say ""Well that's normal!"" or ""but they were just stating the truth!"" or some other deluded line except for, ""This means we're in trouble!"".. <br/><br/>Anyhow the point i decided to not watch this movie anymore was shortly after Mr and Mrs Simpson were going to go to bed together, all these fuzzy little creatures burst in the door of the cabin and tried to make it all love-like. I turned to my friend and and remarked ""this is the most ridiculous thing i have ever seen"". And no i wasn't laughing one single bit. Needless to say it just kept getting stupider and stupider after that.<br/><br/>The lame jokes, which in fact numbered in the thousands if not hundreds, just became too much to bear. It was almost like the director was trying to put every joke possible into this movie, and not caring if only a few succeeded.<br/><br/>I am glad i downloaded this movie, i would not recommend this movie to anyone at all, least of all a child. This is an adult film, made for those who love the American way and all the foolishness associated with it, who love the gossip and rumor mills and who think this junk can bring positive political change.

"saiyan_yobbo","6","4","12","26 July 2007"," Disappointing.
","Movie Review: The Simpsons, 26/07/07<br/><br/>Finally, the wait is over. So, what is the verdict? It was above-average, but not great. Amusing, but not hilarious. Not brilliant, but rather disappointing. Now before you start about how surely, I live in a cave and know nothing about this show, then stop there. I have watched The Simpsons from when it first aired in Australia's screens in 1990, and have even sat through the fairly mediocre 18th season of 2007. I own several seasons on DVD, bought, not burnt, and I have seen every episode there is to see, and heard every commentary there is to hear. I just won a Simpsons Trivia Night; I know every thing there is to know about this show, back to front and sideways. So if you doubt my credentials into reviewing something that I have been waiting for ever since I saw it announced, then you can ""Cram it with Walnuts, Pal."" But why is it disappointing, I hear you cry? Surely this is the funniest thing to be seen in modern day cinemas? Sorry to burst your bubble, but I think not, and here is why: First off, the amount of effort put into this film is definitely noticeable. What started as crude, barbaric scrawling on the Tracey Ullman Show, have become incredibly detailed, if that can be said about a cartoon, the animation is a definite sight to see on the big screen. What is clear to Simpson fans is the amount of talent that was actually brought back into the show, with David Mirkin, John Swartzwelder and John Vitti all attributing to the script. It immediately pays off: the Swartzwelder zaniness shines through, and the some of the jokes make me think I am watching something from the fabled Golden Era. The funniest scene of the film was ruined by its promotional trailers. ""Spider Pig"" will be a new catchphrase. Watch as it becomes a ring-tone, message tone, or something someone says to think they are funny. It was funny, but the moment is blatantly ruined now. The major problem with this movie is just that, it is a movie. With so much time to fill, there is so much humour that you are bound to not laugh, miss certain jokes, and even just plain not get them. With a 22 minute episode, the jokes were definitely noticeable, and it was so funny because the episode only contained the best it possibly could, time constraints did not allow otherwise. And that's what we loved about the show. Instead of a full joke-fest, there are moments of tenderness and character building, which I think Matt Groening should be applauded for, instead of just falling into ""this is an episode only longer"" trick. Sure, it might not work sometimes, but at least he bloody tried it. The few references were also nice, the ambulance near Springfield gorge, to the states that Springfield border (in people's stupidity I heard someone utter: ""So that's where Springfield is!"" It's not. Every state mentioned does not border the other, it is merely a reference to every state that people swore Springfield was in.) Some moments just had me plain stupefied. Bart's full frontal nudity, albeit blink and you miss it, was blatantly pointless, and only served as a punch line to a crude joke. As people laughed: ""Oh my Godyou can see Bart's dick!"" I just merely shook my head. Maggie saying ""Sequel!"" at the end of the end of the credits merely served as a cheap laugh, that wasn't really needed. Because this show has delivered to me an endless amount of quotes, an endless amount of memories, and an endless amount of things to talk about with people I don't even know, I was expecting so much from this film. I wanted it to be the Golden Era reborn. Sure, there were your Mirkin's, your Swartzwelder's and your Vitti's, but where were the Silverman's, the O'Brien's and the Weinstein's? This movie could have, and should have been so much more, but alas, I have realized that the Golden Era is dead. Seasons 4-10 will be forever used as a comparison to every, new Simpson paraphernalia that is produced, be it new shows or a movie. Does this movie hold it's own against episodes such as Homer the Great, Hurricane Neddy and the Secrets of a Successful Marriage? The answer, 100% and surely is, no. This is as good as The Simpsons will ever get again, and it saddens me to say that. It's either onwards and upwards from here or watch as the new series slide deeper into decline. Disappointingly, I think it will be the latter. This movie will be a classic, however. No amount of ranting, talking calmly or brandishing weapons will change that. Even the most deadpan of moments had moron's guffawing. But to the true Simpson fans, they may laugh their way through it as much as the next person, but they will be ultimately, unfulfilled.<br/><br/>Verdict: 6.0/10<br/><br/>Adam Robertson."
"barrys82","10","3","8","4 August 2007"," The Simpsons bigger and better than ever
","Brilliant, awesome, spectacular and funny. A real summer movie that has no more pretensions but entertain. When someone thinks that you already seen everything on the Simpson program after 18 seasons and 400 episodes, appears this film and gives you the very big surprise with a bunch of whole new adventures. It has a lot of references about other movies ( Harry POtter, Spiderman, Snow White and Night of the Living Dead), they mock on politics, religion and environment but with a moral message , and the brief appearances of famous people like Arnold Shwarszeneger as US president and Tom Hanks making a TV commercial. There are a lot of funny moments like the one of the spider pig, and when Bart is on his skateboard naked. The cast of voices were perfect, there's no one in the movie you can say that was a bad. It was great to see almost every Simpson character that have appeared on the show. In conclusion, a very enjoyable movie, perfect for all ages and totally worthy to watch it on the big screen. This movie deserves at least a nomination to the next Academy awards, and it won't be a surprise that it would win it."

","I have had my extreme doubts about this movie what with the series losing the quality we had come to expect from it in recent years but this movie truly comes back to the glory days of the Simpsons and more.<br/><br/>My first ideas when I saw the teaser was, Oh no, A Simpson's movie..It is going to be exactly like the series has become now, tiresome and forced jokes but no!<br/><br/>I won't give away any of the plot which is basic yet manages to captivate you all the same with excellent use of almost every character in Springfield. Except for a few that I'm sure some have complaints about didn't get enough screen time but just remember it's a Simpsons Movie not a Springfield town and all it's residents movie.<br/><br/>Basically Homer screws over the whole town and it's up to him to fix this and it never gets boring.The jokes keep coming and the beginning is almost exactly like an episode but it really starts to pick up the pace from about 20 minutes away and manages to come up with a story better then aliens invading or end of the world/apocalypse I always expected it to be. One thing though, I did miss Kang and Kodos though.<br/><br/>But not to give away the story, it has an excellent reference to one of the best Simpsons ever. Just remember, jumping the gorge and the ambulance is still there!<br/><br/>Overall the movie has excellent jokes and really managed to impress me and I really didn't expect it to be much more then a shoddy attempt but there we go.<br/><br/>And special mention out to Spider Pig! Which manages to do even more then in all the TV adverts and trailer and still make us laugh our heads off!<br/><br/>Simpsons Movie, well worth a watch.In fact, go watch it right now! You will love it and that's a promise.<br/><br/>9/10"
"stephoney07-1","9","3","8","2 August 2007"," Consistency is key!
","I have 3 words for you, GO SEE IT! I also have some more words... This movie has to be one of the funniest things I've seen in a long time. It felt like The Simpson's creators were giving something back to their fans as there was many a reference to previous episodes and inside jokes for long time fans, many of whom like myself grew up with the show. It was also really cool to see the animation and effects that they used, it really helped to make it feel like it was more than just another episode.<br/><br/>There really isn't a minute that goes by without a chuckle being emitted from the audience. The jokes start right from the 20th Century Fox opening until right to the end of the credits. The opening credits are brilliantly done as well, with many a new laugh.<br/><br/>Despite this being a very funny film, there are also some touching moments where you really do have to feel sorry for Homer and his self obsessed, imbecilic actions. He really is a hopeless moronic goof you can't help but feel sorry for.<br/><br/>I think the biggest thing that made this movie great was the consistency from a long time viewer standpoint. There are many references to old story lines and characters throughout which gives it that familiar feel, like an old friend.<br/><br/>A few of my favorite moments: Ralph, anything Ralph says or does IMO is brilliant! Lenny's crack about Black being the worst color and saying no offense Carl. Even though I expected it Spider Pig was still funny and so was the Wanted poster skit in context.<br/><br/>The only thing I feel jipped on was the lack of towns people - there were many characters that were underused and not used at all but I guess they can't fit everyone in, hopefully the DVD has some good extras.<br/><br/>All in all I feel they delivered on what was for me a highly anticipated film."
"SteakSalad_101","10","3","8","30 July 2007"," The funniest film in years. Yes, it's THAT good.
","It was a day of laughs that started as I patiently waited in line at the concession stand on a hot Monday afternoon ready to watch ""The Simpsons Movie."" The obese woman standing in front of me dropped her two Value Pepsi drinks on the floor and it got all over her, and the guy behind the snack bar said dully ""Thanks for putting this much more excitement into my life"" and called for a mop. Because this is exactly something that would happen to me normally, I couldn't help laughing until I took my seat in the theater. Little did I know I was in luck for more.<br/><br/>Seriously, I don't remember the last time I laughed so hard in my life. I have been a die-hard, hardcore, extremely loyal Simpsons fan for most of my life, and there has been nearly no better treat this summer to me than watching America's ""first family of comedy"" on the big screen. If you're like me, you've probably noticed the last few seasons (ok, more than few, more like eight seasons) of the Simpsons have been less funny, less charming, less witty, etc. Usually whenever someone mentions a good episode of the Simpsons, it's been one of the old episodes from the early 90s. Let me one of many to tell you straight and upfront: the comedy is back. Paired up with hysterical references to the real world, classic spoofs on FOX itself (like the show is famous for), HUGE celebrity cameos (including a very popular rock band that tragically drowns in a river) even making fun of movie theaters and watching a TV show adaptation on the big screen, and even some tear-shedding tragedy--The Simpsons Movie has it all. The answer is finally true to me, and it will be to you after seeing the movie: the reason the recent seasons have been disappointing is because Matt Groening and his team of absolute GENIUSES have been bottling up a storm of side-splitting, spleen-bursting, voice-loosing, eye-tearing, stomach-bleeding, popcorn-crunching gold that would, to our surprise, be unleashed on July 27th, 2007, like a tank of Mentos in an ocean of Diet Coke. Quite simply, the funniest film I've had the pleasure of watching since ""Anchorman.""<br/><br/>Yes, it's THAT good.<br/><br/>Oh, and there's a lot more to it too. Unfortunately, I can't tell you anymore or else I'll spoil the insanely amazing plot line, or something that goes with it. Just see the movie and you'll be glad you did!<br/><br/>5-Stars (if you're a Simpsons fan) 1 1/2-Stars (if you're with ""Family Guy"" or ""South Park"" or those OTHER animated shows) 0-Stars (if you have a bad sense of humour and people have confirmed that fact for you)"

","If you don't go with any expectations, like i did. and if you are anything like me, you will laugh the whole way through and leave the theater with a warm fussy feeling and a smile. great Simpsons. great comedy. Don't make the mistake i see other people making, of expecting seasons 4 through 7 rolled up into a magical ball of indescribable hilarity. Yes its true that most of the beloved characters are reduced to mere extras, and that, most likely, means your favorite ancillary character wont get the attention a TV episode would give it. I have read other people say the first thirty minutes or so where hilarious and the rest was slow. but honestly...i think they have ADD. Go. Sit back. Get comfortable. Enjoy. its not a masterpiece of the cinema, but personally, i got my money's worth."
"ethanrunt","7","3","8","25 July 2007"," Is it worth the 18 year wait?
","Does the film win back hearts? Is it the same as the modern show? Is spider-pig still the scourge of the total lack of taste in the culture we live in today? All three answers are yes.<br/><br/>The film starts with the logos, and annoying and unfunny modern Ralph Wiggum, overused all the time, singing the fanfare as well, and then into the 'movie'. Well, Itchy and Scratchy 2, and what a nice little cartoon that is, until Homer has to ruin it, poke fun at everyone for paying to see the film, and we begin with some opening sequence especially for the movie.<br/><br/>The animation has improved a lot, clearer, more details, and some nice use of 3-D models.<br/><br/>Still, it doesn't amount to much in the whole scheme of things, and the first scene of the real part of the film sets the tone to the events. Green Day (Why a crap band anyway) are doing a concert at Lake Springfield, and are pelted at when they try to talk about the environment, and soon enough the lake dissolves their ship, and we get a great and rarely laughed at by the crowd Titanic joke. Violins anyone? From then on we go through two plots, Lisa campaigning about the environment, a terrible character now, she was once funny when she showed she had a sense of humour too, but now is just dull and not care able, and she meets a boy, with an atrocious Irish accent and a string of unfunny almost not jokes.<br/><br/>The other side of the family is Bart and Homer, hanging out, doing chores, starting a dare contest, involving Bart's dick, and how grossly unfunny and completely unnecessary that scene is, but everyone else just laughs like they would at a terrible modern episode.<br/><br/>Bart's story here is about wanting to have a father like Flanders, rather than Homer. Marge ends up having a story later on in the film when she hates Homer, and Maggie, she gets to break a bottle, jump around and throw a rock at the baddie, just perfect, best character in the family.<br/><br/>After the nudity, he collects Bart and they go into Krusty Burger, where, as always on open days at a business, a commercial is being shot, and a pig is about to be killed, but is too cute and Homer-like for him to allow it, so they get a new pet, one that takes to him like he does to it. Unfortunately, all his leavings need to be disposed of properly, a ban on dumping In the Lake is enforced, but Homer as he is, decides that dumping would take too long, and the poor guy wants donuts, so bang, there it is, contaminated lake, donuts needed, environmental disaster, that makes Environmental Agency leader Cargill (played with classic panache and some great improves by Albert Brooks) give the new president, a completely ridiculous Schwarzenegger where a more subtle Wolfcastle would have fit perfectly, the option to dome Springfield and remove it from the country.<br/><br/>It's a bunch of bad plots with some particularly funny, and some awfully horrendous, jokes, but the killer here is that as it's a big screen outing, the writers, the series' finest including one John Swartzwelder, writer of over 50 episodes, most of them are the shows finest and most original, and funny, decided to make it one with a message, and is hit over the head until we are all feeling the pain, of global warming, yeah, we don't care, we want to see funny moments and a clever, smaller than city wide death script, so hopefully in the sequel a more family based series of events one can hope.<br/><br/>The writing is average, the animation is great, the jokes range from terrible (Spider-Pig) to genius (on signs Homer placed as a distraction- ""We shouldn't stop at any more 'sop', 'yeld' or one 'vew' signs"") and the voices are almost great, Julie Kavner in some of the latter scenes tries to make sad Marge too much like her own voice, and it sounds like Marge gets bunged up then back to normal.<br/><br/>Too many flashbacks, not enough explanation of random events and not looking at the town enough, Burns and Smithers only have 2 talking scenes, Apu has one, Moe has a bit, but it looks like his events could have made the film interesting for a further 20 minutes alone, as, like most TV movie spin-offs, it only hits the 1 hour 20 odd minute mark.<br/><br/>The music is interesting, using Hans Zimmer over Alf Clausan was a dare that paid off it seems, but using Dan Castellaneta as the animals rather than Frank Welker, voice over god himself, seems to detract from the quality.<br/><br/>The best bit of the not for TV moments, there are 2 I can tell, was Otto, he knows how to rock the bong and it's a nice little moment from a great and sorely underused character, and when that seems very good Simpsons, they fall into bad Simpsons too, Cletus, one note stereotype, trying to be used as a character, he has an almost Sideshow Bob and the rakes moment but they only do it twice then put in a line, rather than repeating it over and over and over and over and over and over again, which would have been hilarious.<br/><br/>Overall, it is an opportunity sorely wasted on cheap bad jokes, too much environmentalism and the same Homer plot we've had almost 300 times now, hopefully Futurama will come back in fashion to prove it deserves the title it stole from The Simpsons 8 years ago.<br/><br/>8/10"
"moviemanMA","7","3","8","26 July 2007"," It's a hell of a town!
","The Simpsons have broken records, broken boundaries, and have kept us laughing for close to two decades. It paved the way for animated programming geared towards an older audience. Without The Simpsons, there would be no South Park, no Family Guy, and the word ""D'oh!"" would not have been entered into the Oxford English Dicionary.<br/><br/>In that span of time they have had a slew of awards, video games, board games, fan clubs, clothing, but never a movie. It took Matt Groening and his team of creators 18 years and nearly four hundred episodes before The Simpsons Movie lit up the theatre marquee.<br/><br/>Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, Maggie, and all of the citizens of Springfield, USA have taken the big screen by storm and in a big way. We find America's favorite dysfunctional family in the midst of an environmental crisis. The town lake is being polluted to the brink of ecological collapse. Only if the town bands together will the problem be solved.<br/><br/>Of course, it doesn't work out. Homer inevitably puts the entire town at risk of total destruction and the EPA along with President Schwartzenegger must come in and solve the problem so as to not disturb the rest of the country. <br/><br/>The usual ""Simpsonian"" plot ensues where Homer thinks he does the right thing but actually doesn't. Bart loses faith in Homer and looks for guidance elsewhere. Lisa has fallen in love with someone who fights for what she believes in. Maggie sucks her pacifier. Marge must bring everyone back to reality so the family can save the day.<br/><br/>So what is the big deal? Other than the fact that it is the first Simpsons movie, the story is decent enough and entertaining enough to sit down and enjoy. It doesn't go on too long and the writing is really funny. It seems that the writing staff really took there time on this project, seeing as they didn't have to do it for next Sunday's FOX lineup. The jokes are timed perfectly and the material is fresh.<br/><br/>One thing that I was afraid of was that the film would be overrun with cameo appearances seeing as it would be cool to do a voice in The Simpsons Movie. Fortunately, there are only a few, and those few are well placed and well executed.<br/><br/>Whether or not there will be another Simpsons movie or not, who knows. There are some elements of the film that make it seem like this would more than likely be the end of the series, but what will life be like without the Simpsons? They can't just live in syndication and DVD sets, can they? That day will ultimately come, but it doesn't have to be right now.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie puts the charge back into the series. From start to finish, it's a heck of a good time. You'll laugh until you cry. Besides, how can a movie with Spider-Pig be bad?"
"markdr78","8","3","8","26 July 2007"," Very Entertaining...Not Classic Simpsons, but Great first outing on the big screen!
","I think a lot of fans of the TV series have been somewhat apprehensive about this movie, myself included, worrying that it might strike a nail in the Simpsons coffin, and perhaps signal the beginning of the end for the series, but I believe it's the exact opposite, this movie has the opportunity to breathe new life into the much loved franchise, and in my opinion it succeeds, emphasising exactly why I love the show so much, and have done for the best part of 20 years. <br/><br/>A constant bombardment of pleasing gags coming at you for an entire 90 minutes, with obviously more breathing space in it's pace than the regular 22 minute episodes. It's crammed full of gags, including many sight gags, that may be missed first time around. It really is the best of the best for true Simpsons fans. It plays out like an extended episode with bigger thrills & bigger laughs, often pushing the boundaries of what they can get away with in the Simpsons World, with more risqué humour in places. Visually it's a treat, and a welcome contrast to the string of CGI animated movies of recent years. The Simpsons first venture into cinema has a much slicker look to the animation, a lot smoother around the edges to really make it feel like a cinematic outing. <br/><br/>My only criticism, which I think will be echoed by most is how little some of the well loved supporting characters are used, Mr Burns & Smithers particularly, and did Groundskeeper Willy even say anything at all throughout this entire movie, I don't think so. Clearly there are far too many characters in the Simpsons Universe to be able to showcase them all in just one movie, so the main focus here is on the title characters themselves, particularly Homer, however this movie still manages to introduce a few new characters, which i'm sure will appear in future seasons of the show.<br/><br/>If you're a fan of the series, which of course you are, otherwise you wouldn't be reading this, then this film is a must, I certainly can't wait to see it again. I think there'll be a lot of mixed opinions about this movie, many will say if it ain't broke, don't try to fix it, but this film takes the Simpsons to a whole new level, and certainly does nothing to tarnish the legacy of what is without a doubt the best cartoon series or TV show for that matter, of our generation, and no doubt many generations to come."
"EmmaRobertsKnees","1","3","9","18 January 2016"," Simpsons Movie NOT Worth The Wait! Terrible!
","I Don't want to give much away, but this movie truly is AWFUL. The storyline is terrible, so is the animation. The movie is boring throughout, and also has one of the most cringe worthy, unfunny moments ever on The Simpsons. You can see just about every face ever on The Simpsons exploited in this movie and they keep making gratuitous references to the show as if to remind you when the Simpsons was actually funny, such as when Homer and Bart jump Springfield Gorge, the ambulance is still crashed into the tree. Too bad that doesn't make the movie actually funny!<br/><br/>It definitely has contempt for long-time fans, but it is a horrible movie even for those who don't watch the Simpsons.

Then Ralph Wigum, that crazy little kid, comes out of the '0' and does the Fox theme. Wow... I was already laughing.<br/><br/>Itchy and Scratchy- the thing that started the movie- wow.

Apart from the witty and hilarious dialogue throughout the movie that will keep you wanting more and without failure you get a whole lot more and then some, what caught my eye the most was the shock factor, being a HUGE Simpsons fan myself I never thought id see some of the things I saw in this movie. For most of you who have seen the movie will know exactly what I'm talking about, for those of you who haven't, be prepared for some shocking eye candy! The movie remains true to its form; it's your regular TV episode just a little longer and with a LOT of juicy treats you won't see or hear in the TV series. Even for those who aren't Simpson fans, the plot, comedy, action, Adventure and to some extent even drama is absolutely brilliant, as for the stunning visuals; let's just say The Simpsons Movie has raised the bar for 2-D films. There's no doubt you won't be able to get all the jokes cuz you'll still be laughing at the ones in the beginning, so you'll definitely be watching this at least 2 or 3 more times.

","I, like many, have loved The Simpsons for as long as I can remember. One of my first toys was a Bart stuffed doll. I have always had a special connection with the television series and when I found out they were making a movie, I had mixed feelings. On one hand, this could be hilarious and could turn out to be a great movie to go to just to have a good laugh. On the other hand, however, this could easily be a mistake of a movie that could destroy the series as a whole. Luckily, with the odds against them, they managed to turn this into a great movie that lived up to my expectations and made me laugh for a couple hours.<br/><br/>This movie had a lot going against it. Turning a TV series into a movie usually ends with disaster, even if the TV series is one as popular as The Simpsons. People expected it to be bad. Unfortunately, as much as I love the series, I expected this to be a pretty bad movie. The only shred of hope I had was the preview that included ""Spider-Pig."" However, when it all came down to opening night, I figured that The Simpsons had entertained me for free for a countless number of years, that the least I could do was to contribute to its box office success.<br/><br/>As I sat in the theater, I found myself constantly laughing and finding the movie to be very enjoyable. When it comes down to it, this is what makes a movie good. If a movie keeps you enjoyed for the time you spend in the theater and you spend the whole time laughing and really into the story, it deserves a good review. So what if The Simpsons has changed from the first few seasons. They are still funny, original, and America's #1 family. Thats why ""The Simpson's Movie"" gets a 9 out of 10."

","I too was thinking this movie wouldn't be so great and would be just like the most recent episodes: lackluster and just boring. Boy was I wrong! The movie is definitely a return to the Simpsons of old, when the show really knocked your funny bone out and kept firing away clever jaunts at the most random points. I have never been in a theater where it was constant laughter after laughter. There are a couple of crude images...and I mean crude as in ""what they couldn't do on TV"", so you may want to be cautious if bringing the kids. But overall, it's a terrific movie, well-done with the humor and the slapstick that you would expect from the Simpsons.<br/><br/>Oh, and if you're a true fan, you will want to stay through the entire credits.

","When I heard that there was going to be a Simpsons movie, I was excited. I've counted down the days to the big premiere. I've planned to go to Springfield, Illinois when I thought that that Springfield would win the contest for showing ""The Simpsons Movie"". Being an avid Simpsons fan, I went to see ""The Simpsons Movie"" at 5:00 (the time The Simpsons come on in my area). I was having second thoughts about the movie because I've read reviews saying that it wasn't that funny or that good, but when I saw it, I have to say that those reviews are wrong. It was like a Simpsons episode but longer. Some parts I think they should've took out were when Marge was standing outside a hotel (where the family was hiding) and a cop car comes up and Marge is scared thinking that they're after her, but the cops (both male) get out, go around a corner, stand for a second and start kissing. Long story short, the movie was great. I would recommend it. But one thing that has been bothering me was that after the town of Springfield was back to normal, what happened to the pig?"

","I have expected more than i could ever expect for anything to see this movie. It's simply great. I don't have words to describe it, but the minimum for this comment is 10 lines, so... here it comes the review. After all, i must say, i'm from Argentina, and i saw it in Spanish, nevertheless, having listened the series in other languages, i must say the Spanish version is flawless (altough i prefer the old voice over work, Humberto Velez's voice was better than this). The Mexican voice actors are great doing some little things in the characters. Bout the movie, i must say that its a never ending continuity of gags. You never see them coming, but inmediatly, you start laughing your guts out. It goes beyond, where the series couldn't go in 18 years. For those who say it's a long episode. Well, maybe you're right, but it also works as a movie... but if you want to analyze it, go and talk to Syd Field. Obviously it's not the so acclaimed humor that you could see on the first seasons of the show, it's more like the absurd kind of stuff that i love. Homer is stupider than ever, and that's one thing i thank. I mean, that's OK with that dysfunctional family, but what i need is... the ball in the crotch. This movie was for me as Itchy and Scratchie was for Bart, I thank that i hadn't wait 40 years to watch it. So, here is my advice: Don't wait no longer. Get your ticket, buy a big bag of popcorn and enjoy."

This film was absolutely excellent. There is a joke at every single moment of the movie. The film goes right back to the way the simpsons were at their peek.<br/><br/>There are a few cheesy parts, where i thought ""this is a bit gay"", however, as soon as anything like this happens, the film cuts it out. E.g. Green Day. I was also glad that they didn't keep breaking into song.<br/><br/>The Simpsons have also been severely enhanced cinematically.

","The Simpsons Movie had some big shoes to fill. Coming from what has to be one of the most popular TV shows in American history, what would the movie be like? Given the bar set by similar TV-to-Movie adaptations, apprehension as to whether the movie would work or flop were obvious.<br/><br/>It worked. In the first 20 minutes of the movie, there was never a silent moment in the audience as the crowd laughed and laughed. Stunt after stunt hit the mark with perfect timing, and the movie was off to a wonderful start.<br/><br/>A bit slow in the middle, the movie moved into the development of a decent plot, with the story of the struggles of the Simpsons family, and Springfield in general (and yes, the movie places where Springfield is geographically...well, sorta).<br/><br/>What one word could I use to describe this movie? Timing. Timing of the jokes and stunts; transition from the slapstick fun of the first part of the movie into the slower plot development; at a mere 87 minutes, timing of when to end; timing in all aspects was near perfect.<br/><br/>At the end of the movie was something I haven't heard in several years, audience applause...and in case it isn't obvious, stay for the closing credits.<br/><br/>Oh, of course, the single word uttered by Maggie at the end with her pacifier finally removed: ""Sequel"".<br/><br/>In the words of Homer Simpson near the beginning of the movie, ""Why would anyone pay money to see in the theaters what they could watch for free at home?"". The answer is obvious. Good or bad, The Simpsons Movie was going to be a financial success. But it was a success in other ways too. For fans, it was worth the 20 year wait..."

","okay so I went along to watch this film not expecting it to reach the expectations I held, but I am always happy to admit I am wrong when something truly deserves it ... and I was wrong. This movie provides uncountable classic Simpson's style humour as well as fresh new comedy. It also includes every regular Simpson characters, each with their own part within the film. It definitely does not fail to make you laugh until you can't laugh no more, and the story is one that recently has been high-lighted in the media: pollution. It is about the pollution of Springfield, caused by - you guessed it- Homer, which forces the Simpson family into hiding. Homer is happy out of Springfield, however Marge and the kids want to go back. Eventually Homer realises, after a epiphany, that he has to save his hometown from the government in order to get his wife back. <br/><br/>Even if you have never watched a Simpson episode in your life this movie still holds it own unique style. If this movie does not make you laugh then I advise seeking help."

","PROS(no spoilers)= All over, a movie that is guaranteed to make anyone laugh. (I Laughed so much my mouth ended up hurting from all the laughing). Most people are concerned and 'hesitate' to watch this movie because they are afraid it will be similar to the new series, which are somewhat not as funny and clever as the older seasons. The movie is not like the new series, instead it's funny just like the old ones; just with newer & brighter animation which was done superbly well. Its clear this movie is a massive hit and will continue to make it big when it comes out on DVD etc. Put simply, this movie is not a flop in away.<br/><br/>CONS(no spoilers)= The only thing i can think of is that they didn't show enough of Patty and selma and burns which are personally favorites of mine, but other than that the movie is is excellent.<br/><br/>END: If anyone is going to complain about the movie, youl notice it will be pity, so don't worry about them.

","After 20 years the Simpson's finally decided to make a movie. And i must say it is not what you will expect. I was there opening day and also was in th first show at my local theater. As I was standing in line i overheard that people were expecting something of a normal Simpson's episode with a long story line. However what we got was something of a complete different nature. I wont spoil the story for anyone. However i must say there are several stories going on at once. And if you pay close enough attention you can spot a whole lot of old characters in the show popping up and saying their infamous one liners with their own stories.<br/><br/>However my main thought at the end of this movie was that Thank god fox did not sell out the franchise and make a movie for the kids. They made it for the die hard fans who grew up on this show and much Kudos to the team behind The Simpson's who made sure of that. And since the movie did not follow on like the show there is a sense of new direction for the Simpson's. As the movie progresses I got the sense that this movie is not the last, but of a series of movies which will be pumped out. Think of it not as one long episode but as homage to the parody of modern culture and inspiration over the years that the Simpson's have used."

","I've been a massive Simpsons fan ever since I can remember, and so when I discovered they were making a movie I was excited to say the least. And the film did not disappoint. The basic plot of the film is Homer accidentally pollutes Lake Springfield causing the government to cordon off the whole town. The towns residents are obviously upset at this, and so the movie plays out. Probably the best thing about this film to me was the fact that it included a huge range of small yet familiar characters and used our already existing knowledge of them to make us laugh. Homer is on top form giving us a laugh a minute, and there are some familiar famous faces making us giggle too.<br/><br/>So, would I recommend this movie? Yes. Even though I personally think the latter series' of the Simpsons haven't been as good as earlier ones, I think the film is a separate entity and doesn't reflect this. As usual the comedy can be taken on separate levels so all the family will enjoy it.<br/><br/>On the trailer it says, ""Eighteen years in the making..."" and it shows. They saved up all the very best stuff. It was everything I expected and more. It did not disappoint, and I came about in a much better mood than when I came in.<br/><br/>For me, it couldn't of got any better.<br/><br/>10/10"
"AdrenalinDragon","8","3","9","25 July 2007"," Brilliant! The Simpsons are back at the top!
","The Simpsons Movie exceeded my expectations. I knew right from the start that this wasn't going to disappoint. Sure, some might have said different things because of the later episodes of the show, but the movie manages to give the viewer a feeling of how and why The Simpsons is one of the greatest animation and comedy achievements of all-time. You'll recognise and laugh as much as you would with the TV show.<br/><br/>OK, some BIG spoilers now. The movie starts off with Itchy and Scratchy, and then is introduced with an Simpsons intro with Green Day, and things start to pick up fast. Though most of the first 20 minutes is pure comedy, it slowly builds up to the main plot. Lisa complains about the pollution in Springfield and meets up with a boy she likes, and during a church morning Grampa goes out of control and Marge gets concerned with the words he speaks. At the same time Homer adopts a pig but Marge keeps telling him to remove it and when he ignores her words it causes total disaster in Springfield and forces The Simpsons to move away from the town.<br/><br/>I was surprised to see how many of the characters were seen in the whole movie. The whole film felt it was going at a steady pace and all of the comedy moments never felt flat-out. The moments with president Arnold and Tom Hanks are just top and fell right in place. All of the Simpsons family had their share of the movie so none of the characters felt left out, except for Homer of course he gets the larger part! The animation is amazing and well done. It had that movie feel and didn't feel like 4 episodes put together. You could tell it was definitely designed as a movie from the start. It is highly watchable and entertaining from start to finish. I noticed a few good Simpsons references in the movie that referred to older episodes, but you probably won't spot them all straight away but either way you'd probably want to see the movie again since its so good.<br/><br/>The Simpsons still has its comedy, as the movie has proved and will definitely be loved by many people out there. As the show is almost heading for its 20th anniversary, the movie showed me that there is still some great comedy left in The Simpsons. All hope hasn't gone yet, but The Simpsons Movie will be a hit to pretty much all the audience and many will remember it as a top summer movie of the year, and perhaps one of the greatest animation movies ever. Don't be fooled into thinking a TV show to a movie sucks, this one is a BIG exception!"
"Ghostbusterx","6","3","9","25 July 2007"," Totally awesome!
","The Simpsons Movie delivers on every count and is thoroughly engaging from start to finish. Best of all, my arse did not get numb as it was only 82 minutes long. Some critics have said that it seems like four episodes tacked together but you gotta hand it to them, the Simpsons creators have crafted what could easily be four of the best episodes ever. After viewing the movie it becomes clear that more risks are being taken and the characters are having fun doing things that you wouldn't normally see on TV. I guess the Simpsons formula has become a game of 'Let's see how long we can keep it going before is gets boring' which, I can say with all honesty, seems a long way off. This is as fresh and original as it ever was.<br/><br/>I envy Matt G's huge bulging wallet! ***** out of *****"

The plot was movie worthy and wisely concentrated on the family. I'm not give the plot away but the fact that some of the best jokes were given away in trailers and promos could have been a put off but the still seemed funny. Very much like the episodes where you can watch them over and over again without getting bored. Also some jokes that you thought you've seen in the promos are expanded and made funnier like the old Simpsons, where a jokes are layered on top of each other. Worth my money and yours great to see them on screen. Only flaw: Too short, which you hardly say after watching a movie."
"brianstorm","9","3","9","25 July 2007"," My Simpsons Review
","The Simpsons Movie has been in production for the last 17 years and I have been a huge fan of the show for many of them, IE: the ones I was alive. And I had been readily excited since the movie was announced last year, however as I entered the cinema I was still haunted by nagging doubts that they couldn't pull this off. The last time I had felt that was before The Da Vinci Code, and we all know how that turned out.<br/><br/>Ninety minutes later I left the cinema thinking to myself 'Bloody hell, they did it!,' my fears over a sustainable plot cast aside - if anything MORE time was needed expanding on things, especially Lisa's subplot which is very underused - and my fears that after nearly two decades of show all the good jokes had been taken. However, I felt the majority of them fresh and funny, particularly the visual gags: IE: American Idiot - Funeral Version.<br/><br/>There are of course disappointments, the amount of supporting characters reduced to non-speaking roles is large but expected - They cut Sideshow Bob!. And things are wrapped up a little too quickly, especially after the mass destruction over the course of the film. Also, while this isn't necessary a fault for me there are some moments darker than I was expecting - IE: the attempt at executing the Simpson's - so it is PG-13/PG for a reason.<br/><br/>Overall a very fine attempt at a movie, showing that there is still plenty of life left in the world's favourite American family. With some very tasteful nudity to boot!"

","The Simpson's movie does have one fatal flaw. Too many subplots. In the movie Homer gets a pig, Lisa falls in love, Bart finds a father figure in Ned Flanders, Homer spikes the water supply with pig crap and the US government put Springfield in a dome.<br/><br/>I personally think that this is a bit much for young children, and for its relatively short running time.<br/><br/>This aside, the movie is flawless. None of the jokes fail and they all managed to make me laugh. The voice acting was great, and the animation was spot-on. There were also many interesting aspects about Springfield that we were unaware of during all of those years on TV.<br/><br/>This movie is well worth a watch.

The plot begins with Homer adopting a pig that Crusty the Clown is about to slaughter (I also have to lol at Crusty's statements, which are always golden). And as you can imagine, it just continues from there. Homer gets himself into quite the predicament, and let's just say that everybody wants a piece of him after that. There's also a lot of political humor, like how the EPA dealt with 'the problem.' Definitely one of the better movies that I've seen, up there with the Family Guy movie.

"agra_94","4","2","5","12 September 2007"," Wait for the DVD (minor Spoiler)
","It was always hard to do this, to translate one of the most successful TV shows of all time into what is frankly a very different medium. Cinema deals with the grand, things that aren't real life. The reason cinemas aren't totally defunct in a time when we can get the same image quality on our TV screens at home (besides being cheaper) is that sitting in front of a massive screen with amazing surround sound is a different experience entirely, no matter how big your television.<br/><br/>Who remembers the Simpsons at their best? The fact is that The Simpsons when it was good, was good because it poked fun at those small ridiculous things that made up our messed-up western society. Now we can see the writers scraping the barrel, looking for increasingly cheap laughs, just to make that extra dollar. The Simpsons name is now being milked dry, the longer they go on the further tarnished the legacy of what was once the greatest show ever will be left.<br/><br/>This movie, however, attempts to deal with grand events, and partially succeeds. The old story of an ordinary person (usually a guy) coming good and saving the day is a staple of Hollywood cinema. Also is the idea of a superficial plot designed to carry the main content of the film (for a good example of this, See the Jason Bourne series) and this tactic is excusable if justified by the content, but the jokes in The Simpsons simply do not cut it. The flimsy plot shows it's flaws garishly. perhaps the most annoying for me is that, having been kicked out of their hometown, the family deports to Alaska. Then immediately come back. I genuinely feel that this was simply so they could port the funniest joke of them all into the film easily (see the trailer - the huskies gag).<br/><br/>It's true that there are some really funny gags in this film, and it avoids being over-long. What is also true, though, is that the next day I watched a half-hour episode of the show around its peak, where the family visits Itchy and Scratchy land. Everyone, including me, has been to one of those absurd places and it is in this sense that the Simpsons shine most brightly.<br/><br/>Overall, it was shallow, and felt like a series of skits instead of a coherent whole. Get it on DVD rental, it doesn't seem worth a repeat viewing. Plus, Mr. Burns wasn't the villain. I could go on. 2/5"
"cajunstarwalker","10","2","5","8 September 2007"," Best. Movie. Ever.

The animation is great, the voice acting great, the celebrity guest stars have hilarious cameos. Even at a length of only an hour and a half, they sure did cram so many hilarious jokes in it.

","The Simpsons Movie is sort of like a long episode from between the 6th and 11th seasons. It's got the same witty humor you would expect from a good Simpsons episode. It doesn't try to be stupid and random like the newer episodes.<br/><br/>However, it does differ greatly in several ways from an episode. The flow is basically the same, but everything seems a little more serious. It tries to be smart and serious in some ways. The conflict, the dramatic turn towards the end, the resolution, the messages, and all that give it more redeeming power than a simple episode. Homer doesn't seem like a total dumbass, he seems like a caring father and a good man. He's still a dumbass, but not completely.<br/><br/>So, all in all, The Simpsons Movie succeeds at both making you laugh out loud, and making you feel good inside. The best animated movie I've ever seen, and one of the funniest movies I've ever seen. If you love the Simpsons, you'll love this."
"ZekeRage911","8","2","5","24 August 2007"," Everything you'd expect and more
","Being a Simpsons fan nearly all my life, I eagerly awaited a Simpson's Movie for many a long years. Then the show jumped the shark (It was the Nessie episode, and you all know it) and has since proceeded to zoom back and forth over the shark with total disregard to television laws. So when I heard about a Simpson's Movie, I was dubious. On the one hand, being a lifelong fan, I would pay to see a Simpson's Movie. On the other, I feared a two hour episode of the TV show that disregarded anything approaching plot, story, or jokes that were more than a cheap gag. I was pleasantly disappointed. The movie has an epic scope and feel, which is just right when one of the main characters is named Homer. They start off with a little Itchy & Scratchy cartoon hearkening back to the days when cartoons were shown in movie houses across the country. Then, at the end, Homer stands up ""Why should we pay to see something we see at home for free on television?"" This is the tone of the Simpson's movie, a movie that knows not to take itself too seriously (Like other animated movies based on cartoons, AHEM South Park, I'm looking at you.) The plot, while wholly ridiculous and overwhelmingly over the top, is grounded by a certain amount of silly seriousness as the characters actually, now hold your breath, remain true to their characters! When put in tense and stressful situations, they react with tension and stress. The serious moments push the plot along, and the comedy keeps it interesting, fully true to Simpson tradition. Along the way, the brilliant social commentary cuts apart everything Americans hold dear like television, mob mentality, incompetent presidents, laziness, greed, apathy, and the status quo. The artwork, too, is impressive. It's clear the production team wanted to make the animation really noteworthy, and not just, once again, a two hour long episode of the TV show. (Again, looking at you, South Park.) To write a synopsis would take too long, as there are at least six or seven things happening during the course of the movie, but rather than being several stories linked together, they're all integral parts of the unfolding story. So let me sum up: Grandpa Simpson has a vision in church of impending doom. No one takes it seriously but Marge. Lake Springfield is heavily polluted. Lisa attempts to get it cleaned up and falls in love with a young Irish boy who is also on an ecological crusade. Homer is a bad father, and winds up coming across a pig (Yes, it's ""Spider-Pig"" from all the commercials) that he loves more than Bart. Bart starts gravitating towards Flanders as a better father figure. Lisa and her beau convince the town to clean up Lake Springfield. Homer, because he's homer, winds up dumping all the waste from Spider-Pig (and himself) into the lake because he's got to get some free donuts. The lake becomes so over-polluted, the EPA must do something. The head of the EPA, yes, you guessed it, the villain, gets authorization from President Schwarzenegger to encase Springfield in a giant dome. The residents of Springfield are now trapped. A brief investigation discovers that it's all Homer's fault, forcing the family to flee through a sink-hole that Maggie discovered. This covers about the first thirty or forty minutes. The Simpsons then flee to Alaska where they enjoy some brief peace before it's discovered that the government intends to bomb Springfield before anyone else can escape the dome. Homer refuses to help those who chased him with pitchforks and torches. So Marge takes the kids and leaves him. He goes after her, but almost freezes to death before being saved by an Innuit medicine woman. During the inevitable and slightly cliché' vision quest, Homer realizes how selfish he's been and sets out to save Springfield. After several failed attempts to get Marge and the kids back (since they've been captured by the EPA shock troops,) Homer starts climbing to the top of the dome to get inside through the tiny hole they're lowering the bomb from. In the process, he foils the escape attempt of the citizens of Springfield and further alienates Bart. Finally, Homer calls upon his recently learned biking inside a dome skills to get the bomb out of the dome, simultaneously winning back Bart's Love and the town's. That's the SHORT story. I've left out a LOT. In short, this movie is definitely worth watching, especially if you're a fan of the show. Though, don't bring the kids. Seriously, there's some cartoon nudity, and a LOT of 'adult situations.' It's PG-13, guys, not PG-whatever-you-feel-like-and-the-kids-REALLY-wanna-go. Parental GUIDANCE, folks. Do some guiding."

Now the plot was alright, i wont take much away from it but on the other hand i won't give it to much praise. But in all seriousness we all came to see a film that would make us die laughing from all forms oh said humor. What i saw was cliché jokes and gags that were a disgrace to the early homer simpson. The only funny character throughout the entire show was chief wiggum and his son ralph. Both of which appeared very little throughout the movie. One huge thing that bothered me was the lack of two major simpsons fads that have had impacts on society and let alone the fans. One was how Homer did not say ""D'oh"" the entire time. He ALMOST did but it ended up turning out to be the word Dome, alas a valiant attempt but fell a little short. Second, there was no couch clip in the beginning. That is absurd, the completely new and ever changing ending to the opening credits that is one of the most famous things about the show is left out.<br/><br/>In the end the movie disappointed me and my fellow Simpson lovers. If id come to see a fairly decent drama with dry and cliché humor that rarely entertained i wouldve praised it. But sadly thats not what i hoped for and so i in turn give it a 4/10."
"killbill_28","7","2","5","28 July 2007"," Disappointing!
","I was very disappointed about the Simpson's Movie, I'd prefer watching the TV show instead of the movie. The story is very simple and it feels like you watching a over long episode.<br/><br/>They should have taken the Simpson's to new limits in the movie, Like what Trey Parker and Matt Stone did with the South Park Movie. But the director and the producers just left it the same and even sometimes toned down the contact such as swearing, violence, nudity and adult themes, sometimes shown a normal episode of the Simpson's. OK you see Bart's penis and Otto smoking from a bong. But remember in a early episode you see Homer smoking pot in his bedroom to make himself better.<br/><br/>The Animation of the movie is different too, its got 3D back rounds with normal 2D characters in center but overall the Animation is great. Even the normal characters have changed for the movie, Homer is is a selfish pig that doesn't care for his family, Bart turns to Ned Flanders as a father figure, Lisa falls in love with a Irish boy, Marge overreacts, Ralph turns gay are just of the some that change for the movie.<br/><br/>I'm not totally giving this movie the flop but it should have been more then the TV show and something different but it seems the produces and director run out of idea's very quick, even the movie's running time is short only running for 85 minutes. It seems they waited too long for a movie since they show has aired for more then 16 years. They should had made this 10 years ago when they still had idea's. Still go and see this movie but don't expect anything different."

Matt Groening is a genius! 18 years(20 if you count the short films released before on the Tracey Ullman show) and he has not run out of ideas.Im surprised that they haven't made a Simpsons movie until now.I mean South Park made a movie in two years.A lot of people say that the show is not good anymore, I disagree, The Simpsons was always awesome and is still awesome.When I heard there was a Simpsons movie coming out I was excited so I went to see it the first day it came out and guess what, It does not disappoint.The humor in the Simpsons movie is just as funny and fresh as it was in the cartoons.The film has a storyline you can expect from most animated films.Its entertaining but there isn't really much to the story.While Homer is eating at Krusty Burger, he finds that they are about to kill a pig.The pig runs to him so Homer decides to take him in.Homer basically has lots of fun with the pig like in the infamous ""Spider Pig"" scene while Bart feels neglected and starts taking a liking to Flanders.Meanwhile, Homer dumps a silo of ""pig crap"" into Lake Springfield which is on the verge of being polluted.After this, the government seals springfield in a circular glass dome.When the springfielders find out it was Homer's fault, they all try to kill him, but they find a way out of the dome and they go live in Alaska.When the government finds out about this, they decide to destroy Springfield killing everybody.So now its up to the Simpsons family to save them all.The Simpsons movie is very entertaining and definitely a must see for any Simpsons fan."

","This movie was so dang funny. It's definitely better than the new episodes, that's for sure. The story is about Homer dumping his new pet's poo into the river and the town goes crazy over it. The government traps them in Springfield and wont let them escape because their pollution is bad. They must find a way to save Springfield. There were a lot of sexual references and drug scenes in this movie. My theater were crazy about it too. This kids sitting next to me was laughing so hard he kept laughing on my arm lol. I tried to back away, but if I backed away too much i'd be leaning against an old fat man sitting to me. Too much info there lol. But The Simpsons Movie is a great hilarious fun ride if you're fan of the series. Even if you're not people still tend to enjoy it. Eighteen years and here it is! It was all worth it! I can't wait to get it on DVD!"
"dobbin-4","10","3","10","28 July 2007"," The Simpsons Movie is just as good as the series.
","The Simpsons Movie is an awesome movie that is just as good as the series. The movies plot is that after Homer dumps Pig Crap in to the Springfield river the EPA(Environmentel Protection Agency) puts a giant dome over Springfield. The movie is very funny and I am very glad that I waited 6 years to see this film. The film is very good for many reasons like It did not repeat humour from the series and that it did not lose depth in the characters. Overall this movie is a must see and deserves high praise and while there are some jokes there that could insult you(for example Religion, Gay jokes and children drinking alcohol) but it is a very movie and is good for kids. I rate it 96%."

","Like many people around the world, I rushed to see the most anticipated film of the year, The Simpsons Movie. And I was not at all disappointed. I must be honest, I did, before seeing the film, think that it would be a big let-down. I thought that they'd use all the same jokes as the episodes and that it would have a real try-hard vibe to it's humor. Well, it didn't. I can't believe that after 20 years 'in the making', the film version of The Simpsons would be so enthralling. Hilarious, Jam-packed with cute new characters (ie, the pig), and a follow-able story-line, The Simpsons Movie is not one to be missed! If you are not on your way to see it now, you should be."

","The Greenday, sorry... the Green House Effect; the U.S. gov't is evil; Democrats to power!; Capitalism is evil; corporations and CEOs are all Fascists; All Hail Che Guevara and Joseph Stalin!... So what else is new in the extreme Left-wing Simpsons universe? Absolutely nothing. Except maybe that politics never played such a large role as in their redundant theatrical release. That fat charlatanic clown Michael Moore must be proud.<br/><br/>(Btw, they ARE right (sorry... left) about one thing: only morons would pay to see what you get for free on TV. I watched this for free so I'm in the clear.)<br/><br/>Let's start with direct quotes <br/><br/>""This gov't has lost its credibility so now it's borrowing some of mine"". - Tom Hanks. Just what credibility has Hanks the do-goodering hypocrite have? Credibility as a dumb Hollywood actor? Two Oscars for playing dullards in very bad movies? Or maybe they refer to his credibility of agreeing to star in a thriller based on a book which made up a plethora of fallacious historical claims? (""The Da Vinci Code"", of course.) <br/><br/>""Finally the white rich man is in control again"". - Mr. Burns. This sounds like Michael Moore's ""Dumb White Men"" book title. What's this superiority complex that these Marxist American white men have? They are apparently the ""noble"" white men - a minority, but of course - while all these multitudes of right-winging and centrist white people (yes, even centrists are labeled as ""Fascists"" by these clueless arrogant buffoons) are all supposed to be money-hungry racists who destroy the environment. Matt Groening and his merry band of rich middle-aged douche-bag hippies seem to forget that it's the Communist nations and other countries with dictatorships that pollute the environment by far the most. So who should be in control then, according to these Maoists? Should the U.S. have a Congress made up of 500 blacks and American Indians and 3 white women? Is that the point here? Laughable... ""The evil white man"". I don't even know how to call this?... ""Auto-racism""? ""Self-racism""? It's so absurd it's almost funny.<br/><br/>""America: where any man can make quick money with no questions asked"". - Homer. This is actually a good point. For example: any Hollywood producer can put together a Left-wing propaganda movie, using millions of ""dollarinos"", make false claims and spread slander about various gov't institutions and other issues - all in the name of ""satire"", but of course - and then release that trash onto millions of gullible, semi-educated viewers AND MAKE TONS OF MONEY. What hypocrites these left-wing, RICH, morons are. Mighty rich, coming from these stinking rich, decadent, drug-happy Hollywood writers! It's precisely America's freedom that allows Hollywood to spread its Leftist anti-U.S. propaganda in the first place... Should be a hit in France...<br/><br/>""I am the mascot of an evil corporation"". - Bart. Yet ANOTHER stab at corporations, one of about a dozen in this ""Battleship Potemkin"" sequel... Matt Groening, a rather fat man, is a consumer, just like the rest of us, yet he hates all these corporations... Does he even know why? Probably not. Too much pot over the decades has softened his head somewhat.<br/><br/>""It's not like the U.S. gov't is listening to everyone's conversation"". An obvious nod to Bush's new anti-terrorism laws, which the Leftists so oppose, simply because to them terrorists barely even exist - and isn't it Bush anyway who, according to them, caused 9/11? Jesus... This movie is so full of such blatant anti-Bush/Republican propaganda, I wonder why they dimply didn't release this overly long political cartoon in October 2008, just before the U.S. elections? <br/><br/>""The gov't actually found someone we're looking for"". A nod to the current gov't's inability to find Bin Laden. Of course, as we ALL know, if Gore or Hillary were in power, Bin Laden would be found in a millisecond! This entire movie is so riddled with desperate liberal pleas for the masses to stop voting Republican, that it takes away so much from enjoying the actually quite solid humour. It is so full of Left-wing dogma that I almost wonder if Bin Laden and Sean Penn financed it... I'll have to check the end-credits again...<br/><br/>Already the beginning of this ""movie"" put me off. Green Day, of all bands, desecrating the main ""Simpsons"" melody?? Green Day are - ironically - a typical ultra-commercial product of EVIL MUSIC CORPORATIONS (this time I agree about the evil part...), consisting of three spoiled upper-class preppies, one of whom is even called Joseph Hickles Erland the Third (or st. like that), who pretend to play punk while they belt out their sorry pop tunes that even Burns's great-grandfather could move his feet to without missing a beat. Rich pseudo-punk rebel midgets who want to save the world like that egomaniac Bono? Gimme a break...<br/><br/>Matt Groening, Green Day, and Michael Moore are the ""American Idiots"" and ""Dumb White Men"" here. The irony here should make mountains shake - to the tune of a heavy, hard-rockin' Green Day... ballad. <br/><br/>Talk about the pot calling the kettle black...<br/><br/>Watching that semi-amusing segment in Homer's brain reminded of the typical mind of a self-deluded, denial-ridden, overly idealistic, smug Hollywood liberal: that kind of nonsense pretty much goes on in their heads, too. Should I even say it...? Yes: another painful irony.<br/><br/>This cute 80-minute political cartoon has a much stronger first half. Once the setting changes to Alaska, it's all downhill. Still, the level of the comedy in ""Simpsons: the (Marxist View of Modern America) Movie"" is far better than that of the last 10 or so seasons. After all, 17 years is far too long. That show is spent. If you want something funny AND intelligent, totally unpretentious (i.e. no annoying Lisa characters) watch ""South Park"". Unlike the ""Simpsons"" show, they're in their prime still..."
"GeorgeWaltonLucasJr","5","3","11","26 July 2007"," Disappointing
","After six years in production, The Simpsons Movie is here at last. So how does the venerable TV show translate to the big screen? Well, the animation has been given a big face-lift, leaving it crisper and livelier than ever before. (Although the trailers boast that The Simpsons is proudly 2D, there's a lot of slick 3D rendering with cell shading overlaid.) The length -- almost four times that of a regular episode -- permits an unprecedented cameo-fest, with Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer, Hank Azaria, et al voicing a 98-character-strong menagerie. But in most other respects it's the TV show writ large. And although this will please some fans, the truth is that the writers have not really risen to the occasion offered by the medium.<br/><br/>The plot is essentially a variation on a well-worn Simpsons motif: Homer's impulsiveness lands the family in a wacky situation. In this instance, Homer tips poop into dangerously-polluted Springfield Lake, resulting in the power-mad Environmental Protection Agency supremo (Albert Brooks) putting a gigantic dome over Springfield, ostensibly to quarantine it. Along the way we encounter some other familiar developments: Homer's exasperating disregard for Marge causes marital strife, before he has an epiphany and changes his ways. Homer takes an inappropriate pet. Homer's bad parenting causes Bart to seek another father figure. Lisa meets a boy with improbably similar interests. And so on. Long-time Simpsons fans have seen it all before, sometimes several times, and it's a bit disappointing to find such tired clichés wheeled out again, especially since the movie and its 87-minute runtime were a chance to do something new with the series.<br/><br/>But bearing its limited inventiveness in mind, it's perfectly possible to enjoy The Simpsons Movie. The jokes vary in quality but are so many -- nearly every line is a gag -- that enough stick to keep the audience amused. (Unsurprisingly, the biggest laughs come near the beginning, before the weak plot gathers pace.) On the other hand, there are no instances of genuinely brilliant wit, the kind we've seen in the series on a number of occasions. An average 6-minute episode of Yu-Gi-Oh: The Abridged Series is probably more quotable.<br/><br/>You are unlikely, for example, to leave the cinema regaling your friends with ""The federal government finally found something!"" Suffice it to say that as a piece of summer fluff, The Simpsons Movie delivers adequately. But as the long-awaited cinematic take on a veritable cultural icon, it is a let down: neither taking advantage of its swollen budget and lengthy runtime to try something new and interesting, nor even managing to stage the familiar with the incisive wit and engaging plotting of many classic Simpsons episodes."

","I just got done watching the movie and was surprised. After reading all the hate reviews I was totally blown away. I was not angry that they chose the EPA for the bad guys. I personally don't believe in Global Warming because of what was going on in the 70's (Global Cooling, we're all causing our own death because of carbon footprints, blah, blah, blah). This movie is a treat all the way through. It's crude (as always) it's funny (as always) and it's smart (as always). If you are offended easily and/or a Enviromentalist, don't see this movie. If you are a Simpsons fan, see it. That's all I have to say. Anyone who doesn't laugh at the ""Spider-Pig"" song or the part where Bart rides his skateboard through Springfield doesn't have a sense of humor or takes him/herself WAY too seriously."
"Ricardo-36","8","2","6","23 August 2007"," Good Stuff
","Since I heard about the movie being released, I knew it would be pure gold. The writers can still deliver good material, even though the quality has decreased since season 11 or so, and the series is know almost vitually unwatchable.<br/><br/>This is season 9 material here, folks, I kid you not. It had that good feeling and comedy we get from the best episodes. Albert Brooks as a main character is a treat, he's the best voice guest and deserves to be there.<br/><br/>The animation is top notch, but gets a bit distracting some times (CGI cell shading scenes a la Futurama).<br/><br/>Sure, there are a few problems: the movie feels a bit too short, few characters get screen time (Ralph got way too many scenes, and a lot of beloved characters did not even appear), and some subplots feel rushed and go nowhere (kinda like the TV series I guess). The DVD will have LOTS of cut material, so that might get fixed on a subsequent viewing.<br/><br/>If you are a fan of the Simpsons, specially the 8-10 seasons, THIS is the movie to see this year."
"moviegeek310","10","2","6","7 August 2007"," Exxxcellent!
","Without even reviewing ""The Simpson's Movie"" I could tell you to go see it and you probably would. If you have seen the ""Simpson's"" on TV in the past 18 years and thought it was hilarious or even semi-funny then you'll love this movie. Of course, if you think ""The Simpson's"" are boring, crude, not funny, and don't get the humor, then steer clear of this film. For those who are fans, you won't be disappointed. I laughed probably once every ten seconds, no joke. In fact, this movie is so funny and well made that it is already #148 on IMDb's Top 250 Movies of All Time list. <br/><br/>I won't disclose any plot details for fear of ruining a funny joke or gag, but I will say that there is actually a plot. It's not just 90 minutes random humor, though there is plenty of that. Everything about ""The Simpson's Movie"" is great, it all flows so nicely, and the jokes fly so fast and furious that you wish the movie would go on forever. I will caution some of you though, while it is a very mild PG-13, the film still makes fun of everything, and I do mean everything. From global warming, to republicans and democrats, to homosexuality, to Christianity, to making fun of itself  at one point Homer asks why we'd pay money to see something we could see for free on TV  and even makes fun of the rock band Green Day. So if you're easily offended, I wouldn't recommend the ""Simpson's Movie""<br/><br/>Just like the TV show the voice talents fit their characters like a glove. Especially Dan Castellaneta as Homer and about 20 other characters. So take my word for it, ""The Simpson's Movie"" is downright hilarious, and very smartly done. It's just all around great, easily the best cartoon film ever made. I give it 10 out of 10. It's rated PG-13 for crude humor throughout."
"marianozamudiozertuche","9","2","6","5 August 2007"," The Simpsons is not all about laughing
","I found the film interesting in how Bart showed a different attitude from what we know of this character, he plays a more mature role, although he doesn't lose his essence. The scene at night on the tree was pretty moving for me. I thought I would see a more humorous Homer, also, but I think he felt forced by the story writers to accomplish a primary role without letting him improvise. The animation was nothing to do with that famous 2-D motto that was used to promote the film. But what I sense the most serious failure of this film wasn't the film itself, but the extremely overcast trailers FOX made, at a point that along most of the time of playing you could recognize them, not letting the spectator to imagine and enjoy the film with a sense of surprise and astonishment. That spoiled the story more than any other thing."
"happipuppi13","10","2","6","4 August 2007"," Fast, Funny,Touching And Worth The D'Oh!
","I'm writing this review literally minutes after seeing The Simpsons Movie and all I have to say is bravo!!! <br/><br/>The movie,thankfully,did not stray far from the series that Simpsons fans know and love. The animation is of course a higher scale and is perfect for a big screen effort and triumph,such as this one. <br/><br/>Don't wait for it to be on video! The effects are more spectacular on a large movie screen.<br/><br/>Okay,that's enough of sounding like Martin. To put it in simple form Homer once again,ignores the words & warnings of Marge by polluting Springfield lake with a mini-silo of Spider Pig's refuse all for the sake of getting to a doughnut shop before it closes.<br/><br/>His actions effect not just his family but the whole town as well and even the govt. gets in on it by taking drastic action against Springfield by closing them off from the world. The Simpsons are all fingered for the blame and the family escapes the town and heads to Alaska.<br/><br/>Side story lines in include Lisa's infatuation with a new Irish boy in town who's also concerned about the environment and causes she shares.<br/><br/>Bart being humiliated by his own father who dares him to skateboard into town without his clothes. (A hilarious skateboard ride through town by the way.) Finally,thanks to Homer pinning the blame on Bart to the police,Bart's had enough and wishes Flanders were his dad and starts spending time with him.<br/><br/>The upshot is how can Homer redeem himself,save his family and the town of Springfield,now that he has screwed up 1,000,000 times worse than he ever did on TV? See the movie,I have and despite not being even 90 minutes long,it's worth the $7 + price of admission. (I saw it at 2pm,so it was a matinée).<br/><br/>Every joke and gag works,the touching moments actually are and don't feel like the same exact ones from the show. There's no big message here except the obvious one about the environment,which is important but your not clubbed over the head with it.<br/><br/>The Simpsons sure have come a long way since ""Bart Gets an ""F"",that's for certain.<br/><br/>10 stars easy,you have to be slower than Homer to not want to see this!

"TheEmulator23","6","2","6","4 August 2007"," 10 years too late, and the wait, not really worth it.
","An absolutely average movie. There isn't really a lot about this to say except it had few chuckles and many gags that just don't belong in a movie. Half of the gimmicks/jokes aren't barley even worth a regular episode on the show, let alone having to pay 10 bucks to see what was done better the first few years of the show. Overall I give it a little better than a 2 stars, but not worth more than that. For the die-hard fans (meaning those that still watch the show now) I'm sure they will love it. For those that stopped watching it 10 years ago, we'll just think it was a decent longer episode of the glory years of the show. For those that don't watch ""The Simpsons"" at all, well they will chuckle a little bit, but they won't think much about it. All the good reviews are sort of hard to stomach, because the film really isn't that good on it's on merits. I won't say the film is bad, but c'mon now people it's not really that good either! Right now it's ranked here on IMDb as one of the TOP 250 ever. I am hoping that as people calm down after waiting 19 years to see this (A big reason why it's rating is so high) film, they will go back and see the film isn't really all that terrific. I will say that the marketing of this film is some of the best I have ever seen though."

Well it should.<br/><br/>SPOILERS BELOW:<br/><br/>Homer gets it right early in the movie when he stands up during the Itchy and Scratchy cartoon and says that anyone who would pay money to see a movie that they can see for free on TV is a dope. Well apparently Groening (more like ""groaning"") thinks all his fans are dopes, because the jokes are on us (and very few on the screen).<br/><br/>Among the items children should not see are: there was a robot committing suicide, cartoon nudity, ""the finger"", and Marge says ""God damned"".

","The long awaited Simpson's movie has finally been released and a lot of people have been wondering- did they miss the boat to release their movie? I think not. The film is very popular and has a excellent storyline which is surprisingly different than I thought it would be. I like the cameos of Arnold Shwarzenegger as President and Tom Hanks, they give it good comic value. The plot of destroying Springfield and taking it off the map, I thought, was actually rather complex for a 2-D cartoon, but they didn't throw away the feel of the Simpson's and still had all the things that made it funny e.g. Bart saying 'You won't find the treasure of imawiener' to the villain with a gun, then the villain saying 'I'm a wiener?' then Homer and Bart bursting into hysterics. Overall, the film is a fantastic adaption of the Simpson's to the big screen and is enjoyable whether you're a harcore Simpson's fan or a Simpson's virgin."

I hoped that I wouldn't be disappointed, and i wasn't. There was probably 3 laughs a minute, and most of them remind you of classic Simpson's jokes, such as praying people running into Moes and drinkers running into the Church( in time of crisis, prayers become sinners and sinners become prayers) when the dome is placed over the town. Also when Bart skateboards naked( warning...you WILL SEE Bart's genitals) and Ralph simply says"" I like men now"". Also be prepared for Marge swearing and Homer jumping into a sinkhole shouting ""So long suckers!"" and giving the double bird to the mob but he sinks to slow and the mob starts to claw at his head.

","""The Simpsons Movie"" is funny. It's really funny. in fact, it's incredibly funny, and funny enough for me to consider paying to see it a second time in the theater. Even those not familiar with the show should find something to like in this mixed bag of a comedy.<br/><br/>The plot is goofy at best, but then again, who would want it any other way? Basically, Homer makes a big mistake that gets him in big trouble with the other inhabitants of Springfield and gets his town in trouble with the government. You'll have to see it to believe it. Most of the major characters from the show at least make appearances, most of them leaving me laughing. Though it's certainly not working on a very high level, it still works miraculously. It left everyone in the theater where I saw it clapping in the end. Unlike almost every other film produced these days, it has a short and clean run-time as well as a hilariously tight script. I can't dignify putting it on the same level as ""The Godfather"" or ""psycho,"" but it's certainly worth seeing. It works, from start to finish, like a charm. D'oh!"
"theboywhocouldfly","Null","2","6","30 July 2007"," how sad.....
","How sad to see what was once a witty, exceptionally creative well run so horribly dry. There are some chuckles, but almost any earlier Simpsons' TV episode (the latter seasons continue a fairly steady nosedive)would blow this insult to fans off the planet. The animation has more angles and camera moves but the wry wit is long gone. Having the Simpson's swear or give the finger just dumbs it all down even more. A pity. What could have been a well crafted gift to the long standing fans arrives like a used knick knack from a dollar store. It's already performing incredibly at the box office so a sequel is perhaps a definite. But lets hope they bring back the original writers. Or make a two hour ""Tree House Of Horror"" episode (though even those have lost their spark in recent seasons), which couldn't possibly be as bland as this film. Let's hope."

There was nothing corny, hokey, or just plain stupid as there has been in the darker moments of the T.V series.<br/><br/>Still, it does not quite measure up to the glory days of say ""A Street Car Named Marge"" or the ""Power Plant Strike"" but it does come darn close.<br/><br/>The reason that I only rated it a 7 and not higher is that for my money, the movie was actually too short. The writers easily had another half hour out of the material. Some characters were underutilized and some not at all.<br/><br/>Still ""Don't have a cow man!"" The Simpson's Movie is ""Dar-diddly-arn good"""

","The movie started out great, though even in the beginning it had some awkward moments. By the time the plot really got going the jokes mostly disappeared and frankly the plot was not all that compelling. I did like that there was a real plot and that they tried to bring back the old elements of the show, but for the most part they did a below average job. The plot felt very forced and a lot of the jokes in the latter parts of the movie were very corny. I know that it is hard to live up to all of the hype, but it could have been much better. In addition, since the movie was relatively short, I had already seen too many of the jokes in previews and was left out of a lot of laughs. I still enjoyed it overall, but left feeling quite disappointed."

","(This is the same review I submitted to Amazon.com, and I have posted on my website.)<br/><br/>**This review contains spoilers**<br/><br/>This movie was great! Ten times more funnier than the TV shows, and you get to see a lot of added detail that is not allowed on the show. The characters utter a few curses, and you get to see one of the main characters in the nude. <br/><br/>The plot goes like this: the family is at the theater watching, ""The Itchy and Scratchy movie,"" where Homer announces that it is stupid to pay for a movie when you can watch the cartoon at home. He then points his finger at the screen, and the movie begins. <br/><br/>Springfield is on the breakdown of an ecological crisis. The mayor decides that action must be taken, or the town will become a living landfill. Homer manages to foil the plan by dumping toxic waste into the town's water supply. Once the EPA cracks down on Springfield it's up to Homer to save the day. <br/><br/>I can honestly say this has got to the funniest movie I've seen in a long time. I swear I was laughing so hard I was crying! The drawings and art work were perfect, the sound was crystal clear and the jokes were non-stop. Sure, there are some cuss words and other things, but who cares? This movie was awesome. <br/><br/>10 stars <br/><br/>~~Kat"

","Absolutely hilarious.<br/><br/>Please ignore those old-fart comments about how the Simpsons aren't what they used to be. They saved their best jokes for this movie, and The Simpsons lived up to its name.<br/><br/>I liked how the writers did not try to over-do it. They stayed within their realm of the ""TV"" feel and it worked beautifly. The plot wasn't too original; it was a basic simpson's plot where homer messes up and pisses off a lot of people only to gain a conscience and redeem himself But the jokes and humor within the plot are Grade A quality.<br/><br/>Was it as good as the Simpsons were 10 years ago? Personally, I thought it was. You may not, but that's not the point. Remember that for those who didn't like this movie, they are comparing it against the already gold-standard of the Simpsons, which is extremely high. Against any other comedy movie out there, the Simpson's is a top-contender.<br/><br/>My vote for Comedy of the Year!"

","SPOILERS<br/><br/>This is definitely my most anticipated movie this year. I mean, it has been eighteen years and it is finally here! I kept telling myself that this was going to be great, but there was always this little feeling of dread. If it was as bad as some of the past seasons, this would be a horrible movie. Luckily, it was not. In fact, I think that this is easily the best movie I have seen in 2007. It stuck to its old humor, it did not go too over-the-top, and no scene was the slightest bit boring. I laughed at almost every scene. I still can not believe they actually showed Bart's, well, you know.<br/><br/>Here is the plot. Green Day is playing at a concert. Then their barge falls into Lake Springfield, polluting it. Then, at church, Grandpa becomes possessed and starts talking randomly. Marge finds it to be strange and tries to figure out what he was saying. Lisa then starts talking about the environment to the town, but they care less. She then meets Colin, a boy who shares the same concern as she does. Then, Homer dares Bart to skateboard to Krusty Burger naked. He does, and is caught. Ned Flanders then gives him pants and says he understands Bart's pain. Homer then adopts a pig named Spider-Pig. Lisa then talks to the town that the lake can't have anymore pollution. Mayor Quimby makes the town clean the lake. Then, Marge discovers that Spider-Pig's waste silo is overflowing and tells Homer to get rid of it. He does, but puts it into the lake, polluting it even more. A squirrel becomes mutated because of it, and the EPA's leader, Russ Cargill, takes it to the President, who puts a dome over Springfield, so that the pollution won't get to the outside world. The police then discover that Homer cause the town to be polluted. An angry mob then attacks the Simpson home. Maggie then shows the family a sinkhole to escape through. They escape, but their house it destroyed. The family escapes to Alaska. In Springfield, though, people try to break the dome. Cargill decides to blow Springfield up. The Simpsons here about this, and want to rescue the town, except for Homer, who stays behind. Homer then tries to look for them. Then the family is captured, except for Homer, who finally gets back to the town. Then, Cargill gets the bomb and drops it into Springfield. Homer and Bart then get a motorcycle and throws the bomb outside the dome, breaking the dome and saving the town, and Cargill is killed by Maggie. <br/><br/>Overall, this is easily the best animated film I have ever seen. It is hilarious, it is epic, and the animation is fantastic. The Simpsons is my favorite show and this is definitely one of my favorite movies of all time. This is definitely going to be nominated for Best Animated Film at the Academy Awards. The plot does get confusing at times, and some characters are unnecessary, but if you watch this film, the humor, the sight gags, and the parodies are so great, you will forget all about the plot and the unnecessary characters. Anyway, this is a great movie and I would definitely recommend this to anyone.<br/><br/>10/10<br/><br/>Recommended Titles: The Simpsons."
"keiichi73","6","2","6","27 July 2007"," A mixture of ""D'oh"" and ""Whoo-hoo""
","Has any movie this summer been met with more fan pressure than The Simpsons Movie? When you consider that viewers have been clamoring for a theatrical film for over 10 years, you certainly have to admire creator Matt Groening's guts for not rushing a movie out into theaters just to make money. I walked into the film with mixed emotions. On one hand, this was a moment I had been waiting for since I was literally 13-years-old. On the other, given the dip in quality on the show during the past few years, I was desperately trying not to set my hopes up too high. Now that I have seen it, I can safely say that the movie combines both the best and worst aspects of the show itself into an uneven, but still highly entertaining, film.<br/><br/>The Simpson family's beloved town of Springfield is slowly being turned into a hazardous waste dump after years of dumping garbage and sludge into the local lake. After rock group Green Day have an untimely demise sinking into the murky depths of the lake, 8-year-old Simpson daughter Lisa (voice by Yeardley Smith) makes it her mission to wake up the local townspeople to what's happening. Unfortunately, her father Homer (Dan Castellaneta) has never been one to listen to sense or reason. Due to reasons too complicated to summarize here, Homer winds up dumping a silo full of pig feces into the lake, officially turning the town into the most polluted place on Earth. The Government decides to get involved, and President Arnold Schwarzenegger (Harry Shearer) is talked into sealing the entire town within a dome in order to protect the rest of the world by the head of the Environmental Protection Agency (Albert Brooks). Along with loving wife Marge (Julie Kavner), hell-raising son Bart (Nancy Cartwright), and baby Maggie, Homer must find a way to escape from the town after the people of Springfield turn against him for dooming them all.<br/><br/>Like many TV-to-film adaptations, The Simpsons Movie struggles to adapt itself to its new format. After a fairly strong opening 40 minutes, the movie slows down quite a bit, and becomes mired in an environmental-themed plot that avoids being too preachy, but still seems somewhat out of place for the characters. I understand that this is a movie, and Groening and his team are trying to not just make a retread of the show. And yet, the movie still seems padded. There are numerous subplots to fill in time, but these either have disappointing or no resolution at all, or they are good as they currently are, but could have been even better if the film focused on them a little bit more. A good example is the plot concerning son Bart feeling he doesn't get enough attention from his father, and starts seeking solace in overly kind neighbor Ned Flanders. What's up there on the screen is good, but watching it, I felt like it never builds the way it should, and the pay off is pretty much non-existent and overly rushed. Only the plot concerning young Lisa finding her soul mate with a new boy named Colin seems to hit the right mark when it comes to a close.<br/><br/>For every bit of weakness contained within The Simpsons Movie, there are at least two moments to make up for it at least. I laughed quite a bit throughout the film, and smiled even more, especially during the first half of the film. The film is at its best before the proper ""save the town"" plot kicks in, and tries to be just as irrelevant as the show can often be. There is a sense of free-spirited anarchy and fun that is curiously missing from the later half of the film. While the plot-driven part of the film does have its moments of brilliance, it never quite lives up to everything that came before it. I'm proud to say that the commercials have for once not ruined the best jokes in the film. Given the decline in the writing on the TV show the past couple seasons, it seriously felt good to laugh out loud at the characters again.<br/><br/>I strongly believe that your reaction to The Simpsons Movie will depend greatly on your reaction to The Simpsons themselves. If you never got into the show, this movie will do absolutely nothing to change your mind. The movie knows its audience, and unless you're a member of the converted, you can give this a pass. But, for those who have literally been waiting years for this movie, it may not be perfect, but you won't be let down overall. Be sure to stick around for the end credits as well, to hear Maggie learn an important ""first word"" when it comes to Hollywood. The quality of The Simpsons Movie doesn't quite make me long for what she hopes for, but at the same time, I wouldn't mind it."

","Along with millions of other Simpsons fans, I was a bit worried when I first heard that the movie was being written. I was a little more at ease when I heard that it would be a collaboration of writers from all the seasons. It showed. The movie was amazing. I laughed out loud from the very beginning to the end of the credits. There were so many great quotable lines, I will no doubt have to see it again and again. Go see this movie as soon as possible if you're a Simpsons fan, you will not be disappointed. The only downside for the true fans is the abundance of fair-weather fans who will no doubt flock to the theater to claim that they've been fans all along and then complain that it wasn't that good. Ignore them, enjoy the movie.<br/><br/>By the way, the person who said Ricky Gervais' episode was bad is in no way accurate. Gervais wrote one of the funnier episodes of that season - completely on target with a more subtle, British approach. I will agree that it's not for everyone, but nothing is."
"antj999","10","2","6","27 July 2007"," Simpsons Movie does NOT disappoint!
","Personally I do not really think that the Simpsons has been going downhill in recent years, though I can accept points of views stating that it has. With many people discussing the decline in quality of the show over the past few years I even had my doubts as to how good (or more to the point, how great) the movie would actually be.<br/><br/>It did not disappoint...far from it in fact. It by far exceeded my expectations, and my expectations were almost unreachable!! From the opening scene to the closing scene this film delivers what every Simpsons fan wants and what every Simpsons episode should deliver. With so many moments that will have you laughing for an assortment of reasons, this movie is an example of why the Simpsons has lasted so long, and could last for much longer! The film is suitable for all the family, with the little children having their own moments to laugh at, whilst not understanding some of the more adult jokes. There are a few moments/scenes which the show would not include in a TV-aired episode. These moments come as sometimes a shock but are ALL hilarious! The Simpsons Movie, whilst being side-splittingly funny from start to end, also has probably one of the most emotional scenes ever seen from our favourite yellow family.<br/><br/>Homer's imagination, stupidity and golden heart are the essence of this amazingly beautifully crafted and hilarious film.<br/><br/>Whether you are a Simpsons fan of years gone by, a current fan or someone who wants to know 'what the big deal' is - I highly recommend this movie! You will not be disappointed! My only possible criticism is that I would have liked it to be longer...but surely that is a compliment more than a criticism? 10/10"

","The movie that is ""eighteen years in the making"" has finally arrived, but is The Simpsons Movie really as good as it looks? The definite answer is, I'm very happy to say, a loud YES! The Simpsons Movie is filled with all sorts of fun things that will thrill fans of the show to the bone. There are loads of in-jokes, movie references, and there is even a recorded song version of 'Spider-Pig', the tune Homer makes up for his new pig. Heck, even if you aren't a particular fan of the show or you feel that the quality of the show has dropped considerably in the last few seasons, there is nothing to worry about; The Simpsons Movie makes up for everything, including some of the shows faults (of which there really aren't that many anyways).<br/><br/>Without giving too much away, Springfield is in crisis after a mishap with the lake causes the entire town to be covered in a huge solid (and strangely hard to break) glass dome. All sorts of things happen, including Bart starting to grow attached to Flanders, issues between Marge and Homer, a love interest for Lisa, a special moment for Maggie (if you stay during the credits), and many things too random to mention in a simple review.<br/><br/>The madcap humor of the show translates perfectly to the big screen, and there are plenty of laugh-out-loud moments *most* of the entire family can enjoy (the movie IS rated PG-13, after all). Each member of the family has their moment to shine, and the large Simpsons cast also fits in perfectly in one way or another. No line goes wasted; there is always an intelligent one-liner or hilarious physical humor that everyone has grown to love from the show.<br/><br/>What makes The Simpsons Movie so perfect, however, is its huge amount of heart. Behind all of the laughs, in-jokes, and intelligent product placement, this cartoon feature has loads of heart in some of the most unexpected places. The movie never takes itself to seriously, which is hard to find in some films these days. If anymore was said, the movie would certainly be spoiled.<br/><br/>Overall, The Simpsons Movie was a very fun time at the movies, filled with so many laugh-out-loud moments that you are left pretty much breathless by the end. While the movie is pretty short, it never feels too short or long; it actually has great pacing and never outstays its welcome. One can only hope for a sequel that is half as funny or full of heart as this first Simpsons Movie is. At the moment, though, The Simpsons Movie is one of the best of its kind and gives animated films a good name, especially by pushing the envelope to a PG-13 rating. Not much more can be said, so just go see the movie already (I saw the midnight screening)! 9.5/10, or A+"

Where is the value in showing that Homer, the father, has an IQ that is lower than the number of family members? I guess they themselves are like Homer - who have missed the meaning of life and find pleasure in senseless talk - Emptyminded.

","""The Simpsons Movie"" (2007) is an animated movie based on the loved cartoons under the same name. The movie is pretty good, but if you want to get as much out of it as possible, there are a few things you need to keep in mind before watching:<br/><br/>This movie is obviously very humorous but features different kinds of humor - all from slapstick to sarcasm which fills up the wide range of comedy quite well. A lot of the humor is however irreverent, so if crude jokes bothers you, there will be a few cringey moments.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is also serious at times. Despite being a comedy, it delivers some impactful moments that transcends its normal, witty approach. Those moments should be reflected upon and taken seriously, because there are some interesting things to learn. Homer's epiphany, for example, is surprisingly profound.<br/><br/>At last, there are some plot elements which does quite make sense. Honestly though, this is a wacky 90-minute cartoon. Take it seriously at times, but not too seriously.<br/><br/>My personal grade: a fresh and surprisingly sober 7/10. If you found this helpful, check my profile for more reviews."

","To be frank, this movie was awful. Don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons. Im a HUGE Simpsons kid. So when I saw this coming out in the movies, I was pretty darn excited. <br/><br/>And then I saw it. <br/><br/>Spiderpig? Really? The pig wasn't funny. Homer just kept renaming the damn pig he adopted to various pop-culture characters, which I suppose kept the more easily pleased members of the theater happy. But not me, I was hoping for the original wit and humor of the Simpsons to build this movie. No such chance. <br/><br/>The plot- terrible. A giant dome put over Springefield? Gimme a break. You know what this movie SHOULD have been about? SIDESHOW BOB! He's my favorite character, and he didn't appear once! The Simpsons Movie could have been so much better if it was about his murderous revenge on Bart, not the damn pig and EPA. (Oh, and another thing, Mr Burns makes a minute cameo...that's right, pretty much 60 seconds)<br/><br/>There is some really weird personality shifts too, most noticeably in Bart. He goes through a strange phase of wanting fatherly guidance, whereas in the series he seems fine with it, and turns to Flanders for support. Oh yes, may I mention he also has a whiskey drinking problem? A 10 year old boy? (Ha..ha...not) <br/><br/>The stuff is unfunny. It's really all slapstick. REPEATED slapstick. If I remember correctly there is about three times Homer hurts himself on the roof. Whats worse is the lack of violence on the beginning of the Itchy and Stratchy cartoon- there's no blood!<br/><br/>There's also some little romance between Lisa and this boy called Colin, that doesn't last all that long and just kinda moves the plot along. It's pretty pointless, and is quite dull. <br/><br/>Don't see it if you're a simpsons fan."
"the_naked_airplane","3","1","2","18 July 2011"," Enough already!
","Well it was inevitable wasn't it? The Simpsons hasn't been relevant, sharp or consistently funny for several years now. It was perhaps a false dawn but the return of the 'old' writing team promised a upturn in form. A homecoming of sorts to relive the glory days of one of the modern comic greats.<br/><br/>Only the truth is that despite its 'promise' The Simpsons Movie falls short on a number of counts. The major point being laughs. There just aren't enough of them. Also there isn't that element of surprise anymore and it seems as though the writing team knows this. They have used up all their jokes and rehashed and then repeated throughout the 17 some odd years of The Simpsons. Rather than catch us off guard with the razor sharp wit that is sorely lacking we get shock humour that is best left to South Park and Family Guy- Bart's penis anyone? I recall letting out two solid laughs (man being crushed by dome-Ralph Wiggum's 'i like men now'). The only time I was caught off guard being the appearance of Bart's todger. The rest of the duration I managed to titter intermittently and sterile gags which we've heard before (Chief Wiggum nearly blowing his head off with his gun for whatever elementary reason-doughnuts).<br/><br/>'Minor' characters, Mr Burns, Sideshow Bob, Frink, Comic Book Guy etc etc weren't always integral to plots but they made the show buzz, gave it a freshness. The film centre's too much on the family and result is a drab story which goes no particular place quickly (Alaska okay, I'm talking figuratively here). How many times have the Simpson family become disillusioned with each other only to realise just how much they mean to each other? Please. The global warming slant is a feeble attempt to be relevant which falls flat.<br/><br/>It's a sad case, ultimately. I'd like to think that Groening and friends might put The Simpsons out of their misery but there's clearly been no narrative closure so we can expect more. Just one thought. If I'd been watching this 'movie' on TV,I would have switched channels."
"dg-op","4","1","2","6 August 2010"," A mediocre film that can't be compared to the series
","It was ridiculous to ask for a Simpsons' movie, when we could've enjoyed the series for free. However, producers convinced us of the ""need"" of a movie. With too much expectations the movie was produced and then released, but the result is extremely poor.<br/><br/>Since the 2000's the show had already changed its ironic and sarcastic humor to something more likely to a typical American sitcom, lowing its quality and sacrificing its intelligence. Somehow, this was a total sell- out. So, its creator decided to continue with this pathetic humor, since it cost lower and reported greater benefits for him.<br/><br/>So, the movie is mediocre just as the last season of the Simpsons have been. The plot, though it has some modern references (like the inclusion of a popular band at the time, like Greenday) fails to be funny when it sacrifices its intelligent humor and decides to be some sort of romantic comedy/road-pop movie. Yes, you'll see ""the guy"" (Homer) doing everything wrong, disappointing his family, but then having the opportunity for a redemption... sounds familiar, right? It's the classical romantic comedy, but in the Simpsons the failure is major because the plot is just ridiculous: some sort of Apocalypse is approaching to Springfield, and the fault is Homer's.<br/><br/>Is so terrible that such a great series at its beginnings has lost during the years so much of its quality, hitting a new low with the movie. And, just for you to know, the series has gotten even worse after the movie. Please, just keep in your memory the first ten seasons of the Simpsons. The rest is just a waste of your time."

Though Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's SOUTH PARK has long usurped THE SIMPSONS as the zenith of biting political and sociological satire, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE tries its best to bite back, aiming at a tender societal bone - the environment.<br/><br/>Dan Castellaneta (voicing Homer and a host of others) leads the regular voice cast (Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Hank Azaria, Harry Shearer, et al) in a tale about the city of Springfield going ""green,"" to the point of going Orwell, the Environmental Protection Agency eventually sealing the town in a giant dome for Homer's polluting transgressions. Brought about by Homer's newly adopted Spider Pig. ""Spider Pig, Spider Pig; does whatever a Spider Pig does..."" As he caused the en-doming of Springfield, it falls to Homer to free the town with some inspired accidents and contrived character arcing.<br/><br/>Created by Matt Groening, written by - well, everyone - and directed by David Silverman (co-director, MONSTERS, INC., 2001), unlike Trey Parker's and Matt Stone's SOUTH PARK: BIGGER, LONGER AND UNCUT (which stepped up from its episodic feel and made a hell of a feature film) THE SIMPSONS MOVIE finds Bart, Lisa, Marge Simpson and all the other much-loved denizens of Springfield trapped in episodic hell, business as usual.<br/><br/>No better, no worse. Just longer."
"onlyinname","1","1","2","19 January 2009"," Not very good
","I was disappointed with The Simpsons Movie. Like most cartoon-show feature films, the movie does not mash with the show very well, and this creates an uneasy dissonance. The jokes were what really made the film unpleasant for me, and as the film is a comedy, one can understand why I have given it a 3. I found a lot of the jokes slightly more censored and more cliché than in the show. And a lot were just plain boring---like a bad comedian. However, there were a few jokes that went further than the show would normally go, and I found these the worst of all (e.g. Bart's nudity). Another thing I did not like was the plot. It was actually quite shallow for a feature film, yet it tried to mask as an epic plot instead of going for something more ""campy"" or familiar---this made it very awkward. If you are hoping that this will be like a really long Simpsons episode, you hopes will remain unanswered. This film manages to turn away The Simpsons' two biggest audiences: audiences that want the normal Simpsons humor are disappointed; and parents that let their children watch The Simpsons normally, but do not want them seeing nudity, will not let them watch the film."
"ian-1211","4","1","2","15 December 2008"," What a Disappointment!
","When I heard that Matt Groening was making a Simpsons Movie, I was not happy. I know I have some real Simpson fanatics in my school that went on and on and on and on about each day. You know how trying that is, and to my disbelief, they got tickets to the premiere, oh how wonderful! The trailers failed to turn me on but when the movie actually came out in England, must spirits lifted. The reviewers were more than enthusiastic with the critics. The animation was pretty dam good and the still had the same voiceovers from many a year. I was beginning to look forward, you could say I was actually excited about it (then I mind, I haven't seen the recent episodes and I'm proud I haven't). God, how deceived I was! Maybe I was expecting too much and that how you can put this movie. First off and in reality, although I still love the Simpsons, I think the English media is showing too much attachment to this programme to admit the movie was a disappointment. Picture this, if they were just in a car driving to the Kwick-E-Mart and back in 75 minutes, our good 'ole English press will be saying ""Wow! Best Movie Ever!"" How sad. Second, the whole movie is just like a long Simpsons episode of recent quality. Too many obvious jokes and jackhammer clichés done to death. I mean, what's happened to Homer? He's not the Homer Simpson I know. He turned into a crude idiot and not the lovable oaf I know him as! Marge is just a nagger, something of Lois Griffin quality. Bart has lost his badassness and his childish remakes are getting old and what the deal with Flanders? Lisa is just a boring geek who's need to get a life and Maggie, well, she's alright! Now where's was the other characters? We needed Barney for his drunkenness, Moe for his crudeness, Patty and Selma for their bitterness and Burns for his meanness. Why couldn't Sideshow Bob be the villain (Mind you, the episodes with Sideshow Bob are getting boring? How much longer does he want to kill Bart while he's coming less of a threat!). The government guys will leave a bad taste in the mouth of American politics. Moe? Was he even in it? And where were the cat and dog? The story was pathetic! Truly pitiful! A dome around Springfield? Come on! The Alaska was boring and really, can they make a better story? The Marge-Homer relationship storyline has been done to death, I can count how many times that storyline has happened. My point is: the movie is just a huge letdown! The Simpsons are not as funny as they were and the outdated jokes do not come in they way of episode. I think Matt Groening should this now because the Simpsons will just be going will just go further down the pile of ratings. And what is the deal with pig? Spider-Pig? Are you having a laugh? Alas, the summer of 2007 is over (for eighteen months now) and I bet me 'ole school classmates were singing that Spider-Pig song to the point of tedium 'till the end of that year, god bless anyone around them! Another thing Matt, I hardly heard anyone laughing in the cinema, a few chuckles but that was it! Nothing significant. Nobody really laughed! Some even groaned! Any jokes were to-and-far between. If you think the Simpsons is not was it was, skip this and watch the seasons 1-9 instead. They're a lot funnier and original than tripe. Over and Out! <br/><br/>P.S. I can't wait to see the new Wallace and Gromit special coming out at Christmas! It's gonna be good."

","I came on here to check on references from the movie and was shocked to see how many bad reviews this got from supposed life long fans. I have been watching ""The Simpsons"" since they were a crudely drawn cartoon sketch on ""The Tracy Ullman Show"", and I happened to love this movie!! I think people need to realize that the show has evolved with the world around them; and just because Springfield remains unchanged, does not mean that the writers should. They have always been on point with current events as well as the social/political atmosphere in our country. I refer to ""The Simpsons"" as the most honest show on television, and it has been since the day it aired. This show is America.<br/><br/>I also often say that there are 2 kinds of people; those who love ""The Simpsons"" and those who hate them. And you can clearly tell the difference. My son started watching them at birth; it is one of the most educational cartoons out there, mixed with the kind of humor and satire I want my kid to be able to recognize.<br/><br/>Plus, aside from Al Gore and ""An Inconvenient Truth"" this movie did more for spreading the word on saving our environment than most things I can think of. Homer shows how most of us behave, otherwise we wouldn't see trash everywhere we go. Some idiot, probably you, threw it there."
"freemantle_uk","6","1","2","25 August 2008"," Average
","The Simpsons had been going downhill since the 9th Series, and the show lost a lot of credibility of making episodes like The Principal and the Pauper and All Singing, All Dancing, but generally still a good series. The new episodes are barely watchable now and to me the Simpsons is like an old sick pet, you would rather see it put to sleep then watch it suffer anymore pain. I did not have high hopes for the Simpsons Movies because of the decline of the show, and few of my friends did not recommend seeing it. I did not see it at the cinema and have recently seen it on Sky Movies.<br/><br/>The plot of the film is that Springfield is on the edge of ecologically disaster and Lisa campaigns to protect Springfield River. At church Grampa Simpson has a vision and warns that Springfield is heading for danger. Mayor Quimby orders that the river needs to be cleaned up. At the same time Homer adopts a pet pig, Spiderpig/Harry Popper (you can guess what they were making fun of). Homer ends up filling a silo full of pig and his own waste. When taking the silo to be disposed of Lenny calls Homer to tell him that Lard-boy doughnuts were going out of business and giving after free doughnuts. Knowing the fellow that Homer is, he decides to take a short cut and dump the waste into river. Doing this makes Springfield the most polluted city in America and the evil head of the Eniviromental Protection Agency (E.P.A), uses President Schwarzenegger, to seal Springfield behind a giant dome. When the citizens of Springfield find out that Homer was the reason why Springfield became too polluted and Homer and family have to escape the town, before saving it. There are two subplots, first Bart became more hostile to Homer, and ends up befriending Flanders, wishing that he was his father. The second is Lisa ends up falling for an Irish boy, Colin, who shares a lot of interest with her, including music and their passion for the environment.<br/><br/>There were jokes that were not very good and could easily be missed or ignored. But there were still so decent jokes, ranging from Maggie nearly fighting with Mr. Tweeny, to seeing Bart's penis (nothing like a minor bit of paedophilia (I am joking!)), to some of the verbal gags. But it still isn't great. One scene shows Homer pointing his middle fingers (flipping the bird as the Americans say), which I think never fits with the type of humour the Simpsons started out doing. The main problem with the film was that it tried to go for the widest possible audience, attempting to be too family friendly and trying to lure non-Simpsons fans, not being smart enough and relying on slapstick humour, i.e. Homer hurting himself. There was also be to much reliance on cameos, such as Green Day and Tom Hanks. However, the animation is very good, combining the traditional Simpsons style with a more cinematic style. I also like the politics satiring American politics, the media and the environment. It takes the mick out of America's attitude towards the environment, such as the negative reaction at the Green Day concert and $1000 being given to Aslakan people to destroy the natural beauty of the state (espeically where there is so little oil that it would cost more to drill out the oil then it would to make money out of it).<br/><br/>Overall, not the best, but not the worst."

No. Is it amazing? No.<br/><br/>I have for a few years now enjoyed the clever, satiric, parodic and slapstick humour of the Simpsons and it is of course one of my favourite television shows. For a fifth of a century the town of Springfield has been the centre of comedy where the Simpson family causes havoc (mostly through the ironically named Homer) and live their lives.<br/><br/>The possible story lines for the movie were endless. I heard that an obscene amount of drafts were rejected until the final one was approved.<br/><br/>After worrying pollution levels in Springfield, action is taken, however Homer (along with his spider pig) manage to re-contaminate the whole town with horrific consequences. The EPA (environmental protection agency) puts a glass dome over Springfield cutting it off from the rest of the world. All because of Homer. The film follows the adventures of the family trying to save their town and gain the trust of their people once more.<br/><br/>A funny, enjoyable journey of 90 minutes of cinema, but never exceptional or hilarious.

","Ever since their own television show in 1989 after a little program called ""The Tracey Ullman Show"" introduced our favorite family in one minute skits, they finally have a movie of their own where it's pure delight from minute one of Homer and the family watching Itchy and Scratchy before the paterfamilias tells the citizens of Springfield that they are better off waiting for the movie on cable than pay to see it at a movie theater. That's Homer right there, folks! ""The Simpsons Movie"" has every character you love from the sinister Mr. Burns and his ""sissy"" assistant Waylon Smithers, to the drunken Barney Gumble, the goody-goody Flanders, the funny Jewish clown Krusty the Klown and more where the premise of the first length feature of the popular show involves a chemical in the lake where after the mayor of Springfield hears Lisa out on helping the environment, they block the lake with barricades and a fake wall to keep the water clean. Does everybody listen? By now you would've figured that Homer wouldn't while enjoying his lovable pet pig he saved from being slaughtered as he ruins the lake with crap the pig made not before being contained by a crazed EPA (Environmental Protection Agency) member by the name of Russ Cargill (the funny Albert Brooks) where it's up to Homer and the Simpsons to save the day along with the citizens of Springfield.<br/><br/>This isn't the first feature length film from animation to be released to the big screen where back in 1999 we had South Park: Bigger, Longer and Uncut where just like the Comedy Central hit, it stayed true to its roots in being dirty and vulgar to make people laugh just like the show. The Simpsons Movie stays true to its reputation for being funny along with the fact that there's no stopping Homer or Bart's shenanigans.<br/><br/>The film is under 90 minutes where it's just fun."

For those of us that remember how good the series truly was, this bit of fluff involving Homer dooming the the town of Springfield due to his shenanigans, this film was not really made for us and will feel rather repetitive (IE: Homer and Marge fighting AGAIN, Lisa finding a crush AGAIN, even a few jokes are repeated from the series) but rather the newer fans who started watching it at the start of this millennium (yes i know, I shudder at that thought as well).<br/><br/>The fact that this film is currently in the top 100 when it has no business in even IMDb's top 250 is both sad and supremely mind-boggling.<br/><br/>But again if one is fed a steady diet of feces and then given a moldy stale pork rind, it'd likely taste like top cuisine."""
"Boba_Fett1138","7","1","2","25 February 2008"," Could had used some more Spider-Pig.
","This movie started off really well and promising and seemed like an extremely entertaining animated movie, focusing on the famous animated family the Simpsons, of which the first television series episode first aired in 1989 up till still this very day. However as the movie progressed more and more problems raised.<br/><br/>By saying the movie could had used some more Spider-Pig I don't literally mean that the movie should had featured some more of Spider-Pig (on second thought, well maybe that's also what I meant!) but more that the movie handles different plot-lines but none really gets featured or wrapped up properly. It was like the 11(!) writers of the movie each came up with a different plot-line and everything got thrown together on a pile in the end. The Homer and Bart farther son relationship, Homer and Marge's marriage crises, pollution, Lisa falling in love, it's all good but nothing gets really handled satisfying enough in the long run.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, its very main characters and silly main plot-line make sure that ""The Simpsons Movie"" at all times remains a perfectly watchable and entertaining movie with even a couple of moments of brilliance. Especially the character Homer never seizes to amazing and entertain to the max.<br/><br/>Also basically every other character from the Simpsons series makes an appearance in this movie, some featured obviously more prominently than others. This perhaps shall disappoint some of the fans of certain characters but good news is that this movie doesn't waste too much time on introducing any new and main characters. And why should they, when you already have Springfield filled with all kinds of colorful characters. The movie in its core is in fact about nothing else than the Simpsons family and that's also the way it should had been really.<br/><br/>Of course they obviously had more money to spend on this movie than on the television episodes. So this can be seen in some of the more detailed animations but overall the movie maintains fairly much the same style as the television series.<br/><br/>The humor of course also basically remains the same, although this movie goes a bit over-the-top at times in terms of how ridicules the humor gets at moments, as the story in general.<br/><br/>Fun, though flawed, entertainment.<br/><br/>7/10<br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"

I could have done without some of the language and the scene with Bart skateboarding naked through the streets. Marge's language, especially in the final scenes was not what I was expecting though and Homer and the big breasted Eskimo wasn't really needed. <br/><br/>I did like that most of the characters were true to their TV persona's. Homer messed everything up as usual and put the whole family in peril with just one action. Bart was up to no good most of the movie but had good scenes with Flanders. Lisa was great with her plight to save the lake. The opening sequence I expected to be more like the show and instead no couch scene at all!"

","Doesn't it suck how so many big event hyped-up movies are labelled with 'it could have been more' these days? But I guess that means when they get it right, its even more special.<br/><br/>The one-liners and pranks are fine all the way through. There's nothing cringe-worthy-in-a-bad-way here. You'll chuckle, but something needed to be done to separate this from, and make it much more than, just an extended TV show. This is possibly as hard as it sounds, but I'll tell you what they needed to do. They needed to make the premise much more significant. They main plot needed to be incredibly daring/wacky/outrageous and possibly irreparable. What they chose - government's big dome going over Springfield - was not that interesting and wasn't even milked to enough comic effect. Unlike other major crises on the TV show, this one has the opportunity to stretch out for two hours and reveal deeper and more complex internal conflicts inside the souls of Springfield - to comic effect of course. The other plot threads - Marge and Homer's marriage problems, Bart's Dad problem, Lisa's boyfriend - aren't that bad but you pretty much know how they're going to end up.<br/><br/>So what we have left is lots of good one-liners and pranks, and a feeling that it was all over so quickly. The makers really wanted this to be good. They seemed to have wanted it so badly that they were afraid to stick their big toe in too much. It's like a good TV episode, and a kind of missed opportunity."
"EUyeshima","8","1","2","27 January 2008"," How to Extend, Expand and Humanize a Too-Familiar Cartoon for the Big Screen
","Credited to no less than fifteen writers, this 2007 big-screen version of the still-running animated series (unbelievably in its 19th season) is fast, frenzied and funny. I haven't watched an episode of ""The Simpsons"" since the mid-1990's when I started to sense retread, but the movie directed by David Silverman reminds me how furiously clever the show can be with its unique mix of political incorrectness and pop-culture savvy. Moreover, at 87 minutes, or nearly four times the length of a regular episode, the plot never really flags, a startling accomplishment in itself. That's not to say the story doesn't sputter in spots from its own ambitious scope, especially in the last third, but the familiar characters seem revitalized by a plot that not only takes well-deserved potshots at organized religion and the EPA but reexamines the relationships within the nuclear family with surprising poignancy.<br/><br/>An elaborate ""Itchy & Scratchy"" space adventure starts the movie, and then the plot begins in earnest as Green Day performs on a barge disintegrating from all the toxic substances in Lake Springfield. Community apathy has turned the once-bucolic setting into a life-threatening cesspool, reason enough for Simpson daughter Lisa to reignite her social activism. At the same time, Homer continues to eschew fatherhood, this time in favor of a pig he has decided to adopt and serenade (""Spider-Pig"" is an instant classic). He decides to accumulate the pig's waste in a gigantic silo, the aromatic ingredients of which he dumps into the lake. This sets off a natural disaster so monumental that EPA head Russ Cargill (a doppelganger for Michael Brown) quarantines the entire town under a giant dome. The townspeople of Springfield become an angry mob out to lynch Homer, and the rest of the movie follows his circuitous journey toward community responsibility and environmental awareness.<br/><br/>Simpsons fans can rest assured that all five principal characters - Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie - are intact, and the voice actors have completely defined their characters with special mention going to Julie Kavner's frog-voiced drawl as Marge and Dan Castellaneta's buffoonery personified as Homer. Except for Ned Flanders, who becomes Bart's unctuously sensitive replacement father, most of the familiar supporting characters are relegated to cameos. Albert Brooks provides the voice of the Machiavellian Cargill, and Tom Hanks has a funny bit as his avuncular self. Although there are several amusing sequences, my favorite has to be the Disney-inspired foreplay scene between Homer and Marge out in the Alaskan wilderness. Most importantly, the writers successfully magnify and even exaggerate the human dimensions of these all-too-familiar characters in a way that feels fresh and textured.<br/><br/>The primary draw of the 2007 DVD are the two commentary tracks offered - the first with producer and series creator James L Brooks, Simpsons creator Matt Groening among others and the second a more technically oriented discussion with Silverman and several of the sequence directors. The first track is the one to experience since they stop the film for more specific discussion of key sequences, which extends the film's running time by fifteen minutes. Otherwise, there are less than ten minutes of deleted scenes and special features. Series fans won't be disappointed and the rest of us can enjoy the movie, too."

It is in no way reminiscent of the early days in which The Simpsons actually represented a certain indescribable something for which everyone was yearning.<br/><br/>HOWEVER, I don't think that anyone can argue the fact that almost every scene in The Simpsons Movie was funnier than any scene in the more recent episodes of The Simpsons television show.<br/><br/>The movie is definitely entertaining, and definitely much more enjoyable than watching 3 or 4 recent episodes of the show back to back.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie does capture something that the more recent episodes have failed to capture, but I wouldn't say that the movie is akin to the earlier episodes of the show.<br/><br/>All in all, The Simpsons Movie is well worth watching, and I think it deserves at least a B+.<br/><br/>Also, just as a side note, I think this movie is being judged much too harshly based on the longevity of The Simpsons television program - and the simple fact that The Simpsons IS a television program.

","Obviously the big fear with this film was that it wasn't going to be as good as the TV shows; and while I wouldn't say that this movie is The Simpsons at their very best, the movie does give many of the episodes a run for their money and it certainly is very funny overall. Another fear for this film was that it might not make the transition from small screen to big screen in a way that feels right; and while this is hard for the movie to get over since we're all so used to seeing them on the small screen, and I cant really say that it particularly 'feels' like a movie; I cant make that too much of a criticism since I enjoyed the movie on the whole. Given more of a running time, you would expect a plot that is 'bigger' than the average episode's plot and it is. There's the usual Simpsons trick of first featuring a seemingly irrelevant plot, but soon it becomes clear that the plot is focused on Lake Springfield, which gets cleaned up before Homer decides to dump a load of waste in there; leading the Government to take the drastic action of having Springfield encased in a giant dome, and having the locals take it out on the Simpson family...<br/><br/>As is often the case with the show, the jokes here are varied and so personally I wasn't laughing all the way through, though the movie does feature something for everyone, which is a plus. There's no real point in talking about the voices or the animation; all of which are just what everyone is used to. The film maybe does try to be a little too expansive; obviously the Simpsons creators wanted to go for a big blockbuster sort of feel, but personally I would have preferred a 'smaller' story such as the one featured in the classic dual episode 'Who Shot Mr Burns'. I can remember the moment I really decided I wanted to see this film; it was shortly after seeing the trailer, which featured the supremely silly 'Spiderpig' song as sung by Homer. This is a brilliant little gag, and definitely the funniest thing in the film for me. The film does try and bring all of the Simpson family into the plot; though as it often the case with the episodes, it's really Homer and Bart that are the main stars (being the most interesting characters) and that is OK with me. Overall, I wouldn't rank this as a big favourite were it an episode; but The Simpsons Movie certainly works well as a comedy and I'm glad the yellow-skinned family have finally reached the big screen."

","Imagine the setting: You are in the mid-90s, and as a young teenager you watch The Simpsons religiously every day. If you switch channels, you can three or even four episodes back-to-back every day of the week. You just watched the classic ""Who shot Mr. Burns"" and think it would be awesome if a movie could be made about America's most famous dysfunctional family. Unfortunately, the movie came about 10 years too late.<br/><br/>Let me be clear, if you are like some people I know and quit watching cartoons of any kind after watching The Simpsons in your teens, you will love this movie as it is very faithful to the TV show. If you expect a Simpsons episode stretched to 90 Minos and with a bigger budget for the animation, you will be well served because it is no more than that.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, some people like me kept watching cartoons since then and after the Simpsons came South Park, Family Guy, Futurama, ATHF and all the other weird Adult Swim shows. In the last decade, cartoons have been getting more absurd, more gory, more extreme and keep raising the bar higher while The Simpsons stay always the same. This is the reason why I didn't like the movie: What was a good cartoon in 1995 is mostly uninteresting in 2007 and there is not enough cartoon violence in The Simpsons to make it as timeless as the Looney Tunes.<br/><br/>I didn't like the new kinda-3D animation they gave to certain scenes, and the animation in general feels increasingly dated compared to the newer shows. This could be easily forgiven if the story was good, but unfortunately it is pretty boring. Plot twists can be seen miles away and the ""subtle"" political references as well. There was WAAAYY too much cheesy moments as well. Bart has somehow mutated from being the town's little hell-raiser to become an emo boy using Ned Flanders as a surrogate father! I remember yawning in the theater through all these boring corny ""family"" scenes waiting for the occasional joke. Where were all the funny minor characters! It seems like the creators of the movie didn't want to offend the fan base and created a perfectly unoriginal and sanitized 90-minute episode that doesn't need at all to be shown on the big screen. The movie simply doesn't push the Simpsons above the regular TV shows as South Park did with its movie. I now regret to have paid 10$ to watch this movie, what a disappointment. I should have stayed home and watch three shows back-to-back like in the good ol' times..."
"smellysocks12","7","1","2","6 September 2007"," More Simpsons!
","Simpsons the Movie could not have been named any better than this, because it is exactly like the Simpsons we all know and love from the legendary cartoon show on TV, only longer. While this is a great thing and will surely please fans of the series -as one should not tinker with a successful formula- longer is not always better. I am not saying that the movie is bad, not at all, as I enjoyed watching it very much. However, as it is a movie in the theater I somehow expected it to be at least slightly better than the TV-show, which it is not. There are some great jokes in this movie, brought to you with the typical wittiness and silliness we know from the TV-series, but the actual story-line could not really hold my attention throughout the movie's entire 90 minutes. The Simpsons has never been big on storyline, which is perfectly fine for a TV-episode, but here the attempt to create a storyline was not that successful. Nevertheless this is the Simpsons and if you expected it to have an Oscar-winning storyline you did not pay enough attention watching the show on television."

"colonel_green","9","1","2","4 September 2007"," The show that defined a generation comes to the big screen.
","The above phrase in the title of my review (""defined a generation"") is thrown around a lot about pieces of entertainment, but rarely is it so appropriate as it is in the case of ""The Simpsons"", the animated program that debuted in 1989, and is now approaching its 20th season on television, with over 400 episodes released. To today's ten-year-olds, the show has always been around, and is generally regarded as a charming piece of comfort-food; to people of my age, who were young when it first came out, we remember when parents believed that the show was Public Enemy Number One, and disallowed us from watching it (but that didn't stop us). Bart, once ""America's bad boy"", is now a cultural icon, and a fairly harmless one compared to the likes of Eric Cartman of ""South Park."" The controversy has long since worn off, and, after 13 seasons (in my estimation) of brilliance, the show is looking a bit tired these days, but it can still knock them out of the park occasionally.<br/><br/>And now they come to the big screen. This has been the dream of many a fan and screenwriter for many years, and it arrives a bit past the point where it might have been most anticipated; fortunately, this doesn't affect the quality, although it is important to moderate expectations when approaching it. ""The Simpsons"" is the greatest television program of all time, bar none; ""The Simpsons Movie"" is not one of the greatest films of all time, by any means, and it doesn't come close. In part, this is because the show has already dealt with so many of the things a movie might have done; as well, a movie simply cannot capture the diversity of story and humour that can be found in the over 400 episodes currently released. However, it is a very funny movie, well worth one's money.<br/><br/>The basic plot has been done many times before (Homer screws up, compromising his family and his town, and must grow up just enough to fix it), but it doesn't feel stretched out for film, and the animation is modified quite well for the big screen, seeming more epic while at the same time retaining the classic look of the show. And, despite the many times that Homer and Marge's marriage has foundered on the show, the big scene in this film where Marge believes (once again) that it's really over is truly excellent; it's a knockout bit of voice-acting from Julie Kavner."
"Hitchcoc","9","1","2","31 August 2007"," Now, Go Back and Watch the Show
","Because I came to the show late because of a son who has been quite passionate, I never had the luxury of seeing it with any sort of consistency. I'm sixty years old and yet I take something away from nearly every episode I see. I don't know the names of all the characters, but the social commentary and the outrageousness is all I need. I listened to an interview with, I believe Matt Groening (though it could have been someone else). This man was asked if there would be a last show where everything would get wrapped up, like the controversial Sopranos. He said that there has never been a consistent plot line. Each episode stands on its own and, if there is a last one, it will be an episode like all the rest, that takes shots at our human failings and has Homer eating too much. I thought this movie was a joy. It pulls no punches. It shows us at our selfish worst but who cares? Tomorrow is another day and it will all work itself out (or we may all be destroyed in a nuclear disaster--whatever). If this movie is your first experience with the Simpsons, go back and see the show. The movie is very good, but it just continues in an hour and a half, what each half-hour does each week."

"cultfilmfan","7","1","2","11 August 2007"," The Simpsons Movie
","The Simpsons Movie is a full length feature film based on the animated series that has become one of the longest running and most popular television shows of all time. For years the film's producers said they were going to make a movie and they finally did. Originally back in the early 90's they were going to make a movie that didn't end up happening and the idea for the movie later ended up being the Kamp Krusty episode of the series which also remains probably the episode with the shortest running time in the whole series. I have been pretty much a fan of the show from the beginning, although I do have to add that over the last few years the newer episodes with a new team of writers is just not nearly as good as the first several years of the show back in the 90's because those episodes were television gold. These new episodes seem to get more far fetched as they go along and being a fan of the absurd and weird, I usually wouldn't have a problem with that, but with the new episodes it gets to the point where it isn't clever or funny anymore and it is just ridiculous and growing out it's welcome quick. With that being said I found some things I did like about The Simpsons Movie and some things that I didn't like. It took me awhile to go into the film simply because I didn't find much or most of the film for that matter very funny at all and most of the jokes I felt just didn't deliver the punch line as it should have and after only a little while I was growing a bit restless of the film because I wasn't finding it funny, it was getting old and like the new episodes it was too unbelievable to the point of being just annoying. Also it seems over the years and with this film too that most of the humour comes from Homer Simpson doing things that are really stupid and these scenes seem to generate the most laughs. As pointed out in a special episode of the series, someone did point out that Homer seems to get dumber as the show goes on and I would have to agree and some of it just isn't funny anymore and it is getting a bit tired, old and just not as entertaining as it used to be. Those were my main complaints about the film. On the other hand, I did seem to warm up to the film in it's second half and I tended to just watch the film for what it was which is basically a long episode of the show and it's not meant for any real deep thought or purpose other than entertainment. So overall I did get into the film with it's second half and it did entertain me. However the film was still somewhat a disappointment and I wish it would have been as good as some of the original episodes from the 90's and I guess I was hoping it would be seeing as many of the original writers are back for the movie. So all in all the film was entertaining, but I was still somewhat disappointed and if there were a sequel to this movie I don't know how interested I would be in seeing it."
"steeped","8","1","2","9 August 2007"," Simpsons Movie > Family Guy Movie
","What a movie!!! It was outstanding! I laughed throughout the full thing! The movie was so good, it by far triumphed over the Family Guy Movie movie.<br/><br/>The plot begins when homer takes home a pig (named Spider-pig and later Harry Popper) and throws it's dumpings into the local Springfield lake (somehow) creating a toxic waste land. President Arnold Schwarzenegger gets persuaded to put a large dome over the now Toxic city to keep them isolated from the rest of the world.<br/><br/>I must say that the plot was the only downfall of this movie. The whole time when all the Springfielder's were stuck in the dome, no one even thought about getting a shovel and dig. No, instead they just decided to be sitting ducks and wait for their government to bomb the hell out of them. Of course instead of digging a hole they decided to climb through the whole in the top of the dome. Common! We all know Homer is extremely stupid but do the writers think that the audience also has a low IQ? But seriously, who goes to see the Simpsons for the plot? Sure it was bad but in the end, who cares?!?! After the brilliant slapstick humor, I got addicted to this movie. Saw it a few times already.<br/><br/>This movie was full of laughs and two memorable moments which I will never forget. It even had some crude humor which isn't allowed on TV. Sure I admire that I didn't hear the F-bomb at all (good job writers for keeping it PG rated. I wasn't too fond of all the swearing and black humor the Family Guy movie had) Homer did stick up his 2nd (middle) figure, Bart had a hilarious nude scene which totally shocked the whole audience and Marge said gods name in vain.<br/><br/>8/10"

He is a pig who is adopted by Homer in The Simpsons Movie. Plopper is first seen at Krusty Burger, dressed in a baker's hat, where he appears in an advert to promote Krusty's new ""Clogger"" Burger. After filming is completed, Krusty orders for the pig to become a sandwich and Homer immediately becomes upset about this, claiming that animals who wear human clothing can't be slaughtered. In a desperate bid for freedom, the pig runs up to Homer, who immediately adopts him. Later, while Marge is clearing pig tracks off the floor she ponders why they are also on the ceiling and Homer is seen making him walk on the ceiling singing ""The Spider-Pig song"". Eventually, Marge wonders where all of the pig's waste is going, and Homer shows her an overflowing silo marked ""Pig Crap"" and tells her that the pig, now renamed Harry Plopper and seen with glasses and a lighting bolt-shaped scar, and himself filled the entire silo within two days. Marge pleads with him to properly dispose of the silo, but Homer dumps it in Lake Springfield, leading to the toxic polluting of the lake and the events thereafter. When an angry mob ambushes and attacks the Simpsons, Ned attempts to help them escape by moving a plank from his window to theirs; Plopper ignores Homer's pleas not to touch the plank and pushes it with his snout, causing them to fall.

","Irresistibly hilarious! It's awesome how The Simpsons can still manage to make us seriously laugh after all these years, in its trademark brand of wit and self-deprecating humor. <br/><br/>Despite having already seen some funny vignettes in the trailers, they are still funny when seen again in the movie (in 2-D! as Moe proudly says), and it's a big relief that there's actually more of those in the full-length movie. Another brilliant thing about The Simpsons: each character, no matter how small a role, is memorable and likable. <br/><br/>The lead characters, especially, manage to make you care about them no matter how radically different their personalities are: Homer, the dimwitted husband to Marge, the ever-forgiving and perfect wife and mother to Bart, the wise-ass troublemaker; Lisa, the idealistic wunderchild; and the quietly intriguing baby Maggie. Then of course the slew of other characters that would be impossible not to name (as they had in the trailer): Flanders, Santa's Little Helper, Otto, Apu, Mr. Burns and Smithers...<br/><br/>Stay till the end to hear Maggie say her first word!"

However this movie is very enjoyable if your a Simpson's fan. It is fairly short so I do not recommend spending ten dollars on snacks but overall with homer and Bart having the dare challenge at the beginning and is fairly funny all the way through I recommend checking this movie out.

","I must say I'm disappointed with this movie. First of all it was just 77 minutes long, minus the credits. Second of all there were very few jokes and probably just one or two of them made me laugh. It seemed like the writers of this movie tried to make it among the main audience and didn't care about the hardcore Simpsons fans.<br/><br/>I was expecting a lot of hidden jokes just for us hardcore fans but I couldn't find them. There were just old Homer-makes-a-dumb-mistake jokes. I would like to see more parodies of movies. And I don't mean new movies but old ones, let's say from 70's to 90's. There were some, like the Titanic parody in the beginning, but very few.<br/><br/>I'm also disappointed that the smaller characters didn't get that much space in the movie. I would really like more Moe, Krusty, Willy, Apu and Wiggum. Since this movie was so short I guess they didn't have time. But that could have been solved by, let's say, making this movie 30 minutes longer? I read a interview with Matt Groening a couple of days before the premiere of the movie which made me really optimistic about the movie. He said that there were so many jokes they wanted in the movie but they only chose the best ones. But I guess they only had decent jokes.<br/><br/>Even though it was a disappointment still this was a touching movie and it had humour. But unlike the Simpsons episodes I guess you can just watch this one time and then it's enough."
"Robert_duder","9","2","7","11 August 2007"," Absolutely fantastic!! This is why this is STILL one of the greatest sitcoms and animated shows in history and now big screen!!
","I don't really know what I expected from The Simpson's Movie. Certainly I hoped that everyone who has worked on this incredible show would pull out all the stops and put everything they were into bringing this historical and important family to the big screen. I grew up with the Simpsons when it was just cool to be bad like Bart Simpson and now I can watch the show and laugh at all the subtle hidden politically incorrect jabs and famous little parodies that were way over my head as a kid. Could they possibly make this all seem fresh and hilariously funny and give it everything that this film deserved with well over 17 years in the making? Never, ever, underestimate The Simpson family. Many reviewers and critics have stated that the film is nothing more than an extended episode but a really good episode at that and in some ways they are right but I was pleasantly surprised to see that it did push the boundaries and add something different then if I were sitting at home watching them. There was something frightfully polished and perfected about the film. It seemed like it was on such a grandiose scale and that they had been putting away all this A+++ material for just this occasion because after the first half of the film my sides hurt from laughing so hard whether it was the typical Simpson's one liners, the very subtle stab at society or the downright hilarious sight gags and outright funny little puns and jokes...this captured every second of it. And they did a little pushing the envelope...certainly nothing like South Park did but then South Park isn't even the little baby sidekick to The Simpsons. The three major envelope pushing moments (in my opinion) were all so well placed and were all hilarious and I'll cover them in just a moment.<br/><br/>I'm not even going to talk about the cast because they are all...each and every one of them legendary. This cast has been together probably longer than any other cast in TV history and they ARE their characters and no one else could touch them. I really hope that they get every penny they deserve for their years of tireless effort and now to throw out this truly terrific film to justify everything they have done. Trying to rate this cast would be like judging a person on their own voice...it's just perfect in every way.<br/><br/>So moving onto those envelope pushing moments....yes The Simpson's movie contains nudity...and child nudity at that. During a hilarious scene where Homer dares Bart to skateboard naked through downtown we are treated to hilarious attempts at covering his 'doodle' as he refers to it and then suddenly, almost too quickly too notice...there it is...plainly drawn on Bart's little body. And then before you can recover from the shock...Ned Flanders is saying 'Penis' in front of Rod and Todd. Shoot to second moments with Homer jumping down a sink hole to escape the angry mob wanting to kill him. In he jumps and down he sinks as he flips the bird on both of his hands and then stops sinking plugging the sink hole. He then quickly uses his middle fingers to start digging himself deeper into the whole. And finally pure and innocent Marge. The bomb is ticking away and Homer and Bart have seconds to throw it through the tiny hole in the dome. Marge yells ""Oh would you hurry up and throw the God D$%N Bomb"" in that lovable motherly voice and it's like hearing your own saintly mother swear and it's just downright funny. Add into that the dumbest you have ever seen Homer Simpson...the stupidest mistakes he could possibly do and nothing in the movie is stereotypical, run of the mill or ordinary.<br/><br/>Creator and head of The Simpsons Matt Groening didn't fly out looking for some off the wall director to helm this up...instead he looks right at home because that's what this was truly about I think. Keeping it real, and keeping it SIMPSONS. Director David Silverman who has been directing The Simpsons, various episodes, as well as years of animation throughout TV-Land takes the project and does just a terrific job. The laughs are literally non stop. Could this possibly be The Simpsons swan song? I mean once you've climaxed after 17 years with this level of brilliance I'm not sure you could ever recreate the magic but then as I said...never underestimate The Simpsons or anyone on their team.<br/><br/>There are a few remarkable things about the film. First of all, yes everyone is present. I can't really think of anyone that wasn't there but it was for a very brief period of time. The Simpsons film is truly about The Simpsons, especially Homer. The town of Springfield has always been as important to the story as The Simpsons but this film simply uses everyone as a stepping stone to their story and it works but I kind of missed everyone and seeing more of them. Secondly there is truly the most unique scene in Simpsons history as Marge finally reaches her limit with Homer and what he's done. You will never hear a more serious or important tone from Marge, it literally sounds different than anything we've ever heard from Julie Kavner as Marge and it really is quite touching. Hands down one of the summer greats in an incredible summer of movies. Fans of Simpsons hail because this not only does it justice but knocks it out of the park. 9/10"

This time, he pollutes the town's water supply with a silo of ""Pig Crap"", which leads the EPA with the option by President Schwarzenegger (which was a laugh riot) to encase the town with a gigantic dome. Once again, Homer and his family must stop the EPA from destroying Springfield before it is too late.<br/><br/>Homer is a true Homer in this supported with his sight gags, one-liners, and obvious, laughable stupidity.

The hour and a half film flew by with no slow spots.<br/><br/>But to a disappointment, the movie only focused on a few of ""The Simpsons"" characters, mainly on Homer and his family. It did have all the characters, yes, but they didn't have a lot of screen time. I was really looking forward to more of Mr. Burns, Smithers, Apu, etc. as well as more of their comic genius.

","18 years in the making. The phrase featured in the trailer loses a great deal of momentum when seeing the finished product, that being The Simpsons Movie. It's difficult to describe why you are let down but it happens all the same. Maybe, it is simply this: A TV show that has been on for more than half of my life and has brought gut wrenching hilarity in more than 90 % of the episodes, it is extremely difficult to top what has gone before, even in a big screen format.<br/><br/>One thing you can improve upon is the visuals and here the SM does not disappoint. The backgrounds are spectacular and the character designs are as good as it gets. Some of the episodes of the TV-series featured freak character designs that gave you an unsettled stomach. Not so here. Also, the character traits are all carried over without many makeovers. Homer is as thickheaded as ever but you of course know that he is basically a decent Joe who will do right at the end. Marge has a scene that is a bit heartbreaking but is pretty much the same as well. The writing is top-notch as usual with as many puns, one liners and visual gags as a good, sillier Simpsons episode.<br/><br/>One problem is cramming all the supporting characters in Springfield into the movie's brief running time which reduces most of them to mere walk-ons or left out all together (No Duffman or Sideshow Bob - barely any Apu or Chief Wiggum and only a 1 minute cameo by Mr Burns).<br/><br/>And why do you ask. To make room for a super-villain in the form of what else? A government official voiced by A Brooks, who can be very annoying when given free range but even more sad, he is pretty much devoid of any humor here.<br/><br/>Tom Hanks as himself? Why not? The celebrity roster has pretty much run out. The only top celebrities who haven't done the show yet are to my recollection, Jack Nicholson (strange because he has been in three of James L. Brooks' movies), Tom Cruise (a big kahuna the producers have never been able to land) and Robert De Niro who to my knowledge has never even been approached, not even for a gangster character.<br/><br/>What it all adds up to is a satisfying extended version of an episode and a feast for the eyes but to add more kudos would be giving more credit than what is due."

"JG_MovieCritic","9","2","7","31 July 2007"," Review from a disturbingly loyal fan
","Well Ladies and Gentlemen the moment you've been waiting for The Simpsons Movie! This is most important movie of the year, and probably the best. Those more devoted fans of the series, such as myself, have seen it take a turn for the worst starting around series 10 or 12. The movie doesn't quite match up to the standards of the first 200 or so episodes but does go some way to redeem the more recent and shoddy ones.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is truly an epic and mocks issues of great variety and sensitivity. In fact the movies' plot line wouldn't exist if the ideas of environmentalism, political incompetence and sanctified family relationships (namely those of Homer & Marge and Homer & Bart) were not mercilessly taunted. The Simpsons even takes on religion in the forms of Homer's Epiphany, the Church member's faith (or lack thereof) and Marge's conviction that Grandpa is predicting the Apocalypse (in a trance he uses words not dissimilar to that wacky Revelation ending from the Bible).<br/><br/>Most of your favourite characters will get a line, but in most cases that's all they get. I was disappointed to find that my personal favourite, Robert Underdunk Terwilliger (Side Show Bob) was without a plot line or even an appearance. There are few celebrities considering the magnitude of the film. Tom Hanks shows up, as do Green Day and you would think they could do better for the big screen. Governor Arnie is now President Arnold Schwarzenegger although the voice is done by Harry Shearer (the voice of Rainier Wolfcastle or McBain).<br/><br/>The original plot for the movie was going to be that of Kamp Krusty from season 4, which I think would have made a much better movie. The writers of the Simpsons have shot themselves in the foot by making such a great TV show and have had trouble living up to it on the big screen. I would advise any Simpsons fans, and there are a lot of you, to go and see this ASAP. Had this movie come out before the series it would have been an instant classic, it is however, dwarfed by the expectations of many wide eyed fans. I give The Simpsons Movie 9 (Annoyed Grunt)s out of 10."

","After many many years of waiting one of the worlds oldest animated families finally comes to the big screen. After an incredible number of episodes on the little screen it is hard to come with something good enough to feed a movie theaters audience for the length of a full size film, but, it can be said, this one does the trick.<br/><br/>It all starts as Homer gets a pet pig and collects the pigs feces in a silo that he then flushes on a small lake. This small lake had been the victim of lots of pollution already and the silo is the proverbial drop that spills the bucket. And when the bucket spills it is time for drastic measures.<br/><br/>As the story starts there is plenty of room for the little jokes we have learned to expect from The Simpsons series and there is more than enough room for the continuation of a story line that makes this film into a combination of two or three episodes of the series. It doesn't get better than a combination of episodes but I don't think that could even be expected from a series running as long as this one.<br/><br/>There are a some small cameos by actors and other celebrities and all in all it is very true to the series and very enjoyable.<br/><br/>One small hint: take the time to sit through the ending credits.<br/><br/>9 out of 10 french fries covering up things"
"DarthVoorhees","9","2","7","30 July 2007"," It actually works
","To me The Simpsons died with Phil Hartman and Troy McClure and have jumped the shark seven times since the year 2000. However the 90's episodes were beyond brilliance. I own all the seasons of the DVD and I still laugh at them. Even though I am very annoyed by the current quality of the show I couldn't pass up an opportunity to see Homer on the big screen. I walked in expecting to be disappointed but to have a few laughs and I walked out pleasantly surprised and I laughed a lot.<br/><br/>The plot is actually quite clever. Homer dooms Springfield by dumping a silo of crap from his beloved pig in the town's polluted lake. Russ Cargill, the head of the Enviormental Protection Agency states that Springfield must be cut off from the rest of the world because of it's high pollution and puts the city in a giant dome. Homer and his family escape the dome just before a lynch mob kills them. Homer takes the opportunity to take his family to his dream home,Alaska. The Simpsons seem to get used to their new life until a video starring Tom Hanks tells them that Springfield will be destroyed to create a new Grand Canyon(Apparently the old one wasn't generating tourism) Marge takes the kids back to save Springfield while Homer goes on a mystical journey with a Eskimo whose cleavage doesn't leave much to the imagination. Just as Cargill moves in to destroy the city, Homer comes back to save the day.<br/><br/>I really was surprised by how clever the jokes were. Recently the age of The Simpsons writers has shown by their lack of being able to market to The Simpsons age group. The pop culture references on the show now are stale at best. Recently the show has been relying on stereotypes for humor. The movie reminded of the reason I loved the show in the first place, Homer. This is Homer's movie and rightfully so, he got the most laughs in the theater. Dan Castellaneta's performance is down right genius, he is able to salvage some of the weaker material and deliver it in a way that makes it funny.<br/><br/>My one really disappointment with the movie is that A.Brooks doesn' reprise his role as Hank Scorpio. Scorpio fits Cargill's character traits perfectly and he is the most beloved guest star character after Sideshow Bob(Who also isn't in the movie. That was another huge let down!) The animation is great as well, Don't count 2-D out yet."

","""The Simpsons Movie"" / Released: July 27, 2007 / Viewed: July 26, 2007<br/><br/>*** Good<br/><br/>I don't really consider myself a fan of The Simpsons, though I have seen the first season episodes on DVD. As this film shows, it's the writing that has made the film such a long running success. A total of 11 writers, including creator Matt Groening, contributed to the film. That's a very large number of writers for a film made in Hollywood, the most I've ever known. I'm guessing the idea was to try make the film have a broad appeal to as many Simpsons fans as possible. Now in it's 18th season, it's the longest running sitcom ever in the U.S. I viewed the film with my sister, who's a fan from when the show first began in 1990. She especially liked the opening and was overall pleased with the film.<br/><br/>Though I'm hardly an expert on ""The Simpsons"", this film wasn't much different than a typical TV episode of the show. Yes, there is a bigger, more dramatic story here and most of the many characters who have ever appeared on the TV show appear here. There are two firsts that occur, making the film a little unique from the TV show. Faithful to the TV show, the animation is hand drawn, except for a few CGI sequences.<br/><br/>The first 15 minutes of the film is impressive with its fast moving slapstick and parody. The film was made in a loose style that is characteristic of the TV show in it's early years. There is parody going on all throughout the film. At the beginning, Homer says: ""I can't believe people would actually pay to see this as a movie when it can be watched for free on TV"".<br/><br/>The plan, as announced one year ago, is that there would be one more final season after release of the first film. There has been nothing to contradict this as of yet.<br/><br/>The audience I was with was mostly adults, the typical Simpsons audience. Many of it's fans have watched it for 15+ years beginning as children or young adults. I saw the film on a preview screening, one day before it's official nationwide release. I guess that most of the audience were long time Simpsons fans. Most of the audience appeared to enjoy the film all the way through, from beginning to end. There are probably some who will feel a little disappointed as their favorite character did not appear or appeared for too short a time. However it would have weakened the film to try to appeal to all Simpsons fans. Here the aim was to appeal to casual and die hard fans, as much as possible. ""The Simpsons Movie"" succeeds in it's goals."
"diac228","8","2","7","29 July 2007"," Nudge this surprisingly good movie somewhere between the 90s Simpsons masterpieces and the episodes of this decade
","10 years ago, it would have been safe to say that The Simpsons was the greatest American cartoon in the history of television. For several years, we witnessed instant classic after instant classic back when the 90s ruled. However, as the series continued, the quality declined a bit, leading to mere overexposure of the franchise and a constant yearning of a return to the old days. It constantly gets promised that The Simpsons will return to the glory days and prove the die-hard fans wrong but every year despite the occasional success lies disappointment and letdowns. However, with that being said, The Simpsons remains one of the best cartoons of all-time, and a movie was inevitable. But, with some of the creative staff of the past decade gone and ideas running out (400 episodes does indeed eventually create writer's block) can the movie even come close to what it used to be? Can we get a movie that will install catch phrases, controversy, and conversation sparkers all at the same time? Will The Simpsons Movie be able to stand on par with ""Homer at the Bat,"" ""Marge vs. the Monorail,"" ""Who Shot Mr. Burns,"" and ""Itchy and Scratchy and Poochie?"" Believe it or not, the answer is almost yes. <br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is high and mightily above the modern-day episodes of the cult hit television show, yet barely ranks below the episodes of the 90s. Nonetheless, it is an entertaining flick that will not only please the die-hard fans, but will potentially bring in some new ones. The concepts in the movie we have seen before, but it doesn't matter because in here we have an interesting plot, plenty of one-liners, less emphasis on gags, obscure visual humor, good running time, and even a bit of heart. What is lacking in the adult cartoons of today (Family Guy, Simpsons, South Park, all the Comedy Central garbage) is the hint of sentimentality, which was one of the reasons why the Simpsons moments of the past were so wonderful. This wasn't just a throwaway popcorn flick; there was a good dosage of content that explores why Homer Simpson is such a bad father and why Marge can put up with it. Despite it missing the rich, extremely clever humor and commentary of the 90s Simpsons, The Simpsons Movie is a step in the right direction for the franchise.<br/><br/>The plot of the Simpsons Movie is a medley of past plots intertwining with a new one; Springfield is being isolated from the rest of the country because it has become so polluted, which turns out to be the fault of Homer Simpson. After they escape the Springfield dome, Homer is given another chance to show the family that he isn't a deadbeat loser. But as time drags, it's become apparent that Homer is not a good leader, a good father, or a good husband, even if the intentions are there. Can Homer Simpson prove his worth or will he be doomed to be separated from the rest of his family, the only people that understand him. The social, political, and/or cultural commentary isn't there, neither is most of the satire, but instead we have a plot-driven Simpsons episodesomething that usually doesn't happen. This concept is almost foreign to Simpsons fans but it works because we have plenty of jokes to move the story along.<br/><br/>While the usage of characters may trigger differing opinions, it gets the job done. The Simpsons Movie is indeed about the main family, but almost every other character throughout the years of the show have their moment to shine and make a memorable moment. There is a lack of exposure to the Springfield fiends Mr. Burns and Sideshow Bob, and there isn't enough Duffman (Then again, is there ever?) but this is made up by enough running time of every other minor character, and very little emphasis on guest stars (Counted only one band and one celebrity). The voice acting like usual is top-notch, but we need to congratulate Julie Kavner for her portrayal of Marge Simpson, who in this movie reveals her broken and vulnerable side, resulting in the saddest moment in the film.<br/><br/>Some can claim this is nothing more than a cash cow, but The Simpsons Movie is more like a celebration of all the great years in Springfield, (*insert state*). If you are fast enough, not only can you find the hidden jokes mentioned earlier, but references to past Simpsons episodes (Look for the broken-down ambulance). This extended episode doesn't take many jabs at pop culture or competing cartoons like it used to, but it's the one-liners and excellent visual gags that make up for it. Also listen for a surprisingly good musical score by Hans Zimmer. While this is more like an extended episode of the television show (Kind of like The Spongebob Squarepants Movie years ago) it is a darn good episode to watch, and worth the money.<br/><br/>Bottom Line: The Simpsons Movie is an extended episode that surpasses that of recent seasons and just misses the mark when compared to the classics. Instead of a multitude of plots combining together with satire, wit, and commentary like in the 90s, we get a straightforward plot full of gags that hit the mark and one-liners that will most likely be repeated multiple times for months to come. Everything that's made the Simpsons one of the most successful shows ever is present here. You will be left thirsty for more time, especially so we can see more of Springfield and its crazy inhabitants, but that does not make this movie disappointing in the least bit. Unlike the latest couple of seasons, The Simpsons Movie will not let you down. Grab some Buzz Cola and some Krusty Os, and enjoy another chapter in the long-running success of the cartoon that changed the animation world forever."
"kwarau","10","2","7","29 July 2007"," The Simpsons As a Show is Better
","I am The Simpsons fan since 2002. Ever since i watched the first preview of Simpsons Movie with that Supderman logo, i have been dying to see the movie. Finally on Saturday, i went to see it, and here is what i think of it. <br/><br/>You all know the movie PLOT by now so i won't go into detail with it. The Simpsons movie is well funny, storyline is good and almost every character is seen in the movie (some might not have any dialouge) I have to say i was Let Down by this movie, it just didn't meet my expectations. First of all, the movie was way too short, i don't know why. Due to its short length, many characters are cut-off, and some don't even have screen time they deserve. The movie itself seems to be fast-paced due to lack of time. New character were useless because not enough character development was there. It would have been better to represent classic existing Simpsons characters with more refined role to play, than introducing new love of Lisa.<br/><br/>Another thing is that as the film makers mentioned how hard they had to work to get the right story for Simpsons Movie, i don't think this movie does justice to the story. To me, the movie was more focused on the jokes than keeping the plot going. Also the theme was good, but the lack of time prevented a good point between Bart and Flanders to be discovered by homer deeply. Everything seems to be happeninig so quickly, like Simpson family moving to Alaska, then going back to Springfield, the overall journey went by just with a blink of an eye. <br/><br/>Also less screen time was given to famous landmarks of Springfield such as Moe's Tavern, Nuclear Power Plant. The filmmakers spoiled some BIG jokes that the movie had to offer by showing them in the Simpsons Movie promos, like Bart naked skateboarding scene, Spider-pig. <br/><br/>What has been deleted from the final versing of MOVIE?<br/><br/>Also to keep the movie PG-13, the makers of this movie took some scenes and dialogs out from the final movie which they originally showed at the Comic-Con such as when the mob comes to look for homer, Lenny asked Moe ""so who are we going to kill again"" and Moe replies ""I think people in the front knows"" and another scene when mob climbs through ladder in Lisa's room and Homer Hits Lamp,camera, and toilet paper has been cut from the movie which i think was disappointing because it was one of the hilarious scenes in the movie. Another good scene that has been changed is that when Homer goes to dump the Pig-Crap into river, the warning boards were hilarious that were shown at comic con, but in the movie the wording has been changed due to its rating that the movie makers wanted to have. You can see those scene in you-tube when u searched for Simpson movie scene. <br/><br/>Anywaz, back to movie, the animation are good, especially the background is well done and can say is computer animation, the characters are hand drawn, but has been colored by computer so its worth watch in big screen. <br/><br/>After seeing the movie, i truly believe that The Simpsons as a show is much better, after all a show is a show and this is where it all started. If makers of The Simpsons were to do a poll for whether to make a sequel to Simpsons Movie or another new Season, i would prefer a new season because there are thingy that make this show and it can't be done on movies. <br/><br/>Despite the disappointment, i still give this movie 10/10 and can watch it again-again n again, the movie is sure a Must-Go to watch in Theaters, cuz u never know when u will see Homer again on BIG screen."
"silversprings-1","9","2","7","29 July 2007"," My kids forced me to bring them to this...I laughed harder than they did!
","My kids have been wanting to see this since it was first announced, considering they have both watched virtually every episode of the Simpsons ever made. I've watched a lot of them too, but I can't say I'm a huge fan. I do like Groening's irreverent sense of humor though. There was a showing of the movie at 2:30 yesterday at our local theater and I was hoping there would be a showing of Die Harder near the same time; there wasn't, so I went with them to this one. I was planning to take a nap, but I didn't have a chance...when Homer turned to look at the audience and said, ""Who would be dumb enough to pay for a cartoon you can see at home for free?"" I had a feeling we were in for a fun ride. Matt and company are at their prime in this, and surprisingly didn't rely on dozens of celebrity cameos for cheap laughs either (and I'm sure he could have gotten half of Hollywood to participate if asked too!) This is the funniest laugh-out-loud comedy I've seen on the big screen in years. And I loved the little ""inside"" jokes that my kids didn't even get...like the head of the EPA being named ""Cargill"" (one of the country's biggest corporate polluters..fined several times for polluting air and waterways.) This is a great movie and we WILL buy the DVD when it comes out."
"jp71ph","9","2","7","29 July 2007"," The Simpsons Movie succeeds in its long-awaited adventure on the big screen!
","Ten years ago, this movie could have been the dubbed as the Ultimate Simpsons adventure. Now, it seems a little subdued and dated but nevertheless, it still delivers its promised return to the glory days of the Simpsons.<br/><br/>Don't worry guys! The movie is as funny as ever and of course, topnotch entertainment. It is I guess, as funny as the best Simpsons episodes. The writers of the show/movie have chosen to go with the classic approach of delivering the Simpson's movie, utilizing the tried and tested formulas on the TV show. This may seem to be a hindrance of making the movie great, but it succeeds for the simple reason that it works! You get the feeling that a lot of things and situations in the movie are familiar and yet, the movie never feels tired or boring. That's a testament of how the Simpsons has become in itself a unique way of delivering wit, humor, social criticism, sarcasm, awareness and more, all rolled up into one TV program (and in this case, a movie.) Overall, the first Simpsons foray into the big screen is a terrific debut; long-time fans won't be disappointed and for the generation just experiencing the Simpsons for the first time, the movie offers a wonderful perspective on what made the Simpsons the best sitcom (so far!) we have had on TV ever. It's not meant to ""WOW"" us into seeing something strictly new and revolutionary with the Simpsons, rather, it offers a tribute/perspective to the 20 years (so far!) the Simpsons has been making us laugh and forget the troubles of our overly complicated lives."
"tnrcooper","10","2","7","28 July 2007"," Worth the wait.....
","Like the Hippocratic Oath which says doctors should ""first do no harm"", I was just concerned that ""The Simpsons Movie"" not de-value the legendary Simpsons brand. It not only didn't hurt the brand, it was worth the wait. As, sadly, a grown-up who was 14 when the show started, it boggled my mind seeing Homer 15 feet tall (or whatever it is) on the big-screen. I haven't been excited about an ""event"" movie for some time but as a long time Simpsons fan, I've been excited about this for six or seven months or whenever I knew it would be here this summer. The first half hour was riotous. Lots of hysterical, sharp, witty one-liners. It was cool seeing a bit of profanity, some humor which would not be cleared for the 1/2 hour every Sunday. I really don't want to post a detailed summary of what I saw and enjoyed, suffice it to say that I think the writers captured the rhythm of humor which is necessitated by a plot which has been extended from a half-hour base. The humor satisfied everyone. The kids loved the broad, physical, visual humor while of course the additional levels of humor which make the Simpsons such a widely respected institution on television, along with the pratfalls and the visual comedy, kept the older teens and adults laughing. I think finding fault with this movie is really an exercise in pettiness. I don't know how such a legendary program could have been better adapted for the big-screen."
"ksmred2","8","2","7","28 July 2007"," The Simpsons Movie is SPECTACULAR!
","Here we are in year 2007 after 18 years (first episode shown December 17, 1989) and 400 episodes of running, of what may be the biggest pop culture icon of all time. Obviously, I am referring to our favourite dysfunctional family, The Simpsons. I am...(read more) sure you heard about them, If not you must be an alien as in foreigner or ""Kang"" (wink wink). Each week (now everyday), they have delighted us with their ""D'oh!"" and ""Whoo-hoo!"" You know their names; you know their colour(s); and some of you are obsessed with the Simpsons as I am (posters, figures, DVDs, tapes,shirts etc). Having seen every single episode of The Simpsons myself, words could not describe how psyched I was. I know the quality of the recent Simpsons has been down-right disappointing/awful, with their ""Family Guy"" appearance alike. However the movie took 18 years to make (actually 14-15 years, they were going to make the Kamp Krusty episode into a movie); so I had my faith in them turning in The Simpsons into a movie that lives up the hype. And all I can say now is Believe the Hype, because this is actually a good movie that does not let you down. With simple story well told, and colourful designs of the Simpsons universe, and the comedy of...well only The Simpsons can do, it is a throwback to the glory years of The Simpsons. If the movie counts as an episode, this is already in my top 5 or No. 1 despite my love for season 2 through 9. First, the movie is hilarious. This is the funniest comedy movie of 2007 ""so far"" (as Homer would say). Everyone in my theater laughed out loud at the right moment and seemed to enjoy the hell out of it. And I also dug the references to the classic episodes they made. It was very thoughtful. Second, this movie not only depends on the comedy but also emotions. The Simpsons we LOVED fought each others but at the end of the day they learn their lesson and hug it out. That's the Simpsons we always knew and loved. Sure, they are DYSFUNCTIONAL but what makes them emotional in the show or the movie is that they are FAMILY. Who cares if they are dysfunctional? Aren't we all in some way? There was one particular scene in the movie I admit I almost cried (I won't give it away) because although the Simpson family is non-existent they CAN be REAL. I know they are cartoons and I have no mental issues but sometimes you feel human in them and can relate with them. And lastly, I loved the fact that they used advantages of PG 13 (you will know what I mean when you see it) but also not going over at it like the South Park movie did (I love the movie though) because if there was languages they used like f word it just wouldn't be THE Simpsons.<br/><br/>I will bet even non-Simpsons fan can enjoy this. Why? Because it's entertaining and isn't that all you want at the movies? For me though, it was more than an entertainment it was like seeing my old friends again. It's a little cartoon show that made some contributions on me like learning English off them or making me happy when I am not. There's something about The Simpsons that makes them different, and when I finished watching the movie it helped me realize for once and for all the reason why I love the family so much.<br/><br/>9 OUT OF 10 FOR SIMPSONS FANS 8 OUT OF 10 FOR ANYONE ELSE"
"dfranzen70","8","2","7","28 July 2007"," Simpsons movie slouches and delivers
","When a TV show finally hits the big screen, what should the movie have that the show didn't? Obviously, stuff you can't get past the censors on television; jokes that are even more adult in nature, drug use, nudity, even some profanity - as long as the basic characterizations and tone of your program aren't mucked with. Right? I mean, what's the point, otherwise? And that's exactly what the cleverly titled The Simpsons Movie manages to do, shoehorning pithy comments and witty repartee into a relatively brief (87 minutes) cinematic explosion, a supernova of one of comedy's brightest stars.<br/><br/>Now, often full-length feature versions of a TV show will simply be a long episode, or a couple of episodes strung together semicohesively. And semicoherently. But Matt Groening and James L. Brooks takes a plausible-for-the-Simpsons storyline and ratchets up... well, everything. There's more visual and verbal humor, more characters (though not new ones, really), more exciting locales - not just Springfield - and tons of in-jokes, most of which the intended audience is going to fawn over like Bambi's momma. (Speaking of which, there's an amusing scene in which Adorable Woodland Creatures help get Homer and Marge ready for their coital bed.) The basic plot line is that after a lot of nagging by one Lisa Simpson, the horribly polluted Lake Springfield - where people dump crap, dead bodies, and toxic waste - has finally been cleaned up. Mayor Quimby is especially proud of their new deterrent system to prevent people from dumping - it's a wall. But wouldn't you know it, it's only so idiotproof, and Homer winds up throwing an entire silo of pig poop (don't ask) into the lake, immediately killing it and causing some mutant creatures to develop. The EPA, noting this, decides that the entire area must be sealed off, so they put a huge glass dome around Springfield. No one can get in, and most importantly no one - especially toxic waste - can get out. No wonder that in short time the rest of the Springfield citizenry rise up and form an angry mob out to get the Simpsons.<br/><br/>As I said, there's nudity - but, sadly, it's not anyone you'd want to see naked. No, not even Patty or Selma. And, believe it or not, there's death! Of course, it's not like any of the Simpsons themselves die, or even a secondary character. But hey, there are literally scores of characters in the Simpsons universe, so it's okay if one of them bites it, right? And double hey, it's not as if the movie is part of any grand continuity - if someone gets hurt in the movie, I'm betting they'll be peachy keen next time you see them in the TV show.<br/><br/>To be sure, even though there's some envelope pushing and such, the characters remain who they are - Homer is a complete screwup who somehow manages to both destroy and save everyone at least once; Bart is a selfish brat who picks on his sister and is susceptible to dares; Lisa is a dreamy brain who pines for a new boy; and Marge is the proverbial glue that usually holds them somewhat together.<br/><br/>The movie's not very long, which might be its only real debit. It's wildly amusing, and the movie makes the best use out of its short running time, being chock full o' jokes and references that only Comic Book Guys in their mom's basement will get. Thankfully, there are very few celebrity voices - one Name does the voice of the chief bad guy, with the EPA, and another plays himself. (I'm not even including the brief appearance by Green Day, though.) I like that - it'd be too easy for the Bigwigs to shovel in celebrity after celebrity, as has happened in many a Simpsons episode over the years.<br/><br/>Our favorite yellow family survives its first foray onto the silver screen - the movie is so well done, it feels like an episode from the middle years of the series without seeming like a simple extension of the show. It's hysterical, appropriately raunchy, and just absurd enough to be the ne plus ultra of animated movies. Well, at least those that are animated in a traditional (i.e., not wholly computerized) style. So pass the donuts and gulp down your Duff brew!"
"alexptalex","10","2","7","28 July 2007"," A hilarious and fantastic adventure, for fans, casual viewers, and the whole family
","When I first heard they were making a Simpsons Movie, I was over the moon with joy. Being the huge fan that I am, I spent then next several months with both eyes peeled looking for trailers, posters, and bits of information regarding the movie. I even got a part time job at a theater so I could watch it over and over again. And then the big night came, after over a year of waiting, I was surprised to say I was actually nervous. A week before the movie came out I was scared that the writers might have screwed it up, and that a huge part of my life would be embarrassed. As the lights dimmed and the big ""Feature Presentation"" logo popped up on the screen, I had no idea I was in for one of the greats hour and a half of my life.<br/><br/>The movie hits every mark spot on. It's clever, funny, satirical, and all around amazing. Nearly every joke has you laughing out loud and amazed at how witty it can be. There are clever jokes, scenarios, and one-liners for those more mature, and every now and then they give the younger demographic a slapstick gag which to my amazement turned out more mature then most pain gags would seem. Every joke is delivered with good taste and is sure to give anyone a laugh, fan or no fan.<br/><br/>The plot of this movie is very appropriate as it stands out from the average episode. The idea of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie, all making a run for it after poisoning and ruining the lives of everyone in Springfield is very appropriate. A power mad government agent plotting to trap everyone in Springfield and subsequently kill them adds to the epic feel of the movie. The writers even strung in emotional subplots for each of the family members (excluding Maggie), some of which can really pull at your heartstrings.<br/><br/>I have only two minor complaints about this movie. The first being that it is too short. Although it may have dragged on with filler if the writers extended it, I feel that the movie could have been longer. I also feel that some of the secondary characters got pushed to the side, particularly Mr. Burns, who was only in the movie briefly.<br/><br/>All in all this is a fantastic movie. It met and surpassed my expectations. Where I work we put our favorite movies on out name tags underneath our names as a way of showing who we are and what we like. On my next shift my name tag will proudly read ""The Simpsons Movie""."

","The Simmpsons movie was a great film and had a lot of funny moments especially with Bart skateboarding naked in Springfield. Other great moments included were with Bart and Homer, the Pig that Homer adopted, and Springfield's residents trying to kill Homer. The plot of the movie has the Simpson family running away after Homer dumps the pig's waste in the environment causing Springfield to be polluted which is why Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa, and Maggie hide in Alaska. I hope that they make a sequel. The only complaint of the movie is that it could have been longer by 30 minutes, but overall a summer treat that many fans have been looking forward to and won't be disappointed."

The color and graphics of the show was really amazing, makes you happy whilst watching the show.It stayed true to the comedy of Simpson - and as always, expect a lot of randomness like in the normal Simpson series. There's a lot of effort invested into making every line in this show and all the main characters appear in the movie - which was very nice... except you may notice an absence of the actor with arnold schwarz's voice seen in regular episodes hahaha (for reasons you will find out when watching the movie). <br/><br/>Hope all you Simpson fans out there will love it as much as I did!"

Today, The Simpsons is still funny, but episodes that make me laugh as hard as I did during those first ten seasons come around only once in a while.<br/><br/>Fortunately, this movie is one of those episodes. I laughed pretty much the whole way through it, and I laughed hard. As you can tell, I went to the movie expecting to like it. And even with high expectations, The Simpsons Movie still impressed me.

","""The Simpsons"" is undoubtedly, the most important movie release this year. Years before much fans of the famous cult T.V series ask to themselves if could be the possibility of a movie. Well, i get happy when i knew that was a movie of a T.V series that i have seen since little, but... when i go out of the cinema was the same happy feeling? ""the Simpsons"" begins as a T.V series in the early 90s. Since there has become as one of the most important success in T.V. All the world have been listen at least just once about the yellow family. Is intelligent series with interesting plots, created by Matt Groening and released by a lot of creative people,without count with that music theme that we never going to forget. The T.V series is the funniest and best t.V show that i have ever seen. And now, we got the film. Much Simpsons fans (As i am) wait, and wait, and expect that this movie don't be unfaithful to this expects. Today i see this movie. And although i think that this movie leave some empty spaces, much of The Simpsons fans will be happy and pleased.<br/><br/>The movie told us another Simpson adventure (Just like any other episode after all, just than more longer). The Simpsons family receives from grandpa'a kind of omen. Marge is very worry for that, but Homer is worried too... but for Spider-Pig! In other side, Lisa Simpson is worried too for the lake, which is more polluted than before and can be a dangerous response to it. Springfield catches conscience (???) about the situation and decides to take care about the lake... no one can throw more garbage to this lake... but Homer... well, you know... Homer commits a big, big mistake.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" have a good plot after all, which is important because carries a lot of important things that we don't know of the series. I get so proud any way when i watch the credits and found to all that people who work for this big project. Then i go out of the cinema, not so happy as i think, but certainly very pleased. Any Simpson fan going to love it, because after all is loyal with this. Althoug, i think that this film is lightly more violent than the T.V series, and i recommended it for persons from 12 years.<br/><br/>This movie going to make you pass a good time after all, is funny and great, but i think sometimes that it doesn't make justice to a series of so high quality.<br/><br/>*Sorry for the mistakes...well, if there any."
"tatmeister","9","2","7","27 July 2007"," The hype is justified.
","""The Simpsons"" movie offers fun for the entire family, and not just for those who laugh at anything, either. The 90 minute jammed-packed comedy made the audience literally ""LOL"" every minute. The elements of humor, satirical, political & random- is what you expect in a Simpsons movie. It's a bit different than the regular 30 minute shows, since the movie is too short to have a really meaningful plot. Homer Simpson has doomed the town of Springfield. By dumping hazardous material into a lake already haunted by years of toxic treatment, Homer indirectly causes the destruction of Springfield. The EPA (Environmental Protection Agency). After capturing a specimen (squirrel) that was transformed into a mutant squirrel , they decide to trap Springfield in a large dome that is indestructible. The entire town of Springfield, unable to leave anywhere outside the dome, become lunatics and drive the Simpson family out. The Simpsons have to survive and save their city.<br/><br/>This was a funny movie. Don't go in expecting a rich storyline or some sort of developing plot. That's not the point of the movie, all it intends to do is make fun of the characters, and hopefully make you laugh the whole time. Bring friends and family!"
"kevin_crighton","9","2","7","27 July 2007"," Funniest movie this year
","Well, after 18 years and after 400+ episodes, we finally get a Simpsons movie. It's been suggested that the series has been on a downward spiral for awhile, and it's not as funny as it used to be.<br/><br/>Well the reason for that is obvious.... they've been keeping the best stuff for the movie!! Simply put, this is not only a movie that can sit alongside the best years of The Simpsons series, it's also the funniest movie this year, and the best animated movie for years!! The plot, not that it's important is as follows : Homer, in his usual style, causes chaos when he gets Springfield sealed in a dome for environmental reasons, and in the end it's up to the family to save the day.<br/><br/>The plot though is not important. What is important, is it funny? and the answer to that is a resounding YES!! The characters are as funny as always, even if some of them are limited to an occasional scene or in the background. This is a movie that focuses on The Simpsons family and they keep the laughs coming through-out, from Bart skateboarding naked through town, Lisa in love, Maggie's face-off with a monkey (funnier than it sounds!) Marge's attempt to keep sane in the chaos, and of course Homer the funniest non-human on the planet. Be it Homer and the bible, Homer and Spider-Pig, Homer trying to not apologise for ruining the town, to.. aw hell! Just go see it and laugh your head off.<br/><br/>Any film that can poke fun at it's watching audience during the opening scenes, to a brilliant pay-off during the end credits can't go wrong. It starts funny, and keeps going right through, and for me that's what a comedy should do."
"Leopold2","8","2","7","27 July 2007"," Best Animated Film since Finding Nemo
","Yes, it is that funny. This is much more entertaining than overrated films like The Incredibles and Happy Feet. I will give you a detailed plot.<br/><br/>Lake Springfield is becoming very polluted and Lisa wants to help but has no success. With the help of an Irish boy, Colin, she is able to hold a press conference and the town agrees. Meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from Krusty Burger and brings it home. Marge warns him that what Grandpa said links to the pig. Later, Homer is forced to dispose of the waste properly but when Lenny tells him that Lard Lad Donuts is giving out free donuts, he dumps the waste in the lake making it very polluted. The EPA traps Springfield in a dome possibly forever. Don't leave as soon as the credits roll because there is a special treat a couple of minutes in the credits.<br/><br/>Homer is his stupid self in this movie and some of the humour is Family Guy like humour. It feels like it's a movie length episode form season 4 and 5 because it's funny. There are a lot of funny jokes including the classic ""Spider Pig."" This is definitely a new animated classic, it's the funniest movie released this summer. Forget crap like Harry Potter, this is one of the movies of the year. Very funny and a must-see for everyone, even if you're not a fan of The Simpsons. 5/5!"

","Some people could ask themselves why it took so long, that is almost twenty years, for the Simpsons producers to transform the adventures of the most-known family in America into a full-length animated picture. Some less-popular TV series, such as ""South Park"", only waited a few years to see a movie based upon their stories. But once we see the final result, complaining is the very last thing possible to do.<br/><br/>Obviously, ""The Simpsons Movie"" must obey to two crucial rules which are applicable when a movie is based upon a TV series : <br/><br/>1- Never take 90 minutes when 30 minutes are enough. <br/><br/>2- Never modify an important aspect which concerns the characters.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" owns a characteristic that is even more difficult than other TV series adaptations. Many series from the '60s, such as ""The Dukes of Hazzard"" and more evidently, ""The Fugitive"" re-told their whole storyline within two hours. ""The Simpsons Movie"" shouldn't do that for the series is still aired today.<br/><br/>But ""The Simpsons Movie"" avoids every trap and presents the best of what it has to offer: an avalanche of gags, satirical sequences and absurd scenes, all packed into an unforgettable 90-minute hilarious adventure.<br/><br/>The movie is extremely well made, the script is tightly built, the characters never lose a bit of their punch and attacks and cheap shots are nicely done. The result is an extremely funny and absurd comedy, a rare gem among the comedy genre.<br/><br/>The characters need no presentation, so let's go to the story. Before going any further, it must be specified that there are many subjects into the storyline, but one of them is more prominent among the story. And this subject is precisely the most tempting for the satirists: politics.<br/><br/>Lake Springfield is becoming so polluted that the situation becomes more and more urgent and the citizens of Springfield have no choice than curing the problem. But as you guessed it, Homer comes ruining everything by dumping a silo full of liquid manure into the lake. The EPA gets involved and the government cuts Springfield from the rest of the world by enclosing the city under an enormous glass dome, just like futuristic cities seen in some works of science fiction.<br/><br/>Able to escape from the inhabitants' fury, the Simpsons flee towards Alaska and try to begin a new life there. But circumstances will do that they will have to save Springfield themselves... as well as their family union.<br/><br/>To be honest, I don't remember having laughed as much while watching a film than with ""The Simpsons Movie"". Some sequences are so full of gags that we risk of choking ourselves or having a heart attack. I thus decided to stop eating popcorn so it wouldn't happen to me.<br/><br/>The die-hard fans of the TV series won't be disappointed of the film, far from it. The movie makes a good use of recurrent themes talked about for so many years in the TV episodes, such as the Homer-Bart relationship, Lisa falling in love, the marriage of Homer and Marge in crisis, the Simpsons family discovering an exotic place and the city of Springfield vs. the American government. And none of these subjects is misplaced or inappropriate.<br/><br/>The only element that is not appropriate is the suddenly growing relationship between Bart and Ned Flanders. It is supposed to highlight the fact that Bart is growing more and more distant from his father, but it should have been made more adequately than that way.<br/><br/>The script is so well written that even the most obvious technical mistakes become quickly forgivable. I obviously make mention of Arnold Schwarzenegger who is depicted as the President of the United States, when somebody who is born outside of the U.S. cannot become president. But if this gag would have been deleted, a nice quantity of laughs would have been deleted at the same time.<br/><br/>But it must be said that the movie is masterfully handled by entertainment geniuses. Conceptors took many subjects which have been publicly ridiculed so many times and kept the most they could. There are a lot of subjects, but some are more memorable than others, such as: rock activists, government agents, Disney, industry and even Fox parodies itself, which happened more than once in the series.<br/><br/>The usual title sequence has been heavily modified for the movie. There's still a punishment for Bart, but the sacred couch gag has been left aside, which is a great disappointment.<br/><br/>On the artistic side, nothing bad to say. The animation is first-rate and special effects have been used to create shadows and to make the pictures more three-dimensional and thus, more realistic. This is a privilege that TV episodes can't afford.<br/><br/>And to counter-balance funny scenes, the producers use dramatic scenes whose efficiency goes sometimes beyond of some straight-forward dramas. Finally, there's everything in that picture! <br/><br/>Many guest stars have appeared along the years and the movie makes no exception. We can see Albert Brooks in a key role, as well as Green Day and Tom Hanks as themselves.<br/><br/>Some scenes will undoubtedly become classics soon. We only have to think about Spider-Pig, Homer and Bart fixing the roof and Bart who cruises the street naked on his skateboard after his father challenged him to do so.<br/><br/>Matt Groening and his band of collaborators have successfully taken up the challenge. ""The Simpsons Movie"" might be the funniest comedy of 2007 and perhaps one of the best of the 21st century. And I don't think that its freshness will fade soon. It's really a splendid comed'oh.<br/><br/>Uh, I mean comedy..."

","before watching this movie i was as skeptical as most people about the quality of this movie. every detail i had heard about the movie made it inevitable that it was going to be bad, and it was not going to be comparable to the show. i had heard the run time was going to be short, they had re-written a lot of it because test audiences had not liked it, and it is released at a time when the new Simpson's episodes were not that great. i went into the theater expecting the worst. this movie surpassed my expectations in every way. it reminded me why i had fallen in love with the Simpson's, and how extremely funny these characters are. it had the classic Simpson's style humor with every joke having multiple layers, it had political commentary, it had a great plot, it referred to itself in a way that only true Simpson's fans would get, it had everything i wanted. i strongly suggest watching this in a theater with a packed audience. DO NOT WAIT TO WATCH THIS ON DVD! see it in the theaters where you can feel like a large family coming together to share laughter and love for a cartoon family that has been around since most of us can remember. to quote my friend after watching the movie,""they did it."" and i completely agree."
"sioenroux","10","2","7","27 July 2007"," They made the perfect movie
","I was predisposed to love ""The Simpsons,"" as I have loved The Simpsons since it came on the air. As a Gen-Xer, I'm of the right generation -- this is OUR series.<br/><br/>But I remember reading an interview a few years back where Matt Groening said they didn't want to make a movie if it would end up being like three TV episodes strung together. If they were going to make a movie, it had to be like one, big, gigantic, super-sized extra-delicious episode.<br/><br/>And that's what they pulled off. Everything you love about ""The Simpsons"" is here and precisely done, from seemingly-THC-induced tangents to irreverent one-liners to bizarre plot twists to low-key political digs. It's written in the same incredibly tight way that, when you're watching TV episodes, leaves you wondering how they packed so much story into one eight-minute segment.<br/><br/>They did it! It's perfect! Go see it! (But don't see it too many times, because Fox sucks and you shouldn't give them a lot of money.) Viva La Simpsons!"

Go see it in the theaters it is worth it I will see it probably two more times before it goes on DVD. The story line is excellent the animation is great it kept me on the edge of my seat and laughing the whole time. If you do not see it in theaters you are missing out I hate going to theaters and I do not regret going it may have been packed but that didn't matter, if it is good enough to get me to want to go back at least two more times says a lot since this is the first movie I have seen since star wars episode 1 that is how much I hate theaters!!!!!"

","This movie, in my opinion, is the best movie in the entire history of film, coming from a hardcore Simpsons fan since 2002. It was nice because it combined originality, which was the whole quarantining Springfield thing, to old Simpsons references, like seeing old previously shown characters from Simpsons episodes. This movie is a definite, without- a-doubt, must see movie. This is really what I've been expecting from Matt Groening after 18 years, 18 seasons & 400 episodes of The Simpsons, it just makes all 18 of those years of waiting really worth it. In fact, it's so good, that I think one can go see it again & again and never get bored. I was just purely amazed. My favorite parts were all the scenes with Spider Pig.(a.k.a Harry Plopper). I can't wait for this to come out on DVD & hopefully PSP, HDDVD & Blu-ray. I definitely think this movie is worthy of many Oscars. If this is what Matt Groening can pull off with a movie, I can't wait to see the 19th season of The Simpsons (please let there be one)."
"nobbytatoes","8","2","7","27 July 2007"," just off the golden years of the series
","If there was every more of a parent and teacher of a generation, it would have to be The Simpsons. The zeitgeist of topical and social commentary, The Simpsons were more than just the average run of the mill cartoon show. Though like all great things, they all must come to an end, maybe not the end of the show, but the time of their grasp upon that zeitgeist has been severed, and losing that sharp edge which made The Simpsons so special; slap stick, Homer antics now the norm. With writers from the golden years of the show on board for the belated release of The Simpsons Movie, redemption seems promising, striking back into that zeitgeist. Yet a more pressing question is what can the movie tackle, as just through every day living, it’s hard not to say, “Remember when {insert Simpson character} did {insert act}”. Over 400 episodes, everything has been said and done, as South Park pointed out, “Simpsons did it”. So it’s not surprising that environmental themes are the main point of focus, with global warming such a hot topic. Luckily, this environmental theme isn’t jammed down your throat, and good old shenanigans are back. The first half runs with rapid fire jokes and satire, it’s hard not to think, this is what The Simpsons were all about, with pure gold coming out of every scene with Homer and his adopted pig. Once Springfield is encased within the Dome, due to Homer dropping pig excrement in Springfield Lake and is labelled a biohazard by the Environmental Protection Authority, the pacing slightly drops, as some jokes miss than hit, yet the humour still sits on a level to call this the funniest film of the year. Maybe a draw back to the humour is the broad range the writers have aimed for, incorporating the maximum audience. Fans will still be appeased, as in jokes are placed throughout, the ambulance at Springfield Gorge a prime example, and genuine emotional drama and even pathos in Homer’s redemption. In an attempt to bring a big Simpsons adventure to the big screen, there is a lack of surprise, as times arise of haven’t we seen this in another episode, and this really is just a super extended episode, but it’s one of the best to come out of the Simpsons in a very long time."
"theone2088","10","2","7","27 July 2007"," The Movie We've Been Waiting For So Long
","After years and years of rumors surrounding the unattainable Simpsons Movie, it has finally come. Was all the wait worth it? Yes. Yes it was.<br/><br/>The movie begins with the drum rolls of the 20th century company...before Ralph Wiggum walks out and sings with the drum rolls. You know this movie won't be like anything you've ever seen.<br/><br/>The movie moves along like a well oiled machine with every piece of the story being laid out very well. It is not like some of the Simpsons episodes where the beginning has NOTHING to do with the upcoming plot. In the light of environmental issues, the story revolved around the fact that pollution is destroying our world, and even Springfield (wherever it is) is in danger.<br/><br/>Now, we all know we will not go to this movie for the plot. After being introduced in 1987 on the Tracey Ullman Show, the Simpsons family has been through almost every imaginable situation (maybe Marge will become a robot in one episode). That being said, the plot is still a well plaid out one. There are not many moments where enjoyment is hindered by the lack of plot explanation.<br/><br/>The great minds behind the Simpsons deliver, and they deliver their very best. There were laughs throughout the whole auditorium every few minutes, if not every few seconds. My mouth was hurting from the smiling by the time I left the theater. There is a jab at fox, the ridiculous jokes where we cannot help but laugh at, and there is of course the playing with the audience's expectations (for example, the censorship that we have become accustomed to on the show is relieved and we forget this sometimes, and the writers take advantage of this to surprise us and make us laugh.) We came to love this humor and it is all there.<br/><br/>The tangible plot and hilarious jokes are included, and most people expect just those two things, if not only the jokes. But if you listen to the commentary on the Simpsons DVDs, you will know that the old time, and arguably best Simpsons writers love putting heart into their episodes. Do not fear, there is enough heart to go around.<br/><br/>It is an animated movie, so I will touch on that aspect. The animation is superb. It doesn't look like the old days, nor are the colors as warm and rich like in the aged seasons. But the extensive computer animation works in the favor of the movie; there are some fantastic sequences that will amaze you. In recent episodes, the clean cut and computer-aided animation seem to distract people (or, at least that is true for me). But this movie's jokes are so funny and top notch that the animation did not distract; it only enhances the film, like it should.<br/><br/>Going into this movie as, let's say, a die hard Family Guy fan, the whacky comedy of the Simpsons may not sit well with you. But if you love and embrace the old seasons of the Simpsons, that golden age that the fans embrace with both arms, this movie delivers with excellence. Homer doesn't play the saxamaphone, there is no monorail, and Ralph never does go to Bovine University. But what we are left with is the longest episode of the Simpsons ever, not that that is a bad thing; it is indeed also the funniest episode."
"sackjigler","10","2","7","26 July 2007"," Utterly Hilarious
","I went into this film with the same skepticism as everyone else. Don't get me wrong, I love the Simpsons, but the show, as like any other would, has lost some steam throughout it's many years. So, obviously I as many others were wondering how would they pull of a feature film. Now, all I can say is WoW! This movie comes at you like a freight train. Yes, we did have a good fan crowd which always helps, but I did not see this one coming. I thought it would have random funny parts, but this was just wall to wall hilarity. I haven't laughed this hard in a long time. It's easily up there with knocked up as the funniest film this year, although it is two totally different kinds of humor.<br/><br/>The plot goes as this; Springfield's lake is being polluted by it's citizens and Lisa finally gets the message to the town so they clean it up. Unfortunately, Homer steps in and screws everything up, so Springfield is locked in a dome by the environmental protection agency. The townspeople come after Homer, The Simpsons escape, town gets threatened to be destroyed, simpsons return to save the day.<br/><br/>I'm not going to throw in the spoilers. This movie is utterly hilarious and only slightly lets up in the third act, which is saying a lot for comedies these days. The jokes fly fast that you find yourself laughing through most of the dialogue, and they are up to date and genuinely funny.<br/><br/>I didn't expect this movie to be this good and put it on my top ten for the year. Please see this, I don't see how you could be disappointed. Thanks to all involved for making this one of the best times I've had at the movies in quite a while."
"darthrizla","8","2","7","26 July 2007"," Stupid Flanders!
","Spiderpig! How do I just know that's gonna be the thing all summer. And people are going to annoy me by getting the words all wrong. Does it stop me from driving my girlfriend mad with it though? Nope! Other than the Spiderpig song though, I have to say that there's a distinct lack of quality quotes in it. Especially considering the dream-team of Simpsons writers assembled to make the movie. In 20 or 30 years, if I'm still alive, I'm pretty sure I'll still be quoting lines from Marge Versus the Monorail or King Size Homer. But I imagine I'll tire of Spiderpig after a week, maybe.<br/><br/>Will the rest of the movie stand the test of time however? I actually think it will. In fact I think its probably going to save the franchise which, regrettably, has taken a nosedive in terms of quality, but, as this movie shows, still has a good few years of laughter left.<br/><br/>The first half hour in Springfield is pure gold. Some of the best Simpsons laughs I've had in a long, long time. And their effortless transition to the big screen is evident right from the moment Ralf Wiggum appears, dwarfed by the 20th Century Fox logo, singing along to the fanfare. From here on in its a visual treat, the animation is really impressive, with lots of panoramic shots, ""camera"" angles and other eye candy as is Hans Zimmer's music.<br/><br/>The gags are brilliant, with some wonderful slapstick moments, further augmented by the magic of silver screen. A brilliant Bambi homage that's sickeningly cute, surreal and downright disturbing and of course the sort of humor the Simpsons does best, subversive humor, aimed at religion, at society in general, at the US government, and of course, at Fox.<br/><br/>The pacing isn't always the best, however, and sometimes it seems as though the writers weren't sure whether to emulate the older style; the dysfunctional family who eventually resolves problems through mushy sentimentality, or to go for the newer, Homer the boundless buffoon/unapologetic jerk route. Case in point being the subplot where Bart finds a new father figure in (stupid) Flanders, but thankfully we've got a hilarious scene with Bart drinking whiskey to cut through the treacle. (Just try getting *that* shown on TV!) With many of these movies though, it can be very difficult to figure out how, exactly, to turn a half-hour animated show into a full feature. They can play it safe, as in the case of the Family Guy and South Park movies, by simply making an extra-long episode and taking advantage by doing and saying things they couldn't get away with on TV, or they can decide to take the characters outside their limited environment, as was done with the Beavis and Butthead movie. The Simpsons movie does push beyond what it could do on TV but overall took the latter approach, taking the characters we all know and love, and placing them in a new environment and in situations we've never seen them in before.<br/><br/>Of course that's a tall order with the Simpsons. Homer's had such a colourful resume over the past years, not to mention going into space, meeting God and traveling through time for some reason. I think maybe the writers felt that a movie audience would expect something new in the movie so they decided to take a lot of the action outside of Springfield. Pity that. I'd have loved to have seen more action inside Springfield, especially about the collapse of the town in anarchy, and so on. (And, for that matter, to see whatever happened to Spider Pig) Instead a good chunk of the movie takes place when the Simpsons relocate to Alaska. I like a good ""the Simpsons are going to"" (Australia, China, Brazil, India... {though not the England one that was just terrible} episode as much as the next guy, but I would have liked to have seen a lot more Springfield on the big screen.<br/><br/>However, from what I've been reading, there's a vast abundance of unused footage in the movie, including a few cut celebrity cameos. Most notably Kelsey Grammar. He's on the credits for Sideshow Bob but wasn't in the movie. Actually he'd have made a far better villain than the villain in the movie. And speaking of villains, Mister Burns is hardly on-screen for a minute. Something tells me, though, that a feature-packed DVD release by is on the cards, full of deleted scenes hopefully by Christmas time, so I can drop the hint to my girlfriend. Perhaps a director's cut, of sorts, now *that* would be something special!!! As for the plot. Well the Simpsons always had plots within plots within plots. It would start off as one thing, and then go off someplace completely different and who knew where it would end up. The Simpsons Movie takes this formula to new extremes. The plot itself is terrible. But then who cares? In the Simpsons the plot was always secondary to the gags anyway, so I guess the best thing is to stop being all Jeff Albertson about the plot and enjoy the laughs.<br/><br/>Overall, well, it's not perfect and with something as big as the Simpsons is, expectations were always going to be high. Mine, I'm glad to say, were more than met though I'm sure there'll be plenty of would-be Jeff Albertsons out there ""on the internet within seconds registering their disgust throughout the world""  ignore them. If you love the Simpsons as much as I do, then you'll love this movie. Plus it also offers plenty for people who are unfamiliar with (if such people actually exist) or those who wish to reacquaint themselves with the funniest family in television history, and now, cinematic history.<br/><br/>Looking forward to the DVD release and really, really hoping for a sequel!"

It comes as no surprise that Homer is once again a bungling fool, but the consequences this time are more drastic and potentially catastrophic then ever before (and that's saying a lot).<br/><br/>The movie moves along at such a fast pace that even though it's about two hours in length, it seemed like it was over way too quickly.

","This is one of the best animated cartoon movies I have seen in my life so far. Nothing can surpass what makes this movie great. This movie was romantic, exciting, dramatic, and one hundred billion percent funny. So far, I don't see any bad reviews of this movie. Well, I think I saw one. I think this is going to be higher in the rank of IMDb's top 250.<br/><br/>So far, one of the top adult cartoon shows that are shown on Comedy Central, Fox, and Adult Swim. They are Family Guy, South Park, Aqua Teen Hunger Force, and the Simpsons. This movie is quite appropriate for children excluding these things; When Bart Simpson's penis was shown, and when Homer and Marge was having sex, although they didn't show them, there was bed making noises and animals watching, shocked and disgusted. But that was one of the funniest things ever. I loved when Mr. Flanders said, ""I bless God for this wonderful,"" then Bart Simpson jumped toward the window of the Krusty Burger Place and Flanders looked as he spoke, ""wonderful Penis!"" and his children repeated. It was so funny.<br/><br/>I have never went to the theaters hearing an audience laugh this hysterical. Also, the ""To Be Continued"" really had me worried. I heard someone say ""That's boring!"" which I didn't know if it was the movie or in real life, but that was funny. I love how Lisa finally found a boyfriend who loves her and believes in everything she says. Absolutely romantic. I also love how Marge left Homer and recorded a video saying so over the wedding video, but Homer proved himself to be a better husband by saving Springfield and on his motorcycle, grabbed Marge and she rode with him kissing saying, ""That was the best kiss in my life,"" and Homer replied, ""The best kiss in your life so far!"" Absolutely romantic. Ah.<br/><br/>What is the plot you might ask? I leave you to find out for yourself because it is too exciting to describe. Although, another review might had said it but take my advice. If you know the ending and the entire plot and how Springfield was in danger before watching the movie, it will totally suck. Though, little things don't matter such as I read in the IMDb message board that Dr. Nick dies. I didn't really care.<br/><br/>I recommend this movie to everyone in the entire world."

","This movie is not too late. This movie is done exactly the way it should be, flat out funny. I say this to the audience that are fans of the Simpsons. As for the rest of the world, your missing out.<br/><br/>Yes, the movie has a plot about environmentalism. While this subject can get too preachy, it is not that when the Simpsons present it. The plot presents a lot of ways to hang great humor on. The audience I saw it with was laughing (along with me) the entire film. A surprise - spoiler - is that Homer misses getting his donuts. That means bad news-Homer doesn't gain any cartoon weight- good news we got room for the next film.<br/><br/>Everything about this film is done right. In fact it is actually tamer (to me) than some of the television episodes. That means they went for humor- not adult themes- & this movies succeeds on all levels. It even chides Simpson fans for not being in front of the tube. The opening is a rock concert, not the Simpsons on their couch in front of the TV. <br/><br/>The length is about perfect, & the entertainment value is here. All the characters are there although there is so much good stuff jammed into the approximately 87 minutes that some characters don't get much screen time. The film is so funny, you don't really care who gets screen time. Another Simpsons winner, too bad more series & movies can't be as good.<br/><br/>Homer gets Springfield into trouble, Homer & Bart save Springfield, & we get a bonus, Spider-Pig. This is my 300th review here on the IMDb & as I said when I reviewed the Television Series - A Doughnut Hole For Every Critic! Enjoy this & if they can keep it this good, lets have a sequel of something truly entertaining for a change out of Hollywood. I am looking forward to the next one already. They didn't even need Bart flashing in this one, it is great well done lampoon on the excesses of today & all the bull we get exposed too. Spider Pig is the ultimate ham actor."

","This movie was AMAZINGLY FANTASTIC!!!!!!!!! Much better than I'd even hoped for! With those hilarious one-liners (Ralph: I like men now)or (Homer: Thanks Big Boob Lady!). I also LOVED the parodies of movies like TITANIC and Time Machine. Although, those were mostly sight gags and had not much to do with the plot. A classy film. It took rather long to make it but no complaints! You WILL love this movie if you are a fan of the show,love sight gags and a plot with some real substance. Not like some shows or movies (Family Guy). It's pretty much one the whole family will enjoy. Seeing as how the humor reaches many levels. It's definitely not hard to enjoy. And I laughed till it hurt. 10 stars man!!!"

","The world has just received the most hilarious 2D animated movie after 18 years on TV and 9 years on the waiting list.<br/><br/>And the folks from Springfield has landed on the big screen at the nearest cinema near you. Let's welcome...The Simpsons Movie! From the response of the audience who watched The Simpsons Movie at my neighborhood cinema, i could see that the audience enjoyed the jokes from the Simpsons family created. And although 9 years seems to be a long time for the arrival of the movie, the movie has proved that the wait is worth.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie makes Homer Simpson the center of the story, where he saves a pig that was about to be slaughtered at Krusty's Burger after the pig was used for filming Krusty's latest advertisement. Before that, an elderly from Springfield warns the community that a catastrophe is about to fall on Springfield.<br/><br/>Shortly after he adopts the pig, Homer dumped some toxic waste into the Springfield river, where the community has just cleaned up. His act leads Springfield to be quarantined, for the government fears that the river might pollute America. So, it's time for Homer to save his wife Marge and his three kids, namely Lisa, Bart and Maggie and of course, Springfield.<br/><br/>Watching The Simpsons Movie is a treat to the fans of the popular animated series, since it is time to turn the series from goggle box to silver screen. Also, it is much more longer than your usual 25-30 min per episode, as the movie can be considered as a extended version of a normal episode. In this 87 min feature, you are guaranteed with a fun filled adventure of the The Simpsons.<br/><br/>To kick off the movie, the opening scene features the popular animation Itchy and Scratchy on the big screen, where folks from Springfield are watching it in the cinemas. Next, special appearance and introduction from Tom Hanks and Green Day were introduced in the movie to sweeten the experience.<br/><br/>From there, the audience will get to know the stupidity of Homer has created a catastrophe for the folks in Springfield, where it is up to Homer himself to save the day.<br/><br/>Lastly, do stay for the end credits, for audience who stayed for the end credits will be rewarded with treats from the creators themselves!"

","The movie was awesome. Many here seemed to think that the movie will suck like some of the latest seasons of the show. I have watched plenty of the older episodes of this show and I would say a good portion of this movie is equally as funny. There is something for everyone to laugh at in this movie just as the show poked fun at everything in society. There is actually a lot of relevant current issues type of humor to be had and such things include blow back, wiretapping and general trust in your government. Other humor is just good old fashioned Simpson's humor (the movie begins with Itchy and Scratchy) such as Homer tiling his roof and Flanders gets owned plenty of times. There is some irrelevant family guy like humor but it is kept to a minimum and after a while the plot really picks up. I highly recommend this to anyone who has ever liked the Simpson's at one point or another. You will not regret paying, ""to see something you can see for free on TV every Sunday"", trust me!"
"matthew-smith333","10","2","8","26 July 2007"," Wow, 100% worth the 17 year wait!
","Went to an advance screening of this yesterday, with a certain amount of trepidation.<br/><br/>I have loved The Simpsons for nearly 17 years, and have passed on the tradition to my kids. There isn't any other cartoon/sit-com that has the same level of humour. As a parent I watch it on a completely different level to my children, and all the risqué content goes over their heads.<br/><br/>My fear was that it wouldn't live up to my expectations, as there had been rumours of a feature length movie for years. Turns out my fears were wholly unjustified! The laughs start with the opening credits, and are still going on when the final credits roll.<br/><br/>Everything I'd wanted to see in a Simpsons movie was there, and more. The quality of animation was top notch, and there was plenty of rude jokes to satisfy my now adult sense of humour. The clever thing is though, my kids don't pick up on these and therefore I don't have to restrict their viewing.<br/><br/>The producers of The Simpsons could have jumped on the movie bandwagon a long time ago, and cashed-in, but what they have given us shows they have waited, built up ideas and fan bases for individual characters and produced a gem for us to repay our many years of dedicated viewing! I was also pleased to see plenty of other adults there of a similar age to me, all laughing out loud.<br/><br/>This is an all time must-see movie, and one I will be seeing again without a doubt."

","I was living in England when the Simpsons first appeared on sky TV there. From the first episode 'Simpsons Roasting On An Open Fire' I have been a devoted fan and am laughed at by some people all these years later for being a thirty eight year old man who loves a silly cartoon. I don't care. The Simpsons is the best show on TV and I don't think the episodes have diminished that much over the years. Homer is still the greatest character in TV and now cinema history.<br/><br/>I just went with my nineteen year old nephew to the Simpsons Movie in New Plymouth New Zealand and I have to say I have never laughed so loud or hard in a movie theatre ever. Matt Groening and co. have done such a great job that I can see this film becoming one of the biggest hits of all time.<br/><br/>Don't listen to the naysayers. It's everything that the TV series is but it is so much more. This movie has a unique feel to it and I'm still smiling from seeing over two hours ago.<br/><br/>I saw no faults with this film. The thing I'm most pleased about was the fact that it concentrated on the family and left the supporting characters as they should be, supporting. Also I feared that Burns and the Power Plant were going to be part of the plot but was pleased to see they were relegated to walk on parts.<br/><br/>I was wondering how they were going to improve on an already brilliantly animated show but they stepped up and pushed the envelope even further.<br/><br/>Good on you guys. My favourite comedy films used to read 1. Life of Brian 2. Holy Grail 3. Airplane 4. Dumb and Dumber 5. Borat. Now I have to put Homer and family at the top.<br/><br/>D'oh!"
"zook-1","8","2","8","26 July 2007"," I've expected a lot... and got satisfied!
","OK I just saw the premiere of the Simpsons movie and I have to say: It's hilarious! But first of all I have to mention that after watching every single episode, I've expected a lot! And I really had my doubts about the whole 'bringing a great show to the movies' thing... But now after watching the movie all doubts are gone. Well enough talking, let's focus on the movie itself: It brings up one laugher after another that I couldn't even breath sometimes. A lot of good old classic Simpsons humor combined with some new CGI animation (which has never been used before in a Simpsons episode) and some new great info (wait for the credits ;-) ) makes a dignified movie of the most successful cartoon show in the world.<br/><br/>I'm sure that some people will say that the story itself could be better, but I think every fan expects a kind of story, he or she always wanted to see at the Simpsons. But in my opinion Groening found a great way for 87 minutes of non-stop laughing.<br/><br/>As heard before in the media all Simpsons characters appear in the movie... WRONG! I don't think that anybody of the (new) characters (Season ~13 - 18) is missing BUT I definitely missed some classics like Troy McClure or Lionel Hutz. I'm sure every fan has his/her own favorite character. So some might be disappointed that their character only appear for a few seconds in the movie. But the classics like Moe, Lenny, Carl, Ralph, Martin and so on have really great scenes where you can't stop laughing.<br/><br/>Long story short, 'The Simpsons Movie' is a really great try to bring our favorite TV family to the cinema. It's so good that I'm really expecting a second movie! Well I suggest that you go to the movies and see for yourself. But one thing is definitely sure: I'm going to watch that movie a couple of times because seeing this great animation show on a big cinema screen is a really great experience for a Simpsons fan and those who will be after the movie ;-)"

","That's right,you read right. The secret word for tonight is D'oh! (which can only mean one thing---The Simpsons Movie is finally out!). America's favourite dysfunctional family has made the successful transition to the large screen,with most of everybody's fave characters from Springfield (?). As in the series, the plot is multi layered, taking pot shots at various sacred cows (the environment,Pop Culture,etc). Watching it is kind of like watching the series for (just under)90 minutes (and without all of those annoying adverts). Without revealing much, the requisite number of guest stars making cameo voice-overs is there (I won't say who). The crowd I saw it with tonight seemed to have a fun time with it. Suffice it to say, I'm sure this film will (hopefully)have some staying power for awhile. See it with the donut you love!"

And just then the family decides to saves Springfield but Homer Simpson does not want to come because there is evil in Springfield. So instead Homer Simpson decides to get back to save Springfield.

This is very entertaining and a tad informative as well! The lessons don't stop at what I mentioned but those are just a couple of points I touched upon! I watched this on DVD and am happy I did because you will have to rewind or be close up to the screen to catch what some of the print says!"
"madisondeclare","6","1","3","26 April 2016"," Well, it was definitely funny... but not classic Simpsons funny
","Don't get me wrong, this film is definitely not bad, but it seemed to be missing something. <br/><br/>Let me just say that The Simpsons is my favorite television show---at least from season 1-9. And this was not exactly a best time for a movie to come out... When the show was already downhill.<br/><br/>The movie has some very funny moments and definitely keeps you entertained. Also, all of the characters were actually in character, which is of course important. Not to mention the animation is VERY nice to look at! <br/><br/>The problems I have with it? First off, ""a cast of thousands"" is complete BS. None of the side characters of Springfield really get any screen time (aside from the Flanders.) It would have been great to see Sideshow Bob--who is one of my favorite characters--and I wished to see wayyyyyy more with Mr. Burns. He is one of the funniest characters on the show who everyone loves to hate, but he only got ONE scene! The show had many great characters and barely focuses on them. Yes I know the Simpsons are obviously the main characters, but they could have done sooo much with these characters.<br/><br/>Another problem I have is the Marge and Homer separating subplot.. I am so sick of this. We all know how it is going to end...that is all.<br/><br/>Now here is the MAIN problem I have: Its humour is the type of humour you would see in the NEW Simpsons episodes, but not really of the original and memorable seasons and episodes. It's really hard to explain it, but The Simpsons humour used to be very clever and memorable. People to this day still quote old Simpsons episodes (often by heart) but I don't see anyone quoting much from this movie since it came out. That's because the humour isn't all that timeless and memorable. <br/><br/>Overall, if you are a fan of the new Simpsons or are just looking for a good comedy, then you will love it and get good laughs. If you are a long time Simpsons fan, you MIGHT enjoy it, and get a few laughs here or there. I still watch this movie occasionally and enjoy it, but definitely not one of my favourites.<br/><br/>6/10"

","The Simpsons Movie may not go down as an instant classic and it likely won't win over anyone who was not already in love with the series, but for those of us that are completely addicted to anything Simpsons, this is like watching a feature length episode with higher quality animation. The story revolves around Homer who, as always, through irresponsibility nearly causes the downfall of beloved Springfield by polluting the reservoir with the waste from Spiderpig (surely you've at least heard the song by now). Funny dialogue, hilarious songs, Homer, and the rest of the crazy citizens of Springfield give Simpsons lovers another DVD to rent."

This turns out to be my shortest review ever but thats all it deserves and by the way the ""SpiderPig"" song is really dumb.<br/><br/>Most of my friends rightly love the Simpson but the film was designed to exploit the fan base.<br/><br/>If you are a collector then you are forced to buy it.<br/><br/>I suppose it serves as a great example of the comedy genre.<br/><br/>Still good family entertainment."

","I saw the Simpsons Movie on DVD three days ago, and already I couldn't tell you the plot -- it had something to do with a gigantic glass dome over Springfield, or other. It was an entertaining roller-coaster ride of an episode and in wide screen and longer and yellower, but overall the quality of the plot and the gags was below that of one of the better TV episodes. I had the impression that the makers couldn't wait to get their hands on their profits, and that consequently not a lot of love an dilligence went into the production.<br/><br/>Overall, the movie was entertaining but also a bit of a let-down, especially after the brilliant 3D-bunny-rabbit commercial. You will get better mileage out of watching a few classic episodes."

I was happy to hear that a film was coming out and I heard mixed review but I still had to see it for myself.<br/><br/>I won't throw away the film but due to an accident a dome is forced to cover Springfield and the Simpsons attempted to deal with the issue at hand with the dome.<br/><br/>This wasn't the funniest film out there in terms of comedy. It was funny at times, but not rolling on the floor laughing funny. The script is well written, but the jokes at times are corny and stupid.<br/><br/>The film itself was a great idea and enjoyable to watch.

"hall895","8","1","3","28 February 2008"," The Simpsons. Longer.
","Here we have an episode of The Simpsons. Only longer. And, if you happened to see it in the theater, bigger. Other than some slightly crisper animation at times there is really nothing to set the movie apart from the television show. You can pretty much just count this as another episode of the series. To be fair, as Simpsons episodes go, this is a better than average one. Then again, for all the time and money they spent it had better be. Basically, if you like the show you'll like the movie. If you don't, you won't. Rather simplistic but also rather true.<br/><br/>The movie's plot starts in a rather familiar place...Homer does something incredibly stupid. In this case Homer's stupidity leads to the government quarantining the entire town of Springfield under a giant dome. The Simpsons escape and flee to Alaska and from there the story proceeds in familiar Simpsons fashion. There are some scenes which seem to be there only to boost the running time to feature film length. In truth there's really nothing about the story that couldn't have been shoehorned into a traditional 22-minute episode. But all in all, the movie works. There's enough here to remind you of why you loved The Simpsons in the first place. There is certainly some room to quibble with the movie. With so much of the focus on the Simpson family some of the most popular characters seem to get the short shrift. (More Mr. Burns please!) Some of the jokes and gags fall flat but more work than don't. The familiar cast does a fine job bringing their famous characters to life and there's room for a solid guest turn by Albert Brooks as the villain of the story. Could the world have survived without a Simpsons movie? Yeah. But if they were going to make one at least they made it a pretty good one."

","Like Classic Simpsons? Then you'll Love this! The Simpsons Movie combines all of our favourite elements of the beloved TV show, with some new stuff and make the best TV to movie adaption ever made. Though many were skeptical about Springfields jump to the silver screen, the Simpsons Movie was well-received across the globe, and for good reason. From the very beginning it's jam-packed with laughs that poke fun at everything including the very audience watching the movie. The animation is tip-top and shows a new side of Springfield in widescreen that could never be done on TV. This brings so much more to the movie, making it a fantastic view for both fans and newcomers to Groening's story about a dysfunctional family.<br/><br/>Moreover, it's laced with tonnes of references that hark back to the early days of the show, eg. 'the ambulance crashed into the tree of Springfield Gorge'. The Die-hards revel in the countless call-backs to the show, while the outsiders enjoy the comedic film from a different perspective. You can also enjoy all of your secondary characters, almost all of which appear in the vast crowds throughout the movie. Those who prefer the older episodes rather than more recent ones of The Simpsons will be delighted to see this fine movie, with The Simpsons at their very best. All of this along with the worldwide phenomenon of new character SpiderPig and an epic storyline to match bring The Simpsons into their greatest adventure of all-time. Praise Jebus!"
"TheAtomicPunk","2","1","3","21 December 2007"," I laughed twice, that's it
","I'm about as avid a simpsons fan as one could be, I own every season on DVD and have been watching the show since I was 15. So when I went into the movie version I was expecting something spectacular, something with a level of hilarity on par with the south park movie (in that movie there were 5 minutes out of 2 hours where I *didn't* laugh). I mean, after all, this is a two hour movie that the writers had years to come up with as opposed to the usual 24 minute episode that gets written in a few weeks.<br/><br/>About halfway through this thing I realized that I had only laughed once, smirked maybe 5 or 6 times and was losing hope that the movie would ever get any better. The usual simpson's episode delivers a joke about once every 10-15 seconds outside of the plot-development material, this movie was delivering jokes about once a minute and none were new or interesting in any way. It was as if they took the worst simpsons episode in the life of the series, and just dragged it out to 2 hours with some better 3D drawing added in.<br/><br/>This movie will be the first piece of simpsons media that I won't buy. I just can't believe how badly the writers did on this, you'd think they would have worked a little harder for the movie version."
"garydiamond","4","1","3","19 December 2007"," Not the great return to form we'd hoped for.
","The problem is, with a show like the Simpsons, every story both tangible and off-the-wall has been explored in the standard series to often powerful effect. Now in order to stretch it out for a movie they've had to come up with some convoluted and confused plot and even then the main feature has trouble keeping it together for 75 minutes.<br/><br/>I tried, but I could not suspend my disbelief for the plot lines, any of them. We all know Homer is stupid; it's one of the staple points of humour in the show. But in the great episodes (seasons 1-10) he wasn't a complete moron barely able to string a few words together as he is here. Who could believe in Bart and Ned Flanders as best of friends? With all the character development we've seen in the past we know that would never be possible! How about 'Spiderpig' and Colin, two completely superfluous and unnecessary characters if ever we saw them. Lisa Simpson, the former intellectual genius reduced here to pining for Colin and whining about everything. No, the only humour I found was incidental to certain situations and even then there weren't the kind of belly laughs the show was capable of producing at its peak.<br/><br/>The bigger budget has translated into a plethora of CGI-based tweaking that seems to be used as eye candy, distracting less observant viewers from the lack of plot. You've also got characters doing and saying things you know they normally wouldn't just to serve the plot. We've seen these sorts of tricks in other Hollywood motion pictures; I'm sad to say it has filtered through to the silver screen debut of one of the all-time classic animated shows.<br/><br/>I bought both The Simpsons Movie and Futurama: Bender's Big Score on the same day. While the Futurama feature not only managed a longer screen time and a shorter credits list at the end, it also managed more laughs and more emotional connection with the characters. It was so good I watched it twice, whereas with this film I had trouble getting through it once and I'm pretty sure I never want to see it again. I'm glad I didn't buy it as a Christmas present.<br/><br/>In closing I think that The Simpsons Movie is not terrible. But neither is it the great effort it could have been, and I rate it below the Futurama, Family Guy and South Park movies. A shame. 4/10"

Unfortunately that cost knowing how it would end. when we got back I knew that somewhere they would have a 2001 a space odyssey reference (it was the very beginning) then they went into the priceless ""Itchy Hillary 08"" moments. the movie does not hesitate to say that we are paying to see a movie about a show we can watch on TV for free (Homer even calls us ""complete idiots"") They have their traditional attacks on FOX broadcasting, A great story line, great voices (just like the show) and virtually everything needed for an animated movie.

","After many, many years of the show being on television, the big screen was finally ready to embrace a yarn about The Simpsons. I've been a longtime fan since the show began, and waited for the day to come, patiently. I stuck with the show year after year, even when fan boys started to complain about later episodes. The show was as entertaining as ever, as far as I was concerned. I had good feelings about the movie when I heard about it, and I was completely satisfied with the result. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is surely as funny and as entertaining as I knew it would be. <br/><br/>What I liked: <br/><br/>There were no major changes or departures from the show, with the minor exception of some crude humor that wouldn't have flown on Fox, which didn't bother me. I enjoyed hearing the laughter of the audience as the jokes flew by. <br/><br/>What I didn't like: It's unfair to say I didn't dislike anything about the movie, but I really had no problems. Most of the crap came from people online who had nothing but negative things to say about the film, and surely enough, if you weren't a fan of the show, you sure weren't going to change your mind now. But leave the rest of us who enjoy it alone.<br/><br/>So basically: An excellent big screen adaptation, funny and enjoyable. I also appreciated the comment some made that it was pretty much an hour and a half episode. Nothing wrong with that!"

They could have missed the mark and gotten too off track of what makes the Simpsons what it is, or they could have just made it an extended episode. But they found a nice balance. And we finally get a little blue with this one. Eat your heart out Family Guy, The Simpsons Movie is edgier, funnier, and more heartfelt. A complete no-brainer. See it!"

","Maybe it was the fact that I saw all of the previews for the movie (sometimes not a good idea since majority of the best bits are shown in the preview leaving a few surprises for the movie itself), or perhaps I was simply expecting more from one of my favorite shows and the first Simpsons movie ever!<br/><br/>I still enjoyed it very much, don't get me wrong- the spiderpig in particular was awesome, but I felt that the movie was a tad too short and that all of the crucial developments unraveled too fast.<br/><br/>For example, the part where Ned adopts Bart and starts spending time with him had much more potential: more jokes and silliness involving Bart torturing Rod and Todd while getting back at the pig and Homer.<br/><br/>By the same token, Homer and the pig could have had a lot more punchlines as the joke was already set up: example Homer could have started taking the pig to work, shopping or to Moe's- maybe even build a house for spiderpig and eventually moved in with him.<br/><br/>Once the ecological bomb exploded on the Springfield what happened to the pig? How come everyone was able to escape through Maggie's sandbox sinkhole and how come it lead them directly outside of the dome? Once they arrived to Alaska the fun kinda stopped- I barely laughed at all :( The Inuit shaman scene was kinda weird and again a bit of an ""easy fix"" for Homer to (finally) realize that polluting Springfield with the pig's silo was his fault and the city's future lies in his big yellow hands. Again, there could have been many more jokes about the state of the desolate Springfield when Homer came back.<br/><br/>Characters were quite predictable- maybe too predictable: Nobody listens to poor Granpa Simpson or the eco friendly Lisa, Marge tries to mediate unsuccessfully, while Homer is the most socially irresponsible of them all- although the part were he put the buzzing hornets' nest in neighbor's mailbox was pretty funny.<br/><br/>Overall, not a bad movie, but as a huge Simpsons fan, it could have been better."
"claudemercure","8","1","3","10 September 2007"," well done
","They didn't screw it up.<br/><br/>It might sound like I'm damning the movie with faint praise, but I'm not. You have to realize that the creators of The Simpsons faced a very daunting task. How do you honour the legacy of a show that's been using up plot ideas and jokes for almost 18 years? How do you not disappoint your very demanding fans? Well it turns out you start by acknowledging what those fans have been saying all along - that the show's golden age ended about ten years ago. You acknowledge this by hiring the writers who worked on the show during its heyday, and you refuse to put out a movie until it's been lovingly crafted into the best Simpsons movie that can possibly be made.<br/><br/>The effort has paid off. The movie deftly side-steps the many traps it could have fallen into (too many guest stars, too much self-consciousness about being on the big screen, relying too much on past glory, catering to the masses, etc.). Quality, edgy laughs are plentiful. The plot takes over a bit too much by the second half, but not to a disconcerting degree.<br/><br/>So how come I don't rate the movie higher? Because The Simpsons belongs on TV (or at least it did, back when it was a great show), in 22-minute chunks. It's out of its element as a 90-minute movie. It's a small miracle that the result turned out as good as it has."
"Michaelwalby","8","1","3","9 September 2007"," Doh!
","Doh! We all had such high expectations from a Simpsons movie. How could we possibly have hoped that it would meet them? As many reviewers have already commented, the movie plays out like a very long episode of the hugely successful and influential TV show. I still relished the opportunity to see this movie on a large cinema screen. The movie provided me with an opportunity to really enjoy and appreciate the vibrancy of the animation on the big screen and to laugh along to (many) jokes out loud with an audience that I would never be able to fit on my sofa back at home while watching the show on TV. The writers make the right choice of focusing on Homer and his immediate family during the movie although this is at the expense of the many wonderful characters which give the show its identity. Here's hoping the next movie focuses more on Mr Burns, Ned Flanders, Ralph Wiggum and Snowball II. The movie delivers its finest moment very early on with the much quoted 'Spider-Pig' sequence - pure genius. And there is no doubt that as the film seeks to resolve the story line in the third act, the joke quota drops considerably. I had hoped the film would have at least one large musical number, a feature of many episodes that seems ideal for a theatrical version. The breathing space that the movie's running time brings, allows considerable emotional depth - most notably during Marge's video message to Homer. I am looking forward to reliving this movie on DVD so that I can appreciate all the side jokes / background jokes that I surely missed on first viewing. My stand out joke of the film though has to be Ralph Wiggum's reaction to seeing Bart skateboarding naked through Springfield. Hilarious!!"
"chrichtonsworld","8","1","3","15 August 2007"," Very funny but not better than an average episode
","If you can speak about a plot in ""Simpons the movie"" than the plot is somewhat grander than of an average episode! But don't make the mistake to expect grander events to happen! Homer does it again! He causes mayhem en becomes an outcast! Even his family are mad at him! So far so good! For some reason however the jokes aren't as hilarious as we are used to from the series! The plot stays simple and misses some serious rough edges from the series! The show always managed to be sharp and make fun of actual topics! In this movie there are only a few of jokes like these! If you are not familiar with the show and the characters you won't understand some jokes concerning them! This is a shame! Because this is part of ""The Simpsons"" charm and one of the main reasons why ""The Simpsons"" is a good show! After this critical note I have to say that as a standalone this movie was very funny and still better than most of the comedies that came out this year!"

","You've read all the comments--for example, in a 90 minute film, you'd expect more of the minor characters to make an appearance-- we get Flanders, Moe, Mr. Burns, Chief Wiggins, etc., but where were so many others? For a major production in old fashioned 2-D animation, I would have liked to have seen more fantasmagorical sequences like 'Homer's Epiphany.' At least we got that! There were other 'spectacular' wide screen vistas such as the dropping of the dome. And finally, in such an extended episode, seeing so much of Homer's poor parenting got a little tiring. On the good side-- it was THE SIMPSONS! Everything we love about the TV show was there in terms of humor, attitude, sarcasm and subtlety. Good. So it gets a strong B. (That's a B+)."
"coldstick","6","1","3","11 August 2007"," Decent, not a classic
","Before I start, let me say that I grew up with the Simpsons, and consider it the greatest animated series of all time. There was a time in my life when I absolutely would not ever dare to ever miss a new episode, and would then meet up with friends the next day to rehash the funniest parts. Part of what made the series so hilarious was Homers' utter irresponsibility, naïveté, and failure as a role model. (His response to a question about why he litters: ""It's easier. Duh."") Bart was also a total brat who would steal things, vandalize, and get in trouble at school. It was one of the few animated programs on at night instead of Saturday mornings (there are far more today, however). It was wildly popular. I can still remember way back to the ads they ran for the second half of the ""Who shot Mr. Burns?"" episode (real people off the street were being interviewed on who they though the killer was).<br/><br/>The Simpsons is a truly excellent series, but one that should have been ended around the years 2000-2001. The creators of Seinfeld knew to quit while they were ahead. The Simpsons, unfortunately, is not the show it used to be. Granted, it would be impossible for it to be the same after so many years and hundreds of episodes, but that's the reason why most television series eventually have to end. In the ""Poochie"" episode, Lisa makes the same point about the Itchy and Scrachy show to a man wanting feedback: ""Um, excuse me sir. The thing is, there's not really anything wrong with the Itchy & Scratchy show, it's as good as ever. But after so many years, the characters just can't have the same impact they once had."" This is a pretty good summary of the gradual decline in quality the Simpsons has been experiencing.<br/><br/>I first saw a teaser ad for The Simpsons movie sometime in late 2005 or early 2006, I believe. I thought right off the bat that it was a bad idea. South Park and Beavis & Butt-Head had churned out movies relatively quickly, when the characters and material were still fresh, which was the wise thing to do. If there was ever a time for a Simpsons movie, it would have been in the mid-to-late 90's.<br/><br/>Nonetheless, I knew I was going to be dragged to the movie by my friends one way or the other. I went hoping for the best, and was even excited that I would at least get to see The Simpsons on the big screen.<br/><br/>So how did things turn out? Well, it at least kept me entertained and involved throughout, and it was better than I expected it to be. It's nowhere near the hilarity of the show at its peak, but far better than the most recent episodes. The first half hour is particularly decent, because it's close to an early Simpsons episode.<br/><br/>While I of course enjoyed the mocking of the US government, I have to admit that I just didn't really care for the ""sealed in a dome"" story and wish they had come up with a different plot. It seemed like they just wanted the most ""huge,"" ""epic"" plot ever, so they came up with the dome thing. But the stories on the show were rarely ""epic."" They were totally asinine and got laughs because of the ridiculous behavior of the characters (like when Homer and Bart make ""garbage angels"" on the floor of their living room). You have to wonder what kind of opportunities they missed by introducing such a gargantuan idea for a plot. Oh well.<br/><br/>The Simpsons movie is an easy and fun watch, but by the time the credits roll you realize how underwhelming it is. Maybe I'm being too hard on it, because my expectations were so high, but dangit's The Simpsons movie, man!! Ah well. It still has its moments. Who can possibly keep a straight face when Moe yells, ""The top of his head is showing! Claw at it!"" Not me.<br/><br/>All in all, while not a classic, The Simpsons movie will probably keep most fans entertained throughout."
"ccole-7","7","1","3","10 August 2007"," Works better as a TV show than a movie
","I want to start off by saying that I did like this movie, and I am a huge fan of The Simpsons. However, the things that have made The Simpsons a great show, and one of the most successful in television history, don't necessarily translate onto the big screen.<br/><br/>The plot, while absolutely hilarious in some scenes, seemed forced in many other scenes, leaving me with a disjointed feeling in the film. From what I understand the script underwent several revisions over a period of few years, so that might explain much of that feeling that I got. It may also be that the writers have been in television for so long that writing a movie script was a little bit more than they could pull off.<br/><br/>With all that said, I did like the movie, just not as much as the show. The animation was sharp, and the characters were true to form. Perhaps though my expectation was set a little bit too high."
"DICK STEEL","10","2","10","25 July 2007"," A Nutshell Review: The Simpsons Movie
","I'm a big, big fan of the Simpsons, and word that the movie version of the hit TV series would be made had been out for the longest time possible. Toying between trying to cast actors in a life-action movie (rumoured at one point to have Bruce Willis playing Homer because of the err, balding pate), and sticking to its 2D version of yellow skin and four fingers on each hand, I'm glad that the movie was done in the latter version, simply because casting will be a nightmare to flesh out the inhabitants of Springfield, and 2D allows for many insane jokes and situations to be played out without reliance on CGI and the likes.<br/><br/>And it paid off big time, and well worth the extremely long wait. While the movie version of the Simpsons might seem like an extended version of a typical animated episode on TV, this is everything you'd come to expect, and more! I won't spoil the movie's plot in my review, but suffice to say our favourite family is back for more madcap adventures, and being in a feature length movie allowed for the characters emote more than what we see on TV. There's some room here for some serious character development, especially Marge, Bart and even Lisa entering a new phase of her life, while Homer is, well, being just Homer.<br/><br/>With plenty of sight gags, inside jokes, not too subtle jabs at the big summer movies this year like Spider-man and Harry Potter, it's incredibly hard not to laugh every few seconds for the keen eyed viewer, or guffaw at the dialogue or classic Simpsons styled comedy we've come to enjoy from the series. The fast and furious nature the laughs get delivered is bound to keep fans delighted, and win over those who are watching the family and the Springfield folks for the very first time. You just can't get enough of the voice talents of Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria, as well as a whole host of cameo voices as they embark on 90 minutes of pure entertainment. If you've just survived a hard day's work, The Simpsons Movie is almost guaranteed to chase those blues away.<br/><br/>Stay throughout the end credits, where you'll be entertained by more clips near the beginning, the middle, and right at the end of the credits roll, played to the tune of some of the most insane songs ever written.<br/><br/>This is the best Simpsons movie... so far! Bring on a sequel already, D'oh!"
"Filvies144","7","2","11","3 October 2015"," Good, but not as good as the old TV show
","Now, I am a fan of the old ones. Not the new ones, but the old ones. But when it comes to a film, almost all jokes and plot have to be similar. That's what best describes this movie. The plot can be strong, like how the people are trapped in a dome, but the humor of it all is like your average episode of the Simpsons. The jokes are mostly good, too. The animation is pretty decent-good, and the character design has improved, but it looks too perfect. Now the developed characters probably have to be Bart and Homer, but the rest is either a comedy relief, a family member that's there since its a Simpsons movie (Lisa, Maggie and Marge.) Now Marge does make Homer change his mind, but she's not very developed and sure Lisa is helping the town, but neither is she. The villain, Russ Cargill is kind of threatening, but in a humorous way and he could've been used better.<br/><br/>So overall, this is a hit and it's good, but it could've been better. I'd actually like the show to end now that it's stale, but they should make another movie. The story is pretty dumb, but so dumb it's funny. This is probably one of the last Simpson thing that kept the good quality. So if you're a fan, this is the film for you, especially if you're a fan of the new ones.<br/><br/>Story: 7/10 Animation: 6.5/10 Characters: 6/10 Overall, 7/10"

","I don't easily laugh during movies, but this movie had so many clever gags, it was almost impossible not to. In fact, most of the audience was regularly laughing throughout the movie - something I haven't seen happen in a very long time.<br/><br/>The storyline basically involves Homer Simpson polluting a community lake and causing the entire city to suffer the consequences. Namely - being shut off from the rest of the world by a giant glass dome.<br/><br/>Yes - it's crazy, but the story is strung together by a million one-liners and gags. They are so imaginative that it's hard not to acknowledge a certain comedic brilliance that went into making this movie.<br/><br/>Even though the movie is simple animation, it is very nicely one. The rich colors, 3-D shadowing and rich visual backgrounds make the movie very visually appealing. I was surprised at how much I ended liking the movie just for the visual scenes alone.<br/><br/>The one thing that did not happen at any time is boredom. Even though some of the jokes didn't work for me, the fast pace and constant action of the story kept me nicely occupied. There was never a moment where I had a chance to stop and think about anything - I was constantly engaged.<br/><br/>Although this type of humor won't be appreciated by everyone, you can get a pretty good idea of what's in store by watching an episode of the Simpsons. If you find anything funny about it, you'll probably greatly enjoy this movie."

It would either be the funniest movie I had ever seen or a total let down. Instead it was neither. It wasn't as funny as the TV show (granted I haven't yet seen any of the episodes of recent seasons), but it was just as entertaining, in other ways.<br/><br/>There is an urgency of plot in this movie that makes it different and more fresh than the TV show. I can't quite put my foot on it. There had been just as much danger in some episodes of the TV show. Homer has gone through this kind of soul-searching before. Springfield has had this much trauma before. (Remember the garbage episode when the whole city moved location?) But for some reason this didn't seem like episode three hundred-whatever-it's-up-to-now. Instead it's as if the whole series had never happened and this movie starts it all over again. Hopefully the series can build on this rather than let it pass."

","I am a die hard Simpsons fan. I have seen every episode, own all the seasons on DVD and the companion books. After all the hype I heard about this movie, all the rewrites to make it just right, I thought it would be great. It was good, but lacking in a lot of ways.<br/><br/>The film focused on the inner family only. The secondary characters, which made the show so funny over the years, were lucky if they got one throw away line. There were a few new characters introduced, but they were so poorly developed that they just took up time and offered little humor.<br/><br/>The movie is mostly about Homer, going through a journey and becoming a better person. This is my biggest complaint. In the movie Homer is a horrible terrible person. This is not how he is supposed to be! People who treasure the old episodes will surely agree that the basis of Homer's character is stupidity, not cruelty. He is supposed to mean well and try to do what is right, but his stupidity gets in the way and leads to many wacky adventures. In the movie he is more mean than stupid. There should be no need for him to realize he is selfish and ruining everyone's lives, because he should never have been written as being so selfish that he is ruining everyone's lives in the first place. Homer is written completely out of character. I hope you followed that. This blunder ruined any sentimentality in the movie.<br/><br/>There were too many ""touching"" moments. They just dragged down the film and I personally don't think anyone changed that much during the movie.<br/><br/>Some people complain that it is an extended episode, but I disagree. It would have been better if it was an extended episode, because the show is really funny. The writers themselves have said that the funniest jokes don't advance the plot, so they should have made a simple plot and filled it out with jokes, jokes, jokes. Instead we get an overly complicated plot with a supposedly sentimental heart that is lacking funny.<br/><br/>There were obviously too many rewrites done. I saw the animatics and trailers and thought they were very funny, but I was unhappy to find all the funny stuff had been written out. This is what I think happened: They were working on this for 7 years and I'm sure the first draft was hilarious, but after they heard the same jokes 40 times the mistakenly thought that they were not funny anymore and replaced them with less funny jokes. This kept happening until they were forced to stop rewriting and they were left with something that had the 60th generation jokes in it. I bet the DVD is going to be loaded with deleted scenes that are better than the movie.<br/><br/>In conclusion, for a movie that assembled the best writing team every to grace television, I would have expected much better. I recommend this movie because I like the the show the Simpsons and the movie is not bad, it is OK."

","I love the show and did not go into the movie thinking it was going to be something wildly spectacular, just a longer and funnier episode . . . . like watching a couple of episodes in a row. Yet I was let down at several levels. First they took no time to give us any additional character development on some of the more reoccurring characters. Amlost devoid of Burns, that was a major problem. More importantly they broke their own canon by not having Ranier Wolfcastle be the Pres vice Arnold (as Wolfcastle is a parody of the A Man). Sadly I laughed only 4 times during the film, which is less than an average episode. Homer got it right at the beginning of the film. We were SUCKERS."

","The Simpsons have reached into every medium - but like so many of the corporate spoofs they lampoon have ended up a victim of their own success. Despite the TV show running on fumes for the last few years, bringing the Simpsons to the cineplex could be seen as the final strangulation of money from a tired cash cow.<br/><br/>A once funny, inventive and fresh show has become a weak pale imitation of itself and despite some occasional flashes of comic absurdity, this movie is largely redundant. It recycles the same rehashed story elements and adds absolutely nothing new or imaginative beyond what a TV episode of the show could say in one fifth of the time.<br/><br/>There are some good moments amongst the 86 minute run time, but you can't help but politely smile rather than laugh at loud at the stale TV fare peddled as a big screen extravaganza.<br/><br/>Some fans will see this movie with yellow-tinted spectacles and defend it as 10/10, must see comedy and a triumphant return to form.<br/><br/>Sadly not."

","Maybe I went into this movie with very high expectations, so it was just alright for me. Not the laugh-out-loud-fest that I thought. I admit I haven't been watching the TV series lately already, so maybe that's part of the reason.<br/><br/>The line at the beginning of the movie says it all so frankly: Why watch a movie that you can watch on TV for free??? It even goes further to call everyone watching a sucker! I think those were the best lines in the whole movie! Hahaha! The humor was not very spontaneous, especially in a lot of parts that dealt with the main plot of how Homer single-handedly wreaked environmental havoc on Springfield and its dire consequences on his family. The Alaska part of the movie was not very productive. I took away a lot of screen time that could've been given to Mr. Burns and Smithers, Maggie's sisters, Apu and the other interesting characters in Springfield itself.<br/><br/>The storyline of Bart was quite dramatic and even touching (ironic, huh? hehe). Marge, Lisa and Maggie act as I knew them, and I liked that. Lisa's really a great quirky little character. However, for me, Homer's character was not very likable in this film, compared to how he was in the TV show. On TV, the tight situations Homer gets into were due to his stupidity and boorishness, which we find cute and charming. But in this movie, he seemed to be uncharacteristically ill-tempered and ill-intentioned. I think this was a major issue in my not liking the movie as much I wanted to. Even the main bone of contention in the plot, the Pig, was just as easily and casually dismissed and forgotten in the end, as it was haphazardly introduced in the beginning."

","Greetings again from the darkness. Homer hits it right on the head just as the movie starts when he stands up and asks ""why would anyone pay to see a movie of something they can watch for free on TV?"". This is just a 2 hour episode. Now, it is funny and most enjoyable to watch, but it really doesn't qualify as movie and it certainly doesn't deserve the Top 250 on this site.<br/><br/>There is the usual convoluted story from creators Matt Groening and James L.

For my money, there was a bit too much Spider-Pig, but I did enjoy the whole dome thing.<br/><br/>Bottom line, this is exactly what we would expect from this franchise ... plenty of funny characters, great lines, social commentary and lots of laughs.

I can't imagine it that it would have taken them any longer than two weeks to write it. Most of the funnier moments have already been shown in the trailers. This is one of my favorite TV shows but as a movie it left me looking for more. It isn't as though they have to surpass the series with some kind of masterpiece, but any fan of the TV show will be hard pressed to say they don't recall several episodes that were funnier than this movie.

","This review assumes you know about the Simpson's TV show. If you don't, then the humor in the movie is probably not going to be appreciated. If you are familiar with Homer, Bart and the whole cast of Springfield then don't expect an extravaganza. Homer sums up my feelings about the movie during the introduction. Since it's one of the better comedic lines, I won't give it away.<br/><br/>The movie fails to be an epic worthy of the big screen. It's an entertaining movie, it just doesn't rise far enough above the weekly TV show to earn a higher rating.<br/><br/>Do expect cursing. Do expect cartoon nudity. Do expect a lot of cameos and reappearances of past characters. Do go expecting to laugh. The problem is that the story is too similar to every other Simpson's episode I've ever seen. Every dramatic device used in the movie has become just a repeat of things we've seen before. In many cases the episodes were better than the movie. It is also disappointing that the trailer reveals too many of the laughs. It would be easier to appreciate some scenes if they had been a surprise.<br/><br/>If you are a big fan of the Simpsons, go see it in the theater.

However, as a massive Simpsons fan, I would have to say that this was very disappointing stuff indeed. When the closing credits came up, I was left sitting in the movie theatre feeling cheated, and yet knowing that I have no right to feel that way as the Simpsons has given me years of pleasure. But this is actually the first time I have had to directly pay for the privilege, and it was simply not worth it. I am amazed to see so many self confessed Simpsons fans saying that they loved this film, because at the heart of classic Simpsons is a great script, one with legendary one-liner quotes, mainly from Homer, that last in the mind for years. And yet this was totally devoid of that fundamental ingredient. By all means go, but please be prepared to be let down"

Will probably deliver the most satisfaction to dedicated fans of the long-running TV show, but the animation and voice work are terrific, and there are consistently funny gags, in-jokes, and parodies.

"Listen_to_the_Law","5","1","4","30 July 2007"," It has it's moments, but it has nothing on the old shows
","Might it be time to retire the Simpsons? The first ever Simpsons TV episode (which aired on the day I was born) would be followed by 400 + more, with lots of laughs following suite. Then, around the year 1998, the show started a downslide, which included poor, cheap humor and a lack of creativity. The newer Simpsons episodes are littered with Homer hurting himself, Homer acting dumb, and toned down side characters. They all miss the charm of the good ol' days. Quite simply, The Simpsons Movie is an 87 minute TV show with hardly any of the layered and creative jokes from the past.<br/><br/>The story (which is tacky, by the way) deals with pollution and the effects of it. After carelessly dumping their pollutants and waste into Lake Springfield, the citizens of Springfield gather for a meeting, led by the usually unnecessary Lisa. However, this meeting is one of the funnier parts of the movie, mainly due to it's similarities with the Simpsons of old. After some debate, the town decides to clean up the lake and change their ways. In the meantime, Homer saves a pig from being killed and names it Spider-pig, complete with it's own ""Spider-pig"" tune. Yawn. Since the pig is a filthy animal, it (and Homer) store all of their waste in a silo about 15 feet all. Well, that silo has to go somewhere. The newly built safe garbage dump has a long line of cars blocking the entrance, so Homer goes to the nearest place to dump the waste- Lake Springfield. It's a funny move, and immediately gets the government's attention. President Arnold Schwarzenegger (yes!) hears the news from the suspicious head of the EPA and foolishly chooses to put a dome over Springfield. This pisses everyone off, and when the town finally discovers it was Homer's doing, they run him and his family out of town. (The Simpsons escape via a sinkhole, which grows and destroys their house in the process.) With Alaska as their destination, the Simpsons seem ready for some more laughs. However, that is not the case.<br/><br/>Many of the jokes in the movie can be seen coming from a mile away. They aren't like the old ones, which are clever and are followed up immediately by another funny joke (hence the term ""layered""). That was one part of what made the Simpsons so great, yet it is completely lacking here. Many of the jokes feature Homer doing something dumb, and unlike the old shows when Homer doing something dumb was fresh and clever, the situation here has Homer doing the dumbest and most childlike things possible. The whole pig storyline blows and reeks of hopelessness (no pun intended). Lisa, who is no better here than she ever has been, falls in love with a fellow green-loving European kid. Next, please. Bart, who always does something humorous and against the rules, spends most of the moviegetting emotional and wishing he had a better dad, thus wanting to live with Flanders? Why? Maggie the baby is the one character here who seems to have the most charm. Her little impulses here and there lighten the monologue and bring a smile to your face.<br/><br/>Like always, The Simpsons benefit greatly from the vast array of characters in their universe. Although short, appearances by Krusty the Clown (with the new ""Clogger"" burger), Mr. Burns (evilly refusing to share electricity), and Mayer Quimby (usual self-centered but good-natured self) brighten the scene and are quite funny. Problem is, there's not enough of them. There's also not enough original creativity. Where is the feud between Mr. Burns and Schwarzenegger? Just imagine if it was revealed that Mr. Burns was behind all the pollution and bad-mouthed Arnold? Just think of all the Terminator references and macho stuff that would happen. What if Mr. Burns released the Hounds on Arnold, and Arnold ran away, yelling ""I'll be back."" That could've been a fun little side story. Sadly, the main story is all that there was.<br/><br/>Now, to be fair- this is The Simpsons, which is one of the funniest shows of all time. The movie knows it's basics, also- there are still the ""shots"" at FOX, the drunk Bart (which is worth a laugh or two), and Homer, who still has some of what made him so great in the start (even though he's a shell of his former self). You'd be a fool to ignore this movie; I recommend seeing it, but just don't get your expectations up too high.<br/><br/>Good) flashes of brilliance, practically every character makes an appearance Bad) clearly not as good as they once were, not enough of the side characters"
"joebloggscity","7","1","4","29 July 2007"," Great fun as the Simpsons transport form the TV to the big screen
","The Simpsons (the movie!) no need for introductions for the first family of TV, they are an institution in themselves and it is safe to say they will be as well known in 50 years time as they are now.<br/><br/>The story is an elongated episode of one of the TV shows, with Homer getting the family into trouble and the whole town has to suffer the consequences from the national government. Jokes come fast and furious as you expect, and there is no way you can't but help but laugh out loud at many points to the antics of Homer Simpson. One major difference to the TV program is that the movie does have some more risqué jokes in it which will shock and amuse in equal measures.<br/><br/>So the question is how will this film fit into the Simpsons' phenomenon? Firstly, I enjoyed it thoroughly, although is no classic, but fits in well with all that has come before. Strange, bewildering and as unbelievable as it always has been, and all the better for it. Could have used most of the support characters more. Mr Burns, the cops and all the others were hardly in it except bits and bobs which was a shame.<br/><br/>Regardless, a good time for all and will definitely go down well with hardcore Simpsons aficionados."

","I was skeptical when I went in to it, but it is truly the best animated movie I have ever seen! After Homer accidentally pollutes the river causing an environmental disaster, Springfield is enclosed in a giant dome and taken off all maps. The townspeople go after Homer who escapes with the family to Alaska. Now my advice is to not watch the trailers too much or avoid them all together because some of the best jokes are in them so I knew what was coming. The movie is a lot more adult than the TV show but really its not that bad. There are brief scenes of Bart's genitalia but it is VERY crudely drawn, the kind you see drawn on seats at schools. Another scene where Otto is smoking a bong but it is short. The movie never slows down, I expect it would of been even better if I wasn't sick when I saw it."

""The Simpsons"" is arguably one of the best television shows ever created. Even the new seasons can bring some chuckles. Now I must say, if you don't know anything about The Simpsons, then the movie won't be as effective if you were a fan. I can say that fans will be really pleased and satisfied.<br/><br/>This movie will make you laugh-out-loud and chuckle. Sure, this movie isn't going to win any Oscars but the film is really entertaining and that's the only thing that matters. The plot isn't that great but who cares? It's about the jokes in here. We don't care about the plot. Even Bart shows some nudity and some other jokes in the film are surprisingly vulgar, which makes me say that it's not always kid-friendly.<br/><br/>Every character has a moment to shine. How could they fit every character (or most character) in the mere 80 minutes? I don't know but they did it. I also liked the cameos and spoofs in the film. Although there are many jokes in the film, there are some quiet and sad scenes, which, surprisingly, are really lovely.<br/><br/>If you want an entertaining film, here you go. If you want a film with a great story and has this moral in the end, stay away. It's not trying to be cutesy and just for the kids to enjoy. There is some adult humor and everyone will laugh and have the time of their lives. It's worth your money. Trust me."

","Y'know, this is a pretty tough movie to review, for the simple fact I;m trying to figure out if it met, exceeded or even fell short of my expectations, and I'm really not entirely sure which. Let's think of the positive first of all; okay, it's funny. Sure it's funny; they've been doing that shtick so long that it would be impossible for it to not be funny, and they've stuck to the course and given us a bunch of gags that hit the spot, so all's well there. And sure, the plot's okay, as far as it's something good to hang the jokes off, but like quite a number of reviewers, I did end up thinking, ""Is that all there is?"" Naturally the film focused on the core characters we know and love, yet I found myself disappointed they didn't stretch any of the other characters particularly far - I think the TV show has possibly spoiled us in that regard. The question is, could it be watched again, like the best eps of the TV show (and here I include Monorail and my personal favourite, for reasons that almost certainly don't make sense, the one with Mr Bergstrom in it), and the answer is ""almost"", because I don't think it sustains interest over its full running time. Nevertheless, I'm going to give it an eight because it hit the spot often enough, and gives enough reasons to remind you why these characters are both watchable and likable, to warrant it. If you're expecting the moon on a stick, you won't get it, but if you're expecting something other than the moon on a stick, say, for example, the Simpsons, then you won't be wholly disappointed.<br/><br/>HJ"

","Ten years in the making and finally Americas number one family are on the big screen but with mixed reviews aplenty is this animated feature any good? Well casual fans should love it and it is very funny but die hards will probably be a little disappointed but they are probably being too picky. With just an hour and a half and a cast of hundreds a lot of your favourite characters don't even get a look in, so this really is all about the principle characters of Homer, Marge, Bart, Lisa and Maggie. The story is simple enough Homer causes a disaster and then has to fix it, it's a no brainer but its not really about the story that is just there to hang the gags from and they do come thick and fast, spiderpig and the naked skateboarding are classics and remind you of the days when the television show was at its peak and I think that is what will make people believe this film is brilliant. After 400 episodes and a few dips in the level of writing its just good to see the characters being funny again, it's a welcome return to form. But it can at times feel like three good episodes stitched together and that is maybe why this transition to the cinema screen is not as successful as everyone at first thought. It's funny and it's entertaining but don't expect too much and you won't be too disappointed, just enjoy this film for what it is and have a laugh."
"hereontheoutside","7","1","4","27 July 2007"," Surprisingly plot driven, unsurprisingly, very funny...
","Eighteen years after The Tracy Ullman Show the longtime creators of The Simpson's cannot be expected to create an hour and a half of brilliance when they've only tried this plot in 22 minute slots. The film reads much like the plot of every Simpson's episode you've ever seen (saying 'I've never seen an episode right now would be un-American). Homer does something that creates a problem, it tests his family's love for him, he does something ever dumber to prove his love and everyone learns something. This time Homer dumps his pig feces silo into the lake and creates major problems for Springfield. The plot, surprisingly, holds out for the duration of the film, it's nothing special, but it doesn't fail like most adult- cartoon films (See Family Guy: The Stewie Griffin Story or Aqua Teen Hunger Force Colon Movie Film for Theaters). Best of all the film remains consistently funny. The first half hour is a non-stop barrage of jokes (including possibly the greatest Simpson's song ever, ""Spider- Pig), after that the jokes thin in an attempt to keep the plot from treading water. But it holds up. In typical Simpson's fashion there are a few guest stars in the film, but they keep it to a minimum so they film doesn't begin to feel more like a reminiscence of the last eighteen seasons. It's more or less a lengthy episode; they don't even really abuse their ability to do things that they are unable to on TV. A little bit of enhanced animation, a 'god-damn,' a middle finger and Bart's penis sufficed. It is easily the best of the new adult-cartoon features that are appearing. And it's good enough to keep the audience excited over the prospect of a sequel, which is all but promised during the closing credits of the film."
"chaoticcranium","8","1","4","27 July 2007"," It didn't suck! The world isn't over!
","This review was designed so it would be spoiler-free, but sometimes I might give things away out of carelessness, so I'll put the warning just in case. And now to rate a movie that should have been done 15 years ago: <br/><br/>I've listened to non-stop complaining over how the past 5 or so seasons of the Simpsons suck and how this movie will continue along that vein and spell the end for the series. I really hope this movie will shut those people up. Yes, I agree that there is a notable distinction between the current Simpsons and the classic Simpsons we all know and love, but the new episodes are still pretty good (especialy the most recent season - ""24 Minutes"" and ""Homerazzi"" were awesome) and better than most of the drivel on prime time television today. Moreover, the Simpsons movie is - surprise, surprise - quite a good movie that at its high points matches the humor and wit of old school Simpsons (although I must emphasize that it doesn't keep up this momentum throughout the movie). In short, I don't think the Simpsons are going to be booed off the stage just yet.<br/><br/>The best parts of the movie are the first 20-30 minutes and the last 10 minutes. Starting with the most epic Itchy and Scratchy cartoon you'll ever see, I guarantee that you'll be laughing heartily during this time, only pausing to suck a sufficient amount of oxygen from the air so you don't collapse. You'll definitely feel the energy, especially if you're in a theater jam packed with Simpsons aficionados (gotta love opening night!).<br/><br/>The humor is light slapstick humor, satire and biting humor, and visual gags very much in the vein of the show itself. The movie gets a bit risqué (although nowhere near as close as Family Guy and its brethren) - you might see a little bit more of Bart than you've ever wanted to see and I recall a rather disturbingly amusing Bambi allusion - but its all done sufficiently tastefully and these scenes are guaranteed to make you laugh (then again, I love Family Guy and American Dad to death, so I might be the wrong person to ask about this). While the jokes are constantly good, however, there are not many jokes that are brilliant enough to be ""quotes that you will use for the next 20 years"" unlike classic Simpsons. It also could have done more to allude to inside things that happened in the series to keep us old fans happy. Nevertheless, much like classic Simpsons episodes which we've all seen several million times by now, I feel that I could watch this movie several million times and it would still be fresh, although I certainly wouldn't want to try that for $10 a pop. The animation is ""in glorious 2-D"", which is kinda refreshing since every animated movie seems to be in 3-D nowadays and the animation is very high quality and pleasing to the eye.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, the momentum slows down near the middle when they get to the heart of the plot. The plot itself is meh-ish, and I also feel that the quality of the jokes fell at this point, only picking up near the end. One thing that also kind of slowed down the humor was the promotional trailers for the movie. I wish I could have unseen them, because knowing many of the jokes before they happen is really annoying (even though many of the trailers don't give you the joke in its entirety).<br/><br/>By the end, you might find yourself thinking that you've just watched a very long (4 times as long to be precise), well-animated, $10+ Simpsons episode with a rather epic beginning. In terms of a movie, though, its going to feel kind of short and it might dash your expectations if you're going to place it on a pedestal. On the other hand, if you're one of those prophets of doom I mentioned above, and you're not completely stubborn, you might be compelled to refrain from saying ""Worst. Movie. Ever."" and save it for something that's deserving like the Transformers movie or something. It's not perfect, but I think most people - even the hardcore fans - will be satisfied with this movie.<br/><br/>Notable Observations: - If you're thinking that every staple character will appear (even in the background), think again. Off the top of my head, I definitely did not see Lionel Hutz (although, I think I remember hearing that his character was retired for some reason), Troy McClure, Ranier Wolfcastle (I guess he was too busy being his real life counter part as the president), Duffman, and worst of all, Sideshow Bob.<br/><br/><ul><li>Speaking of villains, Mr. Burns pretty much gets no screen time. Although, the two scenes where he does speak are probably the two best scenes in the movie IMO. Some other semi-majorish characters do appear in the film but don't really say anything, like Principal Skinner and Groundskeeper Willie.</li></ul><br/><br/><ul><li>Don't miss the credits! I won't say anything, but I'll just not so subtly hint that a special someone has a word for you.</li></ul>"

","I won't bore you with plot twists, who dies, was the plot driven by a higher, more meaningful interest. I'm here to defend the movie against the Simpson-freaks (with all due respect and admiration) who WILL bash this movie. I saw this movie at the midnight showing last night. I am a Simpson fan who agrees that the show has dropped in quality ever so slightly in the last 10 years. This movie is also not as good as my imagined built-up-over-18-years 1.5 hours of orgasmic laughter I unreasonably expected. Having said that they didn't wreck the franchise. It was funny. It was really funny. The Homer/Marge love scene is a classic right up there with some of the best scenes ever of the show. The first 10 minutes of the movie were some of the best 10 minutes ever put together. Where the movie lost me - and I understand the reasons - was that it had to provide continuity of plot. To do that there had to be entire scenes that weren't even funny. I expected to urinate myself with laughter for 1.5 hours, but instead there were lulls as long as 10-15 minutes that were not funny at all to simply advance the plot. That was a disappointment. I also was a little disappointed that the purpose of the entire Simpsons empire is to entertain and subvert. Entertain, we got. Subvert, we could have used more of, especially in today's America and world. I gave the movie a 9. Stick around for the credits! Some good gags."

","The actual plot does not involve Homer dumping waste from the Nuclear Power Plant into the lake, losing his job, forcing the evacuation of Springfield. If you go see the movie, you will see Springfield on the verge of an environmental catastrophe. Homer then, as usual, forgets to pay attention and adds ""the hair that broke the camel's back."" After the environmental meltdown, Springfield is covered with a huge dome (which is visible in the trailer countless times). The rest of the movie is Springfield dealing with being enclosed, the usual Simpsons' side trips and humor, and Homer trying to redeem himself in the eyes of Springfield and, more importantly, in family's eyes. All in all, I'd say if you like the TV show, then the movie will be right up your alley. It is an over-sized doze of what I love to see. But it doesn't try to carry on for two and a half hours like most blockbusters today. 8/10 stars."

","Going into the movie, I really didn't know what to expect.

There's an epic feel to it.<br/><br/>Second, and more importantly, there was a lot of filler. But boy, what filler it is - I think I laughed at every single joke.

"evilmaleman","8","1","4","27 July 2007"," Everything A Simpsons Fan Could Hope For
","As a fan my whole life of the Simpsons I think they did a good job. Not great or amazing but good. The comedy was great and unlike the last 8 seasons it had a plot. Now that they were not on TV they had breathing room to do the more vulgar jokes (as my mom would say). Although sometimes funny, these jokes felt out of place and thrown so it could get a PG-13 rating as compared to the rest of the 18 seasons. That aside it was what the simpsons movie should have been, jokes about fox, celeberity guests, itchy and scratchy, and showcasing everyone of your favorite character in the Simpsons world.<br/><br/>Also the last bit with tom hanks was the funniest thing i have seen in a long time ""If you see me on the street, leave me be."""
"iscbrooks","9","1","4","26 July 2007"," Extremely disappointing, funniest movie I've ever seen
","This movie is hilarious. The trailers ruined a few of the jokes, so I'm not sure how funny those were, but rest assured that you will likely be laughing for most of the movie, included many cases where you're still laughing when the next great joke appears. This was to be expected.<br/><br/>However, there are also problems you should be aware of. Particularly, the movie's small cast, by which I mean the fact that most of the minor characters Simpsons fans have come to love have at most a one-liner, sometimes not even that. And for those who haven't heard yet, Sideshow Bob was completely cut. Homer's pet pig in the beginning of the movie has about as much screen time as the rest of the minor characters. The only exceptions are Ned Flanders, who has a role in Bart's subplot, Grandpa, with a role in the first ten minutes, and two one-time characters, Collin, involved in Lisa's subplot, and Albert Brooks as the villain.<br/><br/>Another problem is the pandering to non-Simpsons fans, specifically teenagers. There are numerous incidents of crude, often sexual humor, which are not funny to any Simpsons fan/person who's grown up. This includes such scenes as Bart's streaking scene, which was influenced by Austin Powers. If you thought Austin Powers was funny, feel free to ignore this comment.<br/><br/>The last problem is the plot. To justify a movie, they feel the need to have an elaborate and epic plot, and predictably ended up with a silly plot that doesn't really aid the movie (which is mostly composed of unrelated gags).<br/><br/>Why do I give it a 9/10 anyway? Because it's so funny, there are so many laugh-out-loud moments, that those problems are irrelevant. More use of side-characters would have been liked, but the movie doesn't need them to be hilarious. There are numerous crude and unfunny jokes, but that comes from a pie of so many jokes that there are plenty of hysterical ones to go around. The plot is superfluous, but not detrimental. In short, it's still the funniest movie around.<br/><br/>Note: One more problem - I dislike the use of Maggie. Ever since she shot Mr. Burns, it's gone to the writers' heads. In this movie, they seem to have forgotten that she's a baby, and have expanded upon the end of ""Papa's Got a Brand New Badge"". Maybe they're trying to mimic ""Family Guy""; I don't know. But I want the baby back!"
"leesha_lou","9","1","4","26 July 2007"," Finally, something the old-school fans will appreciate!
","I have been an absolute die hard Simpsons fan since the very first season. It became an every week thing, getting excited about new episodes, and most famously ""the couch bits"". But within the past 5 years or so, the Simpsons took a bit of a nose dive, so much so I found myself avoiding new episodes at all costs. It made me cringe. When I heard the announcement that a movie was to be made, my first reaction was, great! Then followed by, ""Oh no, this could be awful"". I avoided all articles, adverts, everything that had anything to do with the movie! I wanted to go in with a clear and open mind. I WAS NOT disappointed. The Simpsons took a u-turn and went back to what they are known and well loved for. The jokes come with ease, unlike the newer episodes, in which the try so hard to be funny. The characters stay true to their form, and is well worthy of being up there with some of the great animated features of all time. Sure it isn't the best Simpsons ever written, but it is just so fantastic to see them back where the belong!"
"powerfull_jedi","9","1","4","26 July 2007"," The Simpons get a little more edgy, will this affect the show?
","In a time where CG movies are all the rage, 20th Century Fox takes a bold step with The Simpsons in their feature film. For those who don't know, unless you've been living under a rock for the past 20 years, this average suburban family started off as a series of sketches from the Tracy Ullman Show, and soon it started it's own TV show and has lasted for over 18 years, having just ended it's 18th season just a couple of weeks ago. The Simpsons helped establish cartoons as suitable entertainment for teen and older audiences, in a way helped the creation of TV shows such as it's current rival Family Guy and the edgy South Park. The Simpsons started out with Bartmania as Bart Simpson was a vital character during the earlier seasons, the show often dealt with several issues, but after a while it's mostly focused on their zany antics. But frankly for a time, The Simpsons lost some of their magic, and never as bold as say, Family Guy. This movie was in the making for a while and I saw it with little or no expectations, I had no idea what the story was about, even the trailers didn't have anything solid, perhaps that was a good idea, because the movie's pretty darn funny. Make no mistake, The Simpsons Movie is extremely funny and it's pretty bold, so bringing kids is most likely not a good idea. Everything is almost perfect in this movie, from the awesome soundtrack to it's jokes and the plot. The plot could've been just a bigger episode, but it turns out to be something really big. It starts with a typical day at church with The Simpsons arriving late to mourn the loss of a rock band who died while performing in a nearby lake, all of a sudden Granpa gets a vision of what seems just random ramblings, and in the first part of the movie, Marge tries to piece together what Grandpa said, while Bart and Homer goof around and Lisa tries to talk with people to raise awareness about the pollution in the lake and falls in love with a young Irish boy who just moved into Springfield, it feels like a typical Simpsons episode except that in one truth-or-dare game between Bart and Homer sets off a colossal plot that goes up all the way to the White House(with Arnold Scwarznegger as the President). What follows are 87 minutes of non-stop humor with some great jokes here and there, some of them are very edgy even for The Simpsons standards(Homer giving the finger to an angry mob, Lisa violently slugging Bart and Bart himself skateboarding naked, so parents,it might not be a good idea to bring kids and an administration willing to blow up an entire city just because the pollution levels are high). Most of the characters are all here, they do their part well. The animation is crisp and very high-budget feel, with stuff that you'd rarely see on the TV show(though some nods from an early Simpsons episode appear, hint: it's involves jumping off a cliff). The humor is top notch, though some jokes are either not fully understood unless you have a huge knowledge of American politics or just some roll-your-eyes non-subtle jokes, but all in good fun. What's left now is how people will look at the show, sometimes a movie overwhelms a TV show to the point that it makes it hard for the show to go for the same heights. But the show's been around for 18 years, I'm guessing it'll last a little longer. If you want a all-out action packed animated adult comedy, look no further then this movie, and parents, if you plan on seeing this movie tell your kids to go watch Surf's Up while you see this one. Well-worth the time."

","I never liked this movie! I know they had to make a movie for the sake of pop culture but why? The movie has three offensive elements which are when Marge says ""Will somebody just throw the god#### bomb!"", Homer flips an angry mob off with both hands, and Bart exposes his genitalia. The movie is so juvenile in writing (a naughty 7 year old could've wrote this) and it's a waste of the Simpsons writers' ideas. The art and animation is stunning though. This movie has lame jokes and a forgettable score. The Simpsons Movie is really not for kids, but it is not for adults neither. I hope immature kids enjoy this crap.

That's besides the point though. I found it really strange, that some Critics gave this movie a C Rating. The jokes in this movie are enough to serve about 30 regular movies. And still make all of them better than average. It was a really great experience to see this film at the movies. Everybody loved it and most people were laughing throughout the movie because there are rarely more than 15 seconds between major jokes. I wont even start with all the little subtle things. I can really and honestly recommend this movie to EVERYBODY. A cinema full of entertained people even furthers the great experience. I guess it won't be so extremely good an experience when the movie comes out on DVD and you watch it alone at home. The movie is enjoyable even if you don't like the TV Show that much. (Which I don't really anymore..) The movie is really great and doesn't have even one weak moment. ***Possible Spoiler starts here*** The only thing that I found strange is that everything was dumped in the lake and nothing happened. Then Homer dumps a few pounds of Pigpoo in there and suddenly Springfield is the most polluted City in the entire US?? I know it's a comedy. But the movie had like 150 writers or so.. They could have come up with something better."

Would Hollywood butcher our precious family that we all know and love? Would it look and sound different? would the storyline be as good to that of the episodes? Well it was not butchered by all means. But there are noticeable differences between the looks of the film but not so much the voices of our favorite 4 fingered friends.

For The Simpsons Movie I thought because it's one of the funniest and longest running shows I've ever seen on t.v., that the movie itself would be 2 hrs or 2hr. 30 or something like that. But overall it definitely was worth the ticket. Bart Simpson, Homer, everyone. They were all classic. Comparing it to Family Guy, and I'm sure a lot of others may not agree with me on this but I personally feel, and again this is just me, that Simpsons is a wee bit funnier.

My wife noticed that I became emotional during the movie... I told her that the movie reminded me of my life, growing up in the USA. How Homer treated Bart was very, very similar to how my dad treated me during my younger days. I told my wife that this movie reminded me of my past life in the USA. --- Nowadays, my dad (living in Seattle, WA USA) stays close to me, even though I am now living in Manila, Philippines.<br/><br/>Other than that, my wife said I act like Homer Simpson. Well, I don't think I do, but she said I do.<br/><br/>Considering I was living my 1st 35 years in the USA, I was telling my wife that the attitudes expressed in the Simpsons movie is very close to reality in America. The movie is intended on being funny, it's really a reality to those that live in the USA. I've lived in Anchorage, Alaska, USA, too. My friends and relatives thought all of the movie was made up, but I told them that I remember the announcement, many years ago, that the Simpsons cartoon will be made into a movie.<br/><br/>Overall, I don't recommend this movie for young children because of the drama within.

They are killed when the pollution in the lake eats away at their barge, causing it to sink. At the funeral, Grampa has a vision, but only Marge pays attention to it. Lisa and Colin, an Irish boy, hold a seminar entitled ""An Irritating Truth"", where they convince the town to clean up the lake by putting the same polluted water in their glasses. Meanwhile, Homer dares Bart to skateboard nude to Krusty Burger and back, but Bart is caught by Chief Wiggum. Ned Flanders comforts Bart after being humiliated, since Homer lets Bart get blamed for the incident and then adopts a pig. He keeps the pig's waste in an overflowing silo, which horrifies Marge, who tells Homer to dispose of it safely. While waiting at the dump, Homer decides on a quicker means of disposal and dumps the silo into the lake, polluting it severely and mutating a squirrel. Nearby, Flanders and Bart bond during a hike and discover the squirrel, and it is captured by the ""EPA"". Russ Cargill, head of the EPA, tells President Schwarzenegger, that Springfield is extremely polluted and the government must take drastic action. Under the President's orders, the EPA places Springfield in a giant glass dome, cutting off the town's supplies from the outside world.<br/><br/>The police discover Homer's silo in the lake, and an angry mob approaches the Simpsons' home, setting it on fire. The family escapes the dome through a sinkhole in Maggie's sandbox and flees to Alaska. Seeing the dome begin to crack and realising the people of Springfield will escape, Russ Cargill manipulates the President into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see a television advertisement in which Tom Hanks promotes a new Grand Canyon, and Marge realises that they are planning to bomb Springfield. Marge and the kids decide to save the town, but Homer refuses to help the people that tried to kill him. His family abandons him and returns to rescue Springfield. After a visit with a mysterious Inuit shaman, Homer has a vision and reaches an epiphany: to save himself, his family, and Springfield and he returns. Meanwhile, Marge, Lisa, Maggie, and Bart are captured by Cargill and returned to Springfield. Cargill tells the people of Springfield that the town will be destroyed. A helicopter arrives and lowers a bomb. Meanwhile, Homer climbs the outside of the dome and descends knocking the escaping townspeople and bomb off the rope.

","I entered the cinema hall with high expectations, after all i have never been disappointed by the Simpsons(perhaps a teeny bit last coupla seasons). It started of well, and it made me laugh, but was this the experience i expected? No. It felt like an overstretched simpsons episode trying to be a movie, and that's what it is. The regular clichés are there - perhaps i've seen too many in the episodes that it felt like it fell short. There were, of course, scenes that were meant to be overdone, but this time they may have overdone the overdoing. <br/><br/>*************very minor spoilers**************<br/><br/>The Bart - Homer 'falling off' (which isn't the exact term to be used, but i am) stretched for a bit long esp. Bart spending all that time with the Flanders' instead of being up to no good. But the biggest letdown was that quite a bit of the movie the simpsons spend away from Springfield - and yeah, that is important to the story, but i would have loved to see the whole story set in springfield, more of the springfield (elemantry) school and Bart's activities. More of 'goody good' Lisa and and less or none of 'Colin and Lisa', and i definitely missed Homer spending some quality time at Moe's. The Disney sattire in the bedroom in Alaska was good but not as funny as it intended to be, and so were a few gags, and really good moments like 'spider pig' and Homer using the demolition ball crane I had already seen in trailers... <br/><br/>********************************************<br/><br/>According to me, if you're a fan n regular simpsons watcher, watch it but don't expect much, you will laugh but not too hard. And the others - if u've seen a few episodes and enjoy this type of comedy that ranges from the satirical to physical humor, well, go ahead, 'cos as u must have heard, an episode of simpsons(even an overstretched one) is any day better than most movie comedies..."

"MovieAddict2016","8","1","5","6 August 2007"," It feels right.
","What struck me most about ""The Simpsons Movie"" - which has been in development for almost an entire decade - is that it really does *feel* like a piece of the past. During the mid-to-late-'90s, a lot of famous cartoon shows were getting big screen adaptations - and the style and scope of these cinematic efforts were all quite similar. ""The Simpsons Movie"" fits in well - similar to the ""South Park"" motion picture, it builds on the strength of the television show while using improved animation, a bigger story, and raunchier jokes.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" isn't brilliant, and one can't help but imagine that a feature film made some time around the show's 5th and 6th seasons would have been far funnier, but it *is* a very good movie and it's also a lot better than any recent seasons of the show (which have been in gradual decline for quite some time). One thing that the show has done recently is focus less on the actual characters - Homer has just turned into a slapstick buffoon, whereas in the earlier seasons he was a more realistic idiot who just got into funny predicaments. The movie is more in-tune with the older version of Homer - he does incredibly idiotic things, but the film focuses on the emotions of the character as well. Ditto for Bart - perhaps the show's most emotionally underdeveloped character finally gets some emphasis.<br/><br/>The film is very entertaining and short enough that it doesn't outstay its welcome. But it does have flaws - it feels rather bloated, and the producers admirably try to include most of the characters from the TV show, but at a certain point this means focusing less on more interesting and consistent show regulars such as Mr. Burns and Smithers (who are woefully neglected for most of the movie and really only have one funny scene - during the credits!).<br/><br/>You can tell this is a movie and not just an expanded episode of the TV show - it definitely *feels* like a blockbuster adaptation and you can also feel the long wait for this movie - it's truly shocking that it's taken them almost 20 years to bring a movie to the big screen given the huge, huge success of the TV show and merchandising profits over the years.<br/><br/>The good news is that they didn't fail - it's a funny, entertaining movie and does justice to the show (even the earlier seasons). The thing is, it's hard to say whether a 5th/6th season era movie would have been better, because that early on in the show the producers might have felt rushed to deliver a film and the result could have actually ended up harming the show's reputation early on if it had failed. I do think it's a good thing that they waited this long to bring a movie to the big screen - and by waiting long enough and really developing the film over the years and investing time into the project, they've delivered a movie that's funnier than most recent seasons of the show - *and* contains more emotional resonance than I've seen on the show in over ten years.<br/><br/>This is definitely one to see at least once on the big screen and later on once it reaches DVD. You may walk away feeling a bit underwhelmed given the near-20-years it's taken for the film to hit, or you may exit the theater with some fan gripes of your own, but I think it's safe to say that if you're a fan of the show - especially the older seasons - you'll at least walk away feeling somewhat satisfied. It may not be a great movie but it's a highly entertaining, very funny one - and, perhaps most importantly, it's not a disgrace to the legacy of the TV show by a long shot."

","What can I say? The Simpons Movie delivered...<br/><br/>At a laugh out loud gag rate of about four per minute, it is easily the funniest movie since Airplane. Homer was as aggressively stupid and a man can be without being institutionalized (actually, he was once, in the series). At one time or another, every member of his family has incited the entire town to mob violence and this movie gives us that and more.<br/><br/>Albert Brooks (Dr. Scorpio and Fat Camp facilitator) is back as an EPA official. The character is an obvious slap at the Bush administration (a wealthy man who turns to public service and screws that up). He is intense, dishonest and brutal.<br/><br/>Homer is the most compelling character in this movie. Spider-pig is a hoot (wait through the credits for the choral version). There is a brief (very) moment of dark soberness, much like in A Goofy Movie. It passes quickly to a dynamite hallucination sequence.<br/><br/>Overall, as a lifelong fan, I give it a nine because there are few tens; but, it is well worth the five hundred or so dollars that it takes to bring the family to the movies these days..."

","With an extended running time of one hour and twenty-six minutes and a wide screen ration of 2:35 instead of the usual 1.33:1, ""The Simpsons Movie"" is longer and bigger than the average series episode to be surebut is it funnier? Well, not quite. That's a caveat I feel obliged to offer for those expecting this to be the laugh-riot sensation of all time. It isn't. Still, compared to most of the big screen comedies that have come our way this season, ""The Simpson Movie"" is one heck of a funny and entertaining movie - provided you don't go into it expecting more than the movie itself can reasonably deliver.<br/><br/>The plotting, which is normally pretty freeform and surrealistic to begin with, has been ratcheted up even further in that direction for the movie. The story has Homer causing a major environmental catastrophe in the town of Springfield when he thoughtlessly dumps a massive container of pig manure in the local lake, turning it into a sludgy toxic swamp. To deal with this emerging national threat, President Schwarzenegger has a huge glass dome placed over the city, trapping the understandably irate citizenry inside. There's no point in revealing anything more about the storyline except to say that it is up to Homer to save the day, which, of course, he does, in his own inimitable way.<br/><br/>Fans of the series will be happy to know that ""The Simpsons Movie"" effortlessly captures the manic energy, sophisticated satire and devil-may-care spirit that have been its hallmarks from the very beginning. Homer's good-natured bumbling, Marge's exasperated pragmatism, Lisa's unquenchable optimism, and, of course, Bart's fresh-faced mischievousness are all on full display in the movie (along with something else of Bart's that is very much on display as well). The other favorites who show up on screen include the perennial toddler, Maggie, Grampa Simpson, Ned Flanders, Mr. Burns, Millhouse, Krusty the Clown and others too numerous to mention.<br/><br/>A team of well over a dozen writers - headed by series creators Matt Groening and James L. Brooks - has come up with some hilarious situations and one-liners, enough, in fact, to compensate for the very few ideas or jokes that flame out or misfire. The zinger-to-dud ratio is one of the best we've encountered in quite some time at the movies, though it's not as high, perhaps, as the best work in the series. As with most feature-length comedies, the concept does feel a little stretched at times and the humor itself runs a trifle thin. Still, with this much talent plugging away at the movie, it would be impossible for it to miss or disappoint its fans in any major way. And, of course, there's the instantly familiar and outstanding voice work from regulars Dan Castellaneta, Julie Kavner, Nancy Cartwright, Yeardley Smith, Harry Shearer and Hank Azaria to get us into the spirit of the enterprise.<br/><br/>The animators have chosen not to tamper too much with the look of the film for its big screen presentation. There may be a bit more elaborate movement in some of the shots, but, for the most part, this is the same uncluttered, two-dimensional Simpsonian world familiar to us from the series.<br/><br/>Indeed, the defining philosophy of those who made the film seems to be ""Why mess with a sure thing?"", an approach that can be both a strength and a weakness depending on how one looks at it. For unlike the ""South Park"" movie, which used its jump to the big screen to expand the scope of its vision and carry the series to a new level, ""The Simpsons Movie"" feels more like an extended version of a single episode, simply blown up to a more impressive size and length. Thus, those looking for this to be the best and greatest ""Simpson"" episode ever may find themselves disappointed with what they find here. Ditto for those who expect it to provide something different from what they've already seen on TV. However, those who just want a few good laughs at the expense of everyone's favorite lovably dysfunctional adult and his wise guy progeny will have a rollicking good time at the movie."

","I love the Simpsons, but the TV series was starting to lose me with the new episodes. I was hoping this movie wasn't going to be anything like them, but it clearly was. The plot was pretty pointless, whereas the episodes really had more heart into it. Many characters are underused, including Mr Burns who would have made a great villain (don't ignore the formula!), and I just feel that the jokes were too forced. I barely laughed out loud, but the kids in the theater will laugh at anything remotely funny. That whole spider pig thing was really dumb in my opinion, and I'm sorry but Homer acts more stupid now than he did before, which was a stupid but smart and funny as well. Only absolute die hard fans will love this movie; for everyone else, stick with the memories of the early seasons."
"castortroy99","3","1","5","31 July 2007"," Disappointed
","I couldn't have been more disappointed with the movie. Krusty, Apu, Smithers, Wiggum, Millhouse, Nelson, Ol' Gill, Mr Burns, Skinner, Moe -- where were all these characters?? I thought a Simpsons movie would have a great background story on some of these characters. Instead we get 50% Homer, 25% Bart, 5% Marge, Lisa and Maggie and 5% Flanders and Grandpa. The side characters, who make the show in my mind, were badly underused. Apu was in about 2 scenes. No Gill. No Fat Tony. No Hutz. I don't even recall a scene featuring Millhouse. Zzzzzzz.<br/><br/>Then the plot...could they have made a more ""Hollywood-ized"" plot? It reminded me of a Armageddon movie gone bad. Watching the previews, I thought they were attempting to parody those terribly over-hyped summer action movies --- much to my dismay, there was no parody involved.<br/><br/>How about using the much extra time (compared to an episode) to get a more ""behind-the-scenes"" look at the characters? What would be funnier than seeing a Nelson family reunion? Or what Moe does in the mornings before the bar opens? Or how Krusty winds down in the evenings? Nothing of that nature was even sniffed at. Instead of a constant barrage of explosions and throw-away jokes, couldn't they have went back in time or in the future? What was a guy like Quimby or Wiggum like in the past? How's a guy like Barney handle old age in the future? So many hilarious things they could have done...instead we were subjected to your typical summer Hollywood action flick.<br/><br/>Wait for the DVD. Booooring! JD"
"moutonbear25","8","1","5","29 July 2007"," The Simpsons' Giant Leap
","It has been eighteen years since America's ultimate nuclear family introduced themselves to the television-watching world. Their popularity and critical favour have waffled in waves over the near-two-decade span of the series' life, but they have also become pop culture icons and a source of constant comfort and laughter through widespread syndication and DVD sales. And so the question I've heard tossed around the most leading up to the release of their first foray in the land of the big screen is why did they wait so darn long to get here? The reason doesn't matter really; it's the sense of entitlement Simpson fans have regarding the series and these characters that is somewhat frightful in its level of expectation. (Although if you're interested to know, series creator Matt Groening and creative mainstay, James Brooks, wanted to place all the focus necessary on perfecting the television series without having anything take away from that. When they finally decided to go forward, close to the turn of the century, there were disputes over final script approval.) The pressure alone to deliver a hilarious feature that will appease the fans, the masses and the studio execs alike would be enough reason for me to never consider making it. Yet THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is finally here and from the moment little Ralph Wiggum pops out of the 20th Century Fox tag to trumpet triumphantly with the tune we all know well, it is clear that the whole ""Simpsons"" clan is happy to have arrived. As someone who would subscribe to a 24-hour ""Simpsons"" channel if one existed, I am just as happy to see them too.<br/><br/>The ""Simpsons"" folks know this is big. They almost seem to acknowledge it right away when the film opens with the biggest ""Itchy & Scratchy"" cartoon ever created. Itchy the mouse and Scratchy the cat get on about their usual, violent antics, but they do so while taking the first steps on the moon. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is one small step for Springfield and one giant leap for television animated series everywhere. What does a leap of this size entail exactly? Rather than string four episodes together, ""Simpsons"" creators opted to tell a story that was too big to encompass on a small screen. In doing so, there are both elements lost and gained. The expansion means longer stretches between punch lines, which can be frustrating at first, as you want director, David Silverman (a one-time regular director of the series and former creative player at Pixar) to pick up the pace. Also, the story itself is much more linear than most of the television episodes that find Homer & company starting in one place and ending up somewhere entirely unexpected by episode's end. (A recent example would be beginning with weaning Maggie off her pacifier, which leads to Homer taking sleeping pills, which finds him causing injury to all of Springfield's fire department and ultimately ending with corruption in volunteer fire fighter work.) The movie follows the Simpson family as they once again find themselves the target of all of Springfield's animosity after Homer commits a selfish blunder to eclipse the hundreds of blunders that came before that. Once the film finds its pace though and adjusts to its newfound size and stature, or perhaps once this fan boy became accustomed to the grandeur of it all, the laughs roll out rapidly. It may be mostly tame but it is also riotous and faithful.<br/><br/>A bigger screen means an opportunity to take some of the Simpson characters further than they have ever been. (It also means some characters don't get any spoken screen time  sorry Patty and Selma.) Lisa meets a boy who transforms her into the giddy girl she's repressed so many times before. Marge finds an assertive voice that elevates her above the doormat status she all too often assumes. One of the more prominent story lines, which I'm carefully trying to avoid being specific about for those of you who are trying to go in to the movie as clear as possible, finds Bart questioning what his life would be like if he had a father figure who wasn't such an impulsive goof all the time. In one of THE SIMPSON MOVIE's greatest achievements, it breathes new life and depth into characters that have spent almost two decades trying to remain the same. The one constant that needs to remain that way to avoid throwing the world order out of alignment is, of course, Homer. As Homer is accustomed to making monumental mistakes and learning lessons from those mistakes shortly afterward, his movie mistakes are nothing new for him. And like usual, he will see the error of his ways and make many more mistakes by the time a sequel hits.<br/><br/>THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is a rare, successful experiment in defying expectation and pressure to become a film that honours its origins while moving forward at the same time. As the town of Springfield breeds a self contained awareness that requires more than just a casual glance to appreciate fully, I'm not sure how well THE SIMPSONS MOVIE will play outside of its fan base. That said, anyone who has had the fortune to spend any amount of time with the people of Springfield since 1989, will find their first feature to be filled with a humoured familiarity that serves as a reminder for how they've been able to stick around for so long. And now that the my Mac widget that has been counting down the days until THE SIMPSONS MOVIE has finally run its course, I can rest easy knowing that all my expectations were met and it probably won't be quite as long until the Simpsons find themselves on the big screen again."
"errant17","9","1","5","29 July 2007"," great, above expectations
","Great movie. It was completely beyond my expectations. I wondered how they were going to create a movie based around 400+ episodes and hundreds of characters. I was worried it would be a lame compromise trying to squeeze every character ever written and every type of Simpsons gag and quote into the movie. But they succeeded by not trying to squeeze all of that stuff in. A lot of movies based on television shows feel more like longer episodes than they do stand-alone movies, but the style of animation they chose (they incorporate 3D modeling) and the size of the conflict (the whole town of Springfield is at risk) make the movie truly cinematic. I would have liked a Duff Beer joke and more Moe but all in all it is still better than they last five seasons put together. I heard years ago that Groening said they'd never make a Simpsons movie. I am glad they finally did and can't wait to see more."

","Bigger is Sometimes Better<br/><br/>I am a Simpsons fan in the sense that if someone quotes from an episode or goes - do you remember that episode of The Simpsons when I know what they are talking about. I haven't seen every episode, far from it, but I know enough about the family to be excited about The Simpsons Movie.<br/><br/>The movie opens with in a cinema with Itchy and Scratchy The Movie playing. Homer then begins to complain loudly about having to pay for something he can see for free on the TV and points to the cinema audience calling them all idiots. That appeals to my sense of humour and thought it was hilarious. I knew from that moment on I would not be disappointed.<br/><br/>The most amusing part came from a child in the cinema who when the ""To be continued"" sign came up asked if it was over! <br/><br/>PLOT: Homer spills some waste from Spider-Pig (or Harry Plopper), even though he was warned not from Marge, into the river and this causes a toxic meltdown. President Schwarzenegger picks from a selection of options - He was elected to lead and not to read - and Springfield is trapped inside a huge dome. The Simpsons escape to Alaska and in the end return to save Springfield. The plot sounds as though it would fit quite easily into a twenty minute cartoon but the summary of the plot does not do it justice. The script is full of gags and is more than adequate to keep an audience glued to the screen for ninety seven minutes.<br/><br/>CAST: All the cast is back and that is no mean feat. The Greenday Cameo at the start was very funny - especially their homage to Titanic!! Was this perhaps a subtle dig at The Simpsons Movie sinking Titanic? (terrible pun intended!). <br/><br/>Overall This is a very short review because I don't want to give to much away and list all of the many gags and funny parts. I will say keep a look out for the jump over Springfield Gorge as you can see the ambulance which crashed into the tree during Homers famous previous attempt at jumping the Gorge.<br/><br/>I would give it a 9/10. A very enjoyable film that was worth the wait."

They're not attempting to do more than what you normally see if you're a Simpson's fan. To be honest, that was very refreshing that they DIDN'T try to ""remake the wheel"" or spruce everyone up to be ...box office.

They poked fun at us the audience as well as popular culture, and wrapped it around a simple story. Surprisingly very effective.<br/><br/>My complaints? I've seen 'Itchy and Scratchy' do MUCH worse on free TV, I missed Kang and Kodos, and of course, Sideshow Bob. But in the light plot of this movie, that wasn't bad at all. Maybe I'll see them in the NEXT movie, ya know? If not, watching them every week on TV for all these years wont mean I'll miss them that much either.

"chimera-4","6","1","5","27 July 2007"," Good but nothing you haven't seen before
","It's been a long time coming but finally after 18 years of the Simpsons we get the long overdue movie. Is this a case of the horse having already bolted from the stable? Well, a little bit but to be fair after 18 years of material coming up with new stuff is going to be difficult and while the Simpsons movie does admirably to entertain for it's short running time it feels like little more than an extended episode with one or two bits of obviously superior animation.<br/><br/>The plot is nothing more than what we'd expect from an episode of the show but being movie length means that Groening and co can stuff more than the usual amount of Simpsons tomfoolery into the bits between the plot. Just about every single regular character ever from the Simpsons mythos gets at least a cameo look in although shame on Groening and co for giving Mr Burns such a stupidly small part in the movie. There are a good few belly laughs throughout the movie including a few that take more than the usual ""Shown in TV land before the watershed"" risks.<br/><br/>It's unfortunate that after so many years of the Simpsons some of the gags are getting a bit predictable (not to mention recycled) but it's to the shows credit that even those bit's are still funny a lot of the time. I mean Homer's as much the clueless buffoon as he ever was which is always funny right. I was surprised that the movie didn't take more shots at pop culture but I guess thats a good way to date a movie quickly so maybe they deliberately chose not to go down that road.<br/><br/>If I was rating this movie alongside the series I'd say it was at least as good as one of the better than average episodes but a long way off the really good ones......"

","It's the event 18 years in the making. For lifelong fans of ""The Simpsons"" on TV, this could very well be the event of the year. Yet the negative word that has haunted the film from day one is the noticeable decline in quality over the past few years. Would the team be able to fight this and successfully expand the show into 90 minutes of pure Simpsons magic, or would it merely be a longer retread of recent episodes? The answer lies somewhere in between; while it by no means reaches the comedic heights of the series' early years, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is an enjoyable, laugh-filled film that passes by in no time and leaves the viewer satisfied.<br/><br/>The film format and PG-13 rating have allowed for many ""shock"" laughs, the most effective of which is used quite early in the film. It's a joke that's bound to upset the parents; for a brief moment, we are reminded of the edgier days when the Simpsons team was called on for public apologies. But the formula of joke after joke begins to falter; the film begins to drag near its middle, the gags become repetitive and more typical of recent episodes. When the jokes fail (more often than not, they are the jokes used in the many previews; by now, they've lost their humor), the film seems to die a bit. While the pace picks up as the film reaches its finale, it never quite recreates the edgy joy the writers clearly felt when they weren't restrained to a plot. The film also attempts a number of large action sequences, poking fun at the summer blockbuster while trying to gain some excitement in its own right. These become a mixed blessing; the expanded, almost epic scope is neat for a while, but the film only comes alive when it returns to the suburban-level comedy it knows best.<br/><br/>What is quite surprising about this film is the level of honesty and seriousness it portrays. Unlike other comedies of its type, ""The Simpsons"" has always seemed earnest, especially when it concerns Homer and Marge. But here they break new ground; a videotaped monologue by Marge halfway through the film may be the most dramatic thing they've ever attempted, and it pays off. In those few moments, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE becomes truly dramatic, almost heartbreaking. It was a risky move to implement such a dramatic element in such a film, yet it is a complete triumph.<br/><br/>The film never reaches the heights of the series as a whole; there are no instantly classic lines, and the filmmakers struggle to create a thoroughly involving 90-minute film, but it is far from a disaster. Actually, the greatest achievement here may be the further characterization of the dynamic Simpson family themselves. Moments of brilliance early in the film show why the Simpsons have lasted all these years, and the rest of the film is solid enough to make THE SIMPSONS MOVIE a successful TV-to-film transfer.<br/><br/>Read more at http://newmanscorner.blogspot.com"

It contains some minor spoilers, mainly in regards to jokes as told from the trailers.<br/><br/>From that true-blue to the tee meaning of a ""teaser"" trailer from March 31, 2006 with Ice Age: The Meltdown, hearing that the Simpsons Movie was in production was about any fan's wonderful dream. It's what only was thought to be impossible. A feature-length film about the family we all have come to love over the better part of a quarter-decade? Was it for real? Was the rumor that once the movie was announced and eventually released  that the show would be cancelled? Hurray, Yes, maybe  but not at the moment.<br/><br/>..:namespace prefix = o ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office"" /> In the first big-screen adaptation of ""The Simpson's"" we find the classic American family of The Simpson's knee deep in a big-scale crisis in a small town in ..:namespace prefix = st1 ns = ""urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:smarttags"" />Springfield. Pollution has become an epidemic in the local lake and Lisa takes initiative<br/><br/>to gain support from the local townspeople to make a change while trying to make a dream come true in having a relationship with fellow supporter and not Bono's kid in Irish kid Colin. But that's not even the worst of the Simpson's problems! The main plot of the story is Homer's inability to realize the before-and-after's of his polluting, his penchant for a pig, and his ever-fading relationship with Bart  who wants to have a positive father figure in his life. And that's not to mention that something that Homer did caused a sort of martial law to be taken on Springfield.<br/><br/>When you think of classic television, you think of the Simpson's. It's the kind of show that everyone in the family can find something to appreciate. From little Sally who likes the funny looking characters, to Davey who likes to see Bart get the best of his dad Homer, to Mom and Dad who like to see real-life arguments fought between and quickly resolved between Homer and Marge. Oh, and yours truly who loves the Comic Book Guy and his obsession with comics. There are so many iconic characters on a show that has reached the peak of superstardom. What more can a show do after almost TWENTY seasons to prove that it is just that good? How about making a movie?<br/><br/>Sounds like a good idea. You've got my bucks right there. All I need to hear is that you've got the entire original cast and you're keeping the Simpson's yellow and I'm in like Flynn. We all know that the average 22  24 minute episode of ""The Simpson's"" has an A and B plot with sometimes a third to add even more to the general story. But can the show keep an audience in a theatre happy for about an hour and half? My personal opinion would be a resounding yes. Maybe it was the whole idea of seeing ""my"" show on a three story screen, or maybe it was the ingenious humor, the fact that most of the same writers from the show worked on the script for the movie, but doggonit if I did not laugh harder, more often or longer at this movie than nearly any other episode I've seen. Not once did I feel the story lines were drawn out or to far-fetched (HA-HA!)<br/><br/>The only negative would be that it was not long enough and did not feature more characters! (SEQUEL!) In actuality, there are about 95 original characters featured throughout the film, whether we large and integral roles or just background doing something goofy like Ralph picking his nose. Every minute of this film looked beautiful. Since the television series went completely computer animated a few years back, the movie reaps on the benefits. The animators already have a top-notch structure to reach from and it only looks better here in this feature. There are more and more 3-D elements featured and it just looks wonderful.<br/><br/>It is so hard not to just expel one of the millions of jokes and one-liners featured throughout the movie. This is not one of those movies that suffer a case of ""everything funny was in the trailer."" It's as packed, if not more, than any normal episode of wall-to-wall irreverent humor and ""preaching."" There are also those subtle jokes like the Moe's being next door to Reverend LoveJoy's Church and them switching places for a moment, or the ticker advertising for a new show in a movie, or heck, even Itchy & Scratchy doing what they do best. (Here's a hint, it's not chasing dust bunnies.) This movie proves that the show is still a viable commodity. Even if the creators decide to bow out gracefully of a primetime slot for a sitcom, a feature length film every few years or so could still work out very well. The film is fast-paced, incredibly funny, looks great and above all else, has that same heart-warming appeal that that makes the show work so well. It's a truly wonderful addition to one of the most extensive, respected and loved collection of comedy in the history of television and film. If you like the show, you'll love the movie. If you love the show, you'll love the movie. Plain and simple."

","The Simpsons Movie is a very funny movie. Don't believe what the people giving it one star. It's a minimum of 7 at least. The Storyline and plot is great the characters are Funny because lets face it the new episodes of the Simpson's are well pritty crap to put it lightly. But the movie makes you forget about that because of the clever and unexpected storyline in the movie. The jokes are create and the writes should be applauded and the President Swartzeneger thing is brilliantly funny.<br/><br/>The Simpsons movie is a must see movie for everyone.<br/><br/>10 out of 10"
"AlphaToOmegaAndBack","10","1","5","26 July 2007"," Funniest cartoon of all time
","Just been to the cinema to watch this. It was pretty much amazing, start to finish none stop laughs for both adults and kids. My two are 7year old boy and 11year old girl, and its the first time they have sat contently through an entire film without talking or getting distracted. In fact they were laughing almost constantly and so was I. Its amazing how they managed to get so many quick fire jokes and weave in a coherent plot as well. It has everything you like from the series and so much more. It has that many memorable moments that I simply can't choose just one. Though my kids and I can't stop singing ""Spider pig spider pig does whatever a spider pig does. Can he swing from a web, no he can't he's a pig"". I can not possibly begin to give this film the praise it truly deserves. That it will be a big hit with adults and kids alike is an understatement. We liked it so much I've had to promise we'll go back and watch it again tomorrow, and its a promise I'm looking forwards to. I don't doubt you'll soon be able to download an illegal copy, but trust me this benefits so much from the big screen, with so much happening in the background as well, that you really will want to go and see this at the cinema regardless.<br/><br/>Not only is this the best film of the year so far its probably the best film of the decade and without doubt the best cartoon of the millennium. Watch it at the cinema and you'll absolutely love it."
"DVD_Collector89","8","1","5","26 July 2007"," Better than I expected
","A long time ago, when I heard that a Simpsons movie will come on the one hand I thought ""I have to see this movie"", but on the other hand I hoped, that it won't ruin the series, because the chance for this is big. The last series of The Simpsons were greatly disappointing me - it isn't just funny any more (for me), so I hoped for the movie... and I thank Matt Groening for making this film! I can't remember when I've laughed that much in a cinema (and the rest of the audience too)! It was really great fun! At first I was a bit afraid, because people told me it seems like a long TV episode, but I don't think so. There weren't just a lot scenes to laugh about - the WHOLE FILM was pure fun. I couldn't stop laughing about a comment, there was the next funny thing to laugh about. Another funny (and also quite important part, I think) part, were the indirectnesses about an the US President, Arnold Schwarzenegger, environmental pollution and the monitoring State.<br/><br/>I think this film is for everyone - old and young people (and especially Simpsons fans) will have 1 1/2 hours fun!<br/><br/>10/10"
"Bing5253","9","1","5","26 July 2007"," Great fun!
","WOW! The Simpsons movie does not disappoint. Anyone who is interested in the show will find this hilarious. It has a great plot, tonnes of characters (including the all time favourites) and overall, loads of really funny gags.<br/><br/>The Springfield lake becomes so polluted that one more piece of rubbish could make it extremely dangerous. Of course the only man stupid enough to dump more rubbish is the one and only Homer Simpson. This one event sets off a hysterical story following the family in their bid to save Springfield.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this film to anyone. You'll regret it for your whole life if you miss it.<br/><br/>9/10"
"johnnyboyz","7","1","5","26 July 2007"," The Simpsons: Bigger, Longer and unbelievably: Uncut!
","So here it is then; The Simpsons finally do a film. I've been a big fan for years and years; frequently watching repeats on television of old episodes I know inside out yet haven't seen for ages. Usually, I don't watch animated films beyond Disney although the South Park film (1999) was a refreshing alternative. It took the makers of South Park a mere two years to adapt their characters into a film, something that took everything great about the series but moved up a level in the fact it didn't censor out any swearing, profanity or violence. Bearing everything else in mind, how does the Simpson's film shape up? Pretty damn good, on the whole.<br/><br/>You get the feeling that the creators are trying to grow the series up a little bit  South Park and Japanese animation as a whole helped move that tag 'cartoons are for kids' away from animation and The Simpsons are also following suit as there are several things in this you'd never get in an episode on TV. These would include but probably aren't limited to: nudity, drug taking and swearing using hand gestures; Marge even refers to Lisa as a 'woman' about a fifth of the way through.<br/><br/>Along with this, the film manages to capture what actually made the series so great and adapt it in a friendly and satisfactory way; there is no plot to start out with (in fact there is no real plot come the end) and thus it plays out like 'just another day in Springfield' as Homer carries out his chores, Lisa goes from door to door telling people about the environment and Bart gets involved in a game of 'truth or dare'. In all honesty, the opening twenty minutes was brilliant  laugh after laugh to any Simpsons fan who has been following the show for the duration I have as the film covers an array of characters and deals with a string of funny situations. Certain people who have certain favourite characters will be disappointed theirs didn't get enough screen time but from memory; Chief Wiggum, Cletus and Ned Flanders get the bulk of the screen time. This is not to be frowned at though as pretty much every character gets at least one joke to themselves, Moe's being particularly funny.<br/><br/>When it comes to the famous family themselves, Maggie seems to get more screen time than Lisa which although sounds rather daft is actually genius as Maggie can't speak and thus, has to rely on her actions to act as the comedy which she does to very good effect. Lisa's time is more dedicated to a romance story which I will not spoil.<br/><br/>The film gets going through an extremely unfortunate event that only really highlights Homer's stupidity and lack of thinking, thus making him look more like a buffoon than anything else; but once this happens you can feel it going down an extremely alternate route to that of the cartoon series. For reasons I shall not say, the rest of Springfield's characters are merely tossed aside meaning the bulk consists of The Simpsons so prepare yourself for that. This is a shame as with so many colourful characters to work with, dismissing them seemed rather ruthless but it is 'The Simpsons Movie' after all, not 'Springfield: The Movie'.<br/><br/>Like I mentioned, the plot as a whole is weak and numerous little occurrences merely kick-start the film once again after it hits a groove it could so easily fall into and stay in. This includes but again, is not limited to Marge discovering something on the news about Springfield resulting in them having to travel back once they bed down in Alaska; something that didn't really seem to contain anything of note plot wise. Also, the humour once in Alaska is limited to things like avalanches, Bart taking up drinking and spoofs of Disney characters from films made 60 years ago.<br/><br/>Once the film beds into its final third, the familiar Hollywood routine kicks in but I think the makers only wanted to finish on a strong, positive note and what better way to do so than using the familiar 'Happy, Hollywood ending'. This isn't a criticism but it does leave you with an odd feeling in the pit of your stomach  maybe it's just the fact that The Simpsons are actually in a film and are thus able to even HAVE a happy, Hollywood ending. It's difficult to say too many bad things about something I love so dear (The TV series) but despite really trying to love it (maybe too much), the film was only so much as a funny, big screen outing for the family of five that are: The Simpsons."

","well...................................<br/><br/>........................ it was everything i expected and a whole lot more! the laughs never stop coming throughout the whole film! the story line has been well guarded and rightly so cause it is actually pretty good but i am saying nothing! The film should maybe have a 12a because we see Bart's family jewels and homer sticking up the middle finger! but that didn't stop me from enjoying it! it was at a perfect length of 90 minutes! but the problem was that most of the characters didn't really didn't get their moment to shine but the trailer does say ""A Cast of Thousands""! Well it was definitely the best film of the summer and the year so far!after the two disappointing months of May and June(Pirates 3,Spiderman 3,Shrek 3 basically all the threequels!) July and August have been the best(including Harry Potter 5,The Simpsons Movie,Hairspray,Transformers and Die Hard 4.0) Heres hoping for a sequel and maybe hopefully the series can get better! Rating 10/10"

"althric","3","1","6","8 June 2019"," Yikes
","If you have good memories of this film, don't rewatch it.
I found the experience extremely boring and unfunny. Homer Simpson is usually a loveable idiot but in this film he's just so dumb and such an irredeemable character that he's basically a different character.<br/><br/>The Simpsons was charming, witty, had a great pace and the characters, whilst mostly exaggerated stereotypes we could relate and laugh at, were and are still very loveable and iconic, even if the shows quality has declined.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is none of this. It's not funny, it's not clever and the main character is frustrating to watch. There were some alright moments, but it's no real surprise to me that nobody talks about this film anymore. The world won't suffer from forgetting it ever existed."
"ArtVandelayImporterExporter","1","1","6","16 November 2016"," Worst. Movie. Ever.
","Watched The Simpsons from the time it began as a weekly series. Let's be honest. It stopped being funny some time in the 90s. <br/><br/>But then you think, ''they'll put some effort into the movie, right?''<br/><br/>Got the movie on DVD as a gift when it was first released. Couldn't get past the ''Spider Pig'' song Homer sings. It was boring up until then but at that point I realized the producers were just insulting my intelligence. Pulled the disc and gave it away (or maybe threw it in the garbage). <br/><br/>Nearly a decade later it's on TV. Figured I'd try again. <br/><br/>This time kept watching beyond the Spider Pig song. Only to see the movie devolve into some kind of hectoring screed on environmentalism. If I wanted to watch whiny liberals I'd check out all the Youtube videos of Hillary supporters crying their eyes out after she lost. <br/><br/>This movie is so bad it makes me kinda resent having been a fan of the show in the first place, sorta like Ted makes me hate Family Guy even more than I already do."
"mrush","8","1","6","21 August 2007"," Wooooo--Hoooooo ! I loved it !!!
","This is one of the funniest laugh out loud movies I've seen in a long long time.And I was relieved that my much beloved TV show didn't produce a bomb at the box office.I have watched The Simpsons since the beginning and I was afraid this movie would bomb and kill the series.Far from it.<br/><br/>In the movie Homer is up to his usual shortcuts and laziness and after he pollutes the Springfield Lake so bad that the EPA takes over the town The Simpsons become fugitives running from the irate townspeople and the government.<br/><br/>If you've watched and loved the TV show you will love this movie.There is nothing much different in the movie than the TV show ,other than vulgarities and nudity and obscene gestures,but other than that it is pretty much the same.That's right this movie has nudity.Take that Jerry Falwell.<br/><br/>Now I've seen some reviewers say this movie is like the later day Simpsons show,good but not as great as the early years but I'm not sure I agree with that.It's true that The Simpsons TV show has declined a bit in the last 5 seasons but it is still the funniest thing on TV.This movie was better,I felt,than many recent episodes of the show.So my opinion is that this movie is indeed a closer relative to The Simpson's glory days than the current crop of shows.<br/><br/>But anyway the movie is laugh out loud funny and I'm not that easy to make laugh out loud.If you like the TV show you'll like this movie and if you're one of the 3 people never to have seen the TV show I'll bet you too will like this movie.<br/><br/>I'm ready to see the movie again and will want to buy a copy for the DVD bonuses and all the hidden stuff in the movie I missed at the theater.<br/><br/>Here's to Matt Groening and all the Simpsons cast members-----thanks for a great movie and a great TV show and may Homer continue to f*** up for many years to come.And since you guys made a crap-load of money off the movie I'm sure we'll see a Part 2 very shortly.Woooo-Hoooo."
"chicana_tigre","2","1","6","8 August 2007"," Quite a let down, if you ask me
","Let me start by saying that I was a kid who's parents turned off The Simpsons if they ever caught me watching it, because they thought it would teach me by bad example. Now, in my mid 20's, I have been buying up all the seasons as they come out.<br/><br/>This movie, makes me reconsider my parents prejudice towards the show. There is one particular scene that shows the naked genital area of Bart while streaking on his skateboard. That along with half a dozen other distasteful scenes makes me lose interest in all things Simpson. I'll sell the DVDs on some online auction site and ignore the new episodes when they come out.<br/><br/>That is not the only reason I though the film was a waste of 2 hours. The storyline was well thought out, but the scenes just lacked all the traditional Simpson feel that I have come to enjoy.<br/><br/>Where were all the barely-noticeable political and pop-culture quips that are the staple of the show.<br/><br/>Rather than an idiotic scene of Homer and Marge being assisted with their physical relationship by a horde of woodland creatures, why not show a kiss and a fade off? I will give the writers and actors the benefit of saying that there were a small handful of humorous moments. Those moments, however, are a featherweight compared to the proverbial anvil of stench with which this movie wreaked."
"sjensen-4","3","1","6","4 August 2007"," Poor piece of Hippie-work
","At first when i heard that they where gonna make a Simpsons movie, i was thrilled. The name of Simpsons always brought me back to that happy time in the start of the 90ties, where the Simpsons was fresh.<br/><br/>But generally The Simpsons have gone down hill since season 13, and that can also be seen in this movie.<br/><br/>The story-line, the bad-guys and jokes are things we have seen in the show, one way or the other. There is no new thing in this movie, it just ends with status-que. Though that can be good for some shows, it just that they could at least have revealed some more secrets or shadow sides of our characters, but the makers of the movie chose not to do this. They chose just to recycle a lot of stuff from the old shows and change bits of things, and then put them together - so they lasted over one hour. Its not impressive, not at all.<br/><br/>Also all the hippie-elements of this show was also why i left the Simpsons back in the 13th season. And it is still here, in the movie. First of all, there is all the anti-pollution thing in the plot - thats just so smug. Its so irritating, and better-knowing-kinda teaching we get there. But we really don't care. That is what the whole picture is about: hippie-stuff from green-peace. You could easily tell that the creators of this show are very left-wing. Not that there is anything wrong with that, its just that people that are too political gets too preachy in their messages in the entertainment, its the same with Simpsons (no wonder family guy IS a better show). The worst smug-hippie-thing in this awful movie was when Lisa is talking to Milhouse at the first time, before the non-Bono-Irish-kid is introduced. Milhouse claims that he cares for the environment, but then Nelson comes and threatens him to take it back. The message is clear: all those who do not agree with the hippie-socialists-creators of the Simpsons, that Global Warming is a fact, is a Nazi. Whether Global warming is true or not, i don't care, but i just don't want to see such green-peace-hippie-bull-crap in a movie that i want to get entertained by. <br/><br/>This movie is just too smug, too hippie-infested. What trash. 3/10 Nuff said!"
"philip_g_marshall","6","1","6","31 July 2007"," Disappointing
","After watching Simpsons religiously for about the past 10 or 11 years I was somewhat disappointed with this film. The series has in my opinion unfortunately been going down hill over the last few years and unfortunately the movie has fallen into the same traps.<br/><br/>The movie started out really funny, but lost momentum as time went on. Like so many TV series that are turned into feature length films, it didn't really work, tended to be dragged out and many of the episodes from TV were much better.<br/><br/>As others have said, maybe they should have stopped making Simpsons when it was still on a high.<br/><br/>I went into the cinema with the anticipation of seeing a brilliant movie, but came disappointed and the thought that it could have been so much better."
"mascha05","3","1","6","30 July 2007"," A must see for the hardcore Simpsons fan, but...
","Not long enough. Honestly who couldn't sit through a three hour Simpsons movie. Starts off with a bang then slowly fizzles out. No sideshow BoB or Kang. Overall a stupid story. Every Simpsons fan should see this though. The main problem is for a full-length feature I was expecting it to be the greatest Simpsons ever, but I can think of about two-dozen episodes that I would rather watch than this again. The other thing I was expecting was for dialog from more characters. If their is a sequel I want Moe, Apu, Rev. Lovejoy, Willie, Lenny, Karl, Barney, Snake, Dr. Hibbert, Martin, Milhouse, Flanders, Sideshow Bob, Krusty, Kang, Grandpa, Mr. Burns, Smithers, Skinner, Duffman, Artie Ziff, and finally more big Hollywood stars playing roles of the towns people."

","""The Simpsons Movie"" won't have fans who have waited 18 years for this big-screen treatment of the long-running animated TV show to be made disappointed - after all these years, it's still funny and effectively satirical. And for the uninitiated who are willing to see it either out of curiosity, or just because they want to subject themselves to some silliness and chuckling, the movie has loads as well. Just be ready for some Bart d***.<br/><br/>In ""The Simpsons Movie,"" the water supply of Springfield is getting more toxic due to high levels of waste dumped into the lake. This prompts Lisa Simpson (voiced by Yeardley Smith) to start an environmental awareness campaign together with Colin (a new guy in the neighborhood that has an Irish environmentalist/guitarist father). Eventually the people of Springfield decide to help in cleaning up the lake. Meanwhile Bart Simpson (Nancy Cartwright) has some sort of a falling out with Homer (Dan Castellaneta) after a game of dare with his dad goes wrong, compounded by the fact that a pig saved from getting butchered has gotten more favorable with his father, building the pig even a pig crap silo, leading Bart to look for a father figure across the yard in the Flanders.<br/><br/>Soon Marge Simpson (Julie Kavner) convinces Homer to get rid of the silo but to make it to a free donut giveaway, Homer decides to save time and simply dump the silo in the lake which proves to be the last straw as the lake becomes so polluted it mutates an animal who gets in contact with the water, calling the attention of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA, under US President Schwarzenegger's orders, quarantine the town of Springfield inside a large glass dome, and the Simpsons, upon the townspeople's discovery of Homer's involvement in the crisis, find themselves under the angry eyes of the whole Springfield.<br/><br/>Director David Silverman and his army of co-writers give a movie with frivolous gags, slapstick humor and hilarious sentimentality that should satisfy long-time fans, and perhaps make new ones out of the rest. While some jokes tend to be less funny than others, one should still have a fun time watching the kind of humor and irreverence one can expect.<br/><br/>Simply put, if you're a fan, you probably have made your mind up in seeing this movie; chances are you won't be disappointed. If you are simply up to find what the hype is about, you'll find yourself a good hour and a half of entertainment."

","It's widely regarded that 'The Simpsons' TV show has been long past its prime of the early through late nineties. Nowadays it's still watched, but it doesn't look like it will ever regain its prestige. However, that didn't stop them trying to make a movie out of the long-running series in 2007 - roughly a decade after people thought it had peaked.<br/><br/>Perhaps one thing that's normally commonplace when a TV show makes the jump onto the big screen, is that everything is bigger and on more of a grander scale. Yet, due to 'The Simpsons' being on the air for so long and because it's animated, therefore not bound by the limitations of special effects and budget etc, pretty much everything has already been seen and done (ala that episode of 'South Park' that made the same point!). Therefore there's very little that's fresh to see by watching 'The Simpsons Movie.' I know there's a certain amount of 'meta' humour poking fun at the audience for going to the cinema to watch something they could view for free on the television, but it's a point that's kind of on the nose.<br/><br/>Although, saying all that (and speaking as a fan of 'The Simpson' - in their heyday) I have to say that the film is an enjoyable enough romp. There's literally nothing here to distinguish it from an episode (well, a good one) besides its extended runtime. All the characters are there, although most are only on screen for a few seconds to throw a line or two in there. The film focuses in on the central family and recycles many old plots from various episodes to create something that appears new (if you don't look too closely).<br/><br/>If you like the show then you should definitely like this. It's one of those movies that you probably shouldn't pay to see (especially at cinema prices), but if you get the chance to watch it for free then there are definitely worse ways to spend an hour and a half. It's just a pity today's episodes can't even match the quality of the film.<br/><br/>Plus did any future episode ever say what happened to the stand-out star of this film, i.e. 'Spider-pig?' He definitely deserves his own spin-off series!"

","When I was 12 I was hyped beyond words about the Simpsons movie. I was so happy to hear about it. I waited all year to see it until the end of Summer. I saw it and opinions where definaly mixed.<br/><br/>STORY
The Simpsons movie starts out very strong. Lots of comedy and humor. Then 30 minutes in after an entire Simpsons episode but slowly paced it takes a akward turn. Homer Simpson starts to dump pig feces in a lake and that sounds hilarious but the worst part is that it's the driving force for the whole franchise. So since Lake Spring feild becomes a toxic garbage pit the EPA comes in and takes over. It rips off Stephen King's Dome. They escape the Dome and move elsewhere. Things get dumb in Alaska.<br/><br/>Thus it goes on this over the top convoluted mess where they need to move somewhere else but the EPA tries looking for them<br/><br/>This is such a limiting story since the Simpsons never ever change. There never needs to be any questions to be answered since at the time the entire tv series was only 18. Where only Mod Flanders dies of a T-shirt to the face.<br/><br/>The comedy was hit or miss. Mostly just sad tired references. Too much Meta pointing out that people just see TV based movies just to make money. That it's pointless. Unlike Macross the movie or Fire walk with me the Twin Peaks Special.<br/><br/>CHARACTERS
Homer is dumb but lovable
Marge is the supportive but naggy wife
Bart is a rebel a loser but a Kyle with sass
Lisa is a studious nerd. But she's in love with a boy. A boring little nerdy boy who makes the story even more akward. Imagine a 14 year old in a 10 year old's body? The atheist kid. Yeah. He's not that good. I don't even remember his name. He plays music though.
At least 90 percent of the characters are more likable than they are now.<br/><br/>ANIMATION
The animation is mostly stiff like new Simpsons. This has comedic charm but no it's not like 1994 Simpsons where there was actually good animation or god forbid a Disney movie. There are nice particle effects and other Sakuga but mostly TV show level. Simpsons movie is filled to the brim with bad CGI that looks so obvious. Overall passable.<br/><br/>SOUND
Oooh ahh it has Green Day in it.<br/><br/>Overall much like the Simpsons nothing was gained or learned other than a psuedo- enviromentalist message which is generic to say the least.<br/><br/>Don't waste your time on this cartoon unless you are a diehard fan. It's full of confusion. You're better watching Mr. Plow episode or the South Park movie if you are man enough, big boy."

","The Simpsons have no doubt been a longtime American icon dominating the world stage of pop-culture ever since they came into being in 1987 thanks to the Tracey Ullman Show. The show's had MANY great episodes throughout its 90s run, it's had some hits but notable misses in the 00s, and the show's still a thing in the 10s. And then you have the movie: a culmination of years and years of small-screen storytelling and it's just okay. It's amusing and harmless, but it's not really anything else.<br/><br/>I love these characters and this town: so why does the movie fall short of that legacy? It's something to do with the lackluster script, the generic 'save the world' scenario it's trying to parody (ultimately succumbing to the problem it's mocking) yet it's still watchable. It's no classic but it's still okay for all age groups to put on and watch, even if it's just noise in the background.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie: it's a movie that's trying to surpass other movies while not trying to truly makes its own cinematic impressions. 3/5 stars."

The movie was great. Very funny. A good weekend movie, to watch with your family (not the little ones). Some of the comments were a little too dirty, for kids to watch. It had some emotional moments, that made it catchier. Homer isn't your typical farther, but that makes the movie funnier. Sometimes I was a little shocked, but Homer is Homer. If you have watched The Simpsons before, you would know what I'm talking about. All said I would probably, not watch it again. Yes, it was funny, but it didn't have that much content.

","In the 90s ""The Simpsons"" was the funniest, most original cartoon ever. It was always going to be difficult for ""The Movie"" to recapture the glory days and it doesn't do that. It seems like nothing more than an extended TV episode of latter day ""Simpsons"".<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" was apparently edited heavily, and Kelsey Grammar, Minnie Driver, Isla Fisher and Erin Brockovich all had their scenes cut out. But it is still ponderous.<br/><br/>Some inhabitants of Springfield have only very brief cameos if at all (Mr Burns, Moe, Sideshow Bob, Principal Skinner, Skinner's mother, Apu, Groundskeeper Willie, Millhouse's parents). The new characters like the Irish kid Colin, are irritating.<br/><br/>The plot is facile, concerning a giant dome put on Springfield to hold in the pollution and the government intending to blow up the city to get rid of it. And the whole Alaska section was weak. What made the Simpsons great was its subtle satire. The movie is like a parody of itself, the same kind of stupid sitcom it once made fun of. Replacing Alf Clausen's usual score with Hans Zimmer is also a mistake. The straightforward orchestral treatment for the show is very distracting.<br/><br/>Having said all that there are some good lines (Bart: It's the worst day of my life. Homer: It's the worst day of your life so far) and some good visuals (nude skateboarding). But you'd get more fun, and save a lot of time, by watching any episode from the first eight series."

","I like The Simpsons. Its one of only two sitcoms I'll watch. They've seen better days, but I'll still defend their newer episodes. So of course I eventually watched their movie. But even after reading reviews, I was still disappointed by how average The Simpsons Movie is.<br/><br/>As many have said, The Simpsons Movie is less a movie and more a long episode. The scope is barely larger than the more outrageous episodes, and the animation is only slightly better. I'd sooner believe it cost $7.5 million to make before $75 million. We're on the big screen, with a higher budget than ever...but why?<br/><br/>The worst part of the movie's mediocrity is the writing. While the usual chuckles are still spread through the film, the arcs of the characters are just rehashes of dozens of episodes. Homer causes chaos because of his selfishness and stupidity. Homer and Marge bicker, but eventually make amends. Homer and Bart settle their differences. Its nothing we haven't seen before. Its totally predicable, yet ultimately pointless. Homer will never grow up, he'll fight with Marge over and over again, and he'll choke his son when it suites the scripts. Not even a big-budget movie can convince The Simpsons to evolve. And you can only run on a premise for so long before it grows stale.<br/><br/>I suppose these problems also exist in the series. But they were contained in 30 minutes, plus commercials. They also used other characters from the show to add spice and satire. They are little more than cameos here.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie could have been explosive, emotional, or the bridge to update a tiring franchise. Instead, its nothing. Which isn't to say its unfunny. It just should have been more. I'd only recommend it to devout Simpsons fans, and they've all seen this already."

Within the first ten minutes, I knew things were okay. There had been many jokes that were funny and the story was set up in a way that only a show like ""The Simpsons"" could do correctly. <br/><br/>The film does a good job in setting up each member of the family and they each get a different story arc to follow. Each story arc is set up in a comical way that anyone can laugh at and they all tie into the overall story. <br/><br/>The humor is similar to that of a regular ""Simpsons"" episode and there are a lot of funny moments. Unfortunate that this is one of the last times that ""The Simpsons"" was extremely funny, the writers did not fail to come up with material to make us laugh. <br/><br/>Everything in this movie was done really well from the comedy to the characters to the story.

","As a lifelong fan of 'The Simpsons,' I really wanted to see this film when It was released in the cinema.

There are tons of sight gags that made me laugh such as the infamous nude skateboarding scene that gained a lot of media attention in the run-up to its release and this film also has clever writing that links scenes very well such as Grampa foreseeing the disasters of Homer polluting the lake with the silo containing Spider-Pig/Plopper's droppings and Springfiled being sealed in a dome; and Homer riding a motorcycle inside a spherical cage and eventually inside the dome during the climax. As well as its humorous moments, this film has touching and tense moments. The backgrounds range from the familiar sights of Springfield to the beautiful surroundings of Alaska. There are also some well-known celebrity cameos such as the rock band Green Day and Tom Hanks. The 20th Century Fox opening logo with Ralph Wiggum was hilarious as well as the post-credit antics of 'The Simpsons' who have appeared to be watching their own movie all along.<br/><br/>Overall, this is one of my all time favourite animated films and a brilliant spin-off of my favourite animated television series. 10/10."

"brando647","8","0","1","20 November 2012"," Good for Fans of the Series, but Needed More Springfield
","I have been a fan of the Simpsons for as long as I can remember. When I was a kid, I'd fight for the chance to stay up on Sunday nights to watch the latest episode and I caught up later when I found it on syndication. There was a time when I was sure to watch every episode, usually multiple times. Not so much anymore. Some time in the last ten years, I just started losing interest. By the time THE SIMPSONS MOVIE came out in 2007, I'd all but stopped watching the series but I was still there opening night. The thought of catching the prime-time powerhouse animated family on the big screen was enough to grab my interest, and I suppose the result was about what I expected. It's about the same as watching an extra long episode of the series. The movie opens when Lisa Simpson begins a crusade to clean up the pollution and end the dumping in Lake Springfield; meanwhile, Homer adopts a pig from a Krusty Burger commercial. These two seemingly separate plot lines collide when Homer ditches a silo full of pig crap in the lake, sending pollution levels through the roof and alerting the Environmental Protection Agency. The new head of the EPA, conniving businessman Russ Cargill (recurring Simpsons guest star Albert Brooks), convinces the President to isolate Springfield in a giant glass dome, angering the town residents and sending the Simpson family on the run as fugitives. Can the Simpsons save Springfield? Well, the show's still on the air, isn't it?<br/><br/>When this movie came out in 2007, the television series had pretty much passed its prime. The newer episodes were good for a few laughs but, for the most part, the show had lost its spark. The movie was a few years too late and probably should've hit theaters sooner while the Simpsons were still a hot commodity. The show is one of the longest running in television history so I guess, as long as they've been pumping out episodes, it was only a matter of time before it ran out of steam. The movie feels like nothing more than a ninety- minute episode of the show, so I guess that's a good thing. I don't really see how a Simpsons movie can be all that cinematic but the colors are sharp and the animation looks wonderful. The movie is actually really funny for the first half hour or so but loses a lot of momentum when the Simpsons leave Springfield. Fans of the show will generally agree that the town of Springfield is just as much a character in the series as anyone. So when the family hightails it out of there and lands in Alaska, it's not as fun. The entire middle of the movie drags when the family goes through its fugitive stage and tries to make a new life. It doesn't pick back up again until the final act when they return to Springfield to make their stand.<br/><br/>The movie's still pretty funny, even at it's weakest moments. It plays a lot off the current obsession with environmentalism and going green, going so far as to satirize the government a bit with it's tendency to overreact in some situations. There are also a lot of nods to fans of the show; for example, there's a point later in the movie where we briefly visit Springfield Gorge and find the crashed ambulance from the second season episode ""Bart the Daredevil"". It's little things that like that made me smile while watching the movie in the theater. Everyone's favorite character will get a moment in the spotlight here with all of Springfield's citizens getting their moment, whether it be Comic Book Guy celebrating a life well spent or Otto getting high while the world crumbles around him. THE SIMPSONS MOVIE does a great job of catering to the fans and giving us what we want (Itchy and Scratchy on the big screen!) but it never really rises above the novelty of a feature length Simpsons movie. I don't know, I suppose I just wish a) the movie had been kept confined within the town of Springfield and utilized the supporting characters more and b) the movie felt a little more epic. The series has some fantastic writers on staff and I wish the movie had hit a little harder (and a little earlier). Overall, THE SIMPSONS MOVIE is a fun time but, just as with the later seasons of the show, isn't as good as the classic early episodes."
"Benjamin_Cox","8","0","1","30 October 2012"," Like an extended episode, making this a fun outing for fans -83%
","What is it about ""The Simpsons"" that has endured them to audiences the world over for the last twenty-something years? I suspect that instead of the deeply glamorous or perfect families normally seen on TV, the Simpsons and their various supporting cast are much more identifiable - everyone can relate to at least one character (personally, I know Comic Book Guy). It also offers a gentle sideswipe at US culture (or lack of it) and isn't afraid of picking targets, much like its imitators ""South Park"" and ""Family Guy"". So after much delay and time wasted in development hell, this belated movie has a lot to live up to and especially considering that a lot of TV-based movies aren't that good. Thankfully, the seasoned pros behind ""The Simpsons Movie"" have delivered a corker although at times, it does feel like an extended episode.<br/><br/>Springfield is in crisis - the pollution in Lake Springfield is reaching dangerous levels of toxicity due to incessant dumping in the lake and despite the efforts of plucky Lisa (Yeardley Smith) to draw attention to the problem. After the town deciding that enough is enough, the dumping stops. But after Marge (Julie Kavner) orders him to dispose of a vast silo of pig waste that he left in the garden, Homer (Dan Castellaneta) desperately drops it into the lake and the resulting pollution forces President Schwarzenegger into dropping a vast dome over the whole of Springfield. Driven by the crazed EPA official Russ Cargill (Albert Brooks), the US Government soon decide to blow up Springfield and kill everyone in the dome - meaning that America's favourite family must flee from the angry mobs outside their home, prevent the destruction of the whole town and make Homer realise the error of his ways - which is harder than it sounds! <br/><br/>The plot, naturally, is pretty far-fetched and doesn't offer as much as I was hoping - for example, can anyone tell me what happened to the pig once the Simpsons were on the run? In truth, this felt like a celebration of the show as characters old and new are in there somewhere, catchphrases are all present and correct (mostly) and the bigger screen allowed the animators to fully utilise CG and other technical toys so the film looks a lot smoother and more professional than the TV show. Vocal talent is as good as you'd expect from a cast performing the roles for so long - Kavner, in particular, is superb as Marge during a surprisingly emotive monologue. And rather than lapsing too much into self parody like ""Die Another Day"", it retains enough composure to gently mock almost every aspect of American life like the public's apathy towards environmentalism, the media's insistence on sensationalism over reality and the rare success for the FBI when they actually get something right.<br/><br/>But (and I'm afraid that it is a big one) it never pushes things too far like the shows that followed do. It's like it's afraid of offending anyone - the Simpsons have never been controversial since the early days when there was nothing else like it on TV. Now, the likes of ""Family Guy"" and ""Team America: World Police"" offer something with real teeth and a serious political agenda whereas the Simpsons remain firmly stuck in the family-friendly mould. It has undoubtedly lost some ground but the truth remains that this is still worthy of your attention. It's funny in its own way and if you're a fan then this movie will be right up your street. I did enjoy ""The Simpsons Movie"" a great deal but find myself questioning why it took so long, why wasn't it a bit bolder and why was I slightly underwhelmed."

","I've been a Simpsons fan for the last 5 years or so, but it was a shocker that Matt Groening and his crew would release a movie on 'The Simpsons.' But the movie was a pretty hilarious ride as Homer causes numerous problems (per usual) along the way throughout the picture. Some of the jokes are pretty funny, but most are typical considering its basis; a cartoon. The characters are the same with a few additions, but no one who was entered into the series after the film was released and there are at two least guest performers (Green Day in the opening scenes and then Tom Hanks around the middle of the movie). The movie is not disappointing per say, but it is loaded with the show's natural humor and jokes. However, the film is still hilariously entertaining and a good movie for the family (11 and up though)."
"ElMaruecan82","7","0","1","16 July 2012"," Not a ""D'Oh!"" ... Not an ""Excellent"" either ...
","More than the film, I remember the event it was. For the first time, the fans were about to see their favorite show in a movie theater. Could you imagine that? Bart, Homer, Marge, Mr. Burns, Moe, Barney, all the Springfield town painting the big screen in a dazzling and bright yellow  that was one movie adaptation no one could ever refuse. A sure hit for the fans, but not necessarily a sure critical success. I think we should all admit that we all watched the film because it was a novelty on itself, and no Simpson fan, no parent of a Simpson fan could miss it, but the certainty of a critical success was more than debatable. The excitement was sincere but so was the apprehension.<br/><br/>Now, after five years, I can't really put my finger exactly in what went wrong in ""The Simpsons Movie"". In fact, I almost want to say that nothing was wrong; it had the fun, the wit, the satire, the zaniness but also the tenderness, the warmth and the heart of some of the greatest Simpsons' episodes. But when you dilute it in almost one hour and twenty minutes, it loses its spectacular value and you can't help but notice some slower moments plot-wise. Whatever it is, it's exactly why I can't call the film 'great', but just a 'very good' with some great moments. And I didn't even have high expectations take it from a Simpsons' fan.<br/><br/>I didn't expect a lot because like so many hardcore fans (I watch the show almost every day and know hundreds of episodes by heart), I got used to disappointments. As I posted once on IMDb, there was a time when ""The Simpsons"" were influencing Pop-Culture but now, it's Pop Culture influencing ""The Simpsons"", the result is not bad, but the episodes are generally hit-or-miss, rarely average, either great or lame. I could picture the Simpsons movie disappointing me, and I kept this feeling as a psychological shield so I could never be truly disappointed enough to abandon my faith over the show's chances of improvement. Talk about negative preconceived ideas but let's say it was just some sort of self-preservation instinct.<br/><br/>But the first minutes were surprisingly hilarious and they really made me lower my guard, the sight of little Ralph Wiggum trumpeting along with the Fox fanfare was very funny and encouraging (too bad, one of the film's highlights started so soon). And it went on with the ""Itchy and Scratchy"" bit and Homer's self referential accusation. The opening sequence couldn't get more creative with Frink passing along the whispering clouds and saying 'the movie' or Bart writing on the chalkboard that he'll never download this film illegally, I could sit and eat comfortably my popcorn expecting the opening sequence to go until the couch but then suddenly, the film switched with the sight of a unknown pop group singing in a concert. The 'Da-da-da' lip-synching was funny but I thought the cut was too abrupt.<br/><br/>I would have preferred the film to take its time to set-up the film as it does for TV episodes. Maybe it was eager to get to the point, since we all knew everybody and the 'Titanic' reference was very clever. Overall, the film wouldn't start to worry me  not until Grandpa's outburst in the church (which was my first alert) and the whole Spider-pig thing (the fact that we don't see the pig after that, damages the solidity of this plot element) and when I understood that the film would only focus on the family. I thought it was a mistake because the material would have served better for a TV episodes' plot. The film didn't exploit all the possibilities that were offered to it. It didn't even had songs, perfect leverages for most posterity. Remember ""South Park"", what most people remember from it? The songs.<br/><br/>And the ""South Park"" movie had at least the merit to feature all the population of the town and make a very clever satire, while ""The Simpsons"" focused on the family and didn't use the characters the way we'd expect. After all, couldn't Mr. Burns be the main antagonist, the one who'd make this dome on Springfield, he did far worse when he decided to block the sunshine. I also wished there was more Barney, Karl and Lenny, Krusty the Clown, and all the great supporting characters that'd populated the show since 1990, but the movie felt like a concentration of three kind of plots : Homer gets a new job, Homer screws up, Problem in the family, not the best of these recent years.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons"" have always been synonyms of smartness, unpredictability, a clever way to be ahead of what we'd expect, it's precisely because I have a tenderness for the show that I felt bad to predict all what was going to happen, the whole redemption of Homer, him reconciling with Bart and all that stuff. I didn't see everything coming, but then again, I never said the movie was disastrous, nor that I was disappointed, simply that it had the potential to be greater than what it actually is. Although I believe it should have been nominated for the Best Animation film Oscar category, if only because it's hand-drawn for once, I don't think the creators wanted to make 'a masterpiece'. Nonetheless, the film is qualitatively good, in the same level than the Simpsons as a TV show in 2007.<br/><br/>But I only wish I could have been more enthusiastic to review this film as I would to one of my favorite episodes."

","I had my doubts when this movie came out. The Simpson's had been around for roughly 20 years, many of the newer episodes had lost their edge and it was wondered whether this movie would either build on or destroy the franchise forever.<br/><br/>As a massive Simpson's fan, it's obvious that this movie caters more for the movie going public, rather than those who've graciously tuned in every day for the last 20 years. But that's not entirely a bad thing, it makes good sense commercially and this project had been in the pipeline for a number of years.<br/><br/>On the downside, I felt that the story was quite haphazard in its approach and instead of keeping it simple and fast-paced like so many classic episodes, went for the over-indulged huge crazy scheme, that assumed would generate equally huge crazy laughs. However that was the films biggest failure. Fans felt a little let down, and others felt, what the hell is going on here? What made this movie for me was the subtle in-jokes and one liners that Simpson addicts have come to love. The little things that the average person would easily miss, but the fan would point out and laugh at. Even though it's nothing more than a cartoon, the writing can be complex and very witty, and while this can work easily for a 30 minute episode, it's hard to translate that into a full length movie.<br/><br/>There were some classic scenes though, for example Homer dumping the pig silo into the lake and after realising what he's done races back to the car gets in the back seat screaming ""Drive, drive, drive!"" But he's the one who drove there and the only person in the car.<br/><br/>Only a fan would get the reference of Homer drinking at the Alaskan bar called ""Eski-Moes"" and only a fan would see the humour of the bomb disposal robot that would rather commit suicide than complete its mission.<br/><br/>Overall it's worth watching, even if it's just to see what all the hype is about."

","Matt Groening and his creative team really took their approach to 'The Simpsons Movie' out of the box, from the pre-release marketing to the finished product. Having only paid attention to the show's early seasons (I consider it of a good calibre, even though I am hardly an avid fan), I find the big screen version proves to be a great companion. Eighteen years of diminishing returns, this isn't.<br/><br/>The animation is 2D bliss, with plenty of modern day trickery and effects to elevate its theatricality. Early trailers billed it as the film that 'dared to be ugly', so proud of its medium that it should have had Disney executives hanging their heads in shame; what should have been their own trend setting return to animation eventually came a full two years later with 'The Princess and the Frog'.<br/><br/>While the eco-friendly plot and moral are hard to ignore for the casual viewer, it is worth appreciating that this direction was clearly chosen as an opportunity to mock the current issues that were prominent in the year of the film's release. While there are obvious spoofs and jokes of the topic circa 2007, the underlying social commentary is not so much on global warming, but on our reaction to it. Rather than capture the implications of the phenomenon, the movie instead essentially epitomises the mass hysteria that surrounds the subject, creating a story full of chaos and stupidity that befits the craziest of 'Simpsons' episodes.<br/><br/>The laughs are thick and furiously fast, with the enormous cast from the show utilised very well indeed, as are several quirky cameos. With an arsenal of jokes loaded to last a good ninety minutes, there are obviously some misfires that don't quite hit the target; I couldn't, however detract from the praise that the sheer effort on show here truly deserves. The critics who dismiss 'The Simpsons Movie' as one long, bloated episode are entirely right. But it's a mighty fine episode.<br/><br/>9/10"

"Tubular_Bell","5","0","1","17 February 2010"," The biggest problem is that it wasn't a movie at all
","Just look at what this show has become! Its fans' greatest expectation was the the film was NOT going to be absolutely awful, and they were rejoicing madly because it turned out to be NOT bad. This thing doesn't even have a proper title: it's ""The Simpsons Movie"". The story is irrelevant: it only matters that it's the Simpsons, and it's a ""Movie"". It's not a movie: it's a TV special that ended up in the theatres. And the packaging? Oh, it has Homer, and it has donuts. The poster had a donut. The advertising banners had donuts. The soundtrack CD casing was donut shaped. People, WHAT KIND OF AUDIENCE is this film aimed at?? If you go a few years to the past, just a few, you'll remember that the TV show was praised (and I mean praised as ""critics raving and drooling and squirming on the ground with excitement"") for being a biting, cruel satire of the American society, for having a lot of criticism towards American traditions. Now look at this: The Simpsons franchise has become everything it made fun of in the past. This ""Movie"" is the final nail in the coffin: it's an acknowledgment that the series has no value anymore. It means nothing, it represents nothing, it stands for nothing.<br/><br/>Yet, oh, not a single person of the crew will ever recognise that. For them, the Simspons is the PINNACLE of sarcasm and satire on TV. Pure hypocrisy. This ""movie"" is a blatant lie. And I don't say that as a ""bitter fan"". I am not a fan, and I'm not bitter. Actually, I get an odd form of pleasure from seeing this pathetic excuse for a ""Simpsons Movie"".<br/><br/>OK, anyway, the proper story. It doesn't suck? I disagree. For a project so big, humongous and hyped as this one, the story is every bit as by-the-numbers as you'd never expect.<br/><br/>If you want a practical example of how contrived, empty and artificial this script is, look no further than what happens to Lisa in here. Since this is ""THE SIMPSONS MOVIE!!!"" (seriously, how could that pass THAT off as a title??), every character needed a plot. We need to please EVERYONE, here! So how do we please Lisa fans? Have her play out something cute and adorable, of course. Yeah, but since Lisa fans represent about 0.5% of our viewers, and the film is aimed at people with the IQ level of an amoeba (See? It has DONUTS! Donuts are FUNNY!), we need to be awfully obvious and to the point with it. So what do we do? Let's create a shallow, empty, contrived character out of thin air to serve as her romantic interest. He won't be at all developed, he'll occupy about 5 minutes of screen time, and we'll make him Irish just to squeeze in a joke about Bono. Yes, that is EXACTLY how it plays out. And you wonder about the rest? Don't bother. It doesn't get much better than that.<br/><br/>Oh, and the film opens up making fun of US for paying for something we can watch for free on TV. Oh, yeah? Who the heck thinks I'm gonna buy THAT garbage as clever, witty self-referential and audience insulting humour? If anything, this is an insult to themselves; they're clutching at straws to be ""edgy"", and will pull off ANY cheap and stupid trick to keep that mask on. Example? During one of the ""emotional"" ""high points"" of the ""movie"", the screen fades to black with the caption ""To be continued..."". I started to feel, with a sense of dread, that the worst was about to happen. And the worst DID happen: it continued ""Immediately"". Seriously, I felt ashamed for paying to see THAT much dumbness and obviousness on the screen. Do we NEED that? Not only this is ""The SIMPSONS MOVIE!!! THAT DOESN'T EVEN HAS A TITLE BECAUSE THE STORY DOESN'T MATTER!!!"", but it plays cheap pranks on you! At least this ""movie"" was a cathartic experience. I felt justified in despising The Simpsons, as the pile of smugness, hypocrisy and complete lack of talent that it is. The makers of this thing surely have their egos inflated to the size of the planet right now. At least we know they're not inflated with hot air, but with FOX's budget."
"matthewcs25","4","0","1","7 February 2010"," This came out about seven years too late.
","The Simpsons was a great sitcom that held its own for almost a decade. This show put the fledgling Fox network on the map. It was a symbol of the 90s. That time came to close in about 2000. The show started to become a shell of what it once was. Now imagine that shell hanging on for another seven years. That is what the movie is. When you have a show on for 18 years and then make a movie out of it, there is not much available for a plot in the movie. I agree with what many other reviewers have said, it is a recent season episode that was dragged out for an hour and a half. There was little real development and not much of an emphasis on secondary characters. To top it all off, Dr. Nick Riviera dies in this movie!"

","I did not know what to expect from the movie. As a fan you have been watching the series for years and when suddenly a movie comes up you can only guess how this venture is going to turn out. Unfortunately, I was left hugely disappointed and unentertained.<br/><br/>First of all, it has questionable sense of reality to say the least. Of course, it's only a cartoon and The Simpsons have never been based on actuality of life, but this breached all boundaries of it. At times the movie reminded a superhero flick or a science fiction in animation. Like when Homer falls from high altitude on concrete and is fresh as a daisy. There were many similar scenes, which really rendered the quality of the movie.<br/><br/>Second, the humor wasn't the same you are used to watching the series. I can't define why, but it just wasn't funny at all. I laughed only on a few occasions, while on the contrary I laugh a lot more in a single episode of The Simpsons. In overall, the humor is primitive, often more disgusting than tasteful and isn't witty. There's a big emphasis on pain and suffering which is supposed to be amusing. It's not...<br/><br/>Third, The Simpsons are about making fun of people and ridiculing certain things and situations. But when there is a sob story, romance and feelings involved it really shuts the whole party down. Sadly the movie embraced exactly that.<br/><br/>And finally, I missed other characters. The movie is so centered around the Simpsons' family while others are only the background that it made me feel like something substantial is left out. Many characters didn't even appear, probably only in the crowd scenes. It's a movie for god sake, you can include almost everyone! <br/><br/>Every Simpsons fan should watch this movie, only because how can you be a fan but haven't seen it? For those who aren't fans... Yeah, most likely they will hate it. I mean, you really have to be a hardcore fan to at least find it good."

","It came as no surprise to me that I was bored through almost all of this movie. The pacing was slow and thick as molasses in February, the jokes were old, and in one case a gag was actually stolen from the Leslie Nielsen classic, Wrongfully Accused! As is often the case with TV to film adaptations, the plot chosen was too epic to be taken seriously, but too serious to be funny. The movie's plot could honestly just have been about the loser patriarch who gets a pet pig, which ends up dirtying the house, etc. That gag, however, the only funny part of the movie, was abandoned by the picture about half way through! My advice to people who like ""The Simpsons"" is to stick to the TV. To the rest of us, just watch Family Guy!"
"Dillypogo","10","0","2","19 August 2008"," The Simpsons Movie: Hilarious
","18 years after it first hit the small screen, one of the world's best TV shows finally blasted onto the big screen in the form of The Simpsons Movie. Dan Castellaneta again provides the voice of Homer Simpson, who pollutes Springfield after dumping a heap of pig excrement into the lake, leading to the town being sealed off in a giant dome. It's then up to Homer and his family to save Springfield from a disastrous fate.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is one of the funniest films I have ever had the pleasure of watching. When I was watching it in the cinema I was laughing at least once every minute and it's very rare that I laugh that much at a movie. In fact, I was laughing five seconds in when Ralph Wiggum appeared inside the 0 of the 20th Century Fox logo, singing along to the fanfare.<br/><br/>The animation in the movie is most definitely a step-up from the animation of the TV series. With added shading, it's perfect and the fact that it's all hand-drawn makes it all the more amazing. But, like the TV series, the dialogue and the character's mouths are sometimes not 100% in sync with each other, although it's not very noticeable.<br/><br/>When I was watching the film I felt like I was just watching an extended episode of the series. This, of, course, was inevitable and there was no way it could have been avoided, but if this was shortened down to 22 minutes and shown on TV as an episode, it would have been the best Simpsons episode ever. Like any TV-film adaptation, The Simpsons will be compared to its maker and the movie definitely lives up to and has the same feel as the series.<br/><br/>For me, what makes a family film good is that the entire family can enjoy and by family I mean both adults and children. The Simpsons Movie certainly has enough jokes for both to laugh at, although it does push the boundaries of ""family"" film when it unexpectedly shows 10-year-old Bart's penis and also Homer sticking up his middle fingers.<br/><br/>The Simpsons Movie is one of the funniest films I've ever seen and has great animation. I give it 10/10."

But as a whole this movie is really bad. I think it's because of the way sitcoms are done, and this was basically a 90-minute sitcom, which obviously doesn't work. It is too fast paced at times and is also very slow at times. The audience can get bored way too easily with this type of thing. There isn't much to say with this, because there really isn't any room for improvement. The world of movies, should never cross the world of TV.

"scott-sw","9","0","2","25 July 2008"," Woo-hoo!
","I've been waiting for the Simpsons Movie for a long time. To get it out of the way, I thought the Simpsons peaked about ten years ago. Therefore, I originally thought the movie was about ten years late. Fortunately, the Simpsons, Bigger, Longer and ... whoops. I mean the Simpsons Movie delivers. I recall seeing South Park, Bigger, Longer and Uncut in a vacuum, meaning I knew nothing about the show itself before seeing the movie, but still walked away somewhat entertained. If I was a fan first, I might have enjoyed it more. As for The Simpsons Movie, I think it has more direct appeal to the fans and probably won't find new ones. Essentially, Homer screws up Springfield once and for all by dumping pig poop into the Springfield Lake, forcing the EPA and President Scwharzneggar to encase the city in a plastic dome. Once the Simpson family is exiled, Homer must make up his mind who he cares about more: himself, his family, and the people of Springfield. All along, the story and pacing is laced with subtle satire, irony, and quick-witted lines the Simpsons is known for. It will make you laugh out loud, and like many Simpsons episodes, you might want to see it twice to catch all the jokes (be sure to stay for the credits, too). The only drawback is that it cannot be seen in a vacuum. You have to know about Homer's stupidity and impulsiveness, about Flander's religiosity, and about the cold-heartedness of C. Montgomery Burns. It also feels like a 90 minute Simpsons episode instead of being an actual movie. What it does not do is go overboard like South Park did in their profanity-laden movie. Instead of a relentless attack on the American Puritanical Culture like South Park, the satire is more subtle and not as cynical. The Simpsons evens pokes fun at the idea of a Simpson's Movie itself. The best part, though, is that the fans will definitely give a resounding ""Woo-hoo!"" instead of ""D'oh!"""

In fact, I'm pretty sure that I didn't watch this cartoon for the first few years of it getting its own show-an early promo by Channel Ten in Australia made it seem like the show it would become in recent years. Was a fan of the original show though, when it was just a feature of The Tracy Ulmann Show.<br/><br/>In any case, it's obvious from this movie that the writers of The Simpsons still had enough fuel in the tank to make a feature length movie which was actually top notch. That gives them one over South Park, which to my mind at least, failed in its transition to the big screen (I've reviewed that South Park movie at this site today).<br/><br/>This movie is very funny with plenty of laugh out loud moments. In fact, I had a sort of Homer Simpson (main character of the show...a big, dumb guy) moment watching this...I watched the DVD extras and found myself being reminded of hilarious scenes which I had just seen not minutes ago and had forgotten about! One of my favourite scenes is where Homer is driving a sledge pulled by dogs....lots of comedy gold in this scene!<br/><br/>Be sure to watch the end credits of this movie-there are more jokes and what must now be baby Maggie's THIRD lot of ""first word ever uttered""- that's three lots of different first words over the course of this series!<br/><br/>One issue-this movie is in an extra wide screen format. You really need a big TV- preferably widescreen-in order to get a good sized view...especially if you like to read the end credits...which some of us do. Not quite as bad as what Channel Ten does to the end credits of programmes, where they shrink the screen to highlight those all important ads. Nearly as bad, though.<br/><br/>A ""must see"" cartoon comedy in any case."

Both are high praise.<br/><br/>The jokes are non-stop even if you may have to be a Simpsons fan to get many of them. There is some plot but that doesn't spoil the show! And if you could pick a couple of highlights from among so many, then the nude skateboarding scene and the spider pig scene are gold-dust!"

","All I have to say is after some 20+ years of The Simpsons I would have though Groening could have pulled off a decent movie but of course, this was filled with the typical disappointing drivel I've come to expect from TV series such as this when they are converted to the big screen. I've been a Simpsons fan for most of those 20 years and I feel let down. Granted there were a couple genuinely funny parts but they were few and far between. As the typical American movie-goer eats up crap like this, I'm sure it will have garnered a high rating on this site I want my $1 back from the DVD rental machine for wasting 1 hr 20 mins of my life. I found myself bored 20 minutes in and pretty much all of the funny parts were shown in the previews so if you've seen the trailers, you don't even need to see the movie."

","Nobody needs me to write a review of ""The Simpsons Movie."" Everything that could be said about this film has been said about a zillion times over. Maybe even a million zillion times over. Every criticism has been made and every accolade lauded upon it. So why am I bothering to write this review... I dunno. If you can't beat 'em, join 'em? Sure, we'll go with that. But even with that said, all I can contribute is that I didn't enjoy it as badly as I wanted to. My primary beef was that it took the Simpsons out of Springfield for too much of the film... and the town of Springfield itself is as important a character as any other in the Simpsons - whether it's the TV show or the movie. But, putting that aside, this film is worth watching just to hear Rod and Todd Flanders say ""bountiful penis."" What could be funnier than that?"

","The Simpson family live in Springfield. Environmental awareness is the subject here, and the town lake is becoming polluted. Somehow weird Homer gets a pet pig, and ends up with a large tank of pig poop in his yard. When Marge asks how that little pig could have filled it up so fast, Homer answers ""I helped."" A crisis arises when Homer decides he needs to get rid of the pig poop quickly, so driving through barricades he sends it into the lake waters, immediately turning everything toxic. The whole town gets after him and his family, they narrowly escape but then the president, Schwartzenneger decides to isolate Springfield by having dozens of helicopters with suction cups fly a large transparent dome over the town and drop it in place, making it impossible for anyone to escape.<br/><br/>SPOILERS: Later the president gets talked into an even more drastic plan, a bomb is suspended into the dame through a hole, it will go off in 15 minutes to destroy all the city and the people. But Homer saves the day by riding a motorcycle round and round the dome, higher and higher, until Bart on his back is able to sling the bomb out. It exploded on the outside of the dome, which shatters, and rains down on all."

","I really loved this movie. Anyone who loves the Simpsons should have watched it. It was really good, and the comedy was spectacular. The movie had good dialogue, and also there were some pretty funny stuff (of course). One of my favorite scenes was the one where the whole family were in the tree house,then all of a sudden, they find a secret way out to the outer world because the dome was covering Springfield. Also, the sandbox was the way out. Anyways, everyone but Homer went out, and Homer yelled at them, and he gives the mob the finger! I laughed so hard, I fell to the side of the theater walkway, and I made a tear. Then after he gave everyone the finger, Homer went through very slowly, so that gives the mob a little while to beat him up. It was really funny. I loved it. And I knew that the movie would be a success, because the Simpsons have been one of the greatest TV shows of our time."

","Like the series, the film is amusing, entertaining and exciting. Despite being a wee bit gory and pushing the jokes somewhat, this film will with no doubt entertain a wide audience, adults and children alike. This is the sort of film that if you watch once, you CERTAINLY won't catch quite ALL the jokes.<br/><br/>A bit surprisingly for something about the Simpsons, this film concerns environmental issues. It starts with Greenday and Lisa having problems with telling people about the environment. Next Homer's dad has a ""vision from God"" in Church and maniacally foretells of misfortune to come, in the form of a twisted tail etc. Marge particularly feels that bad stuff is soon going to happen and when Homer spots a pig with a chef's hat it seems like it will come all too soon...<br/><br/>Enjoy the hilarious, exciting, engaging, disgusting Simpsons Movie! :-)<br/><br/>7 and a half out of ten."

","Well, I've been looking forward to this long before the movie was ""officially"" announced and I was there on opening night, although it took me a few tries to get there. All in all, I think that it was a pretty excellent movie and well worth the wait. In fact, the only thing I can really say about it is best Simpsons movie ever!<br/><br/>The movie had several references to the older episodes like Stampy the Elephant and when Bart was a daredevil. The classic humor is all there, like in the beginning of the movie when the family is watching the Itchy & Scratchy Movie and Homer stands up and complains ""Why would anybody pay money to see something that they can get for free at home?"" The film also adds more depth to the characters and just makes them more real. <br/><br/>I definitely would recommend this movie to anybody, fan of the show or not.

"eched","10","0","2","15 December 2007"," Is this the end, or just the start?
","Everyone, on Earth knows about The Simpsons, and everyone also knows that the series has been going a bit down hill lately. The 'newer' Simpsons is by no means bad, but when compared to the older stuff it simply doesn't hold up as well. The flaws seem to be reusing of plot lines, over and over, more jokes, but them not being thought threw as well(it's machine gun humor,get off as many gags as fast as you can, and often it doesn't work) and jumping on the band wagon on a couple of things.<br/><br/>The question is, how does the movie play. Does it fallow the flaws of 'new' Simpsons because the well is simply to dry, does it somehow go back to the good old days, does it end the series on a high note, or is it the last nail in the coffin, or does the series not end at all.<br/><br/>Well, the film doesn't swing back to the good old days, BUT it shows the 'new' style can be good if done right, very, VERY good.<br/><br/>Plot lines are reused like crazy in the film, heck, the Simpsons once again move to a new location for a bit, but a lot of the plot is jacked up to an over the top level, which oddly makes it feel epic in a way. This makes the plot stand out and 'seem' like something new.<br/><br/>The comedy style is the machine gun brand, but where the flaw was in the show with a lot of the gags being rushed and not working because of it, this time around they pull off the pace. Every joke, despite the speed of them all, pays off well. I think it's due to the shear amount of writers. Once one of them couldn't come up with any more 'fast' jokes, another one picked up the slack and they all somehow banded together and made it work.<br/><br/>Then there was the last flaw, the band wagon. Many 'newer' episodes dealt with issues in todays world and went along with trends going on, and often they didn't pull it off to well and came off as, well, out of place. The film deals with todays problems, but this time they thought things out, and it comes off like a really kind hearted and nice South Park bit. It works, oddly, but it still does.<br/><br/>So, this is NOT classic Simpsons. This is the 'newer' Simpsons, but fine polished. It shows that even though things have changed, the well isn't dry yet and the series can still work, darn well! It's obvious from the end that this is not meant to be the end of the series, but for once a lot of old school fans may not see that as a bad thing. This is a new start for the series and has raised the bar for the show.<br/><br/>Bravo in making the new stuff work, and yes the film is funny, smart, and quick witted. Enjoy."

"blackburnj-1","7","0","1","10 December 2007"," Entertaining, but it could have been so much more
","Matt Groening's phenomenally successful cartoon creation comes to the big screen with plenty of laughs accompanying it. However, the transfer from television to film is not carried off well. The film seems to be caught between being three very funny episodes of the show and being a down-to-earth-dysfunctional-family film. The result is an unstructured, messy narrative, but an extremely funny film.<br/><br/>As always, the visual style of the cartoons looks brilliant and this truly jumps from small to big screen with aplomb. The voice performances are, as always, superb. However, the plot, such as it is, is not the driving force of the film. It is either servant to the jokes or the environmental parable. This could work for 21-minutes, as it does in the film, but after an hour and a half you're left quite entertained though slightly disappointed.<br/><br/>For fans of the show, then, this is a treat of sorts. The writing is better here than it has been on the show for some years and that will appeal to all, though for those who are not Simpsons-literate, the film will ultimately leave you entertained if unsatisfied."

","Undoubtedly the most hilariously consistent laugher of the year, The Simpsons Movie might not be an absolute slice of cinematic perfection fans have been waiting twenty years for, but, all things considered, comes pretty darn close. I suppose one of the only true downsides to this quick-running 90 minute big screen incarnation lies in the fact that so many scenarios have been written inside Springfield over the past two decades that the movie sometimes cannot help touching on these same themes and situations. With it's breakneck slapstick pace and fun doomsday scenario though, only the most hardened of Simpson fans will even begin to notice any overlaps as the fading relevance these writer's once dominated comes out in full force, at least one last time."
"cairnswendy39","9","0","2","29 November 2007"," The Simpsons Movie Review
","It has been 20 years since the yellow family was first introduced onto television And since then, over 400 episodes have been made in over 18 seasons. So with many other pieces of television now arriving on the big screen, it seems natural that The Simpsons Movie should be made. Now first of all, we have been waiting for years for this film to come out and I can easily say that I have managed to stay away from some of the hype. But I must complain, I wish they didn't make so many dramatic trailers to make me think ""Oh no, this film is going to be as unfunny as the current seasons"". So why have I given this a 9/10 star rating? First of all, the movie has been developed by some of the series's finest writers and there has been endless redrafts and altered scripts. Also, to have this movie directed by The Simpson's best Director, David Silverman, seems ideal. Again, the familiar voice artists give us their best to bring our favourite characters to life and the animation has never looked better. The Simpsons has also appropriately been given a more visually cinematic approach (with a widescreen presentation and a complete score by Hans Zimmer) and still with the same feeling that this is the Simpsons and not just a comedy movie.<br/><br/>So, where do I begin? Well first of all, is it funny? Well there is a joke under every minute, so yes! It is funny! But it isn't just funny, but it is very cleverly written, both in a verbally and visually way. But there is one big question, is it just a 22 minute episode transfered into the form of a feature-Lenght movie? Well first of all, the movie obviously doesn't take itself seriously. For example, in the beginning scene, in which the Simpsons are in a theatre watching an Itchy & Scratchy movie, and Homer stands up and says something like ""I can't believe that we're paying for something that we could watch for free"" (the same with the Simpsons). Also, somewhere in the beginning of the movie, we see a random piece of advertisement on the bottom of the screen which includes 'Yes, we now advertise in films too!' which again is suggesting that it is still a piece of television. All that is funny but on a certain level, this film has been criticised for being no more than a feature-Lenght episode. In some way, I agree, but perhaps it could be the fact that the series itself is epic. Most cartoons are television are purely normal and stay on normal television expectation, so when a movie of it does come out, it goes on an epic scale and the audience is surprised by this and that be why this film has been criticised. But the Simpsons, as a series, is not like any cartoons, it has always been epic in many ways and that's why it is unique and special. The film is just an extension to the epic scale that the series has. Also people say that the film is simply split into three sections, a hilarious beginning, a slow middle (in this case, the scenes in Alaska) and an epic, satisfying ending. This is true, however because this film continuously funny in many different ways, you don't easily understand this idea until you've seen the entire film.<br/><br/>As I said in my Transformers film, I was expecting this to be bad and Transformers to be excellent. Instead, Transformers was the disappointment and, despite watching it in a dreadful cinema, I was pleasantly surprised by this film. It is a breath of fresh air from the declining quality of the current seasons (despite some decent episodes occasionally). I thought it was good, decent, funny and very satirical in some parts. Good, decent, funny, satirical- those are the simple descriptions that has always made up the Simpsons, and that is why this exactly what this film is and that is why it works for me."

","After nearly 18 complete years running strong on FOX Sunday nights and after a mind-blowing 166 re-writes, ""The Simpsons Movie"" finally was born and the result ends up being a fitting correlation with the longest-running animated series in television history. Although far from classic fare and not quite spectacular, the movie does deliver what it promises: our heroes in an often irreverent and hilarious romp with pop-culture subtleties galore to please viewers of most all ages. Homer accidentally pollutes Springfield and the Environmental Protection Agency looks to make an example of the sleepy town by literally doming them in and correcting the problem. Thus the town's first family becomes fugitives and end up in Alaska of all places with smile-cracking outcomes. Saying the movie exceeds three outstanding episodes of the series played back-to-back would be an outright lie, but considering the source and the limited premise, ""The Simpsons Movie"" still comes out smelling better than most. 4 stars out of 5."

"colinmcsloy","6","0","1","27 October 2007"," Not bad but not great either
","This film gets off to a promising start with some great gags and set pieces, Bart's naked skateboarding and Homer's antics with a pig. However, as soon as what would have been known in the t.v. series as the 1st act is finished problems start developing. Part of the problem is that things become a bit too plot driven as other people have on this page have mentioned. Also fans will be disappointed that popular characters feature very little (Apu, Mo, Flanders etc.), this is particularly grating as new extremely lame characters are given quite a bit of screen time. A particularly cloying and crappy sentimental sub-plot featuring an annoyingly voiced Irish Greenpeace loving peacenik that Lisa has fallen in tow with springs to mind.<br/><br/>None of this would matter that much if the quality control of the writing had been a little bit more vigorous. There is some very good and funny material in this film but all too often a woefully unfunny line or gag will totally kill the momentum and ruin your' enjoyment of the film, and aspects of the story with great comic potential aren't allowed time to develop( I for one would have liked to see more of the pig).<br/><br/>Yes it is of a much higher standard than most episodes from the last 3 years but for me that is really good enough.

Homer's Fault. Why? Cause he would do something stupid.Why?Because he is stupid. I wasn't wrong at all. Let's face it. Many of the ""funny"" situations feels incredibly forced; Bart's Skate scene doesn't even has a funny reason to have happened,the Motor Bike driving around the Sphere on Springfield..totally ridiculous.No, Spider Pig didn't make me laugh.At ALL.NO,Piggy Potter either!.I could be really retarded and hypocrite if I did wanted to laugh at that.I only heard forced laughters behind and on the front,some maybe did enjoyed the moment, or some was just following the gag.<br/><br/>Anyway,the rest of the movie was full of weird and erratic scenes, such as Homer's discovery of his Sexuality.Zoophilia.With a Pig. Oh, and you are telling me to enjoy the moment?Give me a break.I was very glad that the movie ended. TV SHOW----//----Movie. I am a common watcher of the re-re-reruns of the Show. After seeing the movie...sadly, reminds me that it has been 15 years (And little more) of the favorite family. But instead of a good memory, it becomes DAMAGED seeing how the humor has been...to this point.Doesn't matter if Simpsons ""No1yestheonly1number1""fan club tries to negate this point,but: The Movie Sucked.Watch the Show instead.You actually saved 5 dlls going to see a 1.5 hour episode. <br/><br/>5 Stars because its still watchable for Kids.Except for the PEN** Part(Nude Bart on the Glass).

","I think like most people who are fans of the series, i dreaded to see this movie. That's also why i waited a few weeks after the premiere before actually going (and another few weeks before writing about it). I guess the thing i was most afraid of was the whole ""another episode of Simpsons, just 90 minutes long"". And was it? Both yes and no.<br/><br/>Making a movie out of The Simpsons seems like a long overdue project. The South Park movie was released long ago after all and The Simpsons have all the elements you need for a good movie. I guess the only problems really would be originality and the fact that if you want the series to continue after the movie, you can't really change all that much.<br/><br/>I can begin by saying that while this movie wasn't really that original (the story is very much like the series after all) this is still a very entertaining movie. And it didn't actually feel like an overly long episode of the series either. Rather it felt like a real movie with a proper story arc and time line.<br/><br/>The real winner here though is the pace. This movie moves at breakneck speed with jokes coming constantly both left and right. It reminds me of movies like Airplane! where there almost always something funny going on. Here they also have a lot of stereotypes and well-known characters to play with and use for effect.<br/><br/>Honestly i can say that i don't think a movie based on The Simpsons could have been done much better. It's entertaining, quick-paced, a real movie (when you look at the script and the story) and the look is classic Simpsons with just a little more visual flare added. Maybe i would have liked a storyline that was a bit more drastic and had a more dramatic impact on the Simpsons universe. But in the end i have to be satisfied with this movie. It's great.<br/><br/>8/10"

I was afraid that the other part of the rumor was true but the film is juts as the old days of the show: Great.<br/><br/>I mean, the Simpsons had a golden age that for me was from the season 1 until the season 8 or 9, later there was funny episodes and great moments but not as good as the first 9 years. That is amazing because to keep a show with quality in 9 or 10 years (and in this case a cartoon) is really unique and incredible. The Simpsons became just a classic show that in Mexico has amazing audience that kept this show in the top since 1993 or 1994.<br/><br/>So the film is like the good age of the show, like it was release like 10 years ago because is just fun the entire film, with Homer in his best moments whit spider pig, a really fun pig (but what happened whit spider pig?)

The movie gets a little boring when the Simpsons move to Alaska but after and before that it's great. Go see it if you like The Simpsons but if not don't bother. I gave this a 9/10 it's very good."

","Now I'm not a die hard Simpsons fan and I probably wouldn't have gone to see it if I hadn't been taking my children, but I'm so glad I went as I haven't laughed that much at a movie in years. To be completely honest whenever I'd seen TV episodes I hadn't liked a lot of the supporting characters (whats that Krusty the Clown all about!) so the fact that the movie largely concentrated on the Simpson family itself was a bonus for me. Anyway both my children loved it too and I would have given it 10 but for the scene of Bart getting drunk, which I thought was unnecessary and not something I particularly wanted my kids to see.<br/><br/>The animation was excellent as well and I loved the way they poked fun at Disney in the log cabin scene. I can understand that long standing fans of the TV series might not be as amused by it as my family and I were, although having said that my wife didn't get a lot of the jokes, but the rest of us thoroughly enjoyed it and will look forward to more of the same should there be a sequel."
"ellenxx","9","0","3","25 August 2007"," Simpsons movie is well worth seeing
","I think the Simpson's movie is a great family movie, its packed with laughs and clever jokes throughout. Matt Groaning has made an excellent movie, with smart character outbursts and just enough humour for everyone. The easy to follow story line works well, not making the adults feel there are going to see a kids movie yet not to complicated for kids. Plus the funniness does have a serious message about love and family relationships.<br/><br/>Its the kind of movie that everyone will enjoy, from grandpa to the kids, everyone will be left in stitches from start to finish. So I recommend everyone to go and see it if they want a great afternoon out!"
"alfredosolisfuentes","10","0","4","16 August 2007"," It's funnier than the old episodes
","WARNING SPOILER ALERT.<br/><br/>I've been a fan of The Simpsons for a long time now and I've been waiting for a movie for years.<br/><br/>I agree that the newer episodes of the TV series aren't as good as they were ten years ago but this movie is better than any Simpsons episode ever made.<br/><br/>The movie includes many things that the TV series can't show just like Homer giving the finger, Otto using a crack pipe, Marge saying the Lord's name in vane and of course Bart's hilarious 3 second frontal nudity. All of this add great laughs that you don't get on the show.<br/><br/>I think the only bad thing about this movie is the fact that all the supporting characters of the show have very small roles in the film. Some just one line, some only appear in the background and others don't show up at all. But this acceptable since there are way to many characters on The Simpsons and putting them all in the movie would be very hard.<br/><br/>I think if you are a fan of The Simpsons you will love this movie."

","There isn't much you can say about The Simpsons Movie that you can't say about the television show. Its sense of humor has a lot in common with other brutally irreverent cartoons made for older people. It has that same brilliant timing and expression of certain goofy characters' stupidity, but it never gets into as much trouble as South Park because it never gets that direct or crosses the line to the point of self-satirization, and it never gets old the way Family Guy, no matter how addictive it is, can so easily get, because it's patient and indulges in a little thing called plot. The Simpsons Movie has all of these things, and wisely, knowing that its scope must be expanded as a feature-length production, dreams up many wonderful plot ideas and infventively outlandish set pieces that if done in a live action film would be the most mind-blowing spectacles in any film for several years."
"Neon-man","9","0","4","13 August 2007"," Best comedy of 2007 (so far)
","No other movie this year has had this sort of anticipation. The movie based on the biggest, funniest and most popular cartoon of the past three or four generations. After the series began it's 22 minute prime-time broadcasting, it grew in popularity and immediately the fans began talking about a possible movie creation. The producers themselves of the show have suggested it to themselves two or three times before, but the idea has always been shrugged off. So finally in 2003, they decided again, but this time it stuck. Much was kept tight-lipped, but they did let slip some screens of storyboards, voices, synopsis and then finally trailers featuring finished content for the movie. Simpsons pandemonium swept up everyone, as 7-11s turned into Kwik-E-Mart's, various American Springfields' battled each other for the premiere spot of the movie and everyone was heading back down to the theatres, despite the holidays being over. So, does The Simpsons Movie stack up to what was anticipated, does it please this young Simpson fan, is it just a great comedy animation in general? Yes. The Simpsons Movie is pretty much everything. It is not disappointing, it appeals to Simpsons fans and it is easily the best comedy of the year, beating out the mediocre Epic Movie, Hot Fuzz, Mr. Bean's Holiday and Knocked Up. The Simpsons Movie is also most definitely in the top ten funniest films in the past decade. It's back to comedic basics. It just tries to make you laugh and works perfectly, in timing, voicing, animation and delivery. It can be argued that their aren't enough jokes in the movie, or that some of the jokes are awkward or don't work as well as they should, but there are definitely plenty of jokes in the movie that work perfectly. The jokes also appeal to a mass of people. The slapstick (or just people getting hurt) is always the kids' favourite moments, the satirical jabs work for teenagers and the family issues and hilarity of how the characters act and react appeals to the older audiences. It really is hard to go into this movie and not laugh.<br/><br/>The main complaint (if any) from mainly the fans is the lack of attention on some of the off-side, but popular characters, such as Moe, Mr. Burns, Apu, Chief Wiggum, whom get limited screen-time in the movie. This is true, as the movie focuses more on the actual Simpson characters, as well as a few new faces. These non-Simpson Simpson characters aren't in the movie that much, but when they are, it's a real treat. Not to mention all the characters that they remembered to put in the movie such as the Sea-Captain, Drederick Tatum, Ralph, Sideshow Mel, Kearney, Jimbo, Dolph, Nelson, Milhouse, Martin, Reverend Lovejoy, Principal Skinner, Barney, Itchy, Scratchy, Smithers, Professor Frink, Lou, Eddy, Gabbo, Dr. Nick, Dr. Hibbert, Grandpa Abe. That's just scraping the barrel of the bowl, so who's to say there aren't enough Simpson characters in the Simpsons movie. Onto the Simpsons characters themselves, Homer is the (very) main character here, with the story revolving very much around him. Not only does he conclude the conflict, but he also created the conflict as well. The rest of the family become more and more detached from him after he takes them all to Alaska after he pretty much destroys Springfield. Marge, despite sticking with Homer throughout so many ordeals in the show, feels very much unobliged to stick with him when he does not want to save Springfield from being properly destroyed. Bart no longer sees Homer as a fit father figure and throughout the movie continuously muses over the idea of having their neighbour Flanders as a more appropriate father. Lisa doesn't seem to be in this movie as much as the family, apart from the beginning and end when she tries to get the apathetic Springfield to react to the pollution in Lake Springfield and falls in love with a boy who is trying to do the same. The only Simpson character that sticks with Homer is the baby Maggie. Not to give too much away, but it's more than once in this movie does she save Homer's life.<br/><br/>The Simpson Movie praises on being good ol' 2-D, in contrast to the furious swarm of 3-D movies being mass released recently. Despite this, it still manages to make some very impressive animation that excels far further than the television show. There are no longer any boundaries or limitations to what they can offer. In some scenes, it's amazing the amount of characters, landscape or objects are portrayed on the screen. It goes to show that 2-D can be just as amazing as 3-D.<br/><br/>The Simpson Movie lives up to it's anticipations pretty well. Whether you're a die-hard fan, a general fan, like comedy movies or are just going along with someone who is one of the above, you'll most definitely enjoy this movie and laugh out loud a lot. This definitely isn't just a 22 minute episode stretched out to 87 (another complaint is the length of the movie. Too short for this post-Lord of the Ring crowd). This is the real deal. This is the movie we've all be waiting for 15 years. Everything about the show has been movie-fied for the movie. It even includes a lot of breaking of the fourth wall and referencing itself as being a movie (for example, Bart's chalkboard message is ""I will not illegally download this movie"". This is a great animation, comedy and Simpsons movie. An essential must-see. 8.9/10"
"gzamikes","7","0","2","13 August 2007"," See it at least once
","The Simpsons Movie breaks a lot of ground for the show by doing things that the show could never hope to do such as partial 3D animation for the majority of the time and various edit-worthy bits. Some things might be shark-jump worthy for certain characters by breaking their innocence but that's probably worrying too much.<br/><br/>There are certain characters who only get one line and some characters who speak much more than they should as well.<br/><br/>There are lots of good jokes that are in this movie but a problem that keeps more of them from working is how horrible the timing is in this. During the show, there are points where people will take too long to react to something someone has said and that really hurts the joke. That happens a lot in this.<br/><br/>It's not as funny as the best episodes of the show but it's far above the worst ones and worth mostly anyone's time. Worth owning? Debatable.<br/><br/>Oh and what's up with Rainer Wolfcastle being President Schwarzenegger? That's just dumb."

","I have always loved The Simpsons, but lately, with a few episodes exception, they seem to have run out of ideas and reused some old ones to make episodes that were, while decent, not up to my usual Simpsons standards. But this movie was really good. The plot line was great (Homer screws things up and must save the day; Marge and Homer's marriage gets rocky; Lisa gets a crush; some used-before plot-lines with a new twist!) The creators are also starting to get preachy (big environmental message.) The jokes are very funny, and it has lots of those little Simpsons-style hilarious subtleties that we all know and love. It is hard to explain without giving lots of things away, but if you liked The Simpsons show when it was at its best or near, then you will like this movie!"

","Being an avid simpsons fan since day one and waiting many anxious years for this, I came out of the cinema on Saturday night feeling very let down by this only slightly entertaining money spinner. The cinema was ram packed with people of all ages and as I sat down in anticipation I thought I was going to be blown away with simpsons gold. I was wrong! As a simpsons fan it was O.K, and thats a generous O.K. Im not claiming to be of higher IQ than most people but whilst most of the cinema was roaring at homer falling through the roof and poking his eye with a hammer,I couldn't help but want for some of the clever risquÃ© adult humour which the simpsons did so well in the earlier seasons(and got away with) but 98% of The jokes in it where just at best lame physical slapstick jokes aimed at under 10 year old kids. I love the simpsons and although since season 6 or 7 the writing has been below simpsons brilliant original standard I watch it every week (including re-runs) but couldn't help feeling like homer summed it up in the first 5 mins by saying 'why would people want to pay money for something they get free at home?."
"aceramit","5","0","3","5 August 2007"," Simpsons Fall Short
","With the Simpsons being on air for so long, and the vast amount of characters that have appeared on the show, I for one expected a film that would be centered around several events and stories. This film managed to drag out about a 25 minute episode for almost an hour and a half. With the combined expertise of Groening and Brooks much more was expected. If one were to take into account the works that Brooks has done this should be considered his worst film that he has been involved in.<br/><br/>I have been a viewer of the Simpsons for a long time now. The characters all have their own flaws that they poke fun at, but the characters do have moments where they are relatable. This movie tried to make the dopiest character relatable, Homer, but it was not by any means in a funny way. The movie just fell short of my expectations, and for many others of that I am sure."

","It seems late in the day for a Simpsons movie. The show can still be counted on for some hit-or-miss laughs, but obviously it's not as good as it was during its heyday a decade and more ago. The movie is a reflection of the current state of the show. For longtime fans, there's certainly some chuckles to be had. But there's not a lot of belly laughs to be had, and for that I was a bit disappointed, if not surprised.<br/><br/>I found myself smiling nostalgically more than laughing throughout the 90 minute running time. There's some good sight gags and various amusing Homer-related moments. I didn't even mind Groening and Co. taking the family out Springfield. However, the biting satire which separates the Simpsons from the Family Guys of the world is not quite as sharp as I'd like. Again, this sad fact mirrors the Simpsons recent small screen efforts, but I wanted to love this movie and I did not. It's fun, it's enjoyable, its The Simpsons, just don't go expecting ""Homer Goes to College""-era hilarity from our favorite cartoon family's first movie."
"Megatronika","4","0","3","5 August 2007"," Just Like Any Other Episode
","The Simpson's, the longest running animated series of all time. It has had an effect on the world like no other. All around the world people know who they are, the animation style is unique, simple and original and they've brought us words like ""DOH!"" ""meh"", ""Jeebus"", ""okely dokely"" and ""craptacular"".<br/><br/>However I believe it's time to end will it's still relatively good. The Simpson's has pretty much covered every situation the modern man could face. Think of an experience in your life and tell me the Simpson's haven't already done it. They're beating a dead horse now. What happened to intelligent jokes that parodied our everyday lives and society? Homer used to be the catalyst for most of the plots and had his well timed slapstick moments. Now it's all Homer, appealing to the lowest common denominator.<br/><br/>I love the Simpson's, I've been watching it my whole life and only recently have I gotten that critical about it. Maybe it's because I'm more mature but there is no denying that the show has gone noticeably downhill over the past few years. I've noticed that my friends don't even talk about the episode from the night before any more either.<br/><br/>As for the movie, it's typical comedic trash. A good way to keep yourself entertained on a slow weekend, nothing more. This could have been the perfect way to end the series, tie up loose ends and do something completely new and different. But it never strived to achieve anything the series hadn't already, expect more mature themes, violence and nudity for the sake of it.<br/><br/>Although I did find a few parts funny, like the scene with Mr.Burns about the ""rich white man in power"" and Homer making fun of the audience for watching something that they could see on TV. Especially because it's exactly what my father was complaining about before we saw it. And Maggie said her first word! Not really her first word was ""daddy"" after Homer had put her to bed in an episode five years ago. Which was adorable. There was one moment in the movie that made me almost cry though and it was the tape Marge left Homer.<br/><br/>But that nonsense about a giant dome going over the city, lame political jokes, it's the most uninspired, unimaginative thing I've seen all day.<br/><br/>I guess it's everyone's duty to see it and remember: Together we can stop crap. I have vowed to stop watching the show after this movie and if you do too the ratings drop, Fox will cancel the show, all they care about is money. A fifteen year old has figured that out.<br/><br/>I have to say though, the animation was superb it makes good use of the cinematic format. Courtney"

When i entered the theater i was surrounded by children and their parents. I thought i was in for a family film. To my surprise it was anything but. I thought the parents who brought the children to see the film were neglecting parents. I found the Simpsons to be for adults only. To these parents i think they should have their head examined.

","For all you goofballs who think this movie is some kind of lighthearted joke, think again. It is about the state of the United States, and what is happening and what will become more intense. You remember in the church, when Homer is walking up and complaining, he says, ""why cant I find god at home"", give this some very careful thought in relation to religion. You will remember Homers dad on the church floor, and Homer takes the bible and says, ""there are no answers in here"". You give that some very careful thought. Think about all the intrusive government survelliance, the NSA, the theme. The dome is representative of the REX 84 Fema camps. Arnold being president is more of the constitution being taken off the books, as he cannot be president. That is what that theme is about, think about Arnolds statement, ""I am paid to lead not read"". The town scheduled for extermination, the theme of the rats being exterminated, are better than the citizens. The guy in church telling his sons, you will meet Jesus, and one boy says, ""Will Buddha be there"" and he screams back, ""NO"". The religious theme again, the problem. Remember the mercury in the vaccines, and in the water. Think about Homers daughter telling the neighbors about this stuff. The bill to keep mercury out the vaccines was JUST VETOED last week. You better pay attention you young folks in America, before you wake up in a camp, you wont be laughing then I can guarantee you that. The entire theme of that town being in a bubble is about your rights being taken away, your town off the map, you are being tracked and traced. You better think hard about that theme of going to Alaska, the entire movie is a veiled attempt to show you that you are in a very precarious time, and it is no joke. Think about that greasy hamburger from the clown, and then the reference to nothing more greasy except in Mexico, you better think about the open borders and the North American Union that will make the United States, Mexico and Cananda all one UNION. Thereby taking your bill of rights and constitution off the books permanently and making you as far advanced into tryanny as possible."

","These are the simple facts: ""The Simpsons"" is a TV series - with 400 episodes over 18 years - not on special cable, not at a premium. It's free.<br/><br/>""The Simpsons Movie"" requires paid attendance. It is not free.<br/><br/>Who would you think in all of Hollywood would handle a ""situation"" like this by making a clean breast of it. Or even taunt the audience, foolish enough to pay for something available for free? But behold, it's good old, dumb, obnoxious, lovable Homer Simpson himself, looking down from the movie screen, jabbing a finger at the audience and yelling: ""SUCKERS!"" You can't help sharing his delight, laughing at your own gullibility.<br/><br/>But are you really being taken advantage of? Not by a long shot. ""The Simpsons Movie"" is well worth the price of admission (if not the outrageous prices at the concession stand). For Simpsons fans, the movie is nirvana; for the unfortunate rest of humanity, at least a therapeutic exercise in extreme giggles. (""Others"" include the considerable portion of the fan base that dropped the viewing habit on Sundays.) <br/><br/>And yet, even from the viewpoint of this obvious fan, the movie doesn't have the punch of some of the best TV episodes. There are two reasons for that, one obvious, one complex. It's easy to see how the belly-shaking impact of a half-hour program (minus commercials), such as the family's trips to Japan and South America, could not be replicated over an ad-free 90 minutes. (Actually, the movie sneaks in a commercial, and then gloats over it.) <br/><br/>The other issue is a matter of speculation. Interview after interview with the Simpsons creators and cast stressed how much more work went into the movie than into TV episodes, preparations for the film spreading over years. They might have tried a bit too hard, instead of the easy, elegant charm of the best of the series.<br/><br/>Beyond such belly-gazing, the story of Homer's environmental crime and attempts to rescue Springfield from the consequences (EPA acting as Homeland Security on steroids) begins splendidly, the first half of the film bouncing from laugh to laugh. Things slow down a bit in the second half, but at no point does the ""Simpsons Movie"" justify giving director David Silverman, series creator Matt Groening, and Supreme Simpsonite James L. Brooks a wedgie. (Although it would be fun, ha-haaa!)"
