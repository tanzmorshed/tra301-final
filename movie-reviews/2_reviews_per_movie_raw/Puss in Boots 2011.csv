"Smells_Like_Cheese","7","68","77","14 November 2011"," We must all prepare for Puss! In Boots!
","When I first rented Shrek a few years ago, I have to admit that I was a little disappointed, not that it wasn't a good movie, I just didn't think it was as big a deal as people were making it out to be. But I had also rented the second one and I couldn't stop laughing, one of the main reasons was the character Puss in Boots. A popular character in fairy tales, I loved their spin on him and with Antonio Banderas's voice, you just couldn't go wrong. However, Shrek 3 and 4 didn't hold up so well when they continued the stories. Even Puss seemed to be lacking interest. So naturally I was really nervous when I found out they were making a spin off with him as the star, Hollywood needs money and Puss would pull it in for them. Well I saw the movie today and I can honestly say that if Hollywood just wanted my money, I'm glad to hand it over because Puss in Boots is a very cute movie.<br/><br/>Puss learns that two murderous outlaws, Jack and Jill have the magic beans he's been looking for half his life, which lead to a giant's castle holding valuable golden goose eggs. Puss then meets his old childhood friend Humpty Dumpty, who introduces another cat as Kitty Softpaws, one of the best cat thieves in the world. They ask him to join them in finding the beans, planting them, and getting the golden eggs which lie at the top. Puss refuses to work with Humpty due to a past betrayal that left him falsely accused for robbery, alienating him from his hometown and adoptive mother. After Humpty explains to Puss that he wants a second chance, Puss agrees to help him obtain the beans, making it clear that he is doing it for the town and his mother and to win back the respect he once had.<br/><br/>I always loved Puss in Boots, but I didn't know that he could actually carry a movie. I wished he used his ""cute look"" more often, but I have to admit for the one they use during his jail scene was more than worth the wait and was way too funny. Kitty Softpaws was very nicely voiced by Selma, her character was a lot of fun and for an animated movie had great chemistry with Puss. Humpty Dumpty was the only character that wasn't that interesting to me, though his story was pretty good and I liked the bond that he and Puss shared. The animation was still great as usual, seeing it in 3D added the dimension and looked very nice, though the 3D is really not needed for this one.<br/><br/>The story worked very well and I'm glad that Puss turned into a strong lead character. Even if the story is predictable, I love seeing the hero rise tale, it's always so uplifting. I think it's a great movie for the kids and adults. It doesn't insult the kid's intelligence by making the movie too cute and there are jokes that even the adults could get into like how Puss is more a lover than a fighter. Though I thought it was kind of odd when he winked at a human lady, bestiality? Moving on, I really did enjoy Puss in Boots, I would recommend it and cannot wait to buy it when it comes out. This was exactly what the Shrek series needed to give it some life and I hope there is a sequel. Hollywood may be greedy at times, but at least with this film they got it right in giving us a great story with the most ferocious smooth talking cat on the planet.<br/><br/>7/10"

","Puss In Boots may be a little cliche and the twist may not make a whole lot of sense, but that doesn't mean that this movie isn't entertaining, action packed and funny."
"CaptMTS","9","70","86","29 October 2011"," Fun Movie for Kids and Adults
","Puss in Boots was what I expected - interesting characters, some great laughs (including the Shrek-like humor for adults only), and an interesting backstory. Unfortunately, no cameos from major Shrek characters (I always get a kick out of Gingy).<br/><br/>Antonio Banderas does a great job voicing the ""hero"" Puss, and the movie provides Puss' history with some good laughs and great images. The big eyes look of the adult Puss is topped by the young Puss, and we learn how Puss received his name and his boots.<br/><br/>Humpty Dumpty is Puss' long-time friend, who becomes jealous of the young hero Puss and betrays him. But, Humpty Dumpty returns with a plan to achieve their lifelong goal - get the goose that lays the golden eggs. Humpty Dumpty has some funny lines and great visual humor. My favorite was Humpty wearing a golden egg costume.<br/><br/>Joining the adventure and rounding out the trio is Kitty Soft Paws, who transitions from Puss' nemesis to love interest. The pair has some great chemistry for animated characters. Their adventures include run-ins with Jack & Jill (not what anyone will expect), magic beans, the beanstalk, and the goose that lays the golden egg.<br/><br/>Overall, kids and adults will love the movie for its humor, cute characters, and action. Puss in Boots is a worthy spin-off of Shrek. And, the movie has a great message about learning from our mistakes, retribution, and making good choices."
"DICK STEEL","8","46","58","20 November 2011"," A Nutshell Review: Puss in Boots
","Shrek had run its course, having forcefully pushed itself into a fourth film that was really too trying, but I suppose Puss in Boots, introduced in the second film of the franchise, proved to have nine lives, and extended his longevity through a spin off film of his own. After all, there are plenty of cat lovers out there, and his antics in the Shrek movies were undoubtedly the highlights when the Ogre and his pet donkey were getting really tired. Originally intended for straight to video, Puss in Boots proved to have what it takes for a big screen outing, and it didn't disappoint.<br/><br/>Dreamworks Animation may seem to have a stranglehold on making a mickey out of well known fairy tales, and this continues in its re-imagining of characters adopted for the Puss in Boots origin story, where we go into his background as an orphaned kitty cat brought up by Imelda (voiced by Constance Marie), only to disappoint his foster mum when he got betrayed by best friend Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), a brilliant inventive and creative mind who had turned to a life of crime, staining the honor that Puss had gained through a heroic deed, banishing him forever as an outlaw and bandit.<br/><br/>The two major story arcs in this film enriched the narrative, one dealing with the past of Puss in Boots, while the other having him reluctantly team up with Humpty once again if only to get close to his new squeeze, the master thief Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), to take on the very grown up and nasty Bonnie and Clyde inspired Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thorton and Amy Sedaris), who are in possession of the fabled magical beans belonging to the other Jack (and the Beanstalk), where planting them at the correct spot would mean a path to the heavens to gain access to the goose that lays golden eggs, with repercussions of course that comes with a force of nature to be reckoned with.<br/><br/>What worked for Puss in Boots were the strengths of its story arcs, the major set action pieces, the voice cast really providing that level of flair to the many flamboyant characters in the film as well as dramatic, emotional depth to key characters, and who can forget the comedy. There are plenty of sight and verbal gags, and innuendos galore that hardly a moment goes by without something naturally hilarious happening, and does so quite subtly without screaming and forcing their way down your throat. Which I had found the later Shrek films guilty of doing just that.<br/><br/>Antonio Banderas provides the voice for Puss in Boots, and it's quite convenient that the character gets modelled after Zorro through a series of identifiable elements from costuming, behaviour as well as style, a character that Banderas himself have played twice in live action films. Puss continues to drawn upon established abilities especially that of its iconic hypnotic eyes, which somehow in a self-fulfilling fourth wall prophecy, will have any audience in stitches as well as held in captivating aww/awe. Zach Galifianakis voices the misunderstood character Humpty Dumpty to perfection, providing that balance of villainy and sympathy, while I suspect that the animators would have had a field day with Humpty especially with the plenty of movement gags that he got himself into, and playing upon none too subtle fat jokes on the character, resulting in the character stealing the scene most of the time. Hayek on the other hand did just enough providing her sultriness to the incredibly sexy feline that looked like, erm, Batman in costume.<br/><br/>Hitting the right notes consistently throughout the film, here's a pussy cat that's both a lover and a fighter and a film that can appeal to both young and the not too young at heart alike. The producers of Shrek and Kungfu Panda may have found itself another character that has enough legs to carry off yet another franchise on its own, but please don't let it merge or include characters from Shrek too soon, as this kitty deserves a rogues gallery and supportive allies of its own. Recommended!"
"lpucci","Null","65","86","20 October 2011"," A worthy yet slightly flawed successor
","I was able to see the San Francisco premiere for Puss N' Boots last night. I would say the audience was about 50% children and 50% adults. The movie was shown in 3D and I would definitely recommend it.<br/><br/>The star of the movie was definitely Banderas's Puss. If you liked the character from previous movies, you will not be disappointed. Salma Hayak as Kitty Softpaws was decent enough although not very memorable in any way. And finally, Zach Galifianakis's Humpty Dumpty will be a polarizing character in my opinion. If you thought Rumpelstiltskin from Shrek Forever After was a tad on the annoying side, I think you'll feel the same way about Humpty Dumpty.<br/><br/>Anyways, the story is good. The integration of former players in nursery rhymes and fairy tales is seamless. And the comedy is standard Shrek-style delivering lots of laughs for children and the occasional adult-only joke (some very funny).<br/><br/>The visuals are stunning. And the music is fantastic. It almost felt like an action-packed spaghetti western with a Latin flavor. I definitely enjoyed myself. I also talked to quite a few people afterwords and the consensus was that the children all loved it and the adults kept using the word ""cute"" in so many different ways to describe their feelings about the movie."
"wildwesth","10","11","12","5 November 2011"," Beautiful and fun
","A fine, fun adventure for kids and their parents. I saw it in old-fashioned 2D and a couple of scenes knocked my socks off. First and foremost, the acting was superb. Antonio Banderas is a remarkable voice actor. His acting, and his comedic timing, combined with one incredible scene have made the film forever memorable.<br/><br/>And that scene is the scene when the magic bean stalk grows. There are only a very few motion picture sequences in the history of cinema that are so beautiful, amazing and filled with spirit they touch you down to the toes. I was awe struck.<br/><br/>We remember such cinematic and artistic genius in scenes from Gone With the Wind, Citizen Kane, Lawrence of Arabia, Bambi, 2001's light show sequence and a very few other films that have gone on to become classics.<br/><br/>The only film in the last five years that had such a stunning shot was in Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, when we are flown onto the workshop floor where whole planets are being made. The scene pulls you in with such artistry and beauty that your jaw drops and you realize you are seeing something truly magical and wondrous.<br/><br/>That is the best way to describe the scene in Puss In Boots when the main characters are caught up into the sky and playing among the clouds in that most remarkable sequence as the beanstalk shoots upward in graceful vines exploding lyrically with life. It is sure to become a part of motion picture legend, as legendary as the scene in Bambi when winter first arrives and Bambi and his friends play in the snow and on the ice; or the scene in Star Wars where we are whisked into hyperspace for the very first time, or the Millennium Falcon is pulled into the death star.<br/><br/>The whole film is just great. But this is the greatest moment and nails the entire film as a contender for becoming a classic."
"cheesybites1","9","14","16","1 November 2011"," Cute movie and surprisingly had an actual plot
","I wondered how they would make an entire movie of Puss In Boots, but I loved him in Shrek so I wanted to see this movie. It starts off kind of boring but when you see the plot develop it gets good. I like the introduction of a worthy opponent who of course is a female feline. Humpty creeped me out the entire movie but I felt justified at the end as to why I never warmed up to him. Kind of reminds you of Rumplestiltskin in the last Shrek. It's a mixture of action, sad flashbacks, cuteness (seeing Puss as a kitten is adorable!) and I guess you could call it tragedy but not too much as of course movies like this always have a happy ending. Also the references to fairy tales was enjoyable as in the Shrek films. I would see this movie again, it's not a riveting, thought-provoking film by any means but for what it was and what I was expecting it did pretty well!"

","""Puss-in-Boots"" is one of the funniest and most entertaining animated movies I have seen in recent times. Its not perfect by any means, as some parts seem to drag and at times the movie felt a bit too long for its own good, but on the whole it made for a nice viewing.<br/><br/>I remember a decade or more ago when CGI movies were an event to behold. Each release was noteworthy. Movies like the original ""Toy Story"", ""Finding Nemo"", ""Ice Age"", ""Monsters Inc."" and the first ""Shrek"". To that veritable gallery I would venture to add the spectacularly underrated ""Final Fantasy"". When I saw that movie back in 1999 (damn, I can't believe that was soo long ago...holly crap I'm getting old!), the potential of CGI movies was fully revealed. I thoroughly enjoyed the visionary creativity of that film, especially since it had a more mature, adult slant (something sorely lacking in CGI movies, especially in North America, where CGI movies seem to be exclusively aimed at a young audience).<br/><br/>Since then technology has advanced by leaps and bounds and so have CGI movies. Now it seems that there is one of them coming out every other week. This has not necessarily translated into an all-around positive effect, because while their quantity has increased, their quality has steadily declined. Adding 3D effects and cutesy side-kicks cannot make up for the lack of having a compelling story, an interesting plot and well developed characters.<br/><br/>This brings me back to ""Puss-In-Boots"". This movie has all that, a compelling story, a good message, funny characters and a lot of humour, including a healthy dose of those ""in-jokes"" intended for the adults in the audience, in most cases the parents who tag along with their kids to watch the movie. That makes it a truly good family viewing because not only will the children have a good time, but there is plenty for the adults to enjoy too.<br/><br/>""Puss-In-Boots"" is the most entertaining CGI (animated) movie I've seen since ""Despicable Me"" and ""Monsters Vs. Aliens"". Not on par with the gem that was ""UP"", but a solid offering of funny!<br/><br/>""We found a bag of catnip on you!"" jail guard. ""Its for my glaucoma!"", Puss. <br/><br/>Enough said..."
"Gordon-11","Null","15","18","15 January 2012"," An enjoyable adventure
","This film is about a cat and an egg, who have been childhood friends, working together to find the golden goose to repay the town what they robbed years ago.<br/><br/>""Puss in Boots"" is an adventure filled with fun and action. It has cute characters and colourful animation for children to enjoy. Puss has a wide variety of facial expressions, some of which are so cute that he is irresistibly cuddly. The songs and dance provide great entertainment too. Adults will find ""Puss in Boots"" entertaining too, as the plot is filled with proper adventure that is appropriate for both adults and children. The brotherhood subplot is strong and gripping, and provide the emotional elements to make ""Puss in Boots"" even more credible as a film for the whole family. I enjoyed watching it."
"TourettesPersonal","6","47","69","28 October 2011"," Boots Too Tight
","Puss in Boots is one of my favorite characters in the Shrek series. Giving him a stand alone film is an interesting idea. It's suppose to be cool and exciting. It get what it wants. The movie is fun and often hilarious. The cat jokes are clever. Bunch of impressive scenes. The 3D is great. The scale is large. But the plot is too small for its large scale. It gets lazy in the second half and a bit predictable in the end. Though the film is pretty enjoyable but it could have been a lot better.<br/><br/>Puss In Boots starts in a solid blockbuster way. And one part of the beginning, the dancing, is very impressive. It's more than funny. That scene excites me which gives me a feeling that this film will be very great. I don't know why but it's just my feeling. The first half is exciting and great to introduce the cat hero. But when it comes to the second half(after the flashback), it's large but the story has a very little plot. It's a big adventure but ends up a little bit unsatisfying.<br/><br/>The story is like what Dreamworks Animated films usually do. Flashbacks of these critters when they were babies. They grew up being themselves. The rest of the story of Puss In Boots is Jack in the Beanstalk with Puss in Boots and Humpty Dumpty. It's not faithful to the original story. It's just another fairytale collaboration but this one has Mexican culture. The problem is the laziness of the storytelling. They mixed all the fairytale stories and threw some heart. These things are collaborated and nothing else. It's close to Direct-to-Video type of storytelling since this film was originally planned to be that.<br/><br/>But the film is never meant to be in the small screen since the scale is large. The movie is in 3D, as usual. The 3D is great. Just like Megamind, the camera is flying again. Swashbuckling cats and a lot giant stuff. The humor is clever. The natural instincts of cats are used as a joke. Like drinking milk, chasing a light, and some meows. It's adorable. The ""Ooooh"" cat is the ""Do the roar"" kid of this film. Here's the thing, cats are adorable and their instincts are funny.<br/><br/>In the end, it's just like Monsters Vs. Aliens and Shark Tale. But this has its heart but it's not well executed. It's still enjoyable to watch in the big screen and 3D. The filmmaking is good enough and everything is large. It just needs to make the story better. The film has ambitions for a sequel. Well I got to admit, it really needs a sequel because this adventure is not quite satisfying. More adventures to this kitty cat could be fun. Again, this film is fun but it won't blow your mind or touch your heart too much."
"Boba_Fett1138","7","7","8","3 February 2012"," Pulls itself away from the Shrek franchise, which is a good thing.
","Like many others, I was getting fed up with the Shrek movies. The characters, the way they were structured. It all made it obvious something fresh and new was needed to spice up the series and make things interesting and fun to see again. The way they did this was by releasing this spin-off, which involved just the popular Puss in Boots character, from the previous 3 Shrek movies, voiced again by Antonio Banderas.<br/><br/>So basically this movie is being set in the same Shrek universe but without some of the familiar tropes and characters. This allows ""Puss in Boots"" to do its own thing and picks its own course. The movie definitely differs in style, humor and its buildup, from all of the Shrek movies. And this is a good thing really. It makes this movie like a much needed breath of fresh air for the entire franchise. However I'm still now more interested in seeing a ""Puss in Boots 2"" than a ""Shrek 5"".<br/><br/>Simply said; this is a very entertaining movie. It's a movie that lets you sit back and make you enjoy the ride. It's filled with some great new and fun character, good humor and some nice action in it as well.<br/><br/>The story is not great but it definitely serves its purpose. It provides the movie with plenty of action and adventure elements. Besides, it also provides the the origin- and background story of the Puss in Boots character, which I'm sure lots of people would be interested in.<br/><br/>Absolutely no other characters, from any of the previous Shrek movies, appear in this movie. This means that this movie introduces a whole lot of new characters but luckily not too many though. Basically only two are really important; Kitty Softpaws, the love interest and Humpty Dumpty, the villain, voiced by Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis. And they are welcome as characters in this movie. Especially Humpty Dumpty, who is of course absurd to have as a villain, works out really well and entertaining for the movie and Zach Galifianakis did a great job voicing him.<br/><br/>It's still mostly being a kids movie but that of course does not mean it's not fun for adults to watch as well. There are some jokes and references, which only the adults will get, while there is still plenty of silly and slapstick comedy in this movie to amuse the youngest kids. In other words; it's a good family movie!<br/><br/>Visually and technically these movies are also only getting better and better. Especially the movements for all of the characters also seem more fluent than ever, which allows them to do a lot of convincing fighting and battling in this movie, sometimes even the two combined.<br/><br/>Simply a very entertaining movie, that more than serves its purpose and is a real much needed breath of fresh air, after already 4 Shrek movies.<br/><br/>7/10 <br/><br/>http://bobafett1138.blogspot.com/"
"musanna-ahmed","8","7","8","21 December 2011"," Dreamworks have Booted the series back into the right direction
","DreamWorks Animation – continuing to cash out by releasing sequels and spin-offs to their higher grossing films, Puss in Boots being their second one of the year. <br/><br/>Is this a bad thing? Well as long as they are consistent, of course not. Kung Fu Panda 2 was one of those; it was a fantastic sequel that was a success both financially and critically. The reason for this was despite the unoriginal, familiar narrative, it was gorgeous to look at every scene in Kung Fu Panda 2 with the 3D incorporated plus there was more than enough charm in the characters and wit in the dialogue for it to conclude satisfyingly. Puss in Boots is just the same, except it has an advantage.<br/><br/>That advantage being that it is a significant improvement on the latter half of the Shrek films. So how is this advantageous? Because Kung Fu Panda 2 may have had high expectations for some and therefore left those ones disappointed that it didn't reach the heights the original one did, but Puss in Boots restores faith in the quality-diminishing Shrek series.<br/><br/>For one, it replenishes the energy in the scenes that vibrated the first two Shrek films and comes complete with the sharp, funny dialogue. Again, this instalment in the series is pop culture potshot galore. For the younger target audience that are unlikely to understand the humour in some of the dialogue, there is plenty of physical humour in the film provided. My personal favourite intertextual reference had to be at the beginning of the friendship between Humpty Dumpty (voice of Zach Galifianakis) and Puss (Antonio Banderas) when Humpty tells him about his bean collecting – ""First rule of bean club, you do not talk about bean club."" It gives many nods to classic Westerns – as well as taking their clichés and utilising them for its own story. <br/><br/>Puss in Boots is an outlaw, this being established in the pre-title sequence as he enters the bar and gets into some trouble as every protagonist in a Western has done. He is then set on his own mission to escape his town, named El Ricardo, as a fugitive and along the way bumps into what he refers to as a ""baaad kitty"" – Kitty (voice of Salma Hayek), a female sword-fighting cat along with Humpty whom Puss already knew. The storyline then shifts into a quest for the three to steal magic beans from the local notorious criminals Jack (voice of Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (voice of Amy Sedaris) and use them to grow a beanstalk leading to Giant's castle and grab the golden goose, which should somewhat eventually erase Puss' status as an outlaw. I found this movie to be reminiscent of The Mask of Zorro, and not just because Antonio Banderas is the lead.<br/><br/>The voice acting is good as it always has been in the Shrek series. The casting department has seemed to have newfound talent in Billy Bob Thornton and Zach Galifianakis, who had not had previous voice credits under their names bar, the English version of Princess Monokoke for Bob Thornton. They bring their characters to life as much as possible but that leads me to state a criticism. Character development is lacking in this film. Who each of these characters start with is really how they end up too, with the odd moment here and there where they deliver some philosophical line that they believe in, which is typical in virtually every Hollywood film. However, the each of the characters' character has enough charm and wit to keep the film entertaining for the full 90 minutes and conclude satisfyingly. That last comment was similar to what I stated about Kung Fu Panda 2. And for that same reason, plus the fact that low expectations generated after the failures of Shrek the Third and Forever After will be fulfilled, Puss in Boots is recommended. Plus it's gorgeous to look at every scene in 3D here too. DreamWorks Animation has done it again, hitting two home runs with the same bat, labelled Sequel/Spin-offs, this year."

","'Puss in boots' actually wasn't that bad of a movie like i thought it would be from the trailer they showed on TV. they were more focused on the fact that its a cat who other cat fall in love with then the fact the movie has an actual plot and its not about the cat being a womanizer or something like that. its also in some aspects follows events from the actually tale which reminded me half way through that Puss In Boots is actually a tale and not a character invented by Dreamworks.<br/><br/>the 3D offcours was awesome and in many parts of the movie you feel like dancing to the music thats playing or just staring at these interesting characters and the sounds they make.<br/><br/>not so much as the best cartoon even but its definatelly watchable and i cant wait for the sequel !"
"Chris_Pandolfi","7","11","14","28 October 2011"," The Cat Came Back
","If you were to ask me who my favorite character is from the ""Shrek"" films, I would have to say Gingy, the Gingerbread Man. Apart from getting a kick out of his hilariously exaggerated voice, I've always had a certain fondness for him; he's so small, and yet he's capable of doing big things, like defiantly telling Lord Farquaad to eat him and then spitting into his eye. And believe you me, no other character could have delivered the line, ""We're up Chocolate Creek without a popsicle stick!"" But don't get me wrong, I like Puss in Boots a great deal. How can anyone not like him? He's an adorable orange cat with a cool swashbuckling getup and a magnetic Spanish voice. It's no wonder to me that he's the star of his own spin off film. While it gave me nothing new as far as family-friendly animated comedies go, ""Puss in Boots"" is bright, beautifully rendered, and just plain fun.<br/><br/>I used the word ""bright."" Let me make it clear that I'm referring to the film's tone. Had I been smart and seen it in 2D, then maybe the word would have had double meaning. But no, I had to see it in picture-dimming 3D, which was not immersive so much as it was assaulting. It begins the instant the film starts; the boy on the DreamWorks Animation logo takes his fishing rod and swings it around like a whip, causing the line to snap directly at our faces. There are many moments like that in this movie, which may account for why it contains more than its fair share of action. One sequence has Puss running across rooftops, through windows, and between alleyways; the problem is that much of it is seen from his perspective, so the objects that constantly zoom past do nothing but blur our field of vision.<br/><br/>But I'm just rehashing my usual complaints about the 3D process, which I'm sure you're tired of at this point. Let's move on. The CGI is impressive, the characters are appealing, and the plot is serviceable for both children and adults alike. Although the location has shifted from the forests of Far Far Away to a costal Mexican village, making it more of an animated western parody, the film is very much a fantasy, and like the ""Shrek"" films, it pokes fun at characters from nursery rhymes and fairy tales. There is, of course, Puss (voiced by Antonio Banderas) – suave and seductive, less a figure of children's literature and more a feline reboot of Zorro. Exclusive to this story: Humpty Dumpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis), who must supply at least one egg-related pun (""I'll tell you this: It ain't over easy!""); and Mr. and Mrs. Jack and Jill (voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), murderous thugs built like hulking trolls. The idea of them procreating is just shy of nauseating, hence the joke that they always talk about starting a family.<br/><br/>The story involves Puss and Humpty reteaming after years of being apart. I will not divulge the specifics of their separation, except that they were raised as brothers in a local orphanage. Together, they plot to steal three magic beans from Jack and Jill, climb the gigantic beanstalk to a castle in the clouds, and find the Goose That Laid the Golden Eggs. Tagging along is a new character, Kitty Softpaws (voiced by Selma Hayek), a master pickpocket and Puss' inevitable love interest. They meet under circumstances common in action films: He fights under the incorrect assumption that she was a man. Well, that isn't quite true; they don't fight so much as dance competitively. Only in a cartoon world can you successfully blend martial arts with flamenco.<br/><br/>Apart from the bold visual style, I took notice of Henry Jackman's score, skillfully composed in the style of Hollywood westerns. You probably know the sound I'm talking about – trumpets, castanets, Spanish guitars, and whistling comprise the bulk of the orchestra throughout much of the movie. I found it very infectious, especially during the aforementioned dance sequence. More dancing is reserved for the start of the end credits. You'll appreciate this if you're a cat owner, as I am; rows of cats ""dance"" by playing with spots of light moving on the floor in perfect unison. I can personally attest to the fact that cats are very easily distracted by random points of light. God help me if I use a flashlight or laser pointer in my house.<br/><br/>I digress. I cannot sit here and say that ""Puss in Boots"" is the year's best animated film, because it most definitely isn't. But the long and short of it is, it achieved everything it wanted to achieve, and I certainly enjoyed watching it. Here is a film children won't mind watching and parents won't mind taking them to see – provided, of course, that they can save the extra money and see it in standard 2D. I wouldn't blame them for making that decision. If they're paying your way in, they deserve the privilege of a bright picture, bold colors, and scenes that don't have swords and cats flying out at you. I would wager kids would like it better that way, too. And now that this film has been made, I think it would be a good idea for the ""Shrek"" people to tell a story based on Gingy. I just love that guy, don't you?<br/><br/>-- Chris Pandolfi (www.atatheaternearyou.net)"
"Bravesfan17","8","14","19","29 October 2011"," A rip roaring good time.
","I went into this film, wanting to see it but with mild expectations. The director of this film is Chris Miller, whose most recent film as a director was Shrek the Third, which I thought was the worst one of that series. He has redeemed himself here. Something I noticed on this film was that Miller relied more on the story in the film, rather than put in too many pop culture references.<br/><br/>Antonio Banderas comes back from the Shrek series to voice Puss in Boots, once again. Banderas shows that there is no other actor who can voice this cat. In his own film, Banderas makes Puss into a much more lovable character. In the story, Puss is an outlaw in his hometown of San Ricardo. If seen, he will be arrested and put behind bars indefinitely. He has a mission to find magic beans.<br/><br/>Immediately, he has an unknown rival who is also after the same magic beans. After a long series of chasing and fighting, we find out that it is Kitty Soft Paws, voiced by Salma Hayek. Hayek does great a voicing this sassy cat with no claws, and can steal from one without that one realizing it.<br/><br/>It turns out that she was working with an old friend turned nemesis of Puss named Humpty Alexander Dumpty, voiced by Zach Galifianakis. Zach does an excellent job of becoming this socially awkward egg, who needs Puss for a job involving the magic beans. However, Humpty has a secret of his own.<br/><br/>These magic beans are heavily guarded by a husband and wife bandit couple named Jack and Jill, who are voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris. They are after the same thing Puss and Humpty are after, and want the rewards all to themselves. Thornton does a bit of a mix of his own regular voice and the voice he used when he was Karl Childers in his film Sling Blade. Sedaris made Jill sound like an angry hick.<br/><br/>The story is fun as it is about who Puss in Boots was before he met Shrek and Donkey. The five main characters were all well developed and well played. The visuals in this film are stunning. The animation was spectacular as the scenery is amazing. The music is great as it feels part spaghetti western, part modern day swashbuckling tale.<br/><br/>As for a family film. the kids will enjoy it. The parents will be able to sit through it and enjoy a good story for themselves. Even those who are not kids or parents, like myself, will enjoy watching this film."

","From the Shrek movies comes the Puss in Boots character voiced by Antonio Banderas with all the charm one expects from the character with the addition of Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) and Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zack Galifianakis) also joining for a fun ride of trying to avoid being pursued by Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). Many funny scenes and lines but also much dramatically compelling close calls abound especially in 3-D. Many amusing mixups of various fairy tales with ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" being mostly used as source.

","Many of my friends said that this movie was nothing to be excited about and I watched it without high expectation to fill my evening. <br/><br/>But I have to admit, I was very nicely surprised - honestly, this movie is one of the best motion pictures I've ever seen: It has stunning visuals, an amazingly written and animated choreography (both for the fights and for the dances - every hair, every muscle of the cats just plays so nicely), it shows great love to the most tiny detail, good and easy to follow story (which is not always the best, but it's an animated movie kids should understand, so this time it's desired), it sports a well written and most importantly well played/animated love story, quite good action, well placed references to other media (First rule of bean club...) and of course - the cats. <br/><br/>OK, I admit - I'm a cat person, I basically am a cat, so that probably casts a slight shadow on my review but still, Puss in Boots is a very good movie.<br/><br/>Two things I would change to make this movie simply the best movie of all times: come up with a better visual idea for Humpty Dumpty (he's really ugly) and place Jack Black in his role (though I guess his ego wouldn't comply too well with playing a sidekick :D)"

"Chrysanthepop","Null","3","3","15 April 2012"," Puss Deservedly Gets His Own Film
","Finally Puss gets his own movie and the absence of Shrek, Fiona and Donkey does not take away from this film. As a standalone, 'Puss in Boots' is sheer feline fun. It's much better than the last couple of Shrek flicks. The story, even though it follows the fairy tale path, is richer and more layered. Even Puss's boots have a significant role other than being his cool footwear.<br/><br/>The humour works splendidly. The creators have definitely come up with some cool innovative ideas. The inclusion of Humpty gives it a new and funny twist. The cat jokes and gags are a treat and they made me laugh out loud. There's also a fun catfight-dance sequence that's full of energy and even some sensuality. The adults jokes tickle the funny bones and are subtle enough not to make one uncomfortable when watching children. Yet, it includes dark themes, such as that of betrayal and death, which does make 'Puss in Boots' somewhat more mature than the usual fluff stuff.<br/><br/>The voice cast is excellent. Salma Hayek and Antonio Banderas reunite after appearing together in three films but this time they're cats. Their chemistry is certainly a plus. Zach Galifianakis is great as Puss's childhood friend turned enemy. Amy Sedaris is hilarious as Jill and the rest of the cast do a fine job.<br/><br/>The sense of adventure is maintained throughout. The animation and visuals are excellent and the editing is brilliant but the heart of 'Puss in Boots' is the writing: the story, the characters and the humour.<br/><br/>This just goes to show that how much Puss deserved his own film and with some fine support he is fully capable of carrying a story.º If there are going to be more Puss films, I only hope they manage to keep up with this level of quality and not go the 'Shrek' way."
"thesar-2","8","3","3","26 February 2012"," My Kind of Puss in Boots Movie
","Thank you Shrek for not only taking a back seatbut for not even showing up.<br/><br/>After the enormously disappointing last two Shrek films, his absence from the feature-length Puss In Boots, reminded me of the last major election when all Republican candidates distanced themselves far from the horrid George W. Bush endorsement. Heck, they didn't want to be even seen with him.<br/><br/>Puss's detachment from old pal Shrek was warmly welcomed as was the lack of the usual and over-used origin story attached to a spin-off movie. In fact, the short time they spent on how Puss got his boots, was fantastic, cute, original and a lot of fun. That said, I wouldn't want the whole film based around a Kitten Looking for Boots.<br/><br/>The movie as a whole a grand adventure, perfect for kids and adults. The story wasn't completely original and wildly predictable, but it was perfect for the younglings while the adventure, action, comedy and homage excellent for adults.<br/><br/>And speaking of homage, the inevitable and integrated Shrek-franchise fairy-tales weren't over done and more part of the story, than (said in best MadTV Stuart's voice) ""Look at what I can do!"" from the previous movies. On a personal note, these are the ones I most grew up with: Humpty (Alexander) Dumpty and Jack and the Beanstalk. (That last one was one of my all-time favorites as a kid, and when Disney redid it, oh, it was like Christmas.)<br/><br/>Puss and an oh-so-not-mysterious dueling cat team up with said Mr. Dumpty to get the goose that lays the golden eggs, but are wanted by the town folk and chased by, ah hem, Jack and Jill. (Now why couldn't Adam Sandler's feature length film take be as entertaining?) Puss needs to clear his name and save the town while finding time for love.<br/><br/>There. That was the basic premise. See? Great for kids. As was all the adventure and inventive scenes and gorgeous cinematography and graphics. This all will entertain adults as well, not boring them for a moment.<br/><br/>Finally, Antonio Banderas, who already starred in 3 previous films with this same character, breathes fresh life into the best character in the entire Shrek franchise. Unlike Cleveland from Family Guy, this character not only deserved his own spin-off, he can carry it. Further, most minor/secondary characters need to rely on those kooky new characters to fill in the gaps of the normal 90-minute timeframe. Not this time; while the co-stars were fun and entertaining, Puss held his own throughout and makes me welcome a Puss 2 Boots.<br/><br/>As long as it's more Puss Adventures and NOT leading us any closer to his meeting of Shrek."
"SpiffDico","Null","3","3","5 January 2012"," Kitty's got enough lives to make it!
","Now before we begin, I'll make this quick on what i thought of the Shrek films. The first one, at the time, was a clever work of art that got Mike Myers and Eddie Murphy as a pretty good duo of animation voices for quite a while now. It was fresh, new, and one of Dreamwork's best CGI animated features. Shrek 2, was absolutely amazing. It took everything that made the original Shrek good and made it an amazing comedy! It introduced Puss in Boots as a spin-off of Zorro just hysterical, ESPECIALLY since he's played by Antonio Banderas, who played Zorro in the Martin Campbell movies, Mask of Zorro and Legend of Zorro. Overall, Shrek 2 is by far one of the best sequels that could ever be made by Dreamworks. Now for Shrek the Third and Shrek Forever After, all i got to say for those films is.......meh. they were okay.<br/><br/>So now, Dreamworks still has a good hold for the franchise, but now with Puss in Boots. So how was it? well, let's discuss it first.<br/><br/>The movie's what you expect it to be, an origin story of the whiskered outlaw with boots. It explains his backstory on how he became an outlaw and what he did to redeem himself of being no longer the villain his home town thought him to be, seven years after he was betrayed by a former comrade. For what it gives us, it's a pretty entertaining movie and shows a lot to give.<br/><br/>Antonio Banderas reprises his role as Puss, and does a good a job as he always he does. Salma Hayek plays Kitty Softpaws, Puss's love interest and a master thief. She could take the shirt off your back so fast, it'd take you 10 seconds to realize you lost it. Hayek's not unfamiliar with working with Banderas, so she knows the right style of acting to choose with him. Zach Galifianakis plays Humpty Alexander Dumpty, and is pretty good in the role. Despite being in the Hangover movies with barely anything funny once in a while, he at least tries to give a pretty good performance. Guillermo del Toro has a pretty good cameo in the film, and it works out well, since he's also the executive producer of the film.<br/><br/>One more thing I want to talk about is the 3D in this film, and this film's in the category for good 3D. Animation. The animation in the film, while CG, is gorgeous. Dreamworks has a thing for making such well made animated films, becoming it's own stronghold for CG animation, along with some of their films to have some well done action. Sure, i still prefer hand drawn animation, but i'm not saying CG animation is bad. I'm just saying it's overused. But back to the 3D. Like i said, animated films are one of the only category in movies that work best for 3D. And for this, it looks amazing. Is it as good as Pixar 3D movies? No, but it's still worth it.<br/><br/>Overall, Puss in Boots is a fun family film that really knows how to be entertaining. It's comedy, action, and dark story all in one."
"neil-476","8","5","6","14 December 2011"," Very good but not purrfect
","Given that Shrek, as a self-contained full-length feature franchise, has not so much reached the end of the line as hit the buffers at full speed, a Puss In Boots spin-off is an excellent idea.<br/><br/>Carrying virtually no Shrek continuity (other than being set in a world where familiar fairy tale happenings are regular everyday occurrences) this film tells a tale from Puss's younger days, including his childhood as an orphan, his friendship with the conflicted Humpty Dumpty, and how it all goes horribly wrong. This leads to a present-day(-ish) adventure involving Jack and Jill (who turn out to be not at all what you would have expected), some magic beans, a beanstalk, a goose which lays golden eggs, and a cat burglar called Kitty Softpaws.<br/><br/>The film, set firmly in what one might call Zorroland is, as one might expect, technically excellent - set design, character design, voice, talent, animation and 3D are all flawless. There are a lot of good gags too, some laugh out loud stuff.<br/><br/>Somehow it doesn't quite all fit together, although I'm hard put to say why. It doesn't quite have the heart that the first Shrek movie did, for instance. But it is still an excellent family film, and merits a sequel. One can also imagine a Donkey spin off..."
"chris-massa","Null","24","43","4 November 2011"," Better than expected, but far from greatness.
","""Puss in Boots"" is a perfect example of a movie I absolutely never would have seen if I hadn't gotten a pass to a free screening. And if I had gone to see it — and, to reiterate, I wouldn't have — there's simply no way I would have seen it in 3D. But it was free, so I did. I guess you could say I had low expectations.<br/><br/>Some background: I loved ""Shrek"", I basically couldn't stand ""Shrek 2"", in part because I found the Puss in Boots character more annoying than charming, and I never bothered with the other ""Shrek"" sequels. Life is just too short. So I expected ""Puss in Boots"" to be, at best, tolerable, stupid, and intermittently funny. Imagine my surprise when I found that it was somewhat better than tolerable, more than intermittently funny, and actually kind of clever.<br/><br/>The story, as should be expected from a member of the ""Shrek"" lineage, plays fast and loose with fairy tale characters, plot points, and conventions. Puss, an orphaned cat now branded as an outlaw, joins forces with Humpty Dumpty, an egg of questionable intent, and Kitty Softpaws, a feline fatale, to steal the magic beans from Jack and Jill, grow a magic beanstalk, and find the golden goose of legend. Naturally, things don't go according to plan, and the plot thickens. It's pointless, but fun.<br/><br/>There are instances of real invention here. The first is the setting, which is sort of a medieval spaghetti western, although the western card was played better in ""Rango"". There are several great visual gags, like what happens to Humpty's covered wagon, and a dance fight that is easily the best part of the movie. Without giving anything away, I'll also say that, the more you think about the identity of the ""monster"", the funnier, and the more fitting, it becomes. However, the storytelling is sloppy at times. There's at least one plot point that is dispensed with far too quickly, and the fate of one character simply doesn't make sense. Still, it all kind of works, and the good parts are good enough to help you forget the shortcomings.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the movie is saved by its pacing and its animation, which, as much as I hate to admit it, is absolutely stunning in 3D. I can't recommend paying the 3D up-charge, but I will say that those who do will probably not be disappointed. This isn't a cheap, gimmicky use of 3D, but one that actual adds depth and detail. There was one particular scene, a chase that, oddly enough, reminded me of ""Honey, I Shrunk the Kids"", where I found the use of 3D really creative. Would I pay for the 3D? Probably not, but for those looking for a 3D experience, you could do a lot worse.<br/><br/>""Puss in Boots"" also raises the question of whether or not it's worth it to have major stars as voice actors. Actually, I take it back. This movie doesn't so much raise that question as answer it, resoundingly, with a no. As much fun as Antonio Banderas is as Puss, I'm not convinced that he brings anything to the role that a lesser known actor couldn't have brought. Salma Hayek and Zach Galifianakis are completely wasted as Kitty and Humpty. Billy Bob Thornton is a good choice as Jack, but that's largely because of the clever writing. Understand what I'm saying: I'm not being critical of these actors' work. I am being critical of the decision to cast them in a picture like this, where the most clever aspects of their characters come from the animation, not from the vocal performances. My suggestion would be to save the money needed to hire such big names, and use lesser known actors, perhaps from Broadway. That way, it would be easier for ""Puss in Boots"", a movie that many people will approach with a deserved amount of skepticism, to make money, and struggling actors will find more work. Believe me, the movie won't suffer from it.<br/><br/>This isn't high art. It's not nearly the equal of ""Shrek"", and it doesn't have one iota of the heart of most Pixar films, or of DreamWorks' ""How to Train Your Dragon"". But at the same time, it's not bad for what it is. It's clever, witty, well-made, and fast-paced. It's nothing like a masterpiece, but as far as diversions go, it's quite diverting."

Jack and Jill are just awful people, and the pig thing just didn't take. Humpty is just a psychopath with no redeeming features. I might have been able to overlook this more if Puss and Kitty had been strong characters with things to like, but they weren't.<br/><br/>The only time I raised a smile was during the dance-scene in the Glitter Box - and that was because of the patrons of the place, who I would have liked to have seen much more of.<br/><br/>So, beautifully filmed, exquisitely animated, but lacking in fun or imagination. I could have done something much more fulfilling with my afternoon."
"The-Sarkologist","3","22","43","9 December 2011"," The Shrek franchise is getting quite overdone.
","This is one of those films that as soon as it started it irritated me. I cannot really put my finger on it but to be honest with you, I really did not like it. For those who don't know, Puss in Boots (as played by Antonio Banderas) was one of the characters from the Shrek films (I believed that he first appeared in the second one). Now, I actually quite liked the character in Shrek, but this film seemed that it was pretty much attempting to capitalise on a franchise that is pretty much getting done to death.<br/><br/>Now, while Shrek is set in some fairy tale fantasy land, Puss in Boots appears to be set in Mexico. However, the odd thing is that at one point they suggested that it was Spain, however I do not believe Spain has any deserts with large mesas in it. While Spain appears to be a dry temperate country (much like Greece), the setting simply seemed to get to me. I did not seem to make sense that the character, who originally appears in some fairy tale, is suddenly in some sort of Mexican hero type movie, and bringing Humpty Dumpty (Zack Galifianakis) and Jack and Jill (as ugly looking bad guys) made the setting even more unbelievable. Okay, this is a cartoon, but if the whole purpose of a movie is to suspend ones disbelief, this film failed to do it.<br/><br/>We hear the back story of Puss in Boots in this film, but then the whole back story is irrelevant when one considers Shrek. Puss in Boots was a great character in Shrek, but did not work here, even though the whole film is based around it. The story is that Puss was an orphan dropped off in an orphanage, and there he meets Humpty Dumpty, and Humpty sets him up when he steals a heap of gold from the bank. They flee, but Humpty is caught, and Puss deserts him, not out of selfishness, but because Humpty betrayed him. Later, Puss meets another cat, Kitty Softpaws (have no idea who she is supposed to be, but I guess she is just a character created for the film) when he is trying to steal some magic beans, the same magic beans from Jack and the Beanstalk. I guess all I have to say is that and you can then work out the rest.<br/><br/>Seriously, attempting to bring European fairy tales into a Mexican setting really didn't work for me, but then I might work well for others. My brother enjoyed it, but then he has simple pleasures, and it might quite appeal to kids, but in the end, it really didn't appeal to me."
"lesleyharris30","9","6","9","12 December 2011"," This is how all Spin-Off Movies should be,
","Puss In Boots is a terrific film with a very well developed storyline and a brilliant voice cast. It's a very good spin off film, something that rarely turns out well, but this is an example of one that is done right, Puss in Boots was the perfect Shrek character to give a solo movie to, he's the most underdeveloped character and this movie provides us with plenty of information on his origins. The only thing I think is missing is more humour, it took itself much more seriously than the Shrek movies did, there are no characters, like Donkey, that provide comic relief, it is still quite funny but I felt, for an animated movie, it's a bit too stern. The voice cast is superb Antonio Banderas is voicing Puss for the fourth time now and it is abundantly clear that he is very comfortable with the character, Salma Hayek delivers with Softpaws, as does Zach Galifianakis with Humpty Dumpty, a very well written and flawed character. Entertaining, adventurous and fun for people of all ages, I would recommend Puss in Boots to anyone looking for s good family film. <br/><br/>Puss in Boots heads on a journey with an old friend and a new love interest in search of golden eggs."
"martinrobertson300482","4","10","19","25 January 2012"," ""Puss in boots"" use to be funny!
","Like most, i thought the ""Shrek"" movies were OK. ""Shrek 2"" was the best off the bunch by far, and this was partly (maybe even mostly) due to Antonio Banderas stepping in as the hilarious ""Puss in boots."" A spin off with him as the lead seemed like a good idea, but really, this just felt like ""Shrek 5"" this.<br/><br/>The Problem with the movie is that side characters tend too be way funnier in small doses. ""Puss in boots"" was the funniest character in the other movies, but here he feels over-used. I was expecting this film too be hilarious, but it really doesn't feel like their trying too make this a comedy, more another mish mash off different fairy tales. There just aren't that many funny jokes, and many off the gags are recycled or worse. I hate puns, and this film is full off them. Not only cat puns (a bar the cats in the flick go too is called the ""G""litter box, get it? Litter box? Sigh!) but ""Humpty Dumpty"" being in the movie leads too a number off God awful ""egg"" puns as well. Plus a lot off characters trousers seem too randomly drop down. Is this really such a great gag they feel the need too keep doing it? <br/><br/>Granted this was a hard one too pull off, and does have some amusing moments, but more focus has been put on the story than the humour. Trouble is, I wanted gags, and the plot is just a few classic fairy tales thrown together. Wasn't the original idea off ""Shrek"" too make fun off these classic ""Disney"" style stories. Feels more like this wants too be one, than a spoof off them. Disappointing!"
"Tubular_Bell","4","10","19","9 January 2012"," The only good thing about it is that it features cats.
","Dreamworks apparently managed to produce the ""Avatar"" or animated films: an un-thrilling story with dead tropes played straight, relentlessly obvious from beginning to end, and exhausting pretty much every cat-related joke and pun humanly imaginable. The main differences from Avatar is that it's not long enough to induce coma and that it has lots and lots of voice acting done by non-voice-actors -- but that, for Dreamworks, is business as usual.<br/><br/>Actually, the movie is not 100% obvious and predictable, but everything that is not obvious is abhorrently stupid. For some reason, these people still think it's hot and hip to senselessly mix up fairy tales and nursery rhymes in ways that plainly make no sense. It's random humour without wit, or as Internet jargon has it, ""lol random"". So, for much of the movie, we are treated to this horrifying, pestilent talking egg. And what does Humpty Dumpty have to do with the story after all? Exactly nothing. Dreamworks thinks that is funny, but it's not. Not only it's already old, it wasn't even funny when the first Shrek movie did it.<br/><br/>The only thing I actually like about the film is that it features cats. Loads of them. If you go nuts with pictures of cute kittens, this film will be a party for your eyes. THAT it does well. And, truth be told, the main character is pretty strong, and even though the movie really tries hard to make him shallow and annoying, they couldn't do it.<br/><br/>The rest is failure after failure. If you have at least two braincells in your head, this movie is a great way to achieve time travel: you're always 30 minutes ahead of it. Of course, predictability per se it not bad, but when there is absolutely nothing else going on, there is just no motivation to keep on watching. I gave up halfway through, and I only didn't walk out because I was too bored even for walking. Come on, THIS is the studio that produced Kung Fu Panda? I can hardly believe it.<br/><br/>One last positive side of this film is that it sealed the fate that I'll never watch another 3D movie. This one was the first and the last -- at least until people learn to use 3D to favour the film instead of vice versa. As of today, 3D basically amounts to you giving an obscene amount of money to Hollywood so they can through garbage on your face every 2 minutes. 3D does not aid the look and the atmosphere of the film, it needs atrociously ridiculous angles and effects to make it evident, and the fast-paced action scenes are just impossible to follow. I ACTUALLY found the film more watchable without the (dirty and uncomfortable) glasses on -- 3D was so bad that seeing double actually looked beautiful in comparison."

","Good animation. Good acting. I had good expectations going in and was wide awake. I wanted to like it. It was somewhat amusing in the beginning, but about half way through I found that I could hardly keep my eyes open and kept dozing off. I've often had that problem with animated features, as well as with non-stop action movies like the Transformers series. The problem seems to be that the characters don't seem real in any way, and the story makes no real sense, so it's hard to care about anything happening on the screen. Plus non-stop action just puts me to sleep. At the opposite extreme was Ratatouille, an animated feature that kept me completely engrossed, because it told a really good story. I'd rate that one as one of my favorite movies of all time. So I'm not prejudiced against animated features, per se.<br/><br/>Someday I want to mount a TV in the ceiling above my bed.

","I've been watching a lot of animated movies off late and am a cat lover as well! So there wasn't much of a debate whether to watch this movie or not. My opinion might be based on what I think an average animated movie watcher like me goes to a movie for. First is to see an unthinkable fantasy world come to animated life and second is to get some cute fun in the process. With this in mind I'd rate this movie an 8 out of 10.<br/><br/>The story of the fugitive cat 'Puss in boots' is compelling enough to grasp the viewer in his adventures and there is a lot of other interesting characters, some cute and some stereotypically evil ones on the way as well. We are introduced to the story of friendship, betrayal and reconciliation of the main protagonists Puss and Humpty Dumpty in the beginning and the rest of the story follows vividly from there. All of it is done with little distractions here and there but no cheesiness. But there is still a lack of that charisma for people that look for more in their movies. Which is why this movie might not become a classic like Lion King, Nemo or Shrek for that matter. If you are expecting one then you will be a tad bit disappointed like me.<br/><br/>The cutest part of the movie has to be the baby goose. I could hardly care who else was in the frame in those scenes.Good job! The performance of Antonio Banderas is what make this movie so energetically moving. It's going to be difficult for anyone to personify the lovable Puss In Boots in a different way or a different level above the memorable voice Antonio gave to an otherwise well known parallel character from story books. I cant say the same for any other characters in this movie. Even Salma Hayek falls flat except for a few instances in her performance of Soft Paws. I didn't really grow fond of Humpty Dumpty(Zach Galifianakis) either and I don't hope for these two characters to grow further as well if there happens to be a sequel.<br/><br/>All in all this is good clean animated fun at its best. My whole hearted Meow on this one."

","This film gives us the back-story on Puss in Boots. It is a good film based on fairy-tales (or should I say fairy-tails) that will have you laughing like a kid again.<br/><br/>Kitty Softpaws - Loved her! When I first saw her I thought she was a he like Puss did. ""Bat Cat"" was my first thought.... then I said to myself no it is a she ""Cat Woman"" lol. Well I like the name Kitty Softpaws and the character. She's lovable.<br/><br/>Humpty Dumpty - I did not know if I liked him or despised him until the end of the film. I decided that he is a likable egg. Very funny character - just as funny as Puss.<br/><br/>Puss in Boots - Funny, adorable and charismatic as usual (See: Shrek 2). I'm glad he got his own spin-off movie. Well worth watching.<br/><br/>9 Paws out of 10!! 9/10"

","I totally expected this to be a steaming pile of a washed-up franchise that DreamWorks was trying to squeeze the final pennies from our children out of. But it ended up being a fun movie with some laughs and a actually decent story, and unlike a certain other company's cheap sequel animation, this is as good as any other DreamWorks movie. The new villain was intriguing and the other new characters were well done as well. Seeing Puss on his own didn't flesh out the character much more than we already know from the Shrek films, and I was surprised to not see more cameos from other franchise characters. But no matter, a fine film for your collection. Even though it was only her voice, Salma Hayek is...muy en fuego."

","My 2 year old grandson is totally besotted with this DVD and with 'boots' as he calls him. He knows it so well that he can say what happens before it does. However, I have searched toy shops, Disney shops, internet and I cannot find a Puss in Boots that looks like the one in the DVD. Most of them look like strangled stray cats!! Could you please tell me where I can get a soft toy 'boots' that actually looks like the one in the DVD. My little grandson would be over the moon. I have bought some posters which are really good and I will probably have to buy another DVD because I think he will wear this one out!. Well done on this, it is great animation and a good story with brilliant characters. Hope someone out there can help me out. Thanks."

","While not being the best film DreamWorks Animation has ever made, Puss in Boots is a good, warm-hearted animated feature that will easily entertain family audiences. This movie is a spin off film about one of the supporting characters in the final three Shrek movies, Puss in Boots. This film lacks the heart and bigness of those films, but still manages to get me entertained and I'm always happy to see any characters from the Shrek films.<br/><br/>Chris Miller's film is about the lovely cat, Puss in Boots. In this storyline, which is not devoid of fairy-tale references, Puss joins up with Humpty-Dumpty and Kitty Soft-Paws to go after the evil Jack and Jill who are on the quest for magical beans.<br/><br/>The voice acting is solid. Antonio Banderas is the only one who can play Puss in Boots. Salma Hayek, Zack Galifinakis, and Billy Bob Thornton are all nice additions to the cast and they voice their characters well.<br/><br/>Overall, this is a good animated feature which is bound to receive much love from the younger children. Anyone else, especially those who are Shrek fans, should find this film pretty enjoyable. There's nothing new that was brought to the table, but it has enough wit and charm to make it an entertaining night out at the movies. I rate this film 8/10."

","The Shrek series has overall been pretty great, great animation with lots of classic nursery characters portrayed in comedic and very different way than general. Jack and Jill are good examples of this.<br/><br/>Puss in Boots continues this. I watched this with my son and he loved it. Great character designs and fitting personalities to go with there appearance. <br/><br/>Engaging storyline, and nice that the writers put some back story into Puss in boots. I was very interested to see the outcome of the plot. Great characters all voiced perfectly, Banderas is just too smooth!<br/><br/>Fun for all the family, with enough humour to keep adults and children both laughing as well as a decent story to keep you hooked until the end."

","Fantastic. It was better than Shrek movies. They refined the fairy tale stuff and gave it a vibrant twist and turn. With superb animation works and nice plot the movie was enjoyable. I am glad they kept Antonio Banderas's voice for the Puss. He really got an enigmatic voice. Both kids and adults will find fun in the movie. The touch of creativity in the plot, Puss's adventurous journeys to the exotic places will keep you entertained till the end. Surprisingly, the movie has been under-rated. Some people just don't like modified fairy-tale stuffs. In fact you will not feel that the story was based on fairy tale. The plot of this movie was made unique enough to be one of its kind."

","Watching Puss in Boots is a lot of fun, I laughed and smiled my way through the whole thing, great music, a nice story and animation that blew me away, it was just beautiful to look at and the attention to detail was amazing you really could see every whisker! I know not everyone is a fan of 3D but I think it was used in a great, fun way here. I loved all the characters in this movie and enjoyed watching them go on their little adventure, and happy to see where the story would go. I do think the film slows down a little bit in the last half but then picks itself up again for a nice end, but all round a great film. I think adults and children will love it, when I was a little kid this would be a film I would have been obbsessed with! If you want a fun, light hearted movie that the whole family can enjoy watch PUSS IN BOOTS!!"
"mooie72","8","3","4","30 May 2012"," Funniest yet
","I admit I did not watch the subsequent Shrek movies. The first one wrapped the story up quite nicely for me and I can only take so much of Eddie Murphy. Sadly, I missed the introduction of Puss in #2. My bad! <br/><br/>But this movie was HILARIOUS! And Antonio Banderas was a RIOT! The characters were exactly how I would have pictured them and perfectly explained every question we ever had about fairy tales as children. Jack (Billy Bob) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) were so stereotypical as the White Trash Outlaws. Salma Hayek was perfect as Softpaws. What a great foil to Puss!<br/><br/>I may actually go back and watch the rest of the movies now!"
"TwistedVanity","10","3","4","10 March 2012"," A great laugh for kids and adults
","This was simply fun. It had great laughs that were aimed at both adults and children, the plot was entertaining and original. Great action scenes. And it even had a dance fight! <br/><br/>The voice actors were excellent, giving life and depth to their characters,and the artists then added a wealth of believable, and sometimes subtle expression and character to their drawings as well. You felt everything Puss in Boots felt. <br/><br/>The plot was original and extremely fun, there was a perfect balance of back plot and story that gave an entertaining insight into Puss. The movie then seamlessly blended action, tragedy and humour into a delightful tale that both adults and children will love too watch again and again. Which is good because with my kids I'm sure I'll have too.<br/><br/>I would compare this to the first shrek movie, awesome animation, just enough character depth to entertain both adults and children, inspired humour for both adults and children, and a wealth of action scenes that are so beautifully drawn and animated that the entire film is just eye candy. Without doubt both adults and children will love this movie."
"akashtaker001","9","3","4","2 March 2012"," Watch it!!, If you Dare
","The ever cool legendary Puss in Boots is back with its own movie. The movie has a great storyline which follows Puss in Boots origins before he met Shrek, how he got his name and his attire Boots, hat and sword. Then Puss in Boots team up with Kitty Softpaws and Humpty Dumpty in a quest for magic beans. The voicing is great Antonio Banderas with is Spanish accent is as always great as lead voice of Puss in Boots, Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws and Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Dumpty were also great. The storyline is awesome with lot of emotion, comedy gags, Puss in Boots's one liners, character development and lots of twists and turns. Animation is ever awesome bringing characters to life. To sum it up I enjoyed it more then recent Shrek 3 and 4. Its in the same league as Shrek 2 which in my opinion was best of franchise. Do watch it for a roller coaster ride. You won't be disappointed."
"Ryan_MYeah","8","3","4","3 February 2012"," The slick feline manages to carry his own movie in high fashion.
","Arguably the most popular character of the long running Shrek franchise, it was inevitable that Puss in Boots would receive a movie of his own. To the wrong hands, this could have been a monetary gain, but qualified loss, but the slick feline makes every second of his movie count.<br/><br/>While still staying true to the storybook characters and ideologies of the earlier Shrek films, Puss in Boots is actually a very inspired deviation, being that it plays out more like a spaghetti western rather than a fairy tale. It may not be as wacky or surreal as Rango, but it has an undeniable charm, and one that's honestly a little more easy to digest. Antonio Banderas, as always, is smooth, witty, and charismatic as our nine lived lead hero, but also conveying an honest emotion beneath, especially when the attention is turned onto the old friendship between Puss and Humpty Dumpty.<br/><br/>About 20 minutes through the film, it takes a slow turn from the quick paced, action packed side of things, and builds up a fascinating back story between the two (This sequence takes up about ten whole minutes, but man, it's so good). This friendship is where the movie's emotional core lies, and Humpty Dumpty (Excellently voiced by Zach Galifianakis) is one great character.<br/><br/>But not everything in the movie works. The character of Kitty Softpaws (Voiced by Salma Hayek) is a rather flat one, and I never really bought her romance with Puss. There's also a twist near the end of the film which feels kinda obvious. But at the very least, this is a well done and constructed movie, with beautifully composed animation and camera-work, thrilling action scenes, and to add to all this, Henry Jackman (Whose musical score is surprisingly pretty awesome) clearly channels the great Ennio Morricone, complete with gorgeous Latin Salsa rhythms, and sweeping choirs.<br/><br/>*** out of ****"
"Abigail_fox","9","3","4","11 December 2011"," Fab film especially for cat lovers
","Great film. It's a spin-off from the Shrek series so if you like the Shrek movies you will probably like this. There are lots of cat-jokes that are very funny for cat-owners but they might go over the heads of non-cat people. So the 9 out of 10 score reflects that I have a cat but I think most people will like this film generally. The characters are very likable, apart from maybe Humpty Dumpty (what is there to like about an egg - its just weird!). I didn't see it in 3D so can't comment on that but the animation is visually good. There are some great action scenes too especially the cat dancing. Overall it is one of the best animated films of the year."
"ArtandJoyofMovies","Null","3","4","5 November 2011"," What 3D is made for!
","Right off paw (as opposed to ""off hand"" ) I should note the title means a cat, literally in boots. I suppose that is obvious to most. But when I asked most adults it conjured up everything from cat food to a Saturday morning cartoon. But not a cat musketeer. This film is actually, but only very loosely, based upon the fairy tale Puss n Boots written at the close of the seventeenth century by Frenchman Charles Perrault (1628–1703). This film is sort of the 2011, The Three Musketeers film for children, only much better.<br/><br/>This film version blends a story of child hood pals Puss in Boots (Banderas) and egghead, Humpty Dumpty (Galifianakis) in pursuit of selfish dreams to capture the baby goose that lays golden eggs. Puss falls for Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) and the friendships between Puss, Humpty and Kitty all get a bit confused in pursuit of riches. The writers mix in (and mix up) bits of half a dozen other childhood fables from Jack and Jill to Jack and the Beanstalk. It is all clean great fun and funny for kids and adults along the way. There is a great fight and dance scene that few animated films can match. The PG rating was certainly garnered by the swords and violence, but there is really nothing to disturb even the most delicate of children's emotions. Any child old enough to watch television has seen far worse. My only concern was a brief reference by Jack to swearing off ""murdering and thievery"" as fun, but it may be time to move on. They might have left that worthless line out of the script. And why Jack and Jill had to be portrayed as anything but two nice kids going up a hill to fetch a pale of water might confuse a few kindergärtners.<br/><br/>The hoopla over the new 3D in films is really reserved for animated films like this. The 3D is truly amazing with animation while it adds little and is not nearly as impressive with most films. For animation, it is here to stay. Seeing a cat drink milk from a regular glass is funny and watching milk get spilt in slow 3D is captivating. Watch for the funny reference later in the film to ""catnip for glaucoma""–an obvious cross reference to a funny scene of Galifianakis in last year's Due Date. Puss ""in"" boots or out of them, adults and kids alike will laugh and enjoy this adventure all the way through."

","A wonderfully good looking movie about 20 minutes too long. All the chase scenes, the flying-through-the-air scenes, the long back stories grew tiresome, so I can only give it a basic five stars. I am adding one because the cats are just so darned cute, and one more star for Lady Gaga's song ""Americano"" which somehow I never heard until I saw this movie! The little puns and bits of 'cat business' were cute, but I wanted to punch Humpty Dumpty in the face after a while! He was a bad egg, get it? And there should have been a little more fairy tale and a little less 'Zorro' type swashbuckling. A good movie, but not great. But if there was any spin off from Shrek, Puss In Boots was the logical result."
"TheLittleSongbird","8","4","6","15 March 2012"," Feline animated fun with Puss in Boots
","Dreamworks has been inconsistent for me. I loved The Prince of Egypt, How to Train Your Dragon, Shrek, Spirit, Kung Fu Panda 2 and Antz, liked Shrek 2, Monsters vs Aliens, Sinbad, Kung Fu Panda and Road to El Dorado and didn't care for Bee Movie and Shark Tale(the 3rd and 4th Shreks are between the slightly liked to didn't care for categories). Puss in Boots is not Dreamworks' best, though I do consider it one of their better ones recently. The animation is stupendous, especially in the rich colours and fluid backgrounds. The humans are not as well-drawn as the animals, then again to a lesser extent I found that with the Shrek movies too(especially with Rumpelstiltskin in Forever After).<br/><br/>The music is rousing and gives a sense of jollity and adventure, and Puss in Boots is a cleverly written film with cat puns, witty dialogue and veers from Daesperado, Zorro to Mother Goose and a touch of Sergio Leone. As for the story, for what there is in predictability is made up for with excitement, helped by the hilarious dance fights and superbly choreographed chases up beanstalks and over bridges. The characters are generally great, though I didn't really care for Humpty Dumpty as a character or a villain.<br/><br/>Zach Galifilianakis deserves a lot of credit for his voice work, but while not as bland as Rumplestiltskin, Humpty Dumpty's motivation could have been better explored and he is never really likable or interesting. Consequently by the end, which compared to the rest of the film was too dark for my tastes, he didn't garner my sympathy, like I did with Rameses and especially Lord Shen. Kitty however is wonderfully slinky, and voiced beautifully by Salma Hayek, but it is the title character(one of the Shrek franchise's best characters) who steals the show.<br/><br/>Marvellously voiced by Antonio Banderas, Puss in Boots is suave and although the cute big eyes gag is used quite a few times, I find it far too endearing for it to be getting old. Overall, a fun film, beautifully animated, generally exciting and clever. 8/10 Bethany Cox"
"Christian_Dimartino","9","4","6","5 March 2012"," Parents, watch it sober.
","A lot of movies took me by surprise last year; not bad surprise either, and some of them were kids movies. Yes, I actually enjoyed Zookeeper. Also, Rango and Mr. Popper's Penguins worked, because they all had the right touch of family friendly and hilarity, like Puss in Boots.<br/><br/>Puss in Boots was never my favorite Shrek character.I always loved Eddie Murphey's scene stealing Donkey. But Puss was a mystery. The first Shrek film was a masterpiece. The others were good, but not great. The last two got bad rep, so thank God this spin-off came around.<br/><br/>Antonio Banderas is back behind the voice of the sly outlaw, Puss. The film shows a time before he met Shrek and the gang. Puss teams up with an old friend, Humpty Dumpty(voiced perfectly by Zach Galifianakis) and Kitty Soft-Paws(voiced very seductively by Salma Hayak) to steal magic beans from Jack and Jill(Also voiced perfectly by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), a married couple of psychos.<br/><br/>Puss in Boots is almost like a work of magic. While watching it, I got a feel of the original Shrek, which was smartly funny and clever, do to all of it's fairy tale references. Puss in Boots has a lot of energy, and never seems to really run out of it.<br/><br/>The voice work is almost perfect. Whenever Humpty talks, you kind of see Galifianakis' facial expressions come to life, very strange. The animation here, like Rango, is gorgeous. The other Shrek films may have seemed that way, but Dreamworks has something different here, something much more colorful.<br/><br/>Overall, Puss in Boots is a really good movie. And I know some are skeptical, but don't't be. I bet some parents went to see it drunk, they shouldn't have. If adults had as much of a heart as I do, they would actually enjoy Puss in Boots. Is it quite as good as Rango? Um, no. But it's still very good.<br/><br/>A-"

","I was really upset that this movie did not follow the original story at all – NOT!!! I was a little leery about the movie at first since I did not think Antonio Banderas could pull this off. Was I ever wrong – the comic timing in this story was a hoot. The woman playing his catty girl friend was too funny as well – oh yeah – that would be Salma Hayek. Let me see, she was in that movie – ah – no – not that one. Wait! She was on that TV show – ah – nope – not that one either. Well whatever she was in beforeI personally will always remember her as 'Kitty Softpaws'. Don't get me wrong, I feel the pain of those who felt shorts-rifted by Hollywood because 'they' veered away from the original story (and – in this case - they not only veered away but ran over the original idea several times, flushed it down the toilet once or twice and then set it on fire.) But come on – if you watch TV or waste money on movies – 'they' do it all the time. Look at the Americanisation of, 'The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo.' She has problems and handles them in the original story. I bet Hollywood will blame her problems on 'Bush' or her house was built over some Native American burial ground.

","All the years that we have seen the Shrek movies both myself and my wife have LOVED Puss...By far the best character in the series.Especially with his repertoire with Donkey.. Puss needed his own movie...... <br/><br/>Sad to say..This movie fell way short of our expectations..The best I can say about it is that it was cute with a few laughs now and again. Puss didn't have near the spark that he had in the Shreck movies and although including Ms Kitty Softpaws was an awesome idea (instead of having an Equine sidekick!)..there was no real great moments between the two leading toons..Some innuendo,some smiles..Not near as much as there could have been.<br/><br/>One question for me was why the makers included the worthless Humpty Dumpty in this film,who whined and squealed through the role of the ""Forever Brother"".I could have seen a lot better movie here if the whole fairy-tale theme was carried through with the other main four characters..(The two Kitties and two baddies.) If ever there was a more pointless inclusion...This is it Dreamworks. <br/><br/>Now a lot of people will say that ""Aww..c'mon..its a kids movie..give it a break""..Actually,No there is way too much a lot of kids will miss.This is a family movie but with quite a lot of the humor targeted at the adults in the audience and I think there will be a lot of adults (and some kids for that matter)looking for a little more from a story in a theater!! <br/><br/>Quite disappointing movie really...My best recommendation for Puss fans is save your money and skip the movie theater..Wait till this comes out on DVD and is about the $5 to $7 mark..Then it will be worth while for a movie night at home.."

Puss maintained his character from the Shrek movie which was a good move by Dreamworks to ensure the viewer would be able to connect with the film.

","Cats, closer in temperament to human beings than most people would like to think, were once held in high regard in some of the more advanced ancient civilizations; the Egyptians even worshiped them. Righteous religious zealots have often deluded themselves into believing that cats were somehow Evil, and not just the morons in the Middle Ages: just a few years ago, cats were slaughtered by the thousands in Romania; they were deemed ""Demons in disguise"" by religious leaders. Here at home, witch hunting was likewise instituted when beach goers at one of the local resorts noticed ""too many stray cats"" wandering the area. Though they bothered no one, the stray cats were rounded up and killed. ALL of them. But... No sooner were the cats gone than large river rats began to roam the beach. These rats could be seen through the windows at night scampering on restaurant tabletops and counters and running up and down the streets. The Wise Men who make the Big Decisions decided to truck in more cats. PUSS IN BOOTS is great fun (though the all too familiar storyline DOES drag a bit) and Antonio Banderas never looked better. The animation is state of the art, of course, which can help make even often told tales seem new and interesting. For my money, the scene in The (G)litter Box is most memorable, though there's something here for Kids of all ages."

I never thought that I would sit through 90 minutes of the most irritating, repetitive, and pointless story in a full-length, mainstream cartoon.<br/><br/>Puss returns to the town where he grew up as an abandoned kitten left at the doorstep of an orphanage in a small, 17th Century Spanish town. Puss is looking for work and hears about some Magic Beans (the Jack & the Beanstalk story) and the Goose that laid the Golden Egg. The goose is a the castle in the sky, and the only way to get to it is by planting the Magic Beans and then climbing up the giant beanstalk.<br/><br/>After encountering a ""cat burglar"" by the name of Kitty Softpaws, who is after the same thing, Puss and Kitty engage in a novel version of a cat fight. They form a partnership with Humpty Dumpty who had formerly met Puss at the orphanage and became ""blood brothers."" What follows is what made me want to run screaming out the exit.<br/><br/>The obsessive neurosis of Dumpty dominates the screen and the script, making you wonder if this was just a vehicle made for Zach Galifianakis. The only positive thing about Zack's Humpty's is that we don't need to see his squirrel's nest beard.<br/><br/>Turns out that Dumpty is the mastermind of the Goose Heist and double-cross of Puss on who Humpty took a big Dumpty by tricking him into robbing the bank of his home town.<br/><br/>At any rate, wait for this to come to DVD and then you will only be out a $buck."

But that is if he really and what is hiding behind his cute attractive face? That's what we decided to tell Dreamworks. By the way, strange enough, but kids in the hall almost was not, basically a couple (well, this is understandable, even seals on YouTube are popular.)<br/><br/>The script tells us about the past of the hero, including a mini-story of the Cat, about his childhood. But the bulk of the followers of Jack's adventure takes the bean stalk and hunt for golden eggs. Of course, many changes, but it is a modern cartoon fairy tales treatment now in vogue. There are two main story lines: friendship and love. To be honest, both are shown in this way that children will hardly interesting morality, are not mature enough yet to treachery and romance. But the jokes, dances and other frills - just for them. Shrek style is preserved, ""his wife flowers, ice cream ditYam"", well, or a great moral uncle and aunt, and children - humor. Both lines are disclosed in some detail, especially friendship. Then you and flashbacks of the meeting, and this association, and of course fix the bad guys. And love - is all the chances to continue, maybe we'll see him someday.<br/><br/>The picture is even interesting. I really do not like 3d, but would not say that it was a lot, but overall not bad. And the scenery, ""wild west"", and urban slums, and even cloud castle - all beyond praise. The soundtrack, like in Shrek, does the job. Where should he play fonchikom where you want to highlight key, and even during the dance, listen to it - a pleasure.<br/><br/>Side of humor, as I said, at the level of Shrek. There are jokes for both children and adults have. In recent years, taken to introduce any exotic character that will appear periodically in the background, and to publish funny sounds, comment, or ape. Here he became a cat out of the bar, with its ""Uooou."" I do not quite understand why the place of the partner chose the egg, though of course it is logical in relation to the golden eggs, but they could not bother and we are so deep, sometimes just annoying.<br/><br/>Overall, this movie I would suggest to look in love (in the end, many in the room kissing), it is natural to children, and indeed all relax does not interfere. Easy, not too deep a cartoon, of course, with a happy-end, which will teach you how to take care of Lady, and to seek adventure on his butt."

","Puss in boots is one of the few animation movies that includes comedy. Even though it is based on shrek, puss in boots has its own character, with many Spanish influences. The story even includes twists (the egg is looking for revenge after all) and romantic parts. Clever lines make the film even more amusing, and the familiar characters blend in with the new ones very nicely. In addition, the main stars, the cats, are very cute, especially the one that says ohhh in the bar is a nice detail.However, the movie cannot escape from the well known ending- the hero saves the day, the bad become good by doing a dangerous act...All in all, puss in boots is an exciting family movie with lots of laughter and adventure."

","I'll admit I wasn't certain how well this would do. I was a bit uncertain, as this is dreamworks we are talking about. Their Shrek series was okay (the last two were meh) but this was sort of a spin off of one of the characters introduced in Shrek 2.<br/><br/>I found the animation to be very well done, the 3d gimmicks were pretty well put together, there were enough to make it worth the 3D. The main characters were interesting enough, however I felt that it was a bit mean to take the classic characters we know as love like Humpty Dumpty or Jack and Jill and make them evil. But this is the world, trying to have humor with everything.<br/><br/>I was very impressed with the lack of swearing though. You don't see that too often these days. And in the end, the plot seemed predictable (Humpty 'dies' but then is seen to be alive again at the end) yet had a small twist.<br/><br/>In the end I rate this 7.5 or so. It is almost good enough to be an 8 but just had that sort of clique sort of feel. But it was very well made considering it's dreamworks."

","When we first saw the trailer for Puss in Boots, I can't say I was really excited to see it. But of course, the kids wanted to see it so we did (in 2D only). I must say, we all had a mighty good time! No regrets at all in watching this animated fantasy-Western adventure.<br/><br/>We see Puss' humble origins as a kitten growing up in an orphanage in the Mexican town of San Ricardo. He develops an unlikely friend in one odd egg named Humpty Alexander Dumpty. Circumstances eventually break up the two friends. After several years, Humpty seeks out Puss (with the help of sultry seductress Kitty Softpaws) to convince him to help get Jack's magic beans from Jack and Jill. I know this sounds like a messy mishmash of fairy tale characters, and it was. The artists also take liberties in their visual interpretation of these characters, including the Golden Goose (which I personally found corny).<br/><br/>Thanks to the Shrek films, we already know Puss in Boots and what to expect from him. His Zorro-like swashbuckling exploits, his charm with the ladies and his cute wide-eyed pleading look are all here, and Antonio Banderas too! Selma Hayek voices Kitty delightfully. This new character is quite likable, and you would like to see more adventures of the two cats. As for Humpty (voiced by Zach Galifianakis of ""Hangover"" fame) though, here lies the prickly problem. You may or may not like him, both his look and his character. Humpty can really be annoying!<br/><br/>There are so many hilarious isolated situations that could make you laugh out loud. I certainly did at several points. My favorite funny moment was that when Humpty changed into his Golden Egg costume. I'm sure you can get an absurd image just by reading that last sentence. Haha! His line when he was running and commented that he needed powder to prevent friction in his pants (he was apparently not wearing underwear) really made me guffaw! You have to hear it to believe that a line like that made it into a children's cartoon flick.<br/><br/>The artwork was of course flawless. The textures are palpable. The action sequences are exciting and funny at the same time. The fight scenes mixed with dance moves were quite interesting to watch as well. The 2D version looked adequate enough to enjoy the adventure. Overall this is a fun movie to watch with the whole family."

","I first went into this film expecting a fun animated movie, but the further in I got it got better and better. The Shrek franchise has always had the best looking CGI films and Puss in Boots is no exception. Everything about it looked so realistic, from the water to the fur to the dust to the people, it was breathtaking and really helped you to get more into the story. Speaking of story Puss in Boots has one of the most solid scripts I've ever seen for an animated movie. Everything made perfect sense and there were no unanswered questions which left me completely satisfied. Every single character had depth to them and made have an emotional connection to them, heck *spoiler alert* I even felt really bad when Humpty Dumpty died. And the writers didn't stuff as many fairy tale references as they could into this like they did with Shrek, no they put in the perfect amount. Every story referenced actually impacted the story and eventually led to one of the greatest chase scenes that I have ever seen, no joke! In the end Puss in Boots is a fantastic addition the the Shrek franchise showing us Puss's origin while still delivering a classic movie that I will always come back to watch."
"filipemanuelneto","8","2","3","31 July 2017"," A good family animated film.
","This movie must have been one of the first to take a frankly secondary (but funny) character from an animated film and to give it a prominent place in a film of its own. Its a fad of animation studios that has not always been able to make good movies but has certainly helped to increase their profits.<br/><br/>The first appearance of this cat is during ""Shrek"" franchise, but in this film we can see Puss in Boots in a different way, mixing ""Zorro"" with elements of the traditional tales ""Jack and the Beanstalk"" and ""Chicken of the Golden Eggs"". I think it's not necessary to mention that cinematography and animation are excellent and everything looks quite beautiful and elegant. The performance of voice actors is good, with António Banderas and Salma Hayek in the lead. It's an entertaining movie, to please both young and adult, and will definitely be a good choice for a ""family get together"" evening."

","Let me get this straight, I don't HATE Dreamworks, I like some of their films, and others I don't. This film is one that I like!.<br/><br/>PROS: First off, the animation is great, it looks so much better than any other Dreamworks films done in the past, it just looks so complete and real, it looks like they did what Rockstar Games did for 'RED DEAD REDEMPTION', they rendered and created the animation to 100% perfection so it looks like a real environment, and I loved it! The voice actors were good also, Antonio Banderas was great as always, he was funny and was trying to play it serious at the same time, which is what we always expect from something like this. Salma Hayek and Billy Bob Thornton were average as their characters, but still gave their characters a bit of depth and fun, but the absolute best part of the film was Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Humpty, he was SO funny and actually became my favourite character in the movie. The story was good, and I enjoyed the action and adventure parts of the film as they were exciting and fun to watch.<br/><br/>CONS: Like most of my reviews, the negatives are just a lot of little things, and that would be the jokes. To be honest, I DID laugh while watching this film, it was very, very funny, it's just that, like other Dreamworks films, some of the jokes fell flat. But that shouldn't stop you from watching it. So, if you're a fan of 'SHREK', then check this movie out!<br/><br/>'PUSS IN BOOTS'<br/><br/>Directed by: Chris Miller<br/><br/>Starring: Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Zach Galifianikis, Billy Bob Thornton, Any Sedaris, Zeus Mendoza, Constance Marie, Guillermo del Toro and Bob Joles"

","I say 1/2 original as during Shrek the cat had its own personality but during this movie I could see a huge amount of similarities between the cat and Zorro (The mask of Zorror (1998)) which spoilt the movie for me as the cat didn't have its own personality. Rather more of a rip off / cop out from the writers. But on the other hand there were some really good quotes and funny moments in the film, as well as adding characters from other fairy tales with their own little twist just like Shrek. Which made up for the film. I did like the film and find out how the cat started from being just a cat to being Puss in Boots.Though the ending was a little confusing. It's a bit of a metaphor but I don't think it was needed as it didn't make sense."
"KineticSeoul","Null","2","3","31 October 2011"," Puss in Boots and the fluid animation and action is what carried this movie
","Now this is a movie that kids and adults can enjoy. It isn't a great family film but it's still a enjoyable one. Now if you seen the ""Shrek"" franchise you will know who Puss in Boots when it comes to his character. In fact I found him to be a great supporting characters in the ""Shrek"" franchise so wasn't really disappointed when I saw the trailer for a movie just for this character. Also this could be a stand alone movie and is close to being good as the first two ""Shrek"" movies. The action is fast and entertaining and although the plot isn't anything special is simple and yet enjoyable to watch. The kids and adults were mostly chuckling there way through this movie. What I found sort of surprising though is how almost none of the ""Shrek"" characters are in this movie and doesn't even make a cameo. Which in my opinion didn't effect this movie at all. I am glad that this went in a theatrical release direction instead of straight to DVD direction the creators originally planned. Cause this way there was more input into the movie instead of hardly putting much effort into it. The voice acting is very good in this and the character Kitty Softpaws is a very good addition to this. She reminded me of other characters I read about or seen but she is a cat and I guess that is what makes this work for the most part, although that might be unjust to some degree. The story isn't good but Puss in Boots really is the character that carries this movie. On a negative note though the story just didn't seem developed enough and thus the whole thing comes off as more of an eye candy with it's fluid CGI and action. But overall the positive outweigh the negative and to sum it up, it's a good family flick just not a great one. Sad to know that I didn't even know Puss in Boots was a real fairy tale and not just some character that popped up in the ""Shrek"" series.<br/><br/>7.3/10"

","Desperate not to let the franchise die but doomed to do so regardless, the folks over at Dreamworks decided it'd be a good idea to do a 'Shrek' spin off centred on everyone's favourite Hispanic cat but in the process forgot the fact that the series itself was originally created to lampoon its fairytale groundings and Disney-esque stylings, slipping into origin-story stereotypes and a silly plot somehow not based on the eponymous fable. 'Puss In Boots (2011)' is not a bad film by any means and is in fact rather entertaining, besting the latter two 'Shrek' sequels thanks to its bouncy set-pieces and an improved sense of humour, but it doesn't reach the heights that the franchise or character have set as a bar. It's forgettable to the point that the most memorable moment, and incidentally best joke, turned out to have actually come from its Christmas Day television short. 6/10"
"kosmasp","6","1","1","23 March 2012"," Entertaining and by the numbers
","I enjoyed the movie and I thought it was a really nice comedy. Having seen the trailer though, there was almost nothing left to laugh about. Most jokes are in there. Which of course can be said about most comedies and you wonder why the have to put all the jokes in there? Are they afraid no one will go into the theatre? Whatever the case may be, the movie is entertaining enough.<br/><br/>But is it Oscar-material? I don't think so! In a year, where Pixar only had Cars 2 to offer, none of the rivals seemed to really catch the opportunity. And the one movie that actually should have been the winner wasn't even nominated (see ""Tin Tin"" the Spielberg movie). People would argue it was motion captured, but they still had to animate that and the backgrounds and everything else.<br/><br/>Back to Puss in Boots, which sees Banderas reprising his role, having good chemistry with Salma Hayek (nothing to wonder here) and Zach G. doing his comedy routine. Unfortunately the movie takes again the completely inapt way of unbelievable villain turning nice and good again. Most of the movies who try that, just aren't convincing enough, as is this. But kids won't mind and you will have fun for the running time."

","Okay I watched all the Shrek movies, loved them! I was so disappointed when they came out with the Shrek the Final Chapter. Final chapter it's so final. I was then overjoyed to hear about Puss in Boots. Puss is my all time absolute favorite character. He starts purring and does the begging eyes too cute. It reminds me of my niece's cat Diego. Have to love Antonio Bandareas as an actor too! <br/><br/>So we get to see the story behind the outlaw so to speak. Humpty Dumpty is a big role in this movie. Such an underutilized nursery rhyme! You also have Jack and Jill. Believe it or not Billy Bob Thornton is Jack. I was uncertain when I saw Bad News Bears & Bader Santa, but then he redeemed himself in the Astronaut Farmer. I still have a hard time picturing him playing in a child's movie. Granted I'm no child and love Dream Work Productions along with Disney. Amazing how he can dial himself down so to speak.<br/><br/>We find out Puss's origins, how he met Humpty, and why they have a rift in their friendship. Of course there is Miss Kitty Soft Paws. I hate when people declaw there cats! But, you will have to watch the movie to learn more about her soft paws. So cute how a female can lead a male around by the ""batt of an eyelash."" Of course the ""litter box"" is as funny as the commercials lead you to believe! <br/><br/>I love the fact that Puss ""redeemed"" himself. Of course we know he has a good heart. Look at how he couldn't kill Shrek. Now as to if Humpty is a good egg or bad egg? Well you will have to watch the movie. I think it was a good movie, not on the level of the Shrek tales, but worth watching. They hyped it up way too much. It was a delightful movie none the less and I recommend you see it.

","""Puss in Boots"" (2011), Rated ""PG"" for Some Mild Innuendo and Mild Violence. Running Time: 1hr&30min. Three Stars (out of Four)<br/><br/>""Puss in Boots"" is an animated delight chronicling the adventures of Puss in Boots before his encounter with Shrek in ""Shrek 2"" (2004). This particular ""yarn"" is the background story on how Puss came to don his hat, saber, boots and his status as a crusading outlaw with a heart of gold. <br/><br/>Actor Antonio Banderas reprises his popular role as the voice of Puss. This time, director Chris Miller tones down the adult overtones and risqué humor present in the ""Shrek"" pictures. ""Puss in Boots"" is more of a straightforward family adventure. It is also somewhat less of a comedy than the ""Shrek"" films, relying more on the story and great visuals. I suspect a few edits to this PG rated fare would bring it into the G rated realm. This highly colorful tale (or 'tail') opens with Puss escaping the certain doom of a night's mischievousness. He's on a quest to find magic beans he has been looking for since kittenhood, which in turn will lead him to a great kingdom in the clouds ripe for plunder. This leads him to an amusing confrontation with the deviant Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) who have the beans in their possession, and a new rival known as Kitty Softpaws (Selma Hayek) who has an agenda all her own. <br/><br/>It's not long before we meet Humpy Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) and learn of the bitter childhood connection between Humpy Dumpty and Puss in Boots. At their last encounter many years ago, an altercation stemmed in one ""having had a great fall"" (as you may have heard) and the banishment of Puss from the town of El Ricardo, resulting in the subsequent origin of a wrongfully-accused swashbuckling champion of good although his paws might be ""a little sticky"" from time-to-time. Puss always felt ashamed that his mother Imelda (Constance Marie) believed him to have turned to a life of crime and now seeks to redeem himself. Meanwhile Humpty Dumpty, who was once Puss's brother, continued to descend into a life of greed and develop a deep anger towards Puss in Boots.<br/><br/>Puss, Humpty and Kitty Softpaws forge an uneasy alliance and they are off on a mission of financial gain and to restore Puss's El Ricardo community standing and his mother's faith in him. <br/><br/>Along the journey, the audience is treated to grand visuals that are extremely vivid with details and color. Truly, this is a fanciful (or maybe a ""Fancy Feast""!) delight for the eyes. The visual points of interest include the pilgrimage through a desert, the climb (if it can be called as such) up a magical beanstalk, the sky kingdom and its garden with golden eggs. <br/><br/>""Puss in Boots"" has fun with the characters, always keeping the atmosphere cheerful. A prime example of this is the dance-off between Puss and Kitty at the feline-only dance-club named ""The (G)litter Box"" (where the G in the neon lettering is always on the fritz) complete with a musical number that is fresh, upbeat and engaging with a multitude of interesting visual gags ensuing in the background. This sequence is custom designed to keep viewers dialed-in and smiling.<br/><br/>The ""Puss in Boots"" story presented here is entirely its own creation. It bears no real ties to the original seventeenth century ""Puss in Boots"" fairy tale by Charles Perrault. The only commonality between the two is the name, physical characteristics and personality of Puss. Beyond that, the film studio behind this picture, DreamWorks SKG, took extensive creative liberties with the material and decided to have fun with not one, but multiple fairy tales and assorted fairy tale characters to create a fresh movie for today's audiences for mass consumption. It works.<br/><br/>Though not as original the first two ""Shrek"" pictures, which pioneered the way for this movie and a multitude of other ""sophisticated"" animated fare that has dominated multiplexes the last decade, ""Puss in Boots"" delivers the goods. It's a fun, light-hearted time at the movies. Nothing more and nothing less."
"d-nagelmaker","7","1","1","27 December 2011"," Nothing memorable, but enjoyable nonetheless
","Sure, I can understand why DreamWorks would make a full-length movie from one of Shrek's most beloved characters, but then why does Puss in Boots feel like nothing more but a spin-off, instead of a full-fledged animation film?<br/><br/>Well, first of all, the style is exactly the same as the Shrek-movies. Of course, it would've been weird to see Puss in a completely different animation-style, but copying literally every single detail that made the Shrek-franchise so recognizing? That's just lazy. There's nothing wrong with the animation, it's crispy and the 3D-effects are nicely done, but it doesn't feel as fresh as it did when the first two Shreks were released in theaters.<br/><br/>Second of all, the story isn't that interesting. It explains the origins of Puss in less than 10 minutes and then kicks off with another Shrek- like adventure. Nothing new on the horizon. And when Puss and friends do finally discover something truly magical, there is only a few seconds of aw before the adventure continues like it always did. The movie references a lot of fairy tales, but never does something interesting with it. However, I am glad that director Chris Miller chose not to overuse this trick like he did in Shrek the Third. It's more balanced this way, though a bit dull since it has been done many times before by the Shrek-films.<br/><br/>I may sound a little negative, but I have to admit that I did have a good time watching this movie. Like I said, the animation is very pretty. I can't say it's a huge improvement over Shrek Forever After, but looks good nonetheless. Besides the animation, the jokes are also pretty well done. The timing is good and Humpty Dumpty (an old sidekick of Puss who has a major role in this movie) has some nice one-liners, delivered by the always enjoyable Zach Galifianakis. Talking about voice-acting, Antonio Banderes once again delivers a fine performance as the Puss in Boots. He doesn't have anything new to do, but I don't think it was necessary, since his voice-acting is so refined. Salma Hayak brings the goods as the voice of the attracting Kitty Softpaws, her voice-acting is as well-chosen as it is predictable.<br/><br/>In the end, Puss in Boots doesn't add anything new to the Shrek- franchise, let alone the genre. But it entertains and kids will love it, so if you don't know what to do on a rainy Sunday, give Puss in Boots a try. It won't disappoint."
"sddavis63","7","1","1","4 November 2011"," Fun, But Maybe Too Many Fairy Tales Packed Into One Story
","Spun off from the ""Shrek"" series of movies, where Puss was one of the many fairy tale characters who made appearances, Puss now takes on centre stage in a movie of his own, which also revolves around the weaving together of many, many (perhaps even too many!) fairy tale characters in what was a fun kind of adventure - some of which was probably a little too advanced for the children in the audience, but somewhat surprisingly the audience in the theatre I was in had a lot of adults, some of whom didn't seem to be there with children, so the movie clearly appeals to a broad spectrum.<br/><br/>I enjoyed it. It was pretty well animated, the action/adventure was a good ride and there were a lot of laughs. The theatre was rarely silent; people were enjoying themselves. I did think, though, that the movie tried to incorporate too much. The Shrek movies used a lot of fairy tale characters, but they mostly revolved around Shrek's own and unique story. Here, we have a mish-mash of fairy tales with overlapping stories where everything gets blurred - and the story of Puss In Boots isn't consistent with the character's history, dating back to the 17th century, when the story was first published in France. The primary secondary character is Humpty Dumpty - who's portrayed as a shifty kind of character, with a lifelong (if love-hate) relationship with Puss. The story revolves around the search for magic beans that are in the possession of an old and very tough-looking couple of thieves named Jack and Jill. Once Puss and Humpty get the magic beans - guess what! They grow into a giant beanstalk that leads to the clouds, where Humpty and Puss - and Kitty Softpaws (Puss's love interest) find not a giant (he's dead) but do come across a baby goose that lays golden eggs, and they bring her back down, only to incur the wrath of her giant mother. You get the point. Mish-mash kind of sums it up. The giant Mother Goose running amok through the town was the point at which I thought this really went overboard.<br/><br/>But I can't deny that most of the way through this was fun - and I can't deny the laughs that it brought forth from me and from others around me.

","Puss in Boots (2011): Dir: Chris Miller / Voices: Antonio Banderas, Salma Hayek, Zach Galifianakis, Billy Bob Thornton, Guillermo del Toro: Puss in Boots is a character of identity. He first turned up in Shrek 2 but popularity has rewarded the feline his own movie. He was brought up in an orphanage where a friendship with Humpty Dumpty results in a betrayal where Puss is on the run for a crime he was unaware of, and Humpty lands in prison. Years later Humpty seeks Puss in a scheme to steal three magic beans from Jack and Jill. Once planted, a beanstalk will grow that will lead to a goose that lays golden eggs. Appealing concept gives way to imaginative visuals and a climax where a giant goose rampages through the city. Chris Miller previously made Shrek the Third and he is appropriate for the solo stage for Puss. Antonio Banderas brings out the cunning charm of the feline hero who reluctantly takes on this task. Salma Hayek voices Kitty Softpaws whose name bares history. She competes with Puss in stealing the beans until it comes to realization that she is working for Humpty. She is a potential romantic interest but she sells it. Zach Galifianakis voices Humpty whose quest conceals a desire for revenge and whether Puss can overcome and excel. Guillermo del Toro voices a guy who calls himself Moustache Man. The one downside is the Jack and Jill villains are terrible and more or less standard ugly rule breakers that fail to engage us. The purpose of this film is to give Puss in Boots his feature. He wasn't part of the original Shrek so this makes up for it. Score: 9 ½ / 10"

"mona-pelkey","1","5","14","27 February 2012"," Utterly disappointing
","While I normally laugh off the adult themes and hope that children do not understand the innuendo of adult humor that inevitably makes its way into animated films, I was appalled with the theme of suicide in Puss in Boots. The film attempts to turn bad guy Humpty Dumpty into some sort of hero because he has given his life for the kidnapped Golden Goose, but this is misguided and certainly confusing for the younger audience. Suicide *should not* occur in family-oriented animated films, and it *should not* be glamorized to children or anyone else, lest those viewers who are vulnerable may be influenced. The lesson in the story about friendship and loyalty and trustworthiness is overshadowed by the shocking self-sacrifice of Humpty Dumpty. What a shame. <br/><br/>Normally I like to share my animated film collection with young guests, including my grandchildren, but Puss in Boots is not suitable. The wonderful animation may be entertaining on one level, but the darkness of Humpty's suicide clouds the entire film. One viewing is more than enough for me."

"estebangonzalez10","5","3","7","20 December 2011"," Not a good year for animated films
","¨My thirst for adventure will never be quenched! ¨<br/><br/>Puss in Boots is a character we came to love in the Shrek franchise, and this time director Chris Miller (who wrote the original Shrek screenplay and directed some of the sequels) makes him the star of his own animated film. Antonio Banderas is back again voicing his character, and the similarities with the Zorro can't be ignored (considering he played this famous hero in two films). Puss in Boots takes place before the adventures with Shrek, and we get to see his background story and his interactions with other famous fairytale characters such as Jack and Jill, Humpty Dumpty, the Mother Goose, Jack and the Beanstalk, and many more. Of course the stories are very different from the ones we've heard: Jack and Jill are two thieves who remind us a lot of Bonnie and Clyde; Humpty Dumpty is a smart great inventor, but at the same time is always getting into mischief; Jack sold a stolen cow for the magic beans and therefore is in prison, and so on. DreamWorks has done the same thing with the Shrek franchise so we are used to these funny alterations to classical characters. I really enjoyed the first half of this story and laughed throughout it. Puss in Boots is a great character and he deserved to star in his own movie. I did have a problem with some of the secondary characters, and especially with the last 20 minutes of the film which just got beyond ridiculous. It's too bad because the film really had a lot of potential and it began with a lot of promise.<br/><br/>Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a wanted man, or should I say cat. There is a reward on his head and he's living as a fugitive traveling from town to town and gaining reputation with the kitties. One night at a bar he hears that Jack and Jill (voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) are headed towards their town and that they have stolen the magical green beans. Puss wants those beans and is ready to steal them, but another kitten gets in his way: Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) so neither of them is able to do so. Puss is furious and when he discovers that Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) is involved he wants nothing to do with them. Dumpty and Kitty both want Puss to join them and help them finding the beans in order to climb the beanstalk and reach the giant's mansion to steal the goose that lays golden eggs, but Puss wants nothing to do with Dumpty. Something happened in their past and he refuses to help. After Kitty insists that he join them, Puss tells her how he met Dumpty and what happened to their friendship. We see a flashback of how Dumpty and Puss met in an orphanage where they were taken care of by Imelda (Constance Marie) and how their friendship begins. We even see how Puss gets his boots, but eventually he is betrayed by Dumpty, and they each go their separate way. Eventually Kitty convinces Puss to join them by telling him he has a chance to clear his name, and therefore the three embark on the mission.<br/><br/>I really enjoyed the first half of the story, the dialogue was funny and the main characters were interesting. The movie felt kind of fast paced at first and everything was happening real fast. Puss, Dumpty, and Kitty were interesting characters, but the villains aren't really memorable. My favorite part was perhaps the flashback where we get to see Puss's background and how he was betrayed by Dumpty. Another great scene was when Kitty and Puss have a dance off in a glitter club full of cats. Those were the highlights of the movie, but then once they get a hold of the magical beans the movie goes downhill. The plot gets really ridiculous and ends pretty badly. I wish they would've just kept the same pace of the first half of the movie. Puss in Boots still had its funny moments and I found myself laughing a lot, but I was disappointed with the second half. This wasn't as good a year for animated films as it was last year, but I guess I would have to say that my favorite one this year is Rio. The best thing about this film is definitely Puss and his endearing eyes.<br/><br/>http://estebueno10.blogspot.com/"

","I halfway expected it after the lacklustre Shrek 3 and the appalling Shrek Christmas, but still I managed to get up enough interest and hope to go and see Puss in Boots. It was even more disappointing than I expected. There was only 1 or two halfway funny jokes in the entire movie, the rest of it was frankly dull, just the continued overextending of a tired formula that has become synonymous with Disney over the past 16 ears.<br/><br/>The worst part of the film is the character of Humpty Dumpty, who fails to even crack when he falls off the wall, but the main problem was simply the complete lack of humour in a movie format that relies upon it entirely for success. All the nursery rhyme angles in the film are poorly adapted and irritate rather than engage and the overall film simply falls flat. The excellent voice acting by Antonia and Salma aside, the best part of this film was the preview for the new Muppets movie, which were the only real laughs heard."
"Jayolga","10","4","11","31 October 2011"," Cat characters were not cute enough to be cats!
","As a big cat lover, I was disappointed the way the animated characters turned out, not cute enough to look like cats, and the story could have used more feline signature behavior, not just drinking milk and chasing a light. In ""How to Train Your Dragon"", for example, the writers and the animators utilized more of cat demeanor in the dragon characters than the writers and animators did in the cats, in ""Puss in Boots"".<br/><br/>Although the team involved in this project was responsible for one of my favorite animated films, ""Madagascar"", I wish they hired a team of REAL CAT LOVERS. Someone, like the creator of ""Simon's Cat"". <br/><br/>Moreover, the characters in ""Puss in Boots"" did not look feline enough. They looked like toys or robots. Furthermore, the eyes and noses did not have enough detail, and the proportions of the faces were not accurate. The fangs were shortened, the whiskers too. If they merely took a picture of a real cat and just copied it, it would have been a much cuter looking character. <br/><br/>In closing, I enjoy watching ""Simon's Cat"" more than I did ""Puss in Boots"", and ""Simon's Cat"" is always free on the internet! :)"
"altair2478","5","2","4","21 June 2014"," Good movie, really annoying when thought about
","It's a good movie, it was enjoyable and well animated, if it was a stand alone film (as in Shrek didn't exist) then it would be even better. But that is why I only gave it a 5 because it has one of the biggest plot holes I have ever seen in a film. <br/><br/>The premise of the movie is that Puss was wrongfully labelled a criminal and then became an outlaw, and he spends the movie trying to right his wrongs and let everybody know that he is a nice, law abiding cat. So if this is all a prelude to Shrek, and Puss really is a nice guy and doesn't want to break the law and tries so hard to prove his innocence, why does he then become a hit-man? A sellsword if you will?<br/><br/>In Shrek 2, The King hires Puss to kill Shrek, as Puss is the only one who could manage the job. This means that he has been in the industry for quite a while. Meaning that he isn't actually a law abiding cat. This is why I didn't end up liking Puss in Boots. <br/><br/>It was a good film, and as an independent film it would be marvellous, but I just cannot look past this problem, it's like the creators either didn't care enough about their movies to realise this problem, or knew about it but just couldn't care enough to bother changing it."

","Puss in Boots. The first time I saw the poster, I imagined about a classic story, that tells about a cat that wore boots, that later in the story made his owner rich by his tricky way. It also reminded me about Shrek movie. But when I watched it, it's so different from what I expect it would be. The story, the characters, and others are so different. Only the cat that wearing boots that still the same. Well, this movie is about a cat, named Puss, that wanted to clear his name because he was trapped by his best friend, an egg named Humpty Dumpty, that made him as if he robbed a bank. But now their back and now their main bounty is the magic beans, which they had dreamed about since their childhood. The magic beans, remember it from a classic story, ""Jack and The Beanstalk"". Their journey began...<br/><br/>From all, I think this movie very entertaining with many tense action, and jokes and foolishness from the characters.

"jboothmillard","7","2","4","24 December 2011"," Puss in Boots
","The Shrek series has been a big treat for kids and families for the last decade, and when I found out that they were doing a spin-off for one of the most favourite characters', first introduced in the second film, I was up for it. Basically, set years before he met Shrek and Donkey, this sees how the famous cat came to be the swashbuckling legend that is Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas). The story sees him in search of the legendary and so far never found magic beans that, planted in the right place, will grow the giant beanstalk and take him to the clouds above to take the golden eggs, or rather the goose that lays them. Before this quest begins he has an encounter with a masked cat outlaw, this turns out to be Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek), who has a talent for stealing, and she is an ally with his former friend, since childhood, Humpty Alexander Dumpty (The Hangover's Zach Galifianakis). For a while Puss wants nothing to do with Humpty and helping him to find the magic beans, as he betrayed him a long time ago, but eventually he agrees to join forces, but not as a friend, but purely for the glory. The three companions track nasty thieves Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris) who have managed to find the magic beans, and slowly Puss and Kitty are turning from rivals into close friends. They do eventually get their hands on the beans, and they get the beanstalk after Humpty plants them in the right spot, the Giant that once occupied the cloud castle no longer exists, but the mother of the golden egg laying goose, called the Terror, is on lookout. After they successfully steal the young goose that lays the golden eggs Humpty reveals that he has in fact been keeping an eye on Puss for some time, and he knew that he would be looking for the source of the treasure as well, but Kitty feels guilty of being any part in the scheme. In the end the Terror, obviously a giant goose, is defeated while attacking the fairytale world, after Humpty sacrifices himself, Jack and Jill, having being injured, are arrested, and Puss and Kitty do finally kiss. Also starring Constance Marie as Imelda, Pan's Labyrinth director Guillermo Del Toro as Moustache Man / Comandate, Rich Dietl as Bounty Hunter and Ryan Crego as Luis. Banderas is once again a great choice as the swashbuckling feline with all the sword fighting moves, and the amusing cat habits, e.g. chasing lights and drinking milk, Hayek does well as his fellow female feline companion, and Galifianakis is interesting as the famous talking egg. The story was slightly patchy in places, but it doesn't matter too much as it is full of some great moments that make you laugh, plenty of exciting parts, and of course fantastic computer animation creating great effects and character, a good fun animated comedy adventure. It was nominated the Oscar for Best Animated Feature Film of the Year, and it was nominated the Golden Globe for Best Animated Feature Film. Very good!"

There are more cat puns, idioms, and witticisms than you'll likely care to count, some which hit, some which miss, as well as some sly Zorro in-jokes so as to take full advantage of the vocal talents of Banderas, and familiar characters on hand like Jack and Jill, and one Humpty A. Dumpty. Despite all the characters and colorful lines the plot is pretty flimsy, and the protagonist seems better suited for a supporting role within the company of Shrek and Donkey instead of having his own full-length feature, as even with a fairly short running time it feels padded-out. The content is tame enough to attract its target audience, but not inspired enough to span a new franchise. **½"

The result is an anonymous film sanza infamia e sanza lode, that follows more or less all the stereotypes of the adventure ""for kids"": the journey, the betrayal, the redemption toward love.

Next time you make a movie about an animated sword-fighting cat, do you mind not giving it the same name as my favorite strip club in Reno?<br/><br/>I couldn't have been more excited to see Puss in Boots over the weekend. I went in knowing nothing about the film (having just returned from a swingers convention in Haiti) but I was eager to catch a glimpse of some 'top-notch Hollywood crotch'.

Joining the ride is an equally intrepid girl kitty and one of the worst animated characters in DreamWorks history: Humpy Dumpty, voiced by Zach Galifianakis, whose back story with our furry feline is as boring as it is pointless.<br/><br/>The plot has our eclectic trio trying to steal magic beans. Some cool action scenes straight from a Western flick moves things along till the seeds are planted. Thus a beanstalk reaches to the skies and the story, now involving a baby goose and its gigantic mother, gets way too convoluted for a character deserving of a less bizarre and more earthy tale.<br/><br/>Catisms like licking milk rapidly and chasing light make for humorous intervals, but are quickly ruined by overlong dance numbers seeming more like DVD extras.

","A spin-off of the Shrek series starring Antonio Banderas' character, Puss in Boots. Puss in Boots was the best character in any of those movies (thank the Lord we didn't get a Donkey movie!), but that's damning with faint praise. This film isn't noticeably better than any of the Shreks. The writers of these films couldn't come up with a decent joke if their lives depended on it. All they've got up their sleeves is having the heroic, swashbuckling Puss act like a real cat every once in a while. Really, that's about as clever as it ever gets. They even brought in Salma Hayek as the love interest. The least they could do was reference Desperado. It'd be a cheap gag, but the film is so dry I'd have taken it. They also have Zach Galafianakis as Humpty Dumpty, Puss's former partner with whom he teams back up. And, again, they have nothing for him to do. Why hire a well-known comedian to play this character? Literally anyone could have voiced him (you can't even recognize Galafianakis), but instead they threw away a bunch of cash. Burning it would have at least kept them warm for a few seconds. The animation is as ugly as it ever was in the Shrek movies. The human characters, in particular, have always been beyond hideous. Humpty Dumpty also looks terrible. The action sequences, however, aren't too bad. They've improved that aspect of the animation quite a bit since the last Shrek movie I saw."

","Puss in Boots is a competently made kids' film in the sense that its colorful, quickly paced and accessible. If you're an undiscerning parent their are certainly worse things to see with your children; mindless dribble like Spy Kids 4D comes to mind. Alas, despite occasional flashes of originality this spin-off of the immensely popular ""Shrek"" series seems as phoned-in as an episode of The Flintstones.<br/><br/>The story begins with our titular hero (Antonio Banderas), living on the razor's edge of the law searching for his next big score. Intrigued by rumors of magic beans, Puss looks to steal them from the dastardly duo Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris) but not before bumping into like minded thief Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and former friend/adopted brother Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis). The three then forge a shaky alliance and hatch a plan to steal the beans, plant the stalk and make their way to the castle in the sky to find a gold-laying goose.<br/><br/>The most glaring problem with the film is the script which possesses a solid outline but little else. The jokes are sparse and mostly revolve around our hero being a cat or Humpty Dumpty being an egg and character motivations are fuzzy to say the least. It seemed almost as if the writers wanted to do ambitious things but didn't have time for a few more rewrites before the project was rushed into production.<br/><br/>Still, its refreshing to see a Dreamworks Animation production that isn't heavy on the pop-culture references. Additionally the animation itself is beautiful and Antonio Banderas once again projects his Latin lover persona into the role with gusto.<br/><br/>At one point a crucial character tells Puss to stop stealing informing him that ""you are better than this."" truer words have never been said and no sounder advice can be given to this film's creators.<br/><br/>http://theyservepopcorninhell.blogspot.com/"

"Joxerlives","7","1","2","24 May 2014"," He's got cat class and he's got cat style...
","'Puss in Boots' is a character that rings true to anyone who's ever kept (because we all know you never truly 'own' any cat) a ginger tom, the lead guitar player of the feline world. Casting him as a swashbuckling, devil may care, womanising, hero with a dark past (yet can still turn on the cutest of the cute when he has to) was truly a masterstroke and Antonio Banderas could not have been more perfect in the role, you half wish that he could have been so good as Puss' human counterpart Zorro. We also have a perfectly cast Salma Hyek as the wonderfully named 'Kitty Softpaws' (Ian Fleming would be proud) and seeing the 2 characters on screen you can just see the 2 actors so clearly in your mind. Frankly I would love to see them both together in a live action production, you get the impression that they would have such wonderful on screen chemistry. The dance fight at the tavern is hugely entertaining although you wonder at the tastefulness of moves such as 'The Litter Box' in a children's film? Not to mention Jack and Jill's baby conversation? <br/><br/>The story is OK, I like the scene where Puss and Humpty are on the clouds and Humpty tells him to look down, reminding him of when they were both children at the orphanage who would stare up at the sky in wonder, you get the feeling that this wasn't part of the scam and that he actually meant it. <br/><br/>So all told a worthy spin off from the Shrek movies and if you weren't an auriphile before then it's probably enough to make you one."

","Puss in Boots (Antonio Banderas) is a wanted criminal, but he wants to clear his name. He plans to steal the magic beans from Jack & Jill, and use them to go to the Giant's home to steal the Golden Goose. He has a competitor in Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) and Humpty Alexander Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) from his past. Puss and Humpty used to be best friends in the orphanage.<br/><br/>Puss in Boots is a side character from the Shrek franchise. He's a good character to do his own movie. He has the charisma, and he has an interesting story. However I'm struck with the lack of a sidekick. Shrek has Donkey, but Puss has nobody. Humpty is more of a villain in hiding. There is always a constant threat of double dealing. It's not the same thing. Other than that, this has enough charm and a few funny jokes. A few more funny jokes would help, but that's where the comedic sidekick would help."
"lisafordeay","6","1","2","25 June 2013"," Pros good animation and I love cats and the cons plot is poor and charcthers aren't memorable
","I seen this two years ago in the cinemas with my mom and my little brother. It was my 2nd movie to see that year in 2011 my first was to see Tangled which was brilliant. Puss in Boots is a spin off from the Shrek Franchise that we grew to love and to cherish when it first came out back in 2001 and finished in 2010. So when I found out that the cat from Shrek 2 got his own spin-off I was excited because I loved Antonio Banderas performance in that movie so was this movie worth every penny and the long anticipated wait??...........well let's find out.<br/><br/>Puss is an outlaw who was best friends with Humpedity Dumpy(voiced by Zach Galifankis from The Hangover you know the big built guy with the dark beard and the curly hair looks like he could be related to John Goodman yeah him)who he betrayals years ago as Dumpy stole money from the bank but before that Puss explains his background and judging by him his a very smooth talking charming charismatic cat who's a bit of a heartthrob except his a cat that looks like Zorro(yeah I spotted the Zorro homage as Antonio Banderas played him in 1997 with Catherine Zeta Jones). Meanwhile another cat thief named Kitty Soft paws(voiced by Salma Hayek)is out to steal the magic beans(that are belonging to Jack and Jill voiced by Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Seadris) and to find the golden eggs belonging to the golden goose and Puss lost to her but he decides to team up with her and finds out that his former buddy(who I mentioned before) go off in search of the golden eggs.<br/><br/>So after this set up you think that this is the best movie of all time and is in my top 5 or 10 right?? well there are some problems with this movie.<br/><br/>#1 Is the story yes I know I loved Puss in the sequel to Shrek back in 2004 and I'm a lover for cats but is it just me or did the story drag on and on and on to any of you people.<br/><br/>#2 The charcthers were good but not as memorable as they were in Shrek or the brilliant 2010 Dream works flick How To Train Your Dragon.They were all boring and dull and if I had to pick a favorite I would go with Puss and Kitty. Humpedity wasn't my cup of tea,he was So annoying and so irritating I didn't like him AT ALL.<br/><br/>#3 The pacing was so quick and it didn't give me a chance to look at the scenes right. Yeah like in Tangled was the same but still that was A lot more memorable than this film.<br/><br/>Overall did I like Puss in Boots sure it was a good flick but to be honest i'd rather watch some other cartoon than this. Like its nothing to write home about.<br/><br/>SO overall I'm giving it a 6 out of 10 <br/><br/>A 3 out of 5 stars for me."
"exxcplicit","7","1","2","27 July 2012"," Great family movie!
","Let me be honest. Im a really big fan of the Shrek movies and i loved them all. Then i heard about this ""spinoff"" movie about Puss in Boots. At first i thought it would be a bad idea, but later changed my mind when the new trailers came out. I went out to watch the movie, the ticket was 10 bucks, and it was well worth the little money. Antonio Banderas acts great as Puss in Boots and Selma too. I loved the animation, the plot, and you can take the whole family to watch this movie. Everyone will enjoy this, from small kids to the older generation. The movie had a lot of funny scenes, and a lot of action scenes, i liked it very much. One of the greatest animations that year. The animation was so beautiful and the script was well written, it's worth a watch if you want a fun time. Good job, Dreamworks!"
"julian-mumford","6","1","2","27 July 2012"," Good fun for a younger audience
","With huge saucer eyes and Antonio Banderas providing a South American lilt, Puss in Boots was the star of Shrek 2. Dreamworks knowing they were onto a winner, have spun their favourite kitty into his own adventure.<br/><br/>Puss gets to exist in a similar universe where children's characters happily or unhappily, co-exist with animated humans as if everything was completely normal.<br/><br/>Puss has been a bad kitty when we meet him and when we travel back in time, we see why he is ostracized and lost his metaphorical place by the fire.<br/><br/>As always when characters go bad, it's Humpty Dumpty's fault (Galifianakis), a bad egg if ever there was one. A character with a thin shell albeit quite capable of breaking a few eggs to get what he wants.<br/><br/>Puss and Humpty are searching for beans, magic beans The film is an adventure following Puss's attempt to find redemption after his earlier misdeeds. The story follows the search for the beans that will grow into the mythical beanstalk leading to the ""golden eggs"", a source of unimaginable wealth, something every cat and egg partnership always dream's of.<br/><br/>Standing in their path, in a very big way, are Jack (Billy Bob Thornton) and Jill (Amy Sedaris). This odd couple are somewhat meaner than I remember them, both with anger issues they need to work through, clearly they have not received the mental health help they need.<br/><br/>To add a romantic interest we have Kitty Softpaws (Salama Hayek), a feline temptress if ever there was one, learned in the ways of the catwalk. Teaming Banderas and Hayek together is of course a stroke of genius and their scenes together add to the film. A ""Dance Off"" rather than a sword fight is the order of the day and is choreographed with great care.<br/><br/>Galifianakis plays Humpty Dumpty, channeling all of his previous downtrodden, left behind characters from his previous movies, sometimes his schtick wears a little thin but the character just about works here.<br/><br/>The film does aim relatively young, there are some more mature references and enough to keep adults borderline entertained but this does not have the depth of later Pixar efforts. Kids will love the action, the colours and probably the depth of the 3D version (not reviewed here). Director Chris Miller has made a better film than his previous weak Shrek 3 entry in the series, here clearly showing some care and affection with this well loved character.<br/><br/>As always animation is now at a level we just accept perfection as the norm. It's almost as if these characters just exist and are merely filmed, rather than spending hours inside a mainframe being painstakingly rendered frame by frame.<br/><br/>There are periods where the story flags, the strongest elements are the flashbacks, children however will not notice, as there will a chase scene along in a few minutes.<br/><br/>Who would have thought that an animated cat, wearing boots and carrying a sword would earn over half a billion dollars at the worldwide box office. Whoever came up with the character clearly deserves a raise.<br/><br/>Summary <br/><br/>Good fun for a younger audience, parents should just about find enough to keep them entertained.<br/><br/>Puss goes from strength to strength, clearly breaking free from his Shrek origins and on this evidence, there may be a few more lives left yet.<br/><br/>http://julesmoviereviews.blogspot.co.nz/"

However they cooperate to steal the magic beans from Mr and Mrs Jack and Jill, so that they can get to the land of the giant and the goose that lays the golden eggs.

"BigWhiskers","7","1","2","14 November 2011"," Cute but nothing to write home about
","Riding the coat tails of the popular although somewhat overdone Shrek movies comes Puss N Boots starring the voice talents of Antonio Banderas as the title character and Salma Hayek as his female cat counterpart Kitty Soft Paws. The movie is cute and has some good snappy banter and even a well choreographed cartoon dance fight that had me smiling. Antonio Banderas does really good with Puss and the facial expressions are amazingly patterned after his own face which adds to the overall quality of the character. Salma Hayek does good with Kitty Soft Paws too ,adding some fun. I didn't like Zach Galifianakis's Humpty Dumpty character though, besides the lazy voice over - it could have been Humpty N Boots as he basically takes over 75 percent of the movie with so much boring dialog and it just drags the movie down. There is too little time devoted to Puss's origin too and it never explains how he got in the baby buggy as a kitten either. They really needed to spend more time on Puss and not Humpty , the payoff to the story was kind of a letdown too as I think everyone knew that Humpty was in on the scam with the obvious clues and the whole mess of the big goose etc. Of course , the ending leaves it open for the inevitable sequel which I hope they write better and have a better overall story because this one had better potential and ends up being a 7/10 ."
"KingFarticus","Null","1","2","30 October 2011"," A great film,that finally gives Antonio Banderas lots of funny scenes!
","An excellent film, in my opinion! I loved it, and after Shrek Forever After: The Final Chapter ended I was so sad that the brilliant series came to an end. But then Scared Shrekless came around in Halloween later that year and was pretty cool, but when Puss in Boots was rumoured to hit theaters the next year, I was like ""agh, this'll suck"" but 6 months later, I found out that I was wrong. I walked in to the movie theater deciding to skip seeing Johnny English Reborn, and instead see Puss in Boots. I sure like Johnny English, but you have to give favour to Antonio Banderas and Zach Galifianakis, who portray Puss, a framed outlaw cat on the run from trouble, and Humpty Alexander Dumty, a creative but tricky former sidekick to Puss. A lot of funny scenes occurred mostly throughout the middle of the film, but all in all, a hilarious comedy/adventure! When I walked out of the theater 1 hour and a half later, I was like ""wow"", because I never thought about how great Puss can be as a comedy character. Well, to cut a long story short, I would just like to say thanks to Mike Myers, Eddie Murphy, Cameron Diaz, Antonio Banderas, and everyone else who participated in the Shrek series. I had a great 10 years watching all of the films. So Puss in Boots, ride again my Mexican aristocat!"

","Puss in Boots (1:30, PG, 3-D) — other: talking animals, 2nd string, sequel<br/><br/>This movie is an origin tale describing how the swashbuckling orange tabby from the Shrek series got his start as a lovable rogue. Antonio Banderas returns to voice the title character, but none of the other Shrek regulars are on hand. Instead we get Salma Hayek as Kitty Softpaws, the Pussy Galore to Puss's James Bond but no slouch herself when it comes to buckling a swash; Zach Galifianakis as Humpty Alexander Dumpty, Puss's best friend from their childhood in the San Ricardo orphanage; Billy Bob Thornton as Jack and Amy Sedaris as Jill, brutish, plug-ugly thugs; and Constance Marie as Imelda, the nurturing, encouraging foster mom at the orphanage.<br/><br/>We see in a flashback that both Puss and Humpty feel that the other betrayed their friendship when they were both teenagers, but now Humpty, allied with Kitty, seeks Puss's aid when it comes to snatching the 3 magic beans from Jack and Jill so they can ascend the giant beanstalk to swipe the Golden Goose from the cloud giant's castle.<br/><br/>This is all accomplished con brio y la leche.<br/><br/>There's a lot of stirring music here, with original compositions by Henry Jackman making excellent use of Spanish flamenco traditions, guitars, and trumpets. The opening fight scene between Puss and the leather-masked Kitty turns out to be a dance-off, and a pretty good one.<br/><br/>Puss is alternately sly, noble, supercilious, brave, egocentric, generous, and forgiving — and always athletic — altogether a fitting hero. Good dialog by screenwriters David H. Steinberg, Tom Wheeler, and Jon Zack, with nicely paced direction from Chris Miller.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, while this is certainly a pleasant diversion, and the animation is up to the usual DreamWorks standard, there isn't much adventure, and the comedy is thin, nor can you really consider it much of a character study, tho it's more about character than plot. There are misunderstandings and redemptions, intrigues and stereotypes, flattery and flirtery, but the good guys are worth rooting for and, not surprisingly, prevail in the end to rollick another day.<br/><br/>Basically, there's just nothing outstanding here. You won't consider this a waste of money while you're in the theater, but a couple of months hence you'll probably have a hard time remembering why."

","First of all, I am a huge fan of all of the Shrek movies and especially of the Puss In Boots character! To say that I was eagerly anticipating this movie would be an understatement. Now after seeing it I am very disappointed in the storywriters for this (in my opinion) very poorly written story. The Humpty Dumpty character took on way too big of a spotlight - overshadowing Puss in many, many instances. I found this a real shame. To me, the movie became more about Humpty than Puss! To make it worse, Humpty is a mean-spirited character - using his trickery, deceit, and backstabbing to accomplish his evil tasks - and at Puss's expense! Even after Puss forgives him once, Humpty deceives him again! And then at the end we watch (for me, in complete disgust) as Puss forgives him! Ridiculous!! Is this the message we want to give to our kids? What a horrible character! It is too bad the writers of this film chose to write such a story. This could have been so much better! I feel sorry too for Antonio and all the other actors/actresses who gave their fine talents to this film thinking it was going to be something real special, only to have it ruined by the Humpty Dumpty character. I was hoping this was going to be a special movie for me for years to come, but I don't think I will ever be able to watch it again as the Humpty character is so hateful and annoying to watch - and it is such an insult to good-thinking people that Puss forgives him (not once but twice) after all the deceit and hurt... Shame on the writers for this poorly written story! This should have been a special movie for children and grownups! What we have is a film with backstabbing, trickery, deceit, lies, and lots of sadness. Such a shame."

"dfranzen70","4","1","5","3 September 2012"," Zip-a-dee-do....Nah.
","I'll be frank right up front, even though that's not my name. Puss in Boots isn't a very good movie. It attempts to cling to the tattered coattails of Shrek an is just good enough to sustain interest for you and your littlest of little ones. It does have good voice acting, but the writing's kind of flat - hardly any jokes, puns, pop-cultural references, etc. - and on the whole it's just not very exciting.<br/><br/>This is the tale (ha! pun) of how Puss (Antonio Banderas) came to be, growing up in an orphanage where his only friend was Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galiafanakis). The two spend most of their time trying to find the whereabouts of the magic beans owned, apparently, by Jack and Jill (Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris), who here are bad people. The beans will grow a beanstalk that leads to a giant's castle, where the goose that lays the golden eggs lives. Sort of a mish-mash of fairy tales, but what the heck.<br/><br/>Puss and Humpty, the little scamps, become thieves in their small border town; when a heist goes wrong, Humpty is left to, er, take the fall, and a bounty is put on Puss' head. That's where the mystique develops - the hat, the boots, the sword, the attitude. Later, as Puss is about to finally get a hold of those magic beans, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) shows up for the same score. But it's totally, okay, because she's a foxy feline, and our hero is a lady killer. As an added bonus, she's a plot contrivance.<br/><br/>This is a movie about betrayal, revenge, an reconciliation, so it's really a movie that's about the opposite of different from other animated movies and not a small number of live-action ones. If you cared enough, you could predict each turning point in the film, but you and your kids will be better off just letting that tendency zoom right on by. You'll do yourself no favors by thinking about the plot and how uninventive it is.<br/><br/>See, unlike the Shrek movies that spawned it, Puss in Boots has precious few references to fairy tales, which is a shame. Jack and Jill were brother and sister in the old stories, and here they're husband and wife. And bad, bad people. So why even refer to them as Jack and Jill? Then the movie has to confuse Jack of ""and Jill"" fame with the Jack of ""and the Beanstalk"" fame; not the same Jack. That's sort of explained by a cameo by the latter in a prison for no good reason.<br/><br/>If you did enjoy the Shrek films - any of them - you're not likely to like this one very much. It lacks all of the charm and wit that helped make the others successful. Okay, so the third Shrek and maybe the fourth were both sort of mediocre, but each is much better than this one, which may as well have been done for television by the old Filmation studio that put out the He-Man cartoons each Saturday."

","'PUSS IN BOOTS': Two and a Half Stars (Out of Five) <br/><br/>A spin off prequel to the four 'SHREK' films focusing on the character 'Puss in Boots' (once again voiced by Antonio Banderas). Joining him in the voice cast is Salma Hayek (once again playing a love interest of Banderas's), Zach Galifianakis, Billy Bob Thornton, Amy Sedaris and Guillermo del Toro. The film was directed by Chris Miller (who also directed 'SHREK THE THIRD') and written by a team of writers including David H. Steinberg, Tom Wheeler, Jon Zack, William Davies and Brian Lynch. The movie is pretty much a waste of time in my opinion. It's nether funny nor involving in anyway as there's just not much done with the characters.<br/><br/>The film is set several years before the first 'SHREK' film when 'Puss in Boots' was a wanted fugitive. Puss plots to steal magic beans from Jack (Thornton) and Jill (Sedaris), who are criminals, in order to clear his name. He meets up with an old female friend named Kitty Softpaws (Hayek) and his childhood friend Humpty Dumpy (Galifianakis) who betrayed him. Puss must decide if he can trust the two before agreeing to team with them. They then plot to steal the beans together, get the golden goose from the Giant's castle and clear Puss's name.<br/><br/>I was never a big fan of the 'SHREK' films. I enjoyed the first one to a certain extent but found all of the sequels to be lacking any real entertainment value of any kind. They do seem to appeal to kids though and they're not painful to watch for adults so I'll give them some credit for that. I'd say the same thing is about true of this spin off. It probably would have been a lot more entertaining to see a 'Donkey' prequel starring Eddie Murphy but the Puss in Boot's character could have been interesting. They of course failed to make use of anything they actually had going for them with the character but the movie still should please little kids.<br/><br/>Watch our movie review show 'MOVIE TALK' at: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nDQQKEqGhZQ"

","This quite amusing spin-off prequel from the ""Shrek"" franchise follows the adventures of lovable rogue Puss In Boots as he establishes his legend in an adventure which takes in the nursery rhymes of principally ""Jack and Jill"" and ""Humpty Dumpty"", and ""Jack and The Beanstalk"" with a little splash of ""Little Boy Blue"" thrown in for good measure.<br/><br/>It starts well as we get re-acquainted with the daredevil adventurer Puss, with some nice gags and terrific animation but rather runs out of steam as the story gets elongated by extended chase sequences by which time I came to the conclusion that this was a short padded out to feature-length. Perhaps Puss can't really carry a film on his own and familiarity breeds a little contempt as many of the cat-related gags employed seem recognisable from the earlier Shrek films, including those involving fur-balls, cat's eyes and how a cat always falls on its feet.<br/><br/>I quite liked the Kitty Softpaws character as well as the villainous Jack and Jill protagonists but felt that the tie-up with Humpty Dumpty somewhat contrived. The best scene was probably the early dance-off between Puss and Kitty but the conclusion with the returning giant Mother Goose again was too reminiscent of the flying dragon climax to ""Shrek"".<br/><br/>""Puss In Boots"" as I indicated doesn't quite step up to major character here and while containing many fun and amusing moments never achieves the heights the mighty Shrek achieved. Never really had a cat's chance, did it?"

","A spin-off from the once loved Shrek series, it's exactly what it says on the tin; a standalone tale for everyone's favourite Spanish swordfighting cat. This time, Puss is on the hunt for Goose of the Golden Eggs. However, it wouldn't be much of a chase without competition, both from the Thuggish couple of Jack and Jill, as well as the enigmatic Kitty SoftPaws, a cat who proves herself to be Puss' equal in combat. Along the journey, however, we also learn of Puss' past, and his rekindling with old friend, Humpty Dumpty.<br/><br/>Never fully embracing its swashbuckling lunacy, 'Puss in Boots' makes for decent family entertainment with some highlights, but feels like it could've so much more. Instead, 'Puss' trades in what could've been a great Zorro/Pirates-style pastiche of overblown adventures, which is kind of what the Puss character was original derived from, for a routine hero origin story mixed with a heist/chase film. It's not bad by any means, and there are indeed positives: like most Dreamworks' productions, the film looks and sounds great. The animation is crisp and vibrant, with the fur details on Puss and Kitty having come a long way in just ten years. The voice cast is rock solid, with Banderas able to play this role in his sleep, while everyone else, including Zach Galifinakis, Selma Hayek, Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris, are having an absolute ball. Henry Jackman's score also lends a hand, playing like a faster and zanier version of James Horner's music from, what else, 'Zorro' (and probably a better 'Zorro' score than the pile of rehash that Horner produced for 'Legend').<br/><br/>However, all the polish in the world won't mask the fact that, well, 'Puss' never really offers big, hearty laughs. Most of the jokes amount to little more than slapstick or playing up familiar Puss tropes like the 'cute eyes', and are nowhere near as inventive or playful as say, the first two 'Shreks'. Plus, by not embracing the swashbuckling-jabbing that much, this does leaves other elements deflated; the villains are not especially threatening or even that funny, the action setpieces are not particularly inventive or impressive, as well as few in number, and again, it limits joke creativity, with a lot of potential for sight gags being missed as a result. (Just look at Men In Tights for an example of what happens when you can let rip).<br/><br/>As for the core element, the story itself, it's fine; it's your basic treasure hunt story with some origin elements thrown in. Ironically, the film is at its strongest with the later, trading in wacky hijinks for smaller, more intimate moments as we see Puss grow up and his relationship with Humpty and his 'Mama', Imelda. Probably the best scene comes near the end, when Puss says goodbye to her; it's genuinely touching and rather nuanced for a Dreamworks film. For kids, it's a decent enough introduction to this sort of story, but it won't give something like 'Raiders' or even 'Stranger Tides' a run for their money in this field.<br/><br/>In the end, 'Puss in Boots' is definitely one more for the young 'uns. It's visually stunning and has some strong aspects, but there isn't much for older viewers, and if you've been spoiled by adventure cinema, 'Puss' doesn't quite do enough, or even poke fun at enough, to be worth more than a rental. <br/><br/>Let's hope 'Puss 2: 9 Lives and 40 Thieves' can improve things (and maybe Elliot and Rossio can return to the series so we can even get some nods to 'Aladdin')."

","Let's face it. Any nicely animated film will entertain the children and this one does the task. The animation is well done and the voices are also well done. The children will recognize the characters from nursery rhymes--Puss in Boots, Humpty Dumpty, Jack & Jill, The Golden Goose, the Magic Beans/Giant, etc. They will be entertained and probably want to watch it again. It does the trick.<br/><br/>Adults have also grown accustomed to seeing animated films that work on two levels since the days of Bugs Bunny. So many of these films have in jokes and double entendres and wonderful cultural references. The plot moves beautifully and the dialog keeps us entertained while we have to watch a children's movie. Unfortunately, this is not the case. If I had to rate this solely from an adult's point of view, I'd rate it a 2. It's pretty painful. You can actually predict the dialog. There is little of interest. No bones thrown our way to acknowledge that we have to sit and watch this with the young ones. Well, there's some nice dance moves, but that's about it. So, watch it in the background and have some cards."

Performance wise; well it wouldn't be Puss in Boots without the voice of Antonio Banderas in the starring role, and he really nailed it again here! Salma Hayek did a very decent job as Kitty Softpaws and Zach Galifianakis was adequate as Humpty Dumpty (more on him later). Honourable mentions go to; Billy Bob Thornton as Jack, Amy Sedaris as Jill, Constance Marie as Imelda and Guillermo del Toro as Moustache Man/Comandate.<br/><br/>Although, in parts it was pretty funny and there were some nice one- liners and the usual subtle references to other movies; I felt there was something missing (apart from Shrek and Donkeyetc). At the end of the day I put it down to the fact that I didn't find the character of Humpty Dumpty very convincing. His motivations seemed very vague for the amount of effort he put in.

"amahlanand","7","0","2","22 May 2012"," Innocent Fun with Zorro-Puss
","Who can deny it, the Latin-inspired Puss in Boots definitely adds more interest than the traditional version. He's just far cooler in the way he personifies an animated photocopy of Antonio Banderas' Zorro. The slyness, the brash overconfidence and of course, the ability to create havoc; the ingredients are there. He has the savoir-faire of Charles Perrault's character as well as the morals. Though, overall, he distinguishes himself from any other take on the classic character and ends up as being just good, fairly rollicking fun. <br/><br/>As for the production itself, it was just a good little adventure and what was particularly nice was the lack of complication which many animated features, including the later Shrek films which brought this specific 'Puss' into the limelight, had to their detriment. By no means do I imply however that it was an overly simplified, mundane script either, that wouldn't go together with Puss' vibrancy. Although, it probably deteriorated a touch in even animated film persuasion as it went along, culminating in a slightly underwhelming way. It promised better and in that regard, lets itself down.<br/><br/>Once again, similar to 'Shrek', I thoroughly enjoyed the humorous, light-hearted parody of fairytale characters. That characterisation makes the whole thing even more fun. Banderas is unquestionably the right man to voice a 'Latino Puss' despite overdoing it a bit at times and being slightly overbearing. I'm not complaining though, that sort of exaggeration was the essence of his character. The characters of 'Humpty Alexander Dumpty' and 'Jack and Jill' were well thought out and depicted by their respective voice actors and actresses. My only qualms lay with Kitty Softpaws who didn't initiate sizzling enough chemistry with Puss, they seemed slightly detached from one another although engaged in themselves. Her character didn't leave as much of a mark as the others.<br/><br/>'Puss in Boots' is undoubtedly childishly funny but even adults won't be able to resist a few smiles throughout. Ultimately, it may not deserve the superior label of 'swashbuckling' but it was plain, straightforward fun that you cannot go too wrong with."

There's sharp humour and the character play is superb with surprisingly plenty of depth. Humpy and Puss are given flashback scenes with entertaining back stories. Both lovable rouge come, hero and outlaw Puss is again wonderfully voiced by Antonio Banderas and Salma Hayek gives Kitty Softpaws the perfect Latino sound. Including the likes of Guillermo del Toro, Billy Bob Thornton to name a few the other voice actors are also on fine form and the computer characters are wonderfully animated and brought to life.<br/><br/>Like many of these computer animated features it feels 10 minutes too long, but for characterisation, feats, dance off's and double crosses its pure entertainment with plenty for the adults to enjoy as much as the children."

","If this was a standalone animation film, maybe I would have considered it above average, but my reference is Shrek and, even if the last films of the franchise were not great, Puss in Boots is not at the same level.<br/><br/>Yes, it does try to capitalize on the remaining Anglo-Saxon fairy tales like Jack and the Beanstalk and Humpty Dumpty, but it fails short of the character extravaganza that Shrek was. And while Antonio Banderas is very good as the cat, the Western like setting and even the animation is not expressing enough emotion to make one empathise with the characters. And I am a cat person, so that's saying a lot.<br/><br/>Bottom line: I've laughed aloud a few times, but that's about it. The combination of a man and a cat got stuck right in the middle, being neither attractive, nor cute. The story felt fragmented and the dialogues forced. I am sure children would love it, but it was a disappointment to me."

"bdgill12","6","0","1","9 March 2012"," Stereotypical Dreamworks Animated Production
","As a prequel to the Shrek series, Puss in Boots serves to tell the origin story of the titular character's (Antonio Banderas) rise to prominence. A slick thief with a haunted past, Puss takes on a dangerous job in which he attempts to steal the fabled magic beans from a pair of hardened criminals known as Jack and Jill (fortunately not Adam Sandler in drag). His plan goes awry, however, when he comes into contact with another thief, Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek). Softpaws engages Puss in a (dance) battle and eventually brings him to meet Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), an old friend-turned-enemy. But Humpty has a plan to right an old wrong and convinces Puss to join him in the undertaking of a dangerous but lucrative adventure.<br/><br/>I have to hand it Dreamworks animation, they know how to make a solid children's movie that adults can sit through comfortably. They've developed a formula that goes something like this: Likable Characters + Outstanding Visuals + Recognizable Voice Talent + Borderline-Illicit Jokes That Kids Won't Get - Any Semblance of Heart and Emotion = A 3- Star Film That Kids Will Flock To. Shrek, Kung Fu Panda, Madagascar and the rest all work within this equation and Puss in Boots is no exception. <br/><br/>Let's work our way through that formula as it applies to this film. The characters at play within Puss in Boots are good-enough, though none of them quite measure up to the best of the Dreamworks universe. Puss is probably better served as an ancillary role but he is not overmatched with carrying his own film and his surrounding characters are all enjoyable if underwhelming. Puss looks predictably beautiful with rich scene structure and exquisite character details. The soul of Dreamworks animation is in their visuals and this film is nothing if not gorgeously animated. Another staple of the Dreamworks feature is the use of big name actors to voice the characters as opposed to the Pixar method which often employs lesser-known performers. The risk of using well-known voices is that it can cause the audience to see the characters not as themselves but as the actor providing the voice. Here, though, I think Banderas and especially Galifianakis do a good job of putting their respective characters above themselves, not always an easy task. The jokes, meanwhile, come early and often and fall right in line with the line of humor we were treated to in the Shrek films. Dreamworks has mastered the art of cramming adult-oriented jokes into their films without ever allowing young minds to become the wiser and that is, of course, a large part of their success. Puss manages to push the envelope in sly ways and that provides a handful of big laughs. <br/><br/>The major issue with Puss is the same one I have with just about every Dreamworks feature: there's almost nothing in the way of emotional connection. Whereas Pixar always strives to create organic connection between the characters and the audience, Dreamworks doesn't always seem interested in taking their films beyond above-average children's fare. I feel like steps have been taken to correct this problem in recent years. Kung Fu Panda comes closer to striking an emotional note from time to time and How to Train Your Dragon is absolutely up to the Pixar standard in every way. But Puss in Boots is decisively shallow, never bothering to even scratch the surface in terms of resonating beyond a mildly entertaining level. There's simply no depth whatsoever and while that does indeed fit into the Dreamworks formula, at some point you have to ask yourself if the studio is progressing or simply painting by numbers.<br/><br/>Please see my reviews at thesoapboxoffice.blogspot.com"

"itamarscomix","6","0","4","16 February 2012"," Unneeded, but entertaining
","The big problem about Puss in Boots is that there's really no reason for its existence. In a Disney franchise, it would have been a straight-to-video sequel at best. It distinguishes itself somewhat by focusing more on action and less on fairy tale gags than the Shrek movies, but it's not enough to make up for the very flat, predictable storyline. Every new character introduced for the sake of this movie is also a one-note gag, the protagonist remaining the only one with any real characterization.<br/><br/>In spite of all that Puss in Boots is pretty entertaining, and it's notably better than the last two entries in the Shrek series - animation included, while the animation in Shrek Forever After was lazy and bland, Puss in Boots was made with a lot of imagination and attention to details; the animated cats are all hilarious, their behavior filled with wonderful observation of the real world counterparts, lovely visual gags that make up for the general lack of fresh humor. The movie is bland and forgettable as a whole, but it's a pretty fun way to spend 90 minutes, especially if you enjoyed Kung Fu Panda."

","Hollywood just don't know when to quit, in this instance that proves to be a blessing. Puss in Boots is a spin-off from Shrek, but gladly stands on its own two-boot encased-feet. The film follows Puss' early life, from orphan to outlaw. We learn of his relationship with fellow orphan Humpty Dumpty and their quest to obtain the magic beans which will lead to the golden eggs. Puss is hailed as a hero in his hometown while his brother Humpty is lead into a life of crime to prove his worth. Their interactions form the main crux of the movie. They both consider themselves betrayed at one point or another, and seeing their brotherly love gradually return is a joy. The films biggest success is just taking one character and actually creating a story around them. There isn't a single nod to Shrek, and overall it has an entirely different tone. Even the fairytale references are played down for a more western feel. The voice work is spot on, with Banderas taking his role very seriously. Hayek adds some nice chemistry as his female equivalent, and even Galifianakis shines. This is probably his most emotional role, and he avoids becoming an irritant. The animation is wonderful, and really captures that Spanish/Latino flavour. The writers knew exactly when to focus on exposition and when to add an action scene. This is mostly an action adventure movie, with some comedy. A great film that should be wary about trying to spawn its own franchise."

I have however a strong doubt about if this is an adequate movie for children given the violence of some scenes including a murder when Jack and Jill arrive at the hotel and shoot someone (whom we nevertheless don't see in fact just only hearing the shot and the body falling down) to get a vacant room.

","With the big green ogre well and truly running his course, the time has come for scene-stealing ex-sidekick Puss (Antonio Banderas) to take centre stage. It's not surprising that Dreamworks chose to give this swashbuckling feline his own movie; his arrogantly suave persona, Zorro-esque action moves and razor-sharp wit all combine to deliver a highly watchable lead character that will no doubt generate his own franchise. The film itself, however, struggles to maintain the entertaining antics of the first two acts – a dance-off between Puss and his rival / love interest Kitty Softpaws (Salma Hayek) is exhilarating – when it comes to the cut and paste final act. Despite its narrative shortfalls and a less-than-brilliant third wheel co-star Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis), it looks terrific. Every strand of fur, every human character and every Sun-drenched dusk setting are rendered in flawless CGI, with the third dimension subtly incorporated (the way it should be). Plenty to work on for next time round maybe, but there's more than enough here to ensure it's a satisfying 90 minutes for kiddies and adults alike."

Puss In Boots is neither of those. Instead, it's a charming little tale about the adventures of the swashbuckling feline Lothario before he met Shrek and Donkey and the rest of gang. There are a couple of gags inserted into the movie that are strictly for the grownups who've made the trek to the theater with their little ones, but overall, it moves at a quick enough pace so that the small fry won't get bored. Antonio Banderas gets to show his comedic talents as the voice of Puss, while Salma Hayek is perfect as his occasional foil/love interest Kitty Softpaws. Puss and Kitty re-unite with Puss's old chum, Humpty Dumpty (Zach Galifianakis) to retrieve Jack's mythical beans to grow that giant beanstalk of myth to find the goose that lays the golden eggs. The jokes are silly but there are more than a few memorable funny scenes, like the one involving a dance-off of sorts that's both comical and wonderfully ridiculous, for instance. It must also be noted that using the voices of Billy Bob Thornton and Amy Sedaris as the film's lead villains, Jack and Jill, was brilliant casting. Their two characters, ugly as sin, really chew the scenery and have some of the funnier lines of dialog in this flick. With all the movies coming out in droves this time of year that seem to be geared toward an older audience, it's kind of nice that this kid-friendly film is in the pack to offer families something lightweight and amusing to see.

However, I was extremely disappointed at the hodge-podge of ""Hispanic"" themes and cultural references in the film. They added up to a fuzzy cultural interpretation. Was this story set in Mexico? In Spain? In the U.S. Southwest? It was not clear. The movie starts with a man who (I think) is supposed to be Mexican, yelling in that Mexican country-western way (¡Ay, ay, ay!) before skipping off to a ""fiesta"" in the ""plaza."" Yet, in the village, there are Spaniards in conquistador helmets running the show, and characters who look, from my Southwestern point of view, to be mestizo (ethnically mixed, both Spanish and American Indian). Again, where was this story supposed to be taking place? In the Spanish colonial New World? Or in Spain? Lots of trite stereotypes mixed in with cool Flamenco dancing (from Spain) set to the razor-sharp guitar playing of Mexican artists Rodrigo y Gabriela. Seemed like the Anglo screenwriters didn't do enough research, or get their historical facts straight. Disappointing. Hard to believe Banderas didn't chime in with corrections."

","Walking into this film, I knew it would have some innuendo and cheap 'shock' humor, but I hadn't realized just how much it does have. The original Shrek was a fun romp through a hilariously flawed version of Fairy Tale land, but Puss in Boots is rather sad by comparison. While innuendo certainly was present in Shrek, it was subdued and quietly funny, as it is meant to be. In Puss in Boots, however, innuendo is replaced with in-your-face references to sexuality, alcohol, etc that were a turn-off for me. The fairy tale land gone wrong story was replaced with an awkward mix of the harsh real world and completely random fairy-tale elements. This strange, inadequately explored world was confronted by oddly out-of-place talking cats, eggs, and a few characters who seemed hastily and inexplicably thrown into the script. (e.g. little boy blue, wagon-pulling pigs...) These elements combine to make a film that is sometimes more confusing and awkward than funny, with a few genuinely hilarious moments mixed in."
